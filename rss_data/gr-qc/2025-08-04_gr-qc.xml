      <title>Cosmological Reconstructions in Einstein--Cartan--Myrzakulov Gravity with Torsion and Non-Metricity in the Weitzenb\"ock Geometrical Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The universe is a vast and complex system, and our understanding of its fundamental workings is constantly evolving. In this work, we present a novel modification to the standard theory of gravity by incorporating curvature, torsion, non-metricity, and the geometric structure of Weitzenb\"{o}ck spacetime. This modified framework, referred to as the Einstein--Cartan--Myrzakulov (ECM) model, enriched by Weitzenb\"{o}ck geometry, offers new insights into cosmological phenomena, including the accelerated expansion of the universe, the nature of dark energy and dark matter, and the formation of cosmic structures. Our model not only reproduces observed cosmic histories but also provides testable predictions that can be compared with current and future observational data. By addressing some of the most profound questions in modern cosmology, this work paves the way for a deeper understanding of the universe's evolution and the fundamental forces that govern it. The ECM model, extended through Weitzenb\"{o}ck spacetime, invites further exploration, offering the potential to revolutionize our conception of gravity and the cosmos.</description>

      <title>Effective source for second-order self-force calculations: quasicircular orbits in Schwarzschild spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have seen the first production of "post-adiabatic" gravitational-waveform models based on second-order gravitational self-force theory. These models rely on calculations of an effective source in the perturbative second-order Einstein equation. Here, for the first time, we detail the calculation of the effective source in a Schwarzschild background, which underlies the second-order self-force results in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 151102 (2021); ibid. 128, 231101 (2022); ibid. 130, 241402 (2023)]. The source is designed for use in the multiscale form of the Lorenz-gauge Einstein equation, decomposed in tensor spherical harmonics, or in the analogous second-order Teukolsky equation. It involves, among other things, contributions from (i) quadratic coupling of first-order field modes, (ii) the slow evolution of first-order fields, (iii) quadratic products of a first-order puncture field, and (iv) the second-order puncture field. We validate each of these pieces through numerical and analytical tests.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity signatures in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's BNS and NSBH binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement of eccentricity in low-mass binary systems through gravitational waves is crucial to distinguish between various formation channels. Detecting eccentricity in these systems is challenging due to a lack of accurate eccentric waveform models and the high computational cost of Bayesian inferences. We access the eccentricities of six previously observed low-mass gravitational wave events using publicly available data from the first four observing runs of the LIGO and Virgo collaboration. We analyze the events using the new eccentric waveform model, SEOBNRv5EHM, and compare our results with the existing model, TEOBResumS-Dali. We also present the first eccentricity constraints for GW190814. To improve accuracy, we include higher-order modes in both models and optimize inference using efficient marginalization and parallelization techniques. We find that GW200105 exhibits non-negligible eccentricity, with a measured eccentricity of $e=0.135^{+0.019}_{-0.088}$ at 20 Hz (90% credible level) for TEOBResumS-Dali and $e=0.125^{+0.029}_{-0.082}$ for SEOBNRv5EHM, given a uniform eccentricity prior from 0 to 0.2. This provides moderate support for the eccentric hypothesis, with a Bayes factor of $\sim10-15$ in favor of the eccentric model. With a uniform log prior on eccentricity, the Bayes factor is reduced to 2.35. The remaining five sources are consistent with low eccentricity, with 90% upper limits from $e \leq 0.011$ to $e \leq 0.066$. We find no support for non-negligible eccentricity in GW190814.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Corrected Thermodynamics of Conformal Weyl Gravity Black Holes: GUP Effects and Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic properties of black holes in Conformal Weyl Gravity (CWG) using the Mannheim-Kazanas solution, with particular emphasis on quantum corrections that become significant near the Planck scale. Our analysis employs the Hamilton-Jacobi tunneling formalism to derive the Hawking temperature, revealing explicit contributions from the conformal parameters $\beta$, $\gamma$, and $k$ that lead to substantial deviations from Schwarzschild black hole behavior. We incorporate quantum gravitational effects through the Generalized Uncertainty Principle, demonstrating systematic suppression of thermal radiation in the near-Planckian regime. Using an exponentially corrected entropy model, we compute the complete spectrum of QC thermodynamic potentials, including internal energy, pressure, heat capacity, and free energies. Our heat capacity analysis reveals critical phase transitions separating thermodynamically stable and unstable regions, with the scale-dependent parameter $\gamma$ playing a crucial role in controlling phase structure. The Joule-Thomson expansion analysis shows distinct cooling and heating regimes with inversion points that shift systematically with CWG parameters, capturing QC phase transitions absent in general relativity. We also examine gravitational redshift in CWG geometry, finding complex radial dependence that could provide observable signatures for distinguishing conformal gravity from Einstein's theory. Our results demonstrate that CWG offers a consistent framework for studying black hole thermodynamics beyond general relativity, with quantum corrections revealing rich phase structures and potential observational consequences.</description>

      <title>Can the latent signatures of quantum superposition be detected through correlation harvesting?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore correlation harvesting in quantum superposition, specifically focusing on the entanglement and mutual information extracted by two Unruh-DeWitt detectors interacting with a quantum field in a mass-superposed BTZ black hole spacetime. Our findings reveal that the superposed nature of spacetime induces interference effects that can significantly enhance the entanglement harvesting relative to a single spacetime background. In contrast to entanglement, the mutual information obtained in spacetime superposition is influenced by the proper distance between the two detectors. While the mutual information harvested in a superposed spacetime remains lower than that in a single spacetime when the proper distance between detectors is small, it exceeds that in a single spacetime for specific mass ratios as the distance increases. Notably, we find that both entanglement and mutual information harvesting reach their maxima when the final spacetime superposition state is conditioned to align with the initial spacetime state.</description>

      <title>Unlocking New Paths for Science with Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals: Machine Learning-Enhanced MCMC for Accurate Parameter Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) in space-borne antennas like LISA and Taiji promises deep insights into strong-field gravity and black hole astrophysics. However, the complex, non-convex likelihood landscapes of EMRI signals (compounded by instrumental noises) have long hindered reliable parameter estimation based on traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which often fail to escape local optima or require impractical computational costs. To address this critical bottleneck, we introduce Flow-Matching Markov Chain Monte Carlo (FM-MCMC), a pioneering Bayesian framework that synergizes continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with parallel tempering MCMC (PTMCMC). By leveraging CNFs to rapidly explore high-dimensional parameter spaces and PTMCMC for precise posterior sampling, FM-MCMC achieves unprecedented efficiency and accuracy in recovering EMRI intrinsic parameters. By enabling real-time, unbiased parameter inference, FM-MCMC unlocks the full scientific potential of EMRI observations, and would serve as a scalable pipeline for precision gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement of Hawking-Partner modes in expanding cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates quantum entanglement generated within a one-dimensional cavity where one boundary undergoes prescribed acceleration, a setup designed to mimic aspects of Hawking radiation. We quantify quantum correlations using logarithmic negativity for bipartitions where subsystem $A$ is a given mode and subsystem $B$ the rest of the system. For initial pure states, we also consider a given mode and reconstruct its partner using the Hotta-Sch\"utzhold-Unruh formula, obtaining identical results. Besides the initial vacuum state, we also consider one-mode squeezed and two-mode squeezed states, in order to confirm if quantum entanglement can be stimulated. Moreover, we analyze its robustness against initial thermal noise. Our analysis is based on numerical simulations and does not assume any approximation beyond the validity of our numerical algorithms. Our findings reveal that the expanding cavity effectively acts as a squeezing device, with Hawking-partner pairs largely behaving as two-mode squeezed states. A significant conclusion is that, in our setting, purification of Hawking modes is predominantly a low-energy process, with high-energetic particles contributing negligibly to the partner modes. Indeed, in both small and large acceleration regimes of the boundaries, quantum entanglement decreases towards the ultraviolet modes, indicating that higher-energy particles are more challenging to entangle and hence less probable to contribute in the purification process. While the Hotta-Sch\"utzhold-Unruh formula offers notable computational efficiency, partner modes do not commute, due to the non-trivial multimode entanglement structure of the system. Hence, this pairwise description is not suitable for describing the full system.</description>

      <title>Search for dynamical black hole captures with Gaussian mixture modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) are expected to originate from black holes interacting dynamically in dense astrophysical environments. In such environments, given that the velocity and cross section between the interacting black holes is low, dynamical capture may occur. Such events merge on very short timescales with high eccentricities and are expected to be detectable in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) sensitivity band. In this work, we present a dedicated search for dynamical black hole capture events in the third LVK observing run with the coherent WaveBurst (cWB) algorithm enhanced with Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM) post-production. With this we consider two applications of GMM: a weakly-modeled approach searching for generic short transients under minimal assumptions, and a population informed approach, in which the GMM model is provided information on the parameter space occupied by the capture population. Although our search does not find any new significant GW events, we find that an informed GMM approach brings significant sensitivity improvements, enabling the detection of dynamical capture events up to a distance of 1.9 Gpc for a 200 $M_{\odot}$ equal mass binary. We present updated upper limit estimates of the rate at 90\% confidence, the most stringent of which is 0.15 Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, a 34\% improvement with respect to previous observational estimates. Furthermore, while the weakly-modeled GMM approach is less sensitive to dynamical capture systems, we find that it is possible for these events to be detected up to a distance of 1 Gpc in the cWB-GMM all-sky short search under minimal assumptions. Finally, with the confident detection of GW190521, we estimate the rate of similar events to be 0.94 Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, assuming the event originated from a dynamical capture.</description>

      <title>Thermal aspects of the anomalous $\omega \to \infty$ limit of Brans-Dicke gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brans-Dicke gravity does not always reduce to General Relativity in the limit $\omega\to\infty$ for the coupling constant. This anomalous behavior is examined within the formalism of the first-order thermodynamics of scalar-tensor gravity. It is shown that this effect is linked to the non-vanishing nature of the chemical potential, in the Einstein frame formulation of the thermodynamic analogy, in the $\omega\to\infty$ limit.</description>

      <title>Probing scalar field with generic extreme mass-ratio inspirals around Kerr black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The future space-based gravitational wave observatories are expected to provide unprecedented opportunities to explore intricate characteristics of black hole binaries, particularly for extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), in which a stellar-mass compact object slowly inspirals into a supermassive black hole. These systems are very prominent sources for testing gravity in the strong gravity fields and for probing potential deviations from general relativity, including those arising from the presence of fundamental scalar fields. In this work, we examine the impact of a scalar charge carried by the inspiraling object within the context of EMRIs. We focus on generic orbits that present both eccentricity and inclination to evaluate how these parameters affect the modifications induced by the scalar charge to the gravitational wave signal. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of orbital inclination, in particular, enhances the detectability of scalar field effects by introducing richer waveform features that deviate from the purely general relativistic case. The interplay among scalar charge, eccentricity and inclination provides a more complete sampling of the black hole spacetime, suggesting that EMRIs with such generic orbits represent compelling systems for stringently constraining or discovering new fundamental fields through future gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Rigidity aspects of a cosmological singularity theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the classical singularity theorems in General Relativity, Galloway and Ling have shown the following (cf. Theorem 0): If a globally hyperbolic spacetime satisfying the null energy condition contains a closed, spacelike Cauchy surface $(V,g,K)$ (with metric $g$ and extrinsic curvature ${K}$) which is strictly 2-convex (meaning that the sum of the lowest two eigenvalues of $K$ is positive) then $V$ is either a spherical space or past null geodesically incomplete \cite{Ling, Ling2}. In the present work we relax the convexity condition in two respects. Firstly (cf. Theorem 1) we admit $2$-convex extrinsic curvatures, (for which the sum of the lowest two eigenvalues is non-negative) which allows for the following further possibility: Either $V$ or some finite cover $\tilde V$ are surface bundles over the circle, with totally geodesic fibers. Secondly, (cf. Theorem 2) if $(V,g,{K})$ admits a $U(1)$ isometry group with corresponding Killing vector $\xi$, we can further relax the convexity requirement in terms of the decomposition of ${K}$ with respect to the directions parallel and orthogonal to $\xi$. Compared to Theorem 1, this yields more specific information on the possible foliations of $V$, depending on whether the isometry is tangent to the base or to the fibers. Moreover, in the special cases that $V$ is either non-orientable, or non-prime, or an orientable Haken manifold with vanishing second homology, we obtain stronger statements in both Theorems without passing to covers. While our results do not use Einstein's equations, we provide several classes of $\Lambda$-vacuum solutions of these equations as examples.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Lensing in the Schwarzschild Spacetime: Photon Rings in Vacuum and in the Presence of a Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical black holes are usually surrounded by an accretion disk. At least parts of these accretion disks consist of a plasma in which light rays with different energies are dispersed. However, we usually do not know the exact configurations of these plasmas. In this paper we will now use the example of a Schwarzschild black hole embedded in an inhomogeneous pressureless and nonmagnetised plasma to investigate how the structural changes of the photon rings can help us to determine the properties of a plasma surrounding a black hole using multifrequency observations. For this purpose we will use a simple analytic model which describes a plasma whose electron density increases towards the equatorial plane when we approach the event horizon. For the chosen model we will first derive and then analytically solve the equations of motion. Then we will place an observer in the domain of outer communication and introduce an orthonormal tetrad to relate the constants of motion to latitude-longitude coordinates on the observer's celestial sphere. In the next step we will use the analytic solutions to investigate the geometric structures of the direct image as well as the photon rings of first and second order on the observer's celestial sphere. We will write down a lens equation and calculate the redshift and the travel time. We will compare the obtained results to results for photon rings in vacuum and in the presence of a homogeneous plasma. Finally, we will discuss which of these quantities can be used to extract information about the properties of the plasma.</description>

      <title>Regular black holes without mass-inflation instability and gravastars from modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive regular black-hole solutions, including the Hayward metric, from four-dimensional action principles involving vector fields in addition to the metric. These black holes possess additional hair associated with the vector fields, manifesting as free integration constants that regularize the geometry. These constants can be chosen such that regular black holes of all masses are extremal. As a result, they have vanishing surface gravity and are not susceptible to mass-inflation instability. We also discover another regular black-hole metric with these properties, which constitutes a gravastar for an appropriate choice of integration constant.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Geometry Inspired AdS Black Hole with a Cloud of Strings Surrounded by Quintessence-like fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the geometric and physical properties of an anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole space-time coupled by a cloud of strings and surrounded by a quintessence-like fluid, all within the framework of non-commutative (NC) geometry. From the perspective of geometrical optics, we analyze the behavior of null geodesics, focusing on key optical features such as the effective potential, the structure and radius of the photon sphere, light deflection angles, photon trajectories, and the resulting black hole (BH) shadow. Our findings show that the combined effects of the string cloud and quintessence-like fluid significantly modify photon dynamics and optical observables, leading to notable deviations from standard BH scenarios in NC geometry background. We also examine time-like geodesics, with particular emphasis on the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs). The results demonstrate that the presence of geometric matter components alters the ISCO radius compared to conventional solutions. In addition, we explore the thermodynamic behavior of the BH, deriving expressions for the Hawking temperature, entropy, Gibbs free energy, and specific heat capacity. The influence of the string cloud and quintessence-like fluid introduces substantial modifications to the thermodynamic profile, including shifts in phase transition points and changes to stability conditions under NC geometric effects. Furthermore, we study the dynamics of massless scalar field perturbations in this modified background by formulating the Klein-Gordon equation and reducing it to a Schr\"odinger-like form via separation of variables. The resulting effective potential is analyzed in detail, highlighting the significant role of both the string cloud and the quintessence-like fluid in shaping the perturbative landscape within the NC geometry setting.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Black Hole-Disk Driven Jets: Steady Axisymmetric Ideal MHD Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improved observational precision in relativistic jets has underscored the need for tractable theoretical models. In this study, we construct a semi-analytical hybrid jet model that incorporates both black hole-driven and disk-driven components within the framework of steady, axisymmetric, ideal MHD. We derive a condition that determines the launching sites of cold outflows, introducing a new constraint on the magnetic field configuration threading the accretion disk. Using the Bernoulli equation and critical point analysis, we derive flow solutions along various magnetic field lines. Our hybrid jet model shows that discontinuities in field-line angular velocity lead to clear velocity shear and density jumps at the interface between the two jet components. These features are accompanied by localized enhancements in velocity and density, potentially explaining the observed limb-brightening.</description>

      <title>The Prediction and Interpretation of Singularities and Black Holes: From Einstein and Schwarzschild to Penrose and Wheeler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schwarzschild solution was the first exact solution to Einstein's 1915 field equations, found by Karl Schwarzschild as early as 1916. And yet, physicists, mathematicians and philosophers have struggled for decades with the interpretation of the Schwarzschild solution and the two singularities appearing in it when it is written in polar coordinates. This article distinguishes between eight different ways in which the two singularities have been interpreted between 1916 and the late 1960s, when Penrose's first singularity theorem shed new and lasting light on the interpretation of the Schwarzschild solution.</description>

      <title>Volume as an index of a subalgebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new way to understand the volume of certain subregions in the bulk of AdS spacetime by relating it to an algebraic quantity known as the index of inclusion. This index heuristically measures the relative size of a subalgebra $\mathcal{N}$ embedded within a larger algebra $\mathcal{M}$. According to subregion-subalgebra duality, bulk subregions are described by von Neumann algebras on the boundary. When a causally complete bulk subregion corresponds to the relative commutant $\mathcal{N}' \cap \mathcal{M}$ -- the set of operators in $\mathcal{M}$ that commute with $\mathcal{N}$ -- of boundary subalgebras, we propose that the exponential of the volume of the maximal volume slice of the subregion equals the index of inclusion. This ``volume-index'' relation provides a new boundary explanation for the growth of interior volume in black holes, reframing it as a change in the relative size of operator algebras. It offers a complementary perspective on complexity growth from the Heisenberg picture, and has a variety of other applications, including quantifying the relative size of algebras dual to the entanglement wedge and the causal wedge of a boundary region, as well as quantifying the violation of additivity of operator algebras in the large $N$ limit. Finally, it may offer insights into the volume growth of de Sitter space through the changes in North and South pole observer algebras in time.</description>

      <title>2D End-to-End Modeling of Kilonovae from Binary Neutron-Star Merger Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the kilonova emission resulting from outflows produced in a three-dimensional (3D) general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation of a hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) remnant. We map the outflows into the FLASH hydrodynamics code to model their expansion in axisymmetry, and study the effects of employing different $r$-process heating rates. Except for the highest heating rate prescription, we find no significant differences with respect to overall ejecta dynamics and morphology compared to the simulation without heating. Once homologous expansion is attained, typically after $\sim$ 2s for these ejecta, we map the outflows to the Sedona radiative transfer code and compute the spectral evolution of the kilonova and broadband light curves in various LSST bands. The kilonova properties depend on the remnant lifetime, with peak luminosities and peak timescales increasing for longer-lived remnants that produce more massive ejecta. For all models, there is a strong dependence of both the bolometric and broadband light curves on the viewing angle. While the short-lived (12ms) remnant produces higher luminosities when viewed from angles closer to the pole, longer-lived remnants (240ms and 2.5s) are more luminous when viewed from angles closer to the equator. Our results highlight the importance of self-consistent, long-term modeling of merger ejecta, and taking viewing-angle dependence into account when interpreting observed kilonova light curves. We find that magnetized outflows from a HMNS -- if it survives long enough -- could explain blue kilonovae, such as the blue emission seen in AT2017gfo.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the Penrose cut-and-paste method: Null shells with pressure and energy flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cut-and-paste method is a procedure for constructing null thin shells by matching two regions of the same spacetime across a null hypersurface. Originally proposed by Penrose, it has so far allowed to describe purely gravitational and null-dust shells in constant-curvature backgrounds. In this paper, we extend the cut-and-paste method to null shells with arbitrary gravitational/matter content. To that aim, we first derive a locally Lipschitz continuous form of the metric of the spacetime resulting from the most general matching of two constant-curvature spacetimes with totally geodesic null boundaries, and then obtain the coordinate transformation that turns this metric into the cut-and-paste form with a Dirac-delta term. The paper includes an example of a null shell with non-trivial energy density, energy flux and pressure in Minkowski space.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Normal Modes and Nonlinear Electrodynamics in Black Hole Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the connection between thermodynamic phase transitions and quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in charged black holes with a positive curvature constant, within the framework of $F(R)$-Euler-Heisenberg gravity. Nonlinear electromagnetic fields lead to rich thermodynamic phase structures and significantly affect the QNMs of massless scalar fields. By analyzing the QNMs spectrum, we find that the transition point marking the disappearance of divergence in the QNMs slope parameter $K$ aligns with the change of the thermodynamic phase structure described by the heat capacity, within the bounds of computational uncertainty. This precise matching holds under variations of curvature parameters and charge. Furthermore, we show that larger angular quantum number $l$ diminishes this correspondence, while higher overtone number $n$ restores it beyond a threshold. These findings demonstrate that thermodynamic phase transitions of black holes carry embedded dynamical information, uncovering a fundamental link between black hole thermodynamic and dynamical properties.</description>

      <title>Using tunable coherence for reaching micrometer coherence lengths and suppressing stray light in a power-recycled Michelson interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By reentering into laser interferometers, scattered or stray light introduces non-linear noise. This is a major limitation of precision interferometers as preventing such parasitic light is nearly impossible. Thus, substantial effort is put into mitigating the reentering of these fields in various ways. Ground-based laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors employ such mitigation techniques to reduce otherwise restrictive stray light noise. However, they are now reaching sensitivities where conventional mitigation techniques reach limitations. Further improvements planed for future observatories are placing even more demanding constraints on tolerable stray light power. We previously presented tunable coherence as a possible technique to ease these constraints and suppress unwanted coherent interference. For these promising demonstrations, the remaining coherence length and achievable suppression in length-constrained layouts was limited, among other things, by the used pseudo-random-noise phase modulation frequency. In this work, we demonstrate stray light suppression and cavity performance at modulation frequencies up to 10 GHz. This reduces the remaining coherence to a few centimeter in an interferometer, and even to the scale of the laser wavelength in a cavity. We further present a first demonstration of tunable coherence in a power-recycled Michelson interferometer, successfully suppressing stray light in a more complex topology.</description>

      <title>Effective Phantom Divide Crossing with Standard and Negative Quintessence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic microwave background data from the Planck satellite, combined with baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and Type Ia supernovae from various samples, provide hints of dynamical dark energy (DE). These results indicate a peak in the DE density around $z\sim 0.4-0.5$, with the highest significance observed when using the supernovae from the Dark Energy Survey. In this Letter, we show that this peak does not necessarily imply a true crossing of the phantom divide if the measured effective DE is not a single component, but a combination of standard and negative quintessence. The latter is characterized by negative energy density and positive pressure, both decreasing in absolute value and tending to 0 in the future. For appropriate values of the parameters, negative quintessence is relevant at intermediate redshifts and becomes subdominant in front of standard quintessence around $z\sim 0.4-0.5$, giving rise to the aforementioned peak in the DE density. We find that our model is preferred over $\Lambda$CDM at a $3.27\sigma$ CL, which is comparable to the level of exclusion found with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization. Our analysis leaves open the possibility of negative quintessence and other exotic fields existing in the low-energy universe, potentially playing a significant role in cosmic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Lorentz Invariance Violation from GRB 221009A Using the DisCan Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lorentz symmetry is a cornerstone of modern physics, and testing its validity remains a critical endeavor. In this work, we analyze the photon time-of-flight and time-shift data from LHAASO observations of Gamma-Ray Burst GRB 221009A to search for signatures of Lorentz violation. We employed the DisCan (dispersion cancellation) method with various information entropies as cost functions, designating the results obtained with Shannon entropy as our representative outcome. This choice is attributed to the parameter-free statistical properties of Shannon entropy, which has demonstrated remarkable stability as we continually refine and enhance our methodology. In the absence of more detailed data and physical context, it provides more stable and reliable results. We constrain the energy scale associated with Lorentz invariance violation. Our results yield 95\% confidence level lower limits of $E_{\text{QG},1} &gt; 5.4 \times 10^{19} \, \text{GeV}$ (subluminal) and $E_{\text{QG},1} &gt; 2.7 \times 10^{19} \, \text{GeV}$ (superluminal) for the linear case ($n$=1), and $E_{\text{QG},2} &gt; 10.0 \times 10^{12} \, \text{GeV}$ (subluminal) and $E_{\text{QG},2} &gt; 2.4 \times 10^{12} \, \text{GeV}$ (superluminal) for the quadratic case ($n$=2). Subsequently, we incorporated WCDA photons and the Knuth binning method to further optimize and complement our approach, while also performing filter using information entropies. Furthermore, we demonstrate that employing different information entropy measures as cost functions does not alter the order of magnitude of these constraints.</description>

      <title>Higher spin fields and the field strength multicopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the generalisation of the Weyl double copy to higher spin "multi-copies", showing how the natural linearised higher spin field strengths can be related to sums of powers of the Maxwell tensor. The tracelessness of the field strength involves the appropriate Fronsdal equations of motion for the higher spin field. We work with spacetimes admitting Kerr-Schild coordinates and give a number of examples in different dimensions. We note that the multi-copy is particularly transparent in four dimensions if one uses spinor descriptions of the fields, relating this to the Penrose transform. The higher-dimensional spinor multicopy is also explored and reveals some interesting new features arising from the little group based identification of higher spin field strengths and Maxwell tensor types. We then turn to the vector superspace formalism describing higher spin and `continuous' spin representations given by Schuster and Toro, based on symmetric tensor fields. Here the Kerr-Schild higher spin fields we have used earlier naturally package into a simple expression involving an arbitrary function, when the continuous spin scale $\rho$ is set to zero. Further, we discuss the case of an anti-de Sitter background, where there is also a vector space formalism given by Segal and we clarify this approach using a different definition of the covariant derivative. We give a general solution of Kerr-Schild type and finally we describe some of the obstacles to a continuous spin formulation.</description>

      <title>Can cosmic rotation resolve the Hubble tension? Constraints from CMB and large-scale structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a relativistic cosmological model with background rotation, sourced by a non-perfect fluid with anisotropic stress. A modified version of the CLASS Boltzmann code is employed to perform MCMC analyses against Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and late-time datasets. The results show that current CMB data constrain the present-day rotation parameter to be negligible. As a consequence, the derived cosmological parameters remain consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM values. In contrast, late-time probes such as Type Ia supernovae (SNe) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) allow for a higher level of rotation and yield an increased Hubble constant. However, this comes at the cost of a higher $\sigma_8$, which remains in tension with DES-Y3 measurement. Combining CMB, SNe and BAO data confirms the preference for non-rotation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from axion inflation in the gradient expansion formalism I: Pure axion inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion inflation is a well-motivated model of cosmic inflation with a rich phenomenology. The abundant production of gauge fields during axion inflation notably sources a stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background signal, which nourishes the hope that future GW searches might have a chance to probe the model. In this paper, we scrutinize GW production during axion inflation in the gradient expansion formalism (GEF), a powerful numerical technique that captures the nonlinear dynamics of the system in the limit of vanishing axion gradients. We focus on axion inflation coupled to a pure Abelian gauge sector, i.e., pure axion inflation (PAI), and perform the first-ever comprehensive parameter scan of GW production in the Abelian PAI model close to the onset of strong backreaction. Remarkably enough, we find that GW signals within the reach of future GW interferometers can only be realized in parameter regions that also lead to strong backreaction and that are in conflict with the upper limit on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, i.e., the allowed energy density of dark radiation. This observation defines a clear target for future lattice studies of axion inflation that may confirm or improve the predictions of our GEF benchmark.</description>

Abstract: We focus on the use of the functional Wilsonian renormalization group framework characterized by a proper time regulator and test its use in the search of the scaling solutions and the critical properties of an O(N)-invariant scalar field multiplet coupled to gravity in d=4 and d=3 dimensions. We employ the same background-fluctuation splitting and gauge fixing procedure, already adopted in a previous study based, instead, on the effective average action framework and a similar truncation of the effective action. Our main goal is to compare the results for the scaling solutions and some of the associated critical exponents. In this analysis, performed in a different framework, most of the picture previously uncovered is confirmed both at qualitative and quantitative level. There are, neverthelss, few differences both at finite N and in its large value limit, depending also on the schemes which in both frameworks are called 'improved'</description>

      <title>Impacts of wormholes on false vacuum bubble tunneling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we generalize the work of Farhi, Guth and Guven [Nucl. Phys. B 339 (1990) 417] to include a wormhole effect. We study the influence of the wormhole on the tunneling of the false vacuum bubble. The spherically symmetric bubble has two domain walls. The classical dynamics of each domain wall are constrained by two classically forbidden regions. We find that the wormhole has increased the number of instantons and thus can enhance the tunneling rate. We have analytically derived the formula for the bubble tunneling rate, which is consistent with the result obtained by Farhi, Guth and Guven when the wormhole disappears. We show that the tunneling rate increases with the throat radius of the wormhole. Furthermore, we illustrate that the tunneling rate increases with an increases in the mass of the black hole or the surface tension. In the case where a wormhole exists within a bubble and is connected to another universe, we demonstrate that the bubble can enter into another universe through quantum tunneling.</description>

      <title>Tidal effects in gravitational waves from neutron stars in scalar-tensor theories of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06620v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute tidal signatures in the gravitational waves (GWs) from neutron star binary inspirals in scalar-tensor gravity, where the dominant adiabatic even-parity tidal interactions involve three types of Love numbers that depend on the matter equation of state and parameters of the gravitational theory. We calculate the modes of the GW amplitudes and the phase evolution in the time and frequency domain, working up to first order in the post-Newtonian and small finite-size approximations. We also perform several case studies to quantify the dipolar and quadrupolar tidal effects and their parameter dependencies specialized to Gaussian couplings. We show that various tidal contributions enter with different signs and scalings with frequency, which generally leads to smaller net tidal GW imprints than for the same binary system in General Relativity.</description>

Abstract: We have revisited the gradient-flow in information geometry from the perspective of Weyl symmetry. The gradient-flow equations are derived from the proposed action which is invariant under the Weyl's gauge transformations. In Weyl integrable geometry, we have related Amari's $\alpha$-connections in IG to the Weyl invariant connection on the Riemannian manifold equipped with the scaled metric.</description>

      <title>The Dirac equation in General Relativity and the 3+1 formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I present a review of the Dirac equation in general relativity. Although the generalization of the Dirac equation to a curved spacetime is well known, it is not usually part of the standard toolkit of techniques known to people working on classical general relativity. Recently, there has been some renewed interest in studying solutions of the Einstein--Dirac system of equations, particularly in the context of the so-called ``Dirac stars''. Motivated by this, here I present a review of the Dirac equation in general relativity, starting from Minkowski spacetime, and then considering the Lorentz group and the tetrad formalism in order to generalize this equation to the case of a curved spacetime. I also derive the form of the Dirac equation and its associated stress--energy tensor for the case of the 3+1 formalism of general relativity, which can be useful for the study of the evolution of the Dirac field in a dynamical spacetime.</description>

      <title>Fast Radio Bursts and Electromagnetic Transition Radiation on Gravitational Shockwaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a gravitational shockwave hits a magnetar it creates perturbations of the magnetar magnetic field in a form of a transition radiation. We argue that this radiation can be a novel candidate to explain the origin of fast radio bursts (FRB). A unique feature of the transition radiation on the shockwaves is that normal components of its Maxwell strength `remember' only the spatial `profile' of the shock, not the form of the signal. This fact allows us to determine completely a characteristic initial problem for the perturbations with Cauchy data defined on a null hypersurface just behind the shockwave front. The computations are carried by modeling magnetar as a magnetic dipole. As an illustration we consider shockwaves created by ultrarelativistic objects of two types, by compact sources or by cosmic strings. In the both cases the duration of the engine pulse is determined by an impact distance between the magnetar and the source. We present the angular distribution of the transition radiation flux and show that it is consistent with properties of the FRB engine.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the new BAO data and the significant results recently published by the DESI DR2 Collaboration, this study presents a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis of all currently viable f (R) models using this new dataset, and compares its constraining power with that of previous BAO compilations. A corresponding Bayesian model comparison is then carried out. The results reveal, for the first time, very strong statistical evidence in favor of f (R) models over the standard {\Lambda}CDM scenario. The analysis also incorporates data from cosmic chronometers and the latest Pantheon++SH0ES supernovae compilation.</description>

      <title>A pipeline for searching and fitting instrumental glitches in LISA data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19870v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instrumental artefacts, such as glitches, can significantly compromise the scientific output of LISA. Our methodology employs advanced Bayesian techniques, including Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo and parallel tempering to find and characterize glitches and astrophysical signals. The robustness of the pipeline is demonstrated through its ability to simultaneously handle diverse glitch morphologies and it is validated with a 'Spritz'-type data set from the LISA Data Challenge. Our approach enables accurate inference on Massive Black Hole Binaries, while simultaneously characterizing both instrumental artefacts and noise. These results present a significant development in strategies for differentiating between instrumental noise and astrophysical signals, which will ultimately improve the accuracy and reliability of source population analyses with LISA.</description>

      <title>How Many Times Should We Matched Filter Gravitational Wave Data? A Comparison of GstLAL's Online and Offline Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Searches for gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences employ a process called matched filtering, in which gravitational wave strain data is cross-correlated against a bank of waveform templates. Data from every observing run of the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA collaboration is typically analyzed in this way twice, first in a low-latency mode in which gravitational wave candidates are identified in near-real time, and later in a high-latency mode. Such high-latency analyses have traditionally been considered more sensitive, since background data from the full observing run is available for assigning significance to all candidates, as well as more robust, since they do not need to worry about keeping up with live data. In this work, we present a novel technique to use the matched filtering data products from a low-latency analysis and re-process them by assigning significances in a high-latency way, effectively removing the need to perform matched filtering a second time. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we analyze 38 days of LIGO and Virgo data from the third observing run (O3) using the GstLAL pipeline, and show that our method is as sensitive and reliable as a traditional high-latency analysis. Since matched filtering represents the vast majority of computing time for a traditional analysis, our method greatly reduces the time and computational burden required to produce the same results as a traditional high-latency analysis. Consequently, it has already been adopted by GstLAL for the fourth observing run (O4) of the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA collaboration.</description>

      <title>New Methods for Offline GstLAL Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present new methods implemented in the GstLAL offline gravitational wave search. These include a technique to reuse the matched filtering data products from a GstLAL online analysis, which hugely reduces the time and computational resources required to obtain offline results; a technique to combine these results with a separate search for heavier black hole mergers, enabling detections from a larger set of gravitational wave sources; changes to the likelihood ratio which increases the sensitivity of the analysis; and two separate changes to the background estimation, allowing more precise significance estimation of gravitational wave candidates. Some of these methods increase the sensitivity of the analysis, whereas others correct previous mis-estimations of sensitivity by eliminating false positives. These methods have been adopted for GstLAL's offline results during the fourth observing run of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA (O4). To test these new methods, we perform an offline analysis over one chunk of O3 data, lasting from May 12 19:36:42 UTC 2019 to May 21 14:45:08 UTC 2019, and compare it with previous GstLAL results over the same period of time. We show that cumulatively these methods afford around a 50% - 100% increase in sensitivity in the highest mass space, while simultaneously increasing the reliability of results, and making them more reusable and computationally cheaper.</description>

      <title>Across the Horizon: On Gravitational Wave Flux Laws and Tests of Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06783v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the first detection of gravitational waves, this dissertation develops analytical, numerical, and data analysis techniques to address persistent blind spots in our understanding of gravity. Beginning with asymptotically flat spacetimes and the geometry of null geodesic congruences, the derivation of the shear tensor--encoding gravitational radiation--is revisited. The covariant phase space formulation of General Relativity is then employed to derive a non-conservation law associated with the symmetry group at null infinity, generalizing prior constructions of radiative phase space and yielding consistent results. These flux laws are used to derive constraint equations that enable the evaluation and comparison of state-of-the-art numerical waveform models, leading to new insights and a robust algorithm for benchmarking future improvements. These flux laws are further applied to compute quantum corrections to gravitational waveforms arising from the gravitational wave echo effect. Two leading phenomenological scenarios involving echoes from binary black hole mergers are analyzed. The structure of both the primary echo signal and its induced corrections to nonlinear features of the waveform are studied for observability by the upcoming LISA mission. The results indicate that LISA could detect such signals, potentially probing black hole area quantization. Finally, motivated by recent hints of a stochastic gravitational wave background from Pulsar Timing Array data, this work reviews its theoretical basis and studies several astrophysical and cosmological source scenarios. A forecast for detection prospects with LISA is presented using a modern data analysis pipeline. The results suggest LISA will constrain the extra-galactic stochastic background to a spectral energy density below $ \Omega_\text{GW} \lesssim 10^{-8}$.</description>

      <title>Extensive and Intensive Aspects of Astrophysical Systems and Fine-Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most astrophysical systems in our Universe are characterized by shallow gravitational potentials, with dimensionless compactness $|\Phi| \equiv r_s / R \ll 1$, where $r_{s}$ and $R$ are their Schwarzschild radius and typical size, respectively. While the existence and characteristic scales of such virialized systems depend on gravity, we demonstrate that the value of $|\Phi|$ -- and thus the non-relativistic nature of most astrophysical objects -- arises from microphysical parameters, specifically the fine structure constant and the electron-to-proton mass ratio, and is fundamentally independent of the gravitational constant $G$. It then follows that peak rms values of large-scale astrophysical velocities and escape velocities associated with naturally formed astrophysical systems are determined by electromagnetic and atomic physics, not by gravitation, and that the compactness $|\Phi|$ is always set by microphysical scales -- even for the most compact objects, such as neutron stars, where $|\Phi|$ is determined by quantities like the pion-to-proton mass ratio. Our results emphasize the central but underappreciated role played by dimensionless microphysical constants in shaping the macroscopic gravitational landscape of the Universe. In particular, we clarify that this independence of the compactness $|\Phi|$ from $G$ applies specifically to entire, virialized or degeneracy pressure-supported systems, naturally formed astrophysical systems -- such as stars, galaxies, and planets -- that have reached equilibrium between self-gravity and microphysical processes. Finally, we point out that a clear distinction between intensive and extensive astrophysical/cosmological properties could potentially shed a new light on the mass hierarchy and the cosmological constant problems; both may be related to the large complexity of our Universe.

      <description>arXiv:2410.08278v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theories described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians are known to possess strictly positive energy eigenvalues and exhibit unitary time evolution if the Hamiltonian is symmetric under discrete parity and time (PT) transformation. In this work, we demonstrate how quantum quadratic gravity, a theory that generally violates unitarity when viewed as a Hermitian quantum field theory, can be complex-deformed into such a PT-symmetric theory with an action that consists of a ghost-less Hermitian free part and non-Hermitian interactions. Paying special attention to the gauge symmetry present in the theory, we quantize in the covariant operator formalism after suggesting how the framework might be extended to the pseudo-Hermitian picture. We find compelling evidence that the resulting quantum theory possesses a unitary inner product and a sensible interpretation of quantum probability, thus avoiding the ghost problem present in the Hermitian formulation of quadratic gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a statistical analysis of various cosmological models within the framework of f (R) gravity theories, motivated by persistent challenges in modern cosmology, such as the unknown mechanisms driving the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe. We begin by presenting a comprehensive formulation of these theories and discussing their potential to resolve the outstanding issues. Following this, we perform a detailed statistical examination in a cosmological context, leveraging a wide array of observational data. Special attention is given to the incorporation of the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and of the Pantheon++SH0ES compilation, which play a critical role in constraining these models. Our results show an increase in the values of the distortion parameter b and of the Hubble parameter H0 estimates, due to the use of this new compilation of SnIa data. However, no major changes are perceived when using the DESI data set instead of the previous BAO observations.</description>

      <title>A new perspective on modulus stabilization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In braneworld scenarios with compact extra dimensions, the modulus field typically remains undetermined without an appropriate stabilization mechanism. A common approach introduces a bulk scalar field that generates an effective potential for the modulus with a stable minimum. In this work, we explore some novel aspects of such stabilization mechanisms. We study how the bulk scalar profile influences the stabilization procedure. Following the approach of Chacko et al. [1], we analyze several representative cases using methods of singular perturbation theory, and identify a consistent relationship between the structure of the bulk potential and the emergence of a stabilized modulus. We highlight specific classes of potentials where this correspondence is particularly transparent, and outline the general conditions that any bulk potential must satisfy to support stabilization. In this context, we also examine a potential connection between geometric consistency conditions - specifically, the "brane world sum rules" - and the stabilized value of the modulus. In some scenarios where stabilization occurs, we find that these sum rules can offer additional constraints on the modulus, providing a complementary perspective on its determination. Taken together, these results offer a broader perspective on the mechanisms that govern modulus stabilization in higher-dimensional warped geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15973v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical linearized gravity admits a dual formulation in terms of a higher-rank tensor field. Proposing a prescription for the instanton sectors of linearized gravity and its dual, we show that they may be quantum inequivalent in even dimensions. The duality anomaly is obtained by resolving the dual graviton theories into vector-valued $p$-form electrodynamics and is controlled by the Reidemeister torsion, Ray-Singer torsion and Euler characteristic of the cotangent bundle. Under the proposed instanton prescription the duality anomaly vanishes for an odd number of spacetime dimensions as a consequence of the celebrated Cheeger-M\"uller theorem. In the presence of a gravitational $\theta$-term, the partition function is a modular form in direct analogy to Abelian S-duality for Maxwell theory.</description>

Abstract: We propose a symplectic structure for the phase space of a generic Lagrangian field theory expressed in the framework of $L_\infty$ algebras. The symplectic structure does not require explicit knowledge of the derivative content of the Lagrangian, and therefore is applicable to nonlocal models, such as string field theory, where traditional constructions are difficult to apply. We test our proposal in a number of examples ranging from general relativity to $p$-adic string theory.</description>

      <title>Running scalar spectral index in warm natural inflation</title>

Abstract: The validity of inflation models is mainly evaluated according to the consistency of the predicted scalar spectral index $n_{\mathrm{s}}$, the tensor scalar ratio $r$, and the running scalar spectral index $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ with cosmic microwave background observations. In warm inflation (WI) scenarios, one can find exact analytical solutions for $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ in principle, but long expressions may be obtained. Previous studies for WI scenarios have only shown approximate analytical solutions or numerical results for $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$. In this study, we present a general analytical expression of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ without approximation in WI. By providing an analytical expression, even if it is mathematically redundant, we believe that $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ will be studied across a broader range of WI models in the future. The obtained analytical expression of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ is used in the study of warm natural inflation (WNI). Although $n_{\mathrm{s}}$ and $r$ have been previously investigated, $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ is omitted in previous studies on WNI. Our study of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ completes previous phenomenological studies on WNI. In particular, the lower limit of the symmetry-breaking scale in WNI becomes more concrete in this study.</description>

      <title>Do Pulsar Timing Datasets Favor Massive Gravity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several observational phenomena suggest that the standard model of cosmology and particle physics requires revision. To address this, we consider the extension of general relativity known as massive gravity (MG). In this Letter, we explore the imprints of MG on the propagation of gravitational waves (GWs): their modified dispersion relation and their additional (two vector and one scalar) polarization modes on the stochastic GW background (SGWB) detected by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). We analyze the effects of massive GWs on the Hellings-Downs curve induced by modification of the overlap reduction function. Our study consists of analyzing observational data from the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and the Chinese PTA Data Release I, and is independent of the origin of the SGWB (astrophysical or cosmological). By considering the bound on the graviton mass imposed through the dispersion relation, we scrutinize the possibility of detecting traces of MG in the PTA observational data. We find that massive GWs predict better fits for the observed pulsar correlations. Future PTA missions with more precise data will hopefully be able to detect the GW additional polarization modes and might be effectively used to constrain the graviton mass.</description>
