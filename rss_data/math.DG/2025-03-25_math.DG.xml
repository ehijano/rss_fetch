      <title>Special Vinberg cones of rank 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: E.B. Vinberg developed a theory of homogeneous convex cones $C \subset V= \mathbb{R}^n$, which has many applications. He gave a construction of such cones in terms of non-associative rank $n$ matrix T-algebras $\cal{T}$, that consist of vector-valued $n \times n$ matrices $X = ||x_{ij}||, \, x_{ij} \in V_{ij} $ where $V_{ij}$ are Euclidean vector spaces. The multiplication in a T-algebra is determined by a system of isometric maps $V_{ij} \times V_{jk} \to V_{ik}$, s.t. $|v_{ij}\cdot v_{jk}| = |v_{ij}|\cdot |v_{jk}|$ that satisfies some axioms. A T-algebra is determined by its associative subalgebra of upper triangular matrices or its niladical $\mathcal{N}$, called the Nil-algebra. The connected Lie group $G$ of the upper triangular (non-degenerate) matrices acts in the vector space $Herm_n \subset\cal{T}$ of Hermitian matrices and the orbit $C = G(I)\subset Herm_n$ of the identity matrix $I$ is a convex cone with a simply transitive action of $G$. Conversely, any homogeneous convex cone is obtained by this construction.
  Generalizing the notion of rank 3 Clifford T-algebra, we define notions of rank $n$ special T-algebra and Clifford Nil-algebra, which define a special Vinberg cone. We associate with a Clifford Nil-algebra $\mathcal{N}$ a directed acyclic graph $\Gamma=\Gamma(\mathcal{N})$ of diameter 1 and show that Clifford Nil-algebras with given graph $\Gamma$ bijectively correspond to its admissible equipments. This gives an effective method of classification of Clifford Nil-algebras and associated special Vinberg cones.
  We apply this approach for explicit classification of rank 4 special Vinberg cones in terms of admissible equipment.</description>

      <title>Singularities and Topological Change for Deforming Domains in Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a $C^{0}$-deformation of domains $D(t)$ on a manifold $M^{n}$, which allows the topological types of the domains $D(t)$ to change with $t$, in what cases are the entities in analysis continuous in $t$, so that analysis techniques still work along $t$? This type of problem was addressed in our previous work \cite{H24} concerning domains on hypersurfaces of constant mean curvature (CMC) in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. In this paper, we consider a more popular circumstance, where the deforming domains are situated in any smooth manifold $M^{n}$ equipped with an arbitrary self-adjoint strongly elliptic operator $L$ (replacing the stability operator for CMC hypersurfaces in $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ \cite{H24}).
  We define the concept of quasi-Lipschitz domains by gluing together some boundary points of a Lipschitz domain in a specific manner, allowing the topology of the deforming domain $D(t)$ to change. It is established that any ``appropriate" monotone $C^{0}$-deformation on $M^{n}$ (see Definition~\ref{D1.1}) exhibits Sobolev continuity and eigenvalue continuity of $L$ along $t$. As a consequence, a ``global" Morse index theorem is obtained. Furthermore, given an \emph{arbitrary} Lipschitz domain $D$ in $M^{n}$, we can find a $C^0$-deformation from a small $n$-ball to the domain $D$, such that the topology of $D(t)$ may change, yet the required continuity theorems still hold, and hence the global Morse index theorem still follows.</description>

      <title>$\ast$-$\eta$-Ricci solitons and Einstein metrics on a weak $\beta$-Kenmotsu manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak almost contact manifolds, i.e., the complex structure on the contact distribution is replaced by a nonsingular skew-symmetric tensor, defined by the author and R. Wolak, allowed us to take a new look at the theory of contact manifolds. An important case of such manifolds, which is locally a warped or twisted product, is a weak $\beta$-Kenmotsu manifold defined by the author and D.S. Patra. In this paper, the concept of the $\ast$-Ricci tensor is adapted to weak almost contact manifolds, the interaction of the $\ast$-$\eta$-Ricci soliton with the weak $\beta$-Kenmotsu structure is studied and new characterics of Einstein metrics are obtained.</description>

      <title>On the Classification of Isoparametric Hypersurfaces with Constant Principal Curvatures in Compact 3-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Establishing detailed relationships between transnormal systems of different types and their behaviors under covering maps, this paper presents a classification of transnormal systems on compact 3-manifolds in the sense of equivalence. For CPC transnormal systems, we show that the ambient manifolds must be locally isometric to one of six standard geometries up to equivalence. We also find some equivalence classes containing no CPC transnormal system, highlighting a critical distinction between isoparametric foliations and CPC transnormal systems, which has not been previously addressed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Prescribed Ricci curvature near an Einstein manifold with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let (M, g) be a compact Einstein Riemannian manifold with boundary. We show that under certain conditions, the map that associates to a metric on M its Ricci curvature, its induced conformal class on the boundary, and its mean curvature on the boundary is locally invertible near g. The contravariant Ricci operator, as well as other operators such as the Einstein operator, are also studied.</description>

      <title>The local moduli of Sasaki-Einstein rational homology 7-spheres and invertible polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the dimension of the local moduli space of Sasaki-Einstein metrics for links of invertible polynomials coming from the list of Johnson and Koll\'ar of anticanonically embedded Fano 3-folds of index 1 that produce rational homology 7-spheres, that is, 7-manifolds whose rational-homology equals that of the 7-sphere. In order to do so, we propose additional conditions to the Diophantine equations associated to this problem. We also find solutions for the problem associated to the moduli for the Berglund-H\"ubsch duals of links arising from Thom-Sebastiani sums of chain and cycle polynomials. In particular we give an explicit description of local moduli of the complex structure for the corresponding K\"ahler-Einstein orbifold which in this setting is a rational homology projective 3 -spaces with quotient singularities.</description>

      <title>Almost all real linear second order ordinary differential equations are solved by geodesic curves in two dimensional Riemannian hyperbolic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I show that a real linear second order ordinary differential equation $u''\left(x\right)+h\left(x\right)u\left(x\right)=0$, with differentiable $h(x)$, locally admits two linearly independent solutions which exist on an open interval around any $x_0\in\mathbb{R}$: \[
  u_\mathtt{top}(x)=\exp\left[\int_{x_0}^{x}\!\!d\xi\,\Phi\left(\xi\right)\frac{\Phi'\left(\xi\right)-\sqrt{\left[h\left(\xi\right)-\Phi^{2}\left(\xi\right)\right]^{2}+\left[\Phi'\left(\xi\right)\right]^{2}}}{h\left(\xi\right)-\Phi^{2}\left(\xi\right)}\right], \] \[
  u_\mathtt{bot}(x)=\exp\left[\int_{x_0}^{x}\!\!d\xi\,\Phi\left(\xi\right)\frac{\Phi'\left(\xi\right)+\sqrt{\left[h\left(\xi\right)-\Phi^{2}\left(\xi\right)\right]^{2}+\left[\Phi'\left(\xi\right)\right]^{2}}}{h\left(\xi\right)-\Phi^{2}\left(\xi\right)}\right], \] where $\Phi(x)$ is any geodesic curve in a two dimensional hyperbolic geometry of a Riemannian manifold $\mathbb{M}_h$, which is non-vertical at $x_0$. I define $\mathbb{M}_h$ to be an upper half plane $\{\left(x,\varPhi\right)\in\mathbb{R}^2\,|\,\varPhi&gt;0\}$, with points in which $\varPhi^2=h(x)$ being removed, equipped with metric $g_h=\left[\left(h(x)-\varPhi^2\right)^2dx^2+d\varPhi^2\right]/\varPhi^2$. A non-trivial character of the presented result stems from the fact that $g_h$ is solely defined in terms of the function $h(x)$.
  I also show that a local diffeomorphism between $\mathbb{M}_h$ and Poincar\'e upper half plane $\mathbb{H}$ is induced by any pair of linearly independent solutions of $u''\!\left(x\right)+h\left(x\right)u\left(x\right)=0$. If this pair is selected to be $u_\mathtt{top}(x)$ and $u_\mathtt{bot}(x)$, the associate geodesic curve $\Phi(x)$ is mapped to a vertical geodesic curve on $\mathbb{H}$.
  Thus, I establish a link between linear second order ordinary differential equations and two dimensional hyperbolic geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of complex manifolds which we call weakly holomorphic homogeneous regular manifolds (wHHR) manifolds. As the name suggests, this class contains the so-called holomorphic homogeneous regular manifolds but also other classes of complex manifolds such as two dimensional finite type domains and simply connected K\"ahler manifolds with pinched negative sectional curvature. For wHHR Stein manifolds we prove that the Bergman and Kobayashi metrics are biLipschitz equivalent.</description>

      <title>Two-Sample Tests for Optimal Lifts, Manifold Stability and Reverse Labeling Reflection Shap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a quotient of a complete Riemannian manifold modulo an isometrically and properly acting Lie group and lifts of the quotient to the manifolds in optimal position to a reference point on the manifold. With respect to the pushed forward Riemannian volume onto the quotient we derive continuity and uniqueness a.e. and smoothness to large extents also with respect to the reference point. In consequence we derive a general manifold stability theorem: the Fr\'echet mean lies in the highest dimensional stratum assumed with positive probability, and a strong law for optimal lifts. This allows to define new two-sample tests utilizing individual optimal lifts which outperform existing two-sample tests on simulated data. They also outperform existing tests on a newly derived reverse labeling reflection shape space, that is used to model filament data of microtubules within cells in a biological application.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We first establish the weak stability results for solutions of complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations in relative full mass classes, extending the results known to hold in the full mass class. Building on weak stability, we then prove the $\mathcal{C}^{k,\alpha}$ stability of solutions to complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations on quasi-projective varieties. As an application, we study the limit of the singular Ricci-flat metrics on $\mathbb{Q}$-Calabi-Yau projective varieties, inspired by Tosatti's work on Calabi-Yau projective manifolds.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of fully nonlinear equations and their applications to geometric problems. We solve some fully nonlinear version of the Loewner-Nirenberg and Yamabe problems. Notably, we introduce Morse theory techniques to construct admissible metrics under a weak condition on the underlying metric, which can be further relaxed in a broad setting. Furthermore, we provide some topological obstruction to demonstrate the optimality of our structural conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.10853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the holomorphic symplectic geometry of (the smooth locus of) the space of holomorphic sections of a twistor space with rotating circle action. The twistor space carries a line bundle with a meromorphic connection constructed by Hitchin. We give an interpretation of Hitchin's meromorphic connection in the context of the Atiyah--Ward transform of the corresponding hyperholomorphic line bundle.
  It is shown that the residue of the meromorphic connection serves as a moment map for the induced circle action, and its critical points are studied. Particular emphasis is given to the example of Deligne--Hitchin moduli spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.17173v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the notion of T-duality to manifolds endowed with non-principal torus actions. The singularities of the torus action are controlled by a certain Lie algebroid, called the elliptic tangent bundle. Using this Lie algebroid, we explain how certain invariant generalized complex structures can be transported via T-duality. Along the way, we use the elliptic tangent bundle to define connections for these torus action, and give new insight to the classification of such actions by Haefliger-Salem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue for more widespread use of manifold-like polyfolds (M-polyfolds) as differential geometric objects. M-polyfolds possess a distinct advantage over differentiable manifolds, enabling a smooth and local change of dimension. To establish their utility, we introduce tensors and prove the existence of Riemannian metrics, symplectic structures, and almost complex structures within the M-polyfold framework. Drawing inspiration from a series of highly acclaimed articles by L\'{a}szl\'{o} Lempert, we lay the foundation for advancing geometry and function theory in complex M-polyfolds.</description>

      <title>Pinched theorem and the reverse Yau's inequalities for compact K\"{a}hler-Einstein manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a compact K\"{a}hler-Einstein manifold $M$ of dimension $n\ge 2$, we explicitly write the expression $-c_1^n(M)+\frac{2(n+1)}{n}c_2(M)c_1^{n-2}(M)$ in the form of certain integral on the holomorphic sectional curvature and its average at a fixed point in $M$ using the invariant theory. As applications, we get a reverse Yau's inequality and improve the classical $\frac{1}{4}$-pinched theorem and negative $\frac{1}{4}$-pinched theorem for compact K\"{a}hler-Einstein manifolds to smaller pinching constant depending only on the dimension and the first Chern class of $M$. If $M$ is not with positive or negative holomorphic sectional curvature, then there exists a point $x\in M$ such that the average of the holomorphic sectional curvature at $x$ vanishes. In particular, we characterise the $2$-dimensional complex torus by certain curvature condition. Moreover, we confirm Yau's conjecture for positive holomorphic sectional curvature and Siu-Yang's conjecture for negative holomorphic sectional curvature even for higher dimensions if the absolute value of the holomorphic sectional curvature is small enough. Finally, using the reverse Yau's inequality, we can judge if a projective manifold doesn't carry any hermitian metric with negative holomorphic sectional curvature.</description>

      <title>Symplectic double groupoids and the generalized K\"ahler potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A description of the fundamental degrees of freedom underlying generalized K\"ahler geometry, which separates its holomorphic moduli from its compatible Riemannian metric in a similar way to the K\"ahler case, has been sought since its discovery in 1984. In this paper, we describe a full solution to this problem for arbitrary generalized K\"ahler manifolds. We discover that the holomorphic structure underlying a generalized K\"ahler manifold is a holomorphic symplectic Morita double bimodule between double symplectic groupoids, and that each compatible Riemannian metric is given by a Lagrangian submanifold forming a bisection of the real symplectic core of this double bimodule. In other words, a generalized K\"ahler manifold has an associated holomorphic symplectic manifold of quadruple dimension and equipped with an anti-holomorphic involution; the generalized K\"ahler metric is then determined by the choice of a Lagrangian submanifold of the fixed point locus of this involution. This resolves affirmatively a long-standing conjecture by physicists concerning the existence of a generalized K\"ahler potential.
  We demonstrate the theory by constructing explicitly the above Morita double bimodule and Lagrangian bisection for the well-known generalized K\"ahler structures on compact even-dimensional semisimple Lie groups, which have until now escaped such analysis. We construct the required holomorphic symplectic manifolds by expressing them as moduli spaces of flat connections on surfaces with Lagrangian boundary conditions, through a quasi-Hamiltonian reduction.</description>

      <title>Geometric bounds for low Steklov eigenvalues of finite volume hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain geometric lower bounds for the low Steklov eigenvalues of finite-volume hyperbolic surfaces with geodesic boundary. The bounds we obtain depend on the length of a shortest multi-geodesic disconnecting the surfaces into connected components each containing a boundary component and the rate of dependency on it is sharp. Our result also identifies situations when the bound is independent of the length of this multi-geodesic. The bounds also hold when the Gaussian curvature is bounded between two negative constants and can be viewed as a counterpart of the well-known Schoen-Wolpert-Yau inequality for Laplace eigenvalues. The proof is based on analysing the behaviour of the {corresponding Steklov} eigenfunction on an adapted version of thick-thin decomposition for hyperbolic surfaces with geodesic boundary. Our results extend and improve the previously known result in the compact case obtained by a different method.</description>

      <title>Isometric immersions of constant curvature one metrics on the 2-sphere with two conical singularities into Euclidean 3-space: A partial solution to the G\'{a}lvez-Hauswirth-Mira problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13748v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a geometric correspondence between constant curvature one metrics with two conical singularities on $S^{2}$ and isometric immersions into Euclidean 3-space $\mathbb{E}^{3}$. Specifically, we explicitly construct a family of surfaces with constant curvature one, each of which is endowed with two conical singularities. This construction provides a partial solution to an open problem proposed by G\'{a}lvez, Hauswirth, and Mira (Adv in Math. 241(2013) 103-126).</description>

      <title>Partition functions of determinantal point processes on polarized K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01524v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic expansion of the partition functions of determinantal point processes defined on a polarized K\"ahler manifold. The full asymptotic expansion of the partition functions is derived in two ways: one using Bergman kernel asymptotics and the other using the Quillen anomaly formula along with the asymptotic expansion of the Ray-Singer analytic torsion. By combining these two expressions, we show that each coefficient is given by geometric functionals on K\"ahler metrics satisfying the cocycle identity, and its first variation is closely related to the asymptotic expansion of the Bergman kernel. In particular, these functionals naturally generalize the Mabuchi functional in K\"ahler geometry and the Liouville functional on Riemann surfaces. Furthermore, we show that a Futaki-type holomorphic invariant obstructs the existence of critical points for each geometric functional given by the coefficients of the asymptotic expansion. Finally, we verify some of our results through explicit computations, which hold without the polarization assumption.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Reifenberg theorem for measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08052</link>
      <description>arXiv:1612.08052v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study generalizations of Reifenberg's Theorem for measures in $\mathbb R^n$ under assumptions on the Jones' $\beta$-numbers, which appropriately measure how close the support is to being contained in a subspace. Our main results, which holds for general measures without density assumptions, give effective measure bounds on $\mu$ away from a closed $k$-rectifiable set with bounded Hausdorff measure. We show examples to see the sharpness of our results. Under further density assumptions one can translate this into a global measure bound and $k$-rectifiable structure for $\mu$. Applications include quantitative Reifenberg theorems on sets and discrete measures, as well as upper Ahlfor's regularity estimates on measures which satisfy $\beta$-number estimates on all scales.</description>

      <title>K\"ahler-Einstein Bergman metrics on pseudoconvex domains of dimension two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a two dimensional pseudoconvex domain of finite type with a K\"ahler-Einstein Bergman metric is biholomorphic to the unit ball. This answers an old question of Yau for such domains. The proof relies on asymptotics of derivatives of the Bergman kernel along critically tangent paths approaching the boundary, where the order of tangency equals the type of the boundary point being approached.</description>
