      <title>False Vacuum Decay Rate From Thin To Thick Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a single real scalar field in flat spacetime with a polynomial potential up to $\phi^4$, that has a local minimum, the false vacuum, and a deeper global minimum, the true vacuum. When the vacua are almost degenerate we are in the thin wall regime, while as their difference in potential energy increases, we approach the thick wall regime. We give explicit simple formulae for the decay rate of the false vacuum in 3 and 4 spacetime dimensions. Our results include a careful treatment both of the bounce action, which enters at the exponent of the decay rate, and of the functional determinant at one loop, which determines the prefactor. The bounce action is computed analytically as an expansion in the thin wall parameter in generic $D$ dimensions. We find that truncating such an expansion at second order we obtain a remarkably accurate bounce action also deep into thick wall regimes. We calculate the functional determinant numerically in 3 and 4 dimensions and fit the results with simple polynomials of the same thin wall parameter. This allows us to write the complete one-loop decay rate as a compact expression, which works accurately from thin to thick wall regimes.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetries of Non-Supersymmetric Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine generalized symmetries for 4D theories engineered via type II strings on non-supersymmetric orbifold backgrounds $\mathbb{R}^{3,1} \times \mathbb{R}^6 / \Gamma$. Probe branes detect generalized symmetries via the adjacency matrix for fermionic degrees of freedom in an associated quiver gauge theory. In situations where the tachyons are sequestered away from the boundary $S^5 / \Gamma$, this exactly matches the result extracted from singular homology. In situations with an unsequestered tachyon which stretches out to the boundary, the presence of tachyonic pulses partitions up the space into several distinct sectors, and the net contribution again matches with the answer expected via quiver methods. For IIA backgrounds, the presence of a localized closed string tachyon leads to transitions in the spectrum of states, generalized symmetries, higher-group symmetries, as well as the level matrix of the associated symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT). For IIB backgrounds with a stack of spacetime filling probe D3-branes, the onset of a radiatively generated potential leads to similar considerations involving scale dependent transitions in the symmetries of the theory, including structures such as duality defects / interfaces.</description>

      <title>Euclidean Methods on Dirac Quantization and Gauge Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometrical interpretation on U(1) gage theory of Dirac monopole, introduced here from the line integral\cite{Brandt} form of vector potentials, shows the gauge representation be multi-valued. In this paper, we construct Euclidean form of U(1) gauge theory on Dirac monopole based on the geometrical interpretation, derive the Dirac quantization condition geometrically. Even several theoretical methods which leads to Dirac quantization $eg=l/2$ has been developed, these are only possible under the postulate that gauge representation is single-valued. Using the line integration representation of vector potential, we derived the gauge equation which satisfies under the `phase gauge transformation' ($\mathbf{A}\to\mathbf{A}'=\mathbf{A}, \ \psi\to\psi'=e^{ie\Lambda}\psi$), also showed that the Dirac quantization condition can be derived by the geometrical boundary condition on this gauge equation, without any supposing of canonical quantization condition. We finally explain geometrical meaning of constant phase of gauge and how the Dirac quantization holds single valued gauge representation.</description>

      <title>Generation of kink-antikink pairs through the excitation of an oscillon in the $\phi^4$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the oscillon decay in a model with a single scalar field and two asymmetric fundamental states. Specifically, we verify how the evolution of an initially excited oscillon leads to the formation of antikink-kink pairs in the presence of a centered long-lived pulse. In such a context, the magnitude of the original perturbation stands for the most important factor influencing the process. For intermediary values of this magnitude, we find a transitory behavior which suggests that the energy exchange between translational and vibrational modes begins to play an important role in the overall evolution. As the magnitude increases, the centered pulse intermediates an interaction between the inner structures which compose the pairs whose behavior mimics that of a standard antikink-kink collision and therefore reinforces the role played by the energy transfer mechanism. For different values of width, an almost pure antikink-kink pair escapes to the infinity after multiple bounces.</description>

      <title>Majorana Fermion Zero Modes and Anomalies in String and M Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we propose a new consistency condition of quantum field theory: Having an odd number of Majorana fermion zero modes on a dynamical point-like soliton signifies an inconsistency in a theory with 3+1 or higher dimensions. This inconsistency is related to the non-perturbative anomaly in known models of quantum field theory. As an application, we check the consistency of string and M theory compactifications with branes. We propose a new criterion on the consistency of brane configurations: An odd number of Majorana fermion zero modes on a D-brane stretching infinitely in space is acceptable, whereas compactifying it to a point-like object leads to an inconsistency. We show that a single M5-brane always has an even number of Majorana fermion zero modes because of the symmetry on the worldvolume in 2+1 or higher dimensional compactifications of M-theory. We also construct models with an odd number of Majorana fermion zero modes by intersecting D-branes. From our criterion, compactifying such branes to point-like objects is not allowed. Finally, we show that the gauge invariance on the intersecting branes always requires an even number of Majorana fermion zero modes on a point-like brane. This observation gives another interpretation of the inconsistency we introduced.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Stability Versus Chaos Bound Violation in D-dimensional RN Black Holes: Angular Momentum Effects and Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the Lyapunov exponents for test particles orbiting in unstable circular trajectories around D-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black holes, scrutinizing instances of the chaos bound violation. Notably, we discover that an increase in particle angular momentum exacerbates the breach of the chaos bound. Our research centrally investigates the correlation between black hole thermodynamic phase transitions and the breaking of the chaos limit. Findings suggest that the chaos bound can only be transgressed within thermodynamically stable phases of black holes. Specifically, in the four-dimensional scenario, the critical point of the thermodynamic phase transition aligns with the threshold condition that delineates the onset of chaos bound violation. These outcomes underscore a deep-rooted link between the thermodynamic stability of black holes and the constraints imposed by the chaos bound on particle dynamics.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically safe -- canonical quantum gravity junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The canonical (CQG) and asymptotically safe (ASQG) approach to quantum gravity share to be both non-perturbative programmes. However, apart from that they seem to differ in several aspects such as: 1. Signature: CQG is Lorentzian while ASQG is mostly Euclidian. 2. Background Independence (BI): CQG is manifesly BI while ASQG is apparently not. 3. Truncations: CQG is apparently free of truncations while ASQG makes heavy use of them.
  The purpose of the present work is to either overcome actual differences or to explain why apparent differences are actually absent. Thereby we intend to enhance the contact and communication between the two communities. The focus of this contribution is on conceptual issues rather than deep technical details such has high order truncations. On the other hand the paper tries to be self-contained in order to be useful to researchers from both communities.
  The point of contact is the path integral formulation of Lorentzian CQG in its reduced phase space formulation which yields the formal generating functional of physical (i.e. gauge invariant) either Schwinger or Feynman N-point functions for (relational) observables. The corresponding effective actions of these generating functionals can then be subjected to the ASQG Wetterich type flow equations which serve in particular to find the rigorous generating fuctionals via the inverse Legendre transform of the fixed pointed effective action.</description>

      <title>Relational Lorentzian Asymptotically Safe Quantum Gravity: Showcase model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent contribution we identified possible points of contact between the asymptotically safe and canonical approach to quantum gravity. The idea is to start from the reduced phase space (often called relational) formulation of canonical quantum gravity which provides a reduced (or physical) Hamiltonian for the true (observable) degrees of freedom. The resulting reduced phase space is then canonically quantised and one can construct the generating functional of time ordered Wightman (i.e. Feynman) or Schwinger distributions respectively from the corresponding time translation unitary group or contraction semigroup respectively as a path integral. For the unitary choice that path integral can be rewritten in terms of the Lorentzian Einstein Hilbert action plus observable matter action and a ghost action. The ghost action depends on the Hilbert space representation chosen for the canonical quantisation and a reduction term that encodes the reduction of the full phase space to the phase space of observavbles. This path integral can then be treated with the methods of asymptically safe quantum gravity in its {\it Lorentzian} version.
  We also exemplified the procedure using a concrete, minimalistic example namely Einstein-Klein-Gordon theory with as many neutral and massless scalar fields as there are spacetime dimensions. However, no explicit calculations were performed. In this paper we fill in the missing steps. Particular care is needed due to the necessary switch to Lorentzian signature which has strong impact on the convergence of ``heat'' kernel time integrals in the heat kernel expansion of the trace involved in the Wetterich equation and which requires different cut-off functions than in the Euclidian version. As usual we truncate at relatively low order and derive and solve the resulting flow equations in that approximation.</description>

      <title>Classical integrability in the presence of a cosmological constant: analytic and machine learning results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the integrability of two-dimensional theories that are obtained by a dimensional reduction of certain four-dimensional gravitational theories describing the coupling of Maxwell fields and neutral scalar fields to gravity in the presence of a potential for the neutral scalar fields. By focusing on a certain solution subspace, we show that a subset of the equations of motion in two dimensions are the compatibility conditions for a modified version of the Breitenlohner-Maison linear system. Subsequently, we study the Liouville integrability of the 2D models encoding the chosen 4D solution subspace from a one-dimensional point of view by constructing Lax pair matrices. In this endeavour, we successfully employ a linear neural network to search for Lax pair matrices for these models, thereby illustrating how machine learning approaches can be effectively implemented to augment the identification of integrable structures in classical systems.</description>

      <title>Minimally Extended Current Algebras of Toroidal Conformal Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that families of two-dimensional toroidal conformal field theories possess a dense subset of rational toroidal conformal field theories, which makes such families an interesting testing ground about rationality of conformal field theories in families in general. Rational toroidal conformal field theories possess an extended chiral and anti-chiral algebra known as W-algebras. Their partition functions decompose into a finite sum of products of holomorphic and anti-holomorphic characters of these W-algebras. Instead of considering these characters, we decompose the partition functions into products of characters of minimal extensions of $\widehat{\mathfrak{u}}(1)$ current algebras, which already appear for rational conformal field theories with target space $S^1$. We present an explicit construction that determines such decompositions. While these decompositions are not unique, they are universal in the sense that any rational toroidal conformal field theory with a target space torus of arbitrary dimension admits such decompositions. We illustrate these decompositions with a few representative examples of rational toroidal conformal field theories with two- and three-dimensional target space tori.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric spectrum for vector multiplet on Euclidean AdS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum study of supersymmetric theories on Euclidean two dimensional anti-de Sitter space (EAdS$_2$) requires complexified spectrum. For a chiral multiplet, we showed that the spectrum of the Dirac operator acquires a universal shift of $\text{i}/2$ from the real spectrum to make the supersymmetry between boson and fermion manifest, where both the bosonic and fermionic eigenfunctions are normalizable using an appropriate definition of Euclidean inner product. We extend this analysis to the vector multiplet, where we show that the gaugino requires both $+\text{i}/2$ and $-\text{i}/2$ shift from the real spectrum, and there is additional isolated point at vanishing spectral parameter which is mapped by supersymmetry to the boundary zero modes of the vector field. Furthermore, this spectral analysis shows that not every bosonic fields in the vector multiplet can satisfy normalizable boundary condition. Nevertheless, aided by a reorganization of fields into a cohomological form, we find the supersymmetry mapping between bosons and fermions in terms of the expansion coefficients with respect to the newly constructed basis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study solutions of Einstein equations with negative cosmological constant in five dimensions that describe black holes whose event horizons are homogeneous, anisotropic spaces. We focus on the case where the constant-time slices of the horizon are the Nil geometry, the Thurston geometry associated to the Heisenberg group. For such spaces, we analyze the symmetries both in the asymptotic region and in the near horizon region. We compute the associated conserved charges, which turn out to be finite and admit a sensible physical interpretation. We analyze the thermodynamics of the Nil black hole, and we present a stationary spinning generalization of it in the slowly rotating approximation.</description>

      <title>The defect b-theorem under bulk RG flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that for RG flows confined to a two-dimensional defect, where the bulk maintains its conformal nature, the coefficient of the Euler density in the defect's Weyl anomaly (termed b) cannot increase as the flow progresses from the ultraviolet to the infrared, a principle known as the b-theorem. In this paper, we investigate whether this theorem still holds when the bulk, instead of being critical, also undergoes an RG flow. To address this question, we examine two distinct and perturbatively tractable examples. Our analysis reveals that a straightforward extension of the b-theorem to these cases of RG flows fails.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Lattice Fermions in 2D GNY Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We work the lattice fermions and non-Hermitian formulation in the 2D GNY model and demonstrate the numerical implementation for two flavors by the Hybrid Monte Carlo. Our approach has a notable advantage in dealing with chiral symmetry on a lattice by avoiding the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem, due to the non-symmetrized finite-difference operator. We restore the hypercubic symmetry by averaging over all possible orientations with the proper continuum limit. Our study is the first simulation for the interacting fermion formulated in a non-hermitian way. We compare the numerical solution with the one-loop resummation. The resummation results matches with the numerical solution in $\langle\phi\rangle$, $\langle\phi^2\rangle$, $\langle\mathrm{Tr}(\bar{\psi}_1\psi_1+\bar{\psi}_2\psi_2)/2\rangle$, and $\langle\mathrm{Tr}(\bar{\psi}_1\psi_1+\bar{\psi}_2\psi_2)\phi/2\rangle$. We also used the one-loop resummation to provide the RG flow and asymptotic safety in the 2D GNY model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the Witten index of the Berenstein-Maldacena-Nastase matrix quantum mechanics, which counts the number of ground states as well as the difference between the numbers of bosonic and fermionic BPS states with nonzero spins. The Witten index sets a lower bound on the entropy, which exhibits an $N^2$ growth that predicts the existence of BPS black holes in M-theory, asymptotic to the plane wave geometry. We also discuss a relation between the Witten index in the infinite $N$ limit and the superconformal index of the Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena theory.</description>

      <title>Higher-spin self-dual General Relativity: 6d and 4d pictures, covariant vs. lightcone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the higher-spin extension of self-dual General Relativity (GR) with cosmological constant, proposed by Krasnov, Skvortsov and Tran. We show that this theory is actually a gauge-fixing of a 6d diffeomorphism-invariant Abelian theory, living on (4d spacetime)x(2d spinor space) modulo a finite group. On the other hand, we point out that the theory respects the 4d geometry of a self-dual GR solution, with no backreaction from the higher-spin fields. We also present a lightcone ansatz that reduces the covariant fields to one scalar field for each helicity. The field equations governing these scalars have only cubic vertices. We compare our lightcone ansatz to Metsaev's lightcone formalism. We conclude with a new perspective on the lightcone formalism in (A)dS spacetime: not merely a complication of its Minkowski-space cousin, it has a built-in Lorentz covariance, and is closely related to Vasiliev's concept of unfolding.</description>

      <title>$\beta$-WLZZ models from $\beta$-ensemble integrals directly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, we performed a two $\beta$-ensemble realization of the series of $\beta$-deformed WLZZ matrix models involving $\beta$-deformed Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber integrals. The realization was derived and studied by using Ward identities, which do not allow one to fix integration contours, these latter were chosen to be real axis for one $\beta$-ensemble and imaginary axis for the other one basing on some particular checks. Here, we evaluate the $\beta$-ensemble integrals directly using a conjecture by I.G. Macdonald, and explain that another choice of integration contours is also possible.</description>

Abstract: We establish the nonperturbative celestial optical theorem from the unitarity of $S$-matrix. This theorem provides a set of nonperturbative bootstrap equations of the conformal partial wave (CPW) coefficients. The celestial optical theorem implies that the imaginary part of CPW coefficient with appropriate conformal dimensions is non-negative. By making certain assumptions and using the celestial optical theorem, we derive nonperturbative results concerning the analytic structure of CPW coefficients. We discover that the CPW coefficients of four massless particles must and only have simple poles located at specific positions. The CPW coefficients involving massive particles exhibit double-trace poles, indicating the existence of double-trace operators in nonperturbative CCFT. It is worth noting that, in contrast to AdS/CFT, the conformal dimensions of double-trace operators do not receive anomalous dimensions.</description>

      <title>Non-planar integrated correlator in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated correlator of four superconformal stress-tensor primaries in $SU(N)$ $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory in the perturbative limit takes a remarkably simple form, where the $L$-loop coefficient is given by a rational multiple of $\zeta(2L+1)$. In this letter, we extend the previous analysis of expressing the perturbative integrated correlator as a linear combination of periods of $f$-graphs, graphical representations for loop integrands, to the non-planar sector at four loops. At this loop order, multiple zeta values make their first appearance when evaluating periods of non-planar $f$-graphs, but cancel non-trivially in the weighted sum. The remaining single zeta value, along with the rational number prefactor, makes a perfect agreement with the prediction from supersymmmetric localisation.</description>

      <title>Anomaly and invertible field theory with higher-form symmetry: Extended group cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of invertible symmetry, the topological approach based on classifying spaces dominates the classification of 't Hooft anomalies and symmetry protected topological phases. In contrast, except for discrete 0-form symmetry, a systematic algebraic approach based on cochains remains poorly explored. In this work, we investigate the systematic algebraic approach for discrete higher-form symmetry with a trivial higher-group structure. Studying the discrete formulation of invertible field theories in arbitrary dimension, we extract a purely algebraic structure that we call extended group cohomology, which directly characterizes and classifies the lattice lagrangian of invertible field theories and the behavior of anomalous topological operators. Using techniques from simplicial homotopy theory, we prove the isomorphism between extended group cohomology and cohomology of classifying spaces. The proof is based on an explicit construction of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces and their products. Our findings also clarify the discrete formulation of a class of generalized Dijkgraaf-Witten-Yetter models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05722v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent result of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) in combination with other cosmological data shows evidence of the evolving dark energy parameterized by $w_0w_a$CDM model. We interpret this result in terms of a quintessential scalar field and demonstrate that it can explain the DESI result even though it becomes eventually phantom in the past. Relaxing the assumption on the functional form of the equation-of-state parameter $w=w(a)$, we also discuss a more realistic quintessential model. The implications of the DESI result for Swampland conjectures, cosmic birefringence, and the fate of the Universe are discussed as well.</description>

Abstract: We use the higher-order tensor renormalization group method to study the two-dimensional generalized XY model that admits integer and half-integer vortices. This model is the deformation of the classical XY model and has a rich phase structure consisting of nematic, ferromagnetic, and disordered phases and three transition lines belonging to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless and Ising class. We explore the model for a wide range of temperatures, $T$, and the deformation parameter, $\Delta$, and compute specific heat along with integer and half-integer magnetic susceptibility, finding both BKT-like and Ising-like transitions and the region where they meet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the black hole evaporation can be modelled as a process where one symmetry of the system is spontaneously broken continuously. We then identify three free-parameters of the system. The sign of one of the free-parameters, governs whether the particles emitted by the black-hole are fermions or bosons. The present model explains why the Black Hole evaporation process is so universal. Interestingly, this universality emerges naturally inside certain modifications of gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, the Universe's rip cosmology theories have been provided for the $f(Q,C)$ gravity theory, where $Q$ and $C$ stand for the non-metricity scalar and boundary term. We assumed $f(Q,C)=\alpha Q^{n}+\beta C$ and analyzed the nature of the physical parameters for the Little Rip, Big Rip and Pseudo Rip models. In the LR and PR models, the EoS parameter exhibits phantom characteristics but remains closely aligned with the $\Lambda$CDM line. After investigating the energy conditions, we recognised that our model violates the strong energy constraint. Avoiding singularity situations has been noted in all of these accelerated models. The characteristics of the jerk and snap parameters have been investigated. Our model provides an effective description of the Universe's evolutionary history and fits well with contemporary cosmic data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we show that in a particular braneworld scenario with variable brane tension, we obtain matter acting as dark energy while the gravitational constant $G$ promoted to a scalar field on the brane plays the role of matter (both in the sense they have an 'effective' Equation of State equivalent to that of dark energy and matter respectively). This result is interpreted from the Friedmann equation obtained from our model that exactly matches the standard Friedmann equation of General Relativity with a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ in terms of the aforementioned quantities. The universe is assumed to consist of only matter and dark energy in this model which is a good approximation for our universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extended the notion of Newton-Wigner localization, already constructed in the bi-dimensional de Sitter space, to the tri-dimensional case for both principal and complementary series. We identify the one-particle subspace, generated by the positive-energy modes solution of the Klein-Gordon equation, as an irreducible representation of the de Sitter group. The time-evolution of the Newton-Wigner operator was obtained explicitly, and for the complementary series the evolution is trivial, i.e., there are no dynamics. Also, we discussed heuristically the existing sign ambiguity when we do not require as a postulate that the Newton-Wigner functions must be proportional to their respective solutions in the representation of solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathur and Mehta won the third prize in the 2023 Gravity Research Foundation Essay Competition for proving the universality of black hole (BH) thermodynamics. Specifically, they demonstrated that any Extremely Compact Object (ECO) must have the same BH thermodynamic properties regardless of whether or not the ECO possesses an event horizon. The result is remarkable, but it was obtained under the approximation according to which the BH emission spectrum has an exactly thermal character. In fact, strong arguments based on energy conservation and BH back reaction imply that the spectrum of the Hawking radiation cannot be exactly thermal. In this work the result of Mathur and Mehta will be extended to the case where the radiation spectrum is not exactly thermal using the concept of BH dynamical state.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigated two models incorporating LIV with nonminimal coupling in the ( e^+e^- \rightarrow \mu^+\mu^- ) scattering process, employing cross-section calculations. We found that utilizing the dual electromagnetic tensor led to violations of unitarity in both vector and axial scenarios. However, in the other model the preservation of unitarity by the electromagnetic tensor in both scenarios implies its potential superiority, this implies promising prospects for this CPT and Lorentz symmetry-breaking model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate the convenient and mimetic $f(Q)$ gravities in terms of the metric and four scalar fields with the $Q$ being the non-metricity scalar. As a result, it is shown that the obtained field equations are well-defined. By using the field equations, we show how the $f(Q)$ models which realise any given FLRW spacetime may be reconstructed. We construct convenient $f(Q)$ gravity and mimetic $f(Q)$ gravity, which describe the inflation and dark energy epochs and even unify the inflation and dark energy. Moreover, a radiation-dominated epoch and early dark energy may be easily included in the above theories as is explicitly shown. It is shown that the inflationary spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ are consistent with Planck data for some models of $f(Q)$ gravity. Corresponding asymptotic forms of $f(Q)$ and mimetic $f(Q)$ are given. Finally, some remarks on possible reconstruction for spherically symmetric spacetime are given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a family of self-similar exact solutions in General Relativity. The solutions are found in a Painleve-Gullstrand coordinate system but can also be transformed smoothly into a diagonal form. The solutions represent a gravitational collapse leading to three possible outcomes, depending on the parameter space : (i) a collapse followed by a bounce and dispersal of the clustered matter distribution, (ii) a rapid collapse followed by a bounce and an eventual re-collapse, and (iii) a standard collapse leading to zero proper volume. Profiles of the energy conditions are studied for all of the scenarios, and it is noted that a bounce is usually associated with a violation of the Null Energy Condition. It is found that more than one null surfaces (apparent horizons) can develop during the collapse. We also discuss that for a general metric tensor having a conformal symmetry, some regions of the parameter space allows a formation of null throat, much like a wormhole. Matching the metric with a Schwarzschild metric in Painleve-Gullstrand form leads to the geodesic equation for a zero energy falling particle in the exterior.</description>

      <title>No smooth spacetime: Exploring primordial perturbations in Lorentzian quantum cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent analysis of quantum cosmology has focused on the Lorentzian path integral formulations of both the no-boundary and tunneling proposals. However, it has been criticized that the wave function for linearized perturbations around a homogeneous and isotropic background leads to an inverse Gaussian distribution. This results in divergent correlation functions and cosmological inconsistencies. In this paper we explore these perturbation problems in Lorentzian quantum cosmology, focusing in particular on the quantum creation of closed, flat, and open universes from no spacetime and the beginning of primordial inflation. We show that most quantum cosmological scenarios have serious perturbation problems. We also study the effects of trans-Planckian physics on quantum cosmology, using the generalized Corley-Jacobson dispersion as a case study of modified dispersion relations. Our findings indicate that resolving perturbation problems in Lorentzian quantum cosmology with modified dispersion relations remains a challenge. However, the perturbations can be Gaussian in the quantum creation of the flat or open universe within the confines of the saddle-point approximation and the generalized Corley-Jacobson dispersion.</description>

      <title>Exact symmetry conservation and automatic mesh refinement in discrete initial boundary value problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel solution procedure for initial boundary value problems. The procedure is based on an action principle, in which coordinate maps are included as dynamical degrees of freedom. This reparametrization invariant action is formulated in an abstract parameter space and an energy density scale associated with the space-time coordinates separates the dynamics of the coordinate maps and of the propagating fields. Treating coordinates as dependent, i.e. dynamical quantities, offers the opportunity to discretize the action while retaining all space-time symmetries and also provides the basis for automatic adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). The presence of unbroken space-time symmetries after discretization also ensures that the associated continuum Noether charges remain exactly conserved. The presence of coordinate maps in addition provides new freedom in the choice of boundary conditions. An explicit numerical example for wave propagation in $1+1$ dimensions is provided, using recently developed regularized summation-by-parts finite difference operators.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new class of two dimensional gravity models using ideas motivated by the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity. This leads to a rather natural formulation of a theory that has close links with Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. After introducing the theory and discussing its vacuum solutions, we present the Hamiltonian analysis. This implies the presence of a single dynamical degree of freedom, which is in sharp contrast to General Relativity, where there are no degrees of freedom in two spacetime dimensions. Our approach can be extended to various other lower-dimensional gravity theories and thus could be of wider interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider, in Minkowski spacetime, higher-order Maxwell Lagrangians with terms quadratic in the derivatives of the field strength tensor, and study their degrees of freedom. Using a 3+1 decomposition of these Lagrangians, we extract the kinetic matrix for the components of the electric field, corresponding to second time derivatives of the gauge field. If the kinetic matrix is invertible, the theory admits five degrees of freedom, namely the usual two polarisations of a photon plus three extra degrees of freedom which are shown to be Ostrogradski ghosts. We also classify the cases where the kinetic matrix is non-invertible and, using analogous simple models, we argue that, even though the degeneracy conditions reduce the number of degrees of freedom, it does not seem possible to fully eliminate all potential Ostrogradski ghosts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strongly interacting matter created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions possesses several conserved quantum numbers, such as baryon number, strangeness, and electric charge. The diffusion process of these charges can be characterized by a diffusion matrix that describes the mutual influence of the diffusion of various charges. We derive the Kubo relations for evaluating diffusion coefficients as elements of a diffusion matrix. We further demonstrate that in the weak coupling limit, the diffusion matrix elements obtained through Kubo relations reduce to those obtained from kinetic theory with an appropriate identification of the relaxation times. We illustrate this evaluation in a toy model of two interacting scalar fields with two conserved charges.</description>

      <title>Torsion-induced axions in string theory, quantum gravity and the cosmological tensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the role of torsion in string theory on inducing pseudoscalar degrees of freedom (axions), which in turn couple to (gravitational) Chern-Simons (CS) anomalous terms. Such interactions can induce inflation, of running vacuum type, not requiring external inflaton fields, through condensation of the anomalous terms as a consequence of primordial chiral gravitational-wave (GW) tensor perturbations in a weak-quantum gravity setting. The presence of an UV cutoff for the GW quantum graviton modes opens up the system, leading to a dissipative behaviour realised via the presence of non trivial imaginary parts of the gravitational CS terms. The naive estimate of the life time of inflation based on such imaginary parts, which afflict the pertinent GW Hamiltonian, is quite consistent with the estimates of the duration of inflation based on an analysis of the condensate-induced linear-axion-potential by means of dynamical systems. Such quantum-gravity effects can also contribute positively to the alleviation of cosmological tensions if they survive today. In the talk we discuss the conditions under which such a result may be achieved. We also discuss the potential role of other axions in string theory, coming from compactification, in inducing enhanced densities of primordial black holes during RVM inflation, thereby contributing to significantly increased percentages of these black holes that can play the role of dark matter components. Moreover, under certain circumstances, that we shall discuss in some detail, it is also possible that the initially massless torsion-induced axions can acquire a non-trivial mass during the radiation era, thereby providing additional dark matter components in the Universe. With regards to this aspect, we also emphasise the role of massive right-handed neutrinos, provided that such excitations exist in the relevant spectra.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the quantum Schwarzschild black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss some thermodynamic properties as well as the stability of a quantum Schwarzschild black hole, comparing the results with those obtained within a bumblebee gravity model. In particular, the Hawking temperature, $T_H$, the entropy, $S$, the heat capacity, $C$, and the Gibbs free energy, $G$, are computed for both cases. In addition to that, we compute the Brown-York quasilocal energy and compare the solution with the Schwarzschild case. We find that in both cases (quantum Schwarzschild and bumblebee gravity model) the temperature, the entropy, and the heat capacity show the same functional form, under the replacement $\lambda^2 \rightarrow \ell$ and vice versa. Specifically, the temperature is found to be lower compared to the classical (Schwarzschild) solution, whereas the entropy is computed to be larger. Moreover, the heat capacity becomes more negative. Notably, a distinct contrast emerges in obtaining the Gibbs free energy between these two cases, and this distinction appears to stem from the ADM mass.</description>

      <title>Weak equivalence principle and nonrelativistic limit of general dispersion relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the weak equivalence principle in the context of modified dispersion relations, a prevalent approach to quantum gravity phenomenology. We find that generic modified dispersion relations violate the weak equivalence principle. The acceleration in general depends on the mass of the test body, unless the Hamiltonian is either two-homogeneous in the test particles' 4-momenta or the corresponding Lagrangian differs from the homogeneous case by a total derivative only. The key ingredient of this calculation is a $3+1$ decomposition of the parametrization invariant relativistic test particle action derived from the dispersion relation. Additionally, we apply a perturbative expansion in the test particle's spatial velocity and the inverse speed of light. To quantify our result, we provide a general formula for the E\"otv\'os factor of modified dispersion relations. As a specific example, we study the $\kappa$-Poincar\'e dispersion relation. Comparing the ensuing non-vanishing E\"otv\'os factor to recent data from the MICROSCOPE experiment, we obtain a bound of $\kappa^{-1}\geq10^{15}{\rm GeV}/c^2.$.</description>

      <title>Phantom matter: a challenging solution to the cosmological tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The idea of composite dark energy (DE) is quite natural since on general grounds we expect that the vacuum energy (associated to the cosmological term $\Lambda$) may appear in combination with other effective forms of DE, collectively denoted $X$. This was indeed the old proposal from 2006, (cf. Ref.[41]) called the `$\Lambda$XCDM model', which was primordially designed to explain the cosmic coincidence problem. We now find that it can also have far reaching consequences on the current cosmological tensions on $H_0$ and the growth of large scale structure (LSS). The $\Lambda$XCDM may involve both a phantom-like component $X$ and a constant cosmological term $\Lambda$ (positive or negative) or even a running one, $\Lambda=\Lambda(H)$. In the current work, we deal with a simplified version of the model and exploit the possibility that $X$ behaves as `phantom matter' (PM). The latter appears in stringy versions of the running vacuum model (RVM). Unlike phantom DE, it satisfies the strong energy condition like usual matter, hence bringing to bear positive pressure at the expense of negative energy. Bubbles of PM may appear in the manner of a transitory `phantom vacuum' tunneled into the late universe before it heads towards a new de Sitter era, thereby offering a crop field for the growing of structures earlier than expected. Using SNIa, cosmic chronometers, transversal BAO, LSS data and the full CMB likelihood from Planck 2018, we find that the tensions virtually disappear in this stringy RVM scenario characterized by axionic dark matter. The value of $H_0$ emerging from our analysis proves compatible with SH0ES to within less than $0.25\sigma$ and the LSS growth tension is nonexistent. The statistical information criteria point to very strong evidence in favor of the PM solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.02256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Feynman propagator of free scalar fields in $AdS_3$ with a conical defect. The propagator is built by solving the bulk equation of motion, summing over the modes of the field, and taking the boundary limit. We then perform several consistency checks. In the dual CFT, the operator responsible for the defect creates a highly excited state. We consider the exchange of the Virasoro identity block in the heavy-light limit to obtain an expression for the propagator sensitive to the mass of the defect. In $AdS_3/\mathbb{Z}_n$, we treat the propagator by the method of images and in the geodesic approximation. More generally, we argue that long-range correlations of the scalar are suppressed as the defect becomes more massive: we find a continuous phase transition in the correlator at the BTZ threshold and examine its critical behavior. Finally, we apply our results to holographic entanglement entropy using an analogy between our scalars and replica twist fields.</description>

      <title>Field theory in Rindler frame and more on the correspondence with thermal field theory formalisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering two accelerated observers with same acceleration in two timelike wedges of Rindler frame we calculate the Feynman-{\it like} propagators for a real scalar field in a thermal bath with respect to the Minkowski vacuum. Only the same wedge correlators are symmetric under the exchange of the {\it real} thermal bath and Unruh thermal bath, while the cross-wedge ones are not. Interestingly, they contain a cross term which is a collective effects of acceleration and thermal nature of field. Particularly the zero temperature description along with {\it no analytic continuation} between coordinates in right and left Rindler wedges, as expected, corresponds to usual thermofield-double formalism. However, unlike in later formulation, the two fields are now parts of the original system. Moreover it bears the features of a spacial case of closed-time formalism (CTP) where the Keldysh contour is along the increasing Rindler time in the respective Rindler wedges. Interestingly, we observe a new feature that the analytic continuation between the wedges provides the two more spacial cases of CTP. Hence Rindler-frame-field theory seems to be a viable candidate to deal thermal theory of fields and may illuminate the search for a bridge between the usual existing formalisms.</description>

      <title>Propagation and Fluxes of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays in f(R) Gravity Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16678v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of diffusion of ultra-high energy cosmic ray (UHECR) protons in the presence of turbulent magnetic fields in the light of the $f(R)$ theory of gravity. The $f(R)$ theory of gravity is a successful modified theory of gravity in explaining the various aspects of the observable Universe including its current state of expansion. Here, we consider the two most studied $f(R)$ gravity models, viz., the power-law model and the Starobinsky model. For these two models, the diffusive character of the propagation of UHECR protons is explored in terms of their density enhancement (a measure of how the density of UHECRs changes due to their diffusion and interactions in the intergalactic medium). Ankle, instep, and Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff are spectral characteristics that extragalactic UHECRs acquire when they propagate through the cosmic microwave background. All these characteristics are analysed through the diffusive flux as well as its modification factor. We compare the UHECR protons spectra calculated for the considered $f(R)$ gravity models with the available data of the Telescope Array and Pierre Auger Observatory. Both models of $f(R)$ gravity predict energy spectra of UHECRs with all experimentally observed features, which lay well within the range of combined data of both experiments. However, this work is only to investigate the possible effects of $f(R)$ gravity theory on the UHECRs propagation, using pure proton composition as a simplified case study. At this stage, our results cannot be used to favour or disfavour the $f(R)$ cosmology over the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.</description>

      <title>String amplitudes and mutual information in confining backgrounds: the partonic behavior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13454v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the background of several holographic confining backgrounds, we present the connections between the behaviors of string scattering amplitudes and mutual information. We lay down the analogies between the logarithmic branch cut behavior of the string scattering amplitude in $4d$, $ \mathcal{A}_4 $, at low and medium Mandelstam variable $s$ observed in \cite{Bianchi:2021sug}, which is due to the dependence of the string tension on the holographic coordinate, and the branch cut behavior observed in mutual information and critical distance $D_c$ at low-cut-off variable $u_{KK}$ studied in our previous work \cite{Ghodrati:2021ozc}. It can also be seen that in both cases, as $s$ or $u_{KK}$ increases, the peaks in the branch cuts fade away in the form of $\text{Re}\lbrack \mathcal{A}_4 \rbrack \propto s^{-1}$. Then, we used modular flow and modular Hamiltonian as intermediary concept to further clarify the observed connection. We discussed how mutual information itself can detect chaos in various scenarios. In addition, we considered two examples of Compton scattering between two photons and also the decay of a highly excited string into two tachyons and scrutinized the pattern of entanglement entropy and the change in the mutual information in these examples. Then, the kink-kink and kink-antikink scatterings as simple models of scattering in confining geometries have been used to examine the fractal structures in the scatterings of topological defects. Finally, the relationships between Regge conformal block and quantum error correction codes through pole-skipping and chaos bound have been postulated. These observed connections can further establish the ER$=$EPR conjecture and the general interdependence between the scattering amplitudes and entanglement entropy.</description>

Abstract: We consider thermodynamics of the Universe within a quasiparticle approach where the collective dynamics of a system is governed by the thermal mass of the constituents. The spacetime dependence of this thermal mass leads to a negative contribution to the pressure and a positive contribution to the energy density, similar to the effect due to dark energy. We propose a mechanism based on thermodynamic arguments to quantify this contribution from the thermal vacuum of the system. For a sufficiently large spacetime variation of the thermal mass, the effective pressure can become negative and could mimic a dark energy equation of state. We validate our framework using results from renormalizable interacting scalar field theory and demonstrate an application on QCD axion.</description>

Abstract: We show that a UV divergence of the propagator integral implies the divergences of the UV/IR mixing in the two-point function at one-loop for a $\phi^4$-theory on a generic Lie algebra-type noncommutative space-time. The UV/IR mixing is defined as a UV divergence of the planar contribution and an IR singularity of the non-planar contribution, the latter being due to the former UV divergence, and the UV finiteness of the non-planar contribution. Some properties of this general treatment are discussed. The UV finiteness of the non-planar contribution and the renormalizability of the theory are not treated but commented. Applications are performed for the Moyal space, having a UV/IR mixing, and the $\kappa$-Minkowski space for which the two-point function at one-loop is finite.</description>

Abstract: We analyze correlation functions of $SU(k) \times SU(2)_F$ flavor currents in a family of three-dimensional ${\cal N}=4$ superconformal field theories, combining analytic bootstrap methods with input from supersymmetric localization. Via holographic duality, we extract gluon and graviton scattering amplitudes of M-theory on ${\rm AdS}_4\times S^7/\mathbb{Z}_k$ which contains a $\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_{k}$ orbifold singularity. From these results, we derive aspects of the effective description of M-theory on the orbifold singularity beyond its leading low energy limit. We also determine a threshold correction to the holographic correlator from the combined contribution of two-loop gluon and tree-level bulk graviton exchange.</description>

      <title>A Smooth Horizon without a Smooth Horizon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations on type III algebras in AdS/CFT raise the possibility that smoothness of the black hole horizon is an emergent feature of the large-$N$ limit. In this paper, we present a $bulk$ model for the finite-$N$ mechanism underlying this transition. We quantize a free scalar field on a BTZ black hole with a Planckian stretched horizon placed as a Dirichlet boundary for the field. This is a tractable model for the stretched horizon that does not ignore the angular directions, and it defines a black hole vacuum which has similarities to (but is distinct from) the Boulware state. Using analytic approximations for the normal modes, we first improve upon 't Hooft's brick wall calculation: we are able to match $both$ the entropy and the temperature, $exactly$. Emboldened by this, we compute the boundary Wightman function of the scalar field in a typical pure state built on our stretched horizon vacuum, at an energy sliver at the mass of the black hole. A key result is that despite the manifest lack of smoothness, this single-sided pure state calculation yields precisely the Hartle-Hawking thermal correlator associated to the smooth horizon, in the small-$G_N$ limit. At finite $G_N$, there are variance corrections that are suppressed as $\mathcal{O}(e^{-S_{BH}/2})$. They become important at late times and resolve Maldacena's information paradox. Highly excited typical pure states on the stretched horizon vacuum are therefore models for black hole microstates, while the smooth horizon describes the thermal state. We note that heavy excited states on the stretched horizon are better defined than the vacuum itself. These results suggest that complementarity in the bulk EFT could arise from a UV complete bulk description in which the black hole interior is not manifest.</description>

Abstract: We construct the most general four-dimensional ${\cal N}=4$ supergravity coupled to an arbitrary number $n$ of vector multiplets in which the global scaling symmetry is gauged, in addition to a subgroup of $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R}) \times \text{SO}(6,n)$. The various gaugings are parametrized by an embedding tensor built out of $2 \binom{n+6}{3}+4(n+6)$ parameters that satisfy a specific set of quadratic consistency constraints, to which we provide an explicit solution. We also derive the local supersymmetry transformation rules and the equations of motion for the four-dimensional ${\cal N}=4$ matter-coupled supergravity with local scaling symmetry. Such supergravity theories do not possess an action, since the scaling symmetry is only an on-shell symmetry of the corresponding ungauged theories.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by quantum field theory (QFT) considerations, we present new representations of the Euler-Beta function and tree-level string theory amplitudes using a new two-channel, local, crossing symmetric dispersion relation. Unlike standard series representations, the new ones are analytic everywhere except at the poles, sum over poles in all channels and include contact interactions, in the spirit of QFT. This enables us to consider mass-level truncation, which preserves all the features of the original amplitudes. By starting with such expansions for generalized Euler-Beta functions and demanding QFT like features, we single out the open superstring amplitude. We demonstrate the difficulty in deforming away from the string amplitude and show that a class of such deformations can be potentially interesting when there is level truncation. Our considerations also lead to new QFT-inspired, parametric representations of the Zeta function and $\pi$, which show fast convergence.</description>

Abstract: Perturbative renormalization provides the bedrock of understanding quantum field theories. In this work, I point out an alternative way of renormalizing quantum field theories, which is naturally encountered and well known for the case of large N scalar field theories. In terms of bare parameters, this non-perturbative alternative renormalization differs qualitatively from its perturbative cousin: in the continuum limit, the bare coupling constant goes to zero instead of infinity, and there is no wave-function counterterm. Despite these differences, the resulting n-point functions of the theory are finite. I provide explicit results for alternative renormalization for the O(N) model and QCD with $N_f=12$ flavors in 3+1 dimensions.</description>

      <title>A hierarchy of WZW models related to super Poisson-Lie T-duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by super Poisson-Lie (PL) symmetry of the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model based on the $(C^3+A)$ Lie supergroup of our previous work [A. Eghbali {\it et al.} JHEP 07 (2013) 134], we first obtain and classify all Drinfeld superdoubles (DSDs) generated by the Lie superbialgebra structures on the $({\cal C}^3+ {\cal A})$ Lie superalgebra as a theorem. Then, introducing a general formulation we find the conditions under which a two-dimensional $\sigma$-model may be equivalent to a WZW model. With the help of this formulation and starting the super PL symmetric $(C^3+A)$ WZW model, we get a hierarchy of WZW models related to super PL T-duality, in such a way that it is different from the super PL T-plurality, because the DSDs are, in this process, non-isomorphic. The most interesting indication of this work is that the $(C^3+A)$ WZW model does remain invariant under the super PL T-duality transformation, that is, the model is super PL self-dual.</description>

      <title>Pauli-Villars regularization of Kaluza-Klein Casimir energy with Lorentz symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Pauli-Villars regularization is appropriate to discuss the UV sensitivity of low-energy observables because it mimics how the contributions of new particles at high energies cancel large quantum corrections from the light particles in the effective field theory. We discuss the UV sensitivity of the Casimir energy density and pressure in an extra-dimensional model in this regularization scheme, and clarify the condition on the regulator fields to preserve the Lorentz symmetry of the vacuum state. Some of the conditions are automatically satisfied in spontaneously-broken supersymmetric models, but supersymmetry is not enough to ensure the Lorentz symmetry. We show that the necessary regulators can be introduced as bulk fields. We also evaluate the Casimir energy density with such regulators, and its deviation from the result obtained in the analytic regularization.</description>

Abstract: $\alpha'$ corrections to near horizon dynamics of a Schwarzschild black hole in a large number of spacetime dimensions $D$ are governed by the worldsheet theory composed of the cigar CFT and the classical sigma model on the sphere at the horizon, along with a timelike-Liouville theory of central charge $26-D$. At leading order in weak string coupling, blackhole thermodynamics is insensitive to the details of timelike Liouville theory. In this limit, we use Lewkowycz-Maldacena-trick motivated infinitesimally off-shell closed string worldsheet formalism in [arxiv: 2310.02313] to calculate thermal entropy exactly in $\alpha'$. The leading term in $\alpha'\to 0$ limit and the first stingy correction of our result is in precise agreement with the target space Callan-Myers-Perry formula. Also, we point out a remarkable simplification at an ultra-low temperature of order $1/\sqrt{\alpha'D}$ and show that for a certain special set of vertex operators involving modes of the $D$ dimensional spacetime and the time-like Liouville theory, the resulting worldsheet theory is related to Virasoro minimal string.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric AdS Solitons and the interconnection of different vacua of ${\cal N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18482v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find AdS soliton solutions in 5-dimensional gauged supergravity, obtained from the $S^5$ compactification of type IIB, with a dilaton saturating the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound. The solutions depend on the value of the periodicity of an $S^1$ cycle and the boundary values for two $U(1)$ gauge fields, and give a scalar VEV in the dual field theory. At certain values of the gauge sources we have supersymmetric solutions, corresponding to supersymmetric flows, which are a deformation of the Coulomb Branch flow in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM. The solutions parameterize quantum phase transitions between a discrete spectrum phase, a continuous above a mass gap phase, and a continuous without a mass gap phase, in 2+1 dimensions. We analyze the phase diagram in terms of the QFT sources and we find that for every value for them, there are always two branches of supergravity solutions. We find that these two branches of solitons correspond to two possible vacua existing in the dual QFT when fermions are anti-periodic on an $S^1$. We describe the interconnection of these states in the QFT at strong 't Hooft coupling in the large $N$ limit. In 10 dimensions, our solutions are related to deformations of D3-brane distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00906v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We utilize a novel method for the partial-wave unitarity recently suggested in [1] to analyse the hypergeometric Coon amplitude. In this approach we use a new type of harmonic numbers as a basis. Owing to the properties of the harmonic numbers this method bypasses lots of difficulties and can be used to derive a clear and unified form for the partial-wave coefficients. This new approach further streamlines the partial-wave unitarity analysis. As an instance, we re-derive the unitarity bounds from Regge trajectory analysis and find the new critical condition of the hypergeometric Coon amplitude. Our new method also benefits the discussion on the various limits of this amplitude. Specifically, we demonstrate the manifest positivity of super string below $d\leq10$ from our new perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12899v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by string-theoretic swampland conjectures, the existence of a dark fifth dimension, whose size is roughly 1 -- 10 microns, has been proposed. A great deal of supporting evidence has been presented, and definitive experimental tests are likely to be carried out. The basic idea is that the four-dimensional spacetime that we observe lives on a brane that is localized in the dark dimension. This short note points out that there are two distinct ways to realize such a scenario in string theory/M-theory. In the one considered previously the dark dimension is topologically a circle and our observable 4d spacetime is confined to a brane that is localized in a GUT-scale region of the circle. An alternative possibility is that the dark dimension is a line interval with branes attached at each end. This option would imply the existence of a parallel 4d spacetime microns away from us!</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a family of new black holes with a nontrivial horizon in Einstein-$R^2$ gravity with a negative cosmological constant. The solutions are found at the critical point where the coefficient of the $R^2$ term is fixed and the phase structure of AdS black holes of the theory is reversed. These solutions possess vanishing entropy. We also analyze the case in general $F(R)$ gravity, of which the Einstein-$R^2$ gravity is a special case. We arrive at the conclustion that the solutions with arbitrary horizons mentioned above should have $0$ entropy.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Gravity, Dark Energy and Conformal Symmetry: Testing the Hierarchies of Anomaly-Induced Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal back-reaction generates cosmological models where the trace anomaly reflects the breaking of Weyl invariance. Analyzing these actions yields a dynamic approach to dark energy through anomaly-induced actions (AIAs), that are variational solutions of the trace anomaly functional constraint. Expanded around Minkowski space, they produce semiclassical correlators subject to hierarchical anomalous Ward identities, tied to conformal symmetry and diffeomorphism invariance. We focus on comparing the hierarchy of a specific 4-point function, particularly the 2-gravitons-2-photons correlator $(TTJJ)$, generated by AIAs, to free field theory realizations of the same correlator. We observe that the free field theory original hierarchy splits into one ordinary and one anomalous hierarchy, both satisfying the conservation Ward identities from diffeomorphism invariance. However, we find that the anomalous hierarchy derived from ordinary AIAs in both the Riegert or Fradkin-Vilkovisky gauges, are either affected by double poles or violate the hierarchy of the trace Ward identity, respectively. We show that correct forms of the anomalous hierarchies of 4-point functions (for the $TTTT$ and $TTJJ$), identified in a perturbative free field theory expansion around flat space, are characterised by anomaly poles, corresponding to a curvature expansion in $R\Box^{-1}$, together with Weyl invariant terms. We derive the effective action that generates the correct form of the hierarchy for the $TTJJ$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the geometries obtained by performing super non-Abelian T-duality of the Principal Chiral Model on OSp$(1|2)$. While the initial model represents an appropriate 3D supergravity background, interpretable as the superspace version of AdS$_{3}$, the T-dual model fails solving the 3D supergravity torsion constraints. We argue that this has to do with a factorisation pattern taking place under dualisation: the dual 3D geometry can be rewritten as the supersymmetric version of AdS$_{2}$, satisfying the supergravity constraints, fibered over what we interpret as the superspace equivalent of the standard bosonic line. We discuss an interesting connection between T-duals of generic Principal Chiral Models and Poisson sigma models. We exploit it to show that in a suitable limit the dual action studied in this work gives rise to JT (super)gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the intricate real-time dynamics of a non-Hermitian system composed of two interconnected Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. A central finding reveals that an excitation initially localized in the right SYK subsystem can be efficiently transmitted to the left subsystem subsequent to the characteristic scrambling time, a phenomenon facilitated by the intrinsic non-Hermitian nature of the system. The defining hallmark of non-Hermiticity is manifest in the asymmetric conveyance of quantum states, with the non-Hermitian parameter functioning as a tunable knob that selectively amplifies or dampens propagation modes on either side. Despite this inherent directional bias in state transfer, the system sustains two distinct phases, analogously likened to black holes and wormholes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13684v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near horizons, quantum fields of low spin exhibit densities of states that behave asymptotically like 1+1 dimensional conformal field theories. In effective field theory, imposing some short-distance cutoff, one can compute thermodynamic quantities associated with the horizon, and the leading cutoff sensitivity of the heat capacity is found to equal to the leading cutoff sensitivity of the entropy. One can also compute contributions to the thermodynamic quantities from the gravitational path integral. For the cosmological horizon of the static patch of de Sitter space, a natural conjecture for the relevant heat capacity is shown to equal the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. These observations allow us to extend the well-known notion of the generalized entropy to a generalized heat capacity for the static patch of dS. The finiteness of the entropy and the nonvanishing of the generalized heat capacity suggests it is useful to think about dS as a state in a finite dimensional quantum gravity model that is not maximally uncertain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of defining an invariant notion of tension in gravity. For spacetimes whose asymptotics are those of a Defect CFT we propose two independent definitions : Gravitational tension given by the one-point function of the dilatation current, and inertial tension, or stiffness, given by the norm of the displacement operator. We show that both reduce to the tension of the Nambu-Goto action in the limit of classical thin probe branes. Subtle normalisations of the relevant Witten diagrams are fixed by the Weyl and diffeomorphism Ward identities of the boundary DCFT. The gravitational tension is not defined for domain walls, whereas stiffness is not defined for point particles. When they both exist these two tensions are in general different, but the examples of line and surface BPS defects in $d=4$ show that superconformal invariance can identify them.</description>

      <title>The Case Against Smooth Null Infinity III: Early-Time Asymptotics for Higher $\ell$-Modes of Linear Waves on a Schwarzschild Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.00035v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the early-time asymptotics for fixed-frequency solutions $\phi_\ell$ to the wave equation $\Box_g \phi_\ell=0$ on a fixed Schwarzschild background ($M&gt;0$) arising from the no incoming radiation condition on $\mathcal I^-$ and polynomially decaying data, $r\phi_\ell\sim t^{-1}$ as $t\to-\infty$, on either a timelike boundary of constant area radius (I) or an ingoing null hypersurface (II). In case (I), we show that the asymptotic expansion of $\partial_v(r\phi_\ell)$ along outgoing null hypersurfaces near spacelike infinity $i^0$ contains logarithmic terms at order $r^{-3-\ell}\log r$. In contrast, in case (II), we obtain that the asymptotic expansion of $\partial_v(r\phi_\ell)$ near spacelike infinity $i^0$ contains logarithmic terms already at order $r^{-3}\log r$ (unless $\ell=1$).
  These results suggest an alternative approach to the study of late-time asymptotics near future timelike infinity $i^+$ that does not assume conformally smooth or compactly supported Cauchy data: In case (I), our results indicate logarithmic modifications to Price's law for each $\ell$-mode. On the other hand, the data of case (II) lead to much stronger deviations from Price's law. In particular, we conjecture that compactly supported scattering data on $\mathcal H^-$ and $\mathcal I^-$ lead to solutions that exhibit the same late-time asymptotics on $\mathcal I^+$ for each $\ell$: $r\phi_\ell|_{\mathcal I^+}\sim u^{-2}$ as $u\to\infty$.</description>

Abstract: Black holes exert quantum pressure coming from the nonlocal gravity correction. We investigate this nonlocal correction for black holes in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime and its dual boundary field theory. We show that the second order curvature and the nonlocal actions do not backreact on the AdS black hole metric. Thus, the interpretation of quantum pressure holds in the bulk for AdS black hole, generalizing the previous result for the asymptotically flat black hole. We then show that the leading geometric correction comes from the third order in curvature and explicitly calculate the corrections to the metric and to the horizon. For applications to AdS/CFT, we conjectured a nonlocal Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term along with the necessary counter terms to cancel the ultraviolet divergence of the bulk action. We then calculate the thermodynamic quantities in the bulk and discuss their properties.</description>

      <title>Outlook for detecting the gravitational wave displacement and spin memory effects with current and future gravitational wave detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.16266v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave memory effects arise from non-oscillatory components of gravitational wave signals, and they are predictions of general relativity in the nonlinear regime that have close connections to the asymptotic properties of isolated gravitating systems. There are many types of memory effects that have been studied in the literature. In this paper we focus on the "displacement" and "spin" memories, which are expected to be the largest of these effects from sources such as the binary black hole mergers which have already been detected by LIGO and Virgo. The displacement memory is a change in the relative separation of two initially comoving observers due to a burst of gravitational waves, whereas the spin memory is a portion of the change in relative separation of observers with initial relative velocity. As both of these effects are small, LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA can only detect memory effects from individual events that are much louder (and thus rarer) than those that have been detected so far. By combining data from multiple events, however, these effects could be detected in a population of binary mergers. In this paper, we present new forecasts for how long current and future detectors will need to operate in order to measure these effects from populations of binary black hole systems that are consistent with the populations inferred from the detections from LIGO and Virgo's first three observing runs. We find that a second-generation detector network of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA operating at the O4 ("design") sensitivity for 1.5 years and then operating at the O5 ("plus") sensitivity for an additional year can detect the displacement memory. For Cosmic Explorer, we find that displacement memory could be detected for individual loud events, and that the spin memory could be detected in a population within 2 years of observation time.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part IIa. Eigenmodes, correlation matrices, and detectability of orientable Euclidean manifolds</title>

Abstract: If the Universe has non-trivial spatial topology, observables depend on both the parameters of the spatial manifold and the position and orientation of the observer. In infinite Euclidean space, most cosmological observables arise from the amplitudes of Fourier modes of primordial scalar curvature perturbations. Topological boundary conditions replace the full set of Fourier modes with specific linear combinations of selected Fourier modes as the eigenmodes of the scalar Laplacian. We present formulas for eigenmodes in orientable Euclidean manifolds with the topologies $E_{1}-E_{6}$, $E_{11}$, $E_{12}$, $E_{16}$, and $E_{18}$ that encompass the full range of manifold parameters and observer positions, generalizing previous treatments. Under the assumption that the amplitudes of primordial scalar curvature eigenmodes are independent random variables, for each topology we obtain the correlation matrices of Fourier-mode amplitudes (of scalar fields linearly related to the scalar curvature) and the correlation matrices of spherical-harmonic coefficients of such fields sampled on a sphere, such as the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We evaluate the detectability of these correlations given the cosmic variance of the observed CMB sky. We find that topologies where the distance to our nearest clone is less than about 1.2 times the diameter of the last scattering surface of the CMB give a correlation signal that is larger than cosmic variance noise in the CMB. This implies that if cosmic topology is the explanation of large-angle anomalies in the CMB, then the distance to our nearest clone is not much larger than the diameter of the last scattering surface. We argue that the topological information is likely to be better preserved in three-dimensional data, such as will eventually be available from large-scale structure surveys.</description>

      <title>Exploring CP Violation beyond the Standard Model and the PQ Quality with Electric Dipole Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01090v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In some models of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM), one of the leading low energy consequences of the model appears in the form of the chromo-electric dipole moments (CEDMs) of the gluons and light quarks. We examine if these CEDMs can be distinguished from the QCD $\theta$-term through the experimentally measurable nuclear and atomic electric dipole moments (EDMs) in both cases with and without the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) mechanism solving the strong CP problem. We find that the nucleon EDMs show a distinctive pattern when the EDMs are dominantly induced by the light quark CEDMs without the PQ mechanism. In the presence of the PQ mechanism, the QCD $\theta$-parameter corresponds to the vacuum value of the axion field, which might be induced either by CEDMs or by UV-originated PQ breaking other than the QCD anomaly, for instance the PQ breaking by quantum gravity effects. We find that in case with the PQ mechanism the nucleon EDMs have a similar pattern regardless of what is the dominant source of EDMs among the CEDMs and $\theta$-term, unless there is a significant cancellation between the contributions from different sources. In contrast, some nuclei or atomic EDMs can have characteristic patterns significantly depending on the dominant source of EDMs, which may allow identifying the dominant source among the CEDMs and $\theta$-term. Yet, discriminating the gluon CEDM from the QCD $\theta$-parameter necessitates additional knowledge of low energy parameters induced by the gluon CEDM, which is not available at the moment. Our results imply that EDMs can reveal unambiguous sign of CEDMs while identifying the origin of the axion vacuum value, however it requires further knowledge of low energy parameters induced by the gluon CEDM.</description>

      <title>Algebraic classification of 2+1 geometries: a new approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a convenient method of algebraic classification of 2+1 spacetimes into the types I, II, D, III, N and O, without using any field equations. It is based on the 2+1 analogue of the Newman-Penrose curvature scalars $\Psi_A$ of distinct boost weights, which are specific projections of the Cotton tensor onto a suitable null triad. The algebraic types are then simply determined by the gradual vanishing of such Cotton scalars, starting with those of the highest boost weight. This classification is directly related to the specific multiplicity of the Cotton-aligned null directions (CANDs) and to the corresponding Bel-Debever criteria. Using a bivector (that is 2-form) decomposition, we demonstrate that our method is fully equivalent to the usual Petrov-type classification of 2+1 spacetimes based on the eigenvalue problem and determining the respective canonical Jordan form of the Cotton-York tensor. We also derive a simple synoptic algorithm of algebraic classification based on the key polynomial curvature invariants. To show the practical usefulness of our approach, we perform the classification of several explicit examples, namely the general class of Robinson-Trautman spacetimes with an aligned electromagnetic field and a cosmological constant, and other metrics of various algebraic types.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was recently proposed that five-dimensional inflation can relate the causal size of the observable universe to the present weakness of gravitational interactions by blowing up an extra compact dimension from the microscopic fundamental length of gravity to a large size in the micron range, as required in the Dark Dimension proposal. Here, we compute the power spectrum of all primordial fluctuations emerging from a 5-dimensional inflaton in a slow-roll region of its potential, showing an interesting change of behaviour at large scales corresponding to angles larger than about 10 degrees in the sky.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz and Generalised Hydrodynamics in the sine-Gordon model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03909v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We set up a hydrodynamic description of the non-equilibrium dynamics of sine-Gordon quantum field theory for generic coupling. It is built upon an explicit form of the Bethe Ansatz description of general thermodynamic states, with the structure of the resulting coupled integral equations encoded in terms of graphical diagrams. The resulting framework is applied to derive results for the Drude weights of charge and energy. Quantities associated with the charge universally have fractal dependence on the coupling, which is notably absent from those associated with energy, a feature explained by the different roles played by reflective scattering in transporting these quantities. We then present far-from-equilibrium results, including explicit time evolution starting from bipartite initial states and dynamical correlation functions. Our framework can be applied to explore numerous other aspects of non-equilibrium dynamics, which opens the way to a wide array of theoretical studies and potential novel experimental predictions.</description>

      <title>Josephson current through the SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17366v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the equilibrium Josephson current through a disordered interacting quantum dot described by a Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model contacted by two BCS superconductors. We show that, at zero temperature and at the conformal limit, i.e. in the strong interacting limit, the Josephson current is suppressed by $U$, the strength of the interaction, as $\ln(U)/U$ and becomes universal, namely it gets independent on the superconducting pairing. At finite temperature $T$, instead, it depends on the ratio between the gap $\Delta$ and the temperature. A proximity effect exists but the self-energy corrections induced by the coupling with the superconducting leads seem subleading as compared to the self-energy due to the interaction for large number of particles. Finally we compare the results of the original four-fermion model with those obtained considering zero interaction, two-fermions and a generalized q-fermion model.</description>

      <title>Investigation of generalised uncertainty principle effects on FRW cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the entropy-area relation from Nouicer's generalised uncertainty principle (GUP), we derive the GUP modified Friedmann equations from the first law of thermodynamics at apparent horizon. We find a minimum apparent horizon due to the minimal length notion of GUP. We show that the energy density of universe has a maximum and finite value at the minimum apparent horizon. Both minimum apparent horizon and maximum energy density imply the absence of the Big Bang singularity. Moreover, we investigate the GUP effects on the deceleration parameter for flat case. Finally, we examine the validity of generalised second law (GSL) of thermodynamics. We show that GSL always holds in a region enclosed by apparent horizon for the GUP effects. We also investigate the GSL in $\Lambda CDM$ cosmology and find that the total entropy change of universe has a maximum value in the presence of GUP effects. To better grasp the effects of Nouicer's GUP on cosmology, we compare our results with those obtained from quadratic GUP (QGUP).</description>

      <title>The excitation of quadratic quasinormal modes for Kerr black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The excitation of quadratic quasinormal modes is an important nonlinear phenomenon for a Kerr black hole ringing at a specific linear mode. The amplitude of this second-order effect is proportional to the square of the linear mode amplitude, with the ratio being linked to the nature of the Kerr black hole. Focusing on the linear $(l=m=2,n=0)$ mode, we compute the dependency of the ratio on the dimensionless spin of the black hole, ranging up to 0.99, with the method applicable for more general mode couplings. Our calculation makes use of the frequency-domain, second-order Teukolsky equation, which involves two essential steps (a) analytically reconstructing the metric through the Chrzanowski-Cohen-Kegeles approach and (b) numerically solving the second-order Teukolsky equation using the shooting method along a complex contour. We find that the spin dependence of the ratio shows a strong correlation with the angular overlap between parent and child modes, providing qualitative insights into the origin of the dependence. Depending on the nature of the angular overlap, the ratio decreases with spin in scenarios such as the channel $(l=m=2,n=0)\times(l=m=2,n=0)\to(l=m=4)$ or increases in situations like $(l=m=2,n=0)\times(l=m=2,n=0)\to(l=5,m=4)$. For both cases, the ratios do not vanish in the extremal limit. As a byproduct, we find that the Weyl scalars can be concisely expressed with the Hertz potential.</description>

      <title>Constraints on an Anisotropic Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15782v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the possibility of global anisotropy of the universe. We consider an altered Friedmann Lemaitre Robertson Walker metric in which there are different scale factors along the three different axes of space. We construct the corresponding altered Friedmann equations. We show that any initial anisotropies decrease into the future. At late times, the difference in Hubble parameters changes as $1/\sqrt{t}$ in a radiation dominated era and as $1/t$ in a matter dominated era. We use constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background to constrain the level of anisotropies at early times. We also examine how the approach back in time to the singularity is radically altered; happening much more abruptly, as a function of density, in an anisotropic universe. We also mention improved bounds that can arise from measurements of primordial gravitons, Weakly interacting massive particles, and neutrinos.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the recently-established connection between Jarzynski's equality and the theoretical framework of Stochastic Normalizing Flows, we investigate a protocol relying on out-of-equilibrium lattice Monte Carlo simulations to mitigate the infamous computational problem of topological freezing. We test our proposal on $2d$ $\mathrm{CP}^{N-1}$ models and compare our results with those obtained adopting the Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions proposed by M. Hasenbusch, obtaining comparable performances. Our work thus sets the stage for future applications combining our Monte Carlo setup with machine learning techniques.</description>

      <title>Energy Extraction via Magnetic Reconnection in Konoplya-Rezzolla-Zhidenko Parametrized Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Comisso and Asenjo proposed a novel mechanism for harnessing energy from black holes through magnetic reconnection. Our study focuses on exploring the utilization of this mechanism on Konoplya-Rezzolla-Zhidenko (KRZ) parametrized black holes to assess the impact of deformation parameters on energy extraction. Among the various parameters, $\{\delta_1, \delta_2\}$ are identified as the most important factors affecting the physics under consideration. The influence of these two parameters on the ergoregion, circular geodesics in the equatorial plane, and energy extraction from the KRZ black holes through magnetic reconnection is carefully analyzed. Results indicate that deviations from the Kerr metric have a notable influence on the energy extraction process. Particularly, energy extraction is enhanced with more negative ${\delta_1}$ or more positive ${\delta_2}$ within the range constrained by current astronomical observations, resulting in significantly higher maximum power and efficiency compared to the Kerr model. Moreover, when ${\delta_2}$ is sufficiently negative, extracting energy through this mechanism becomes increasingly challenging, necessitating an exceptionally high black hole spin.</description>

      <title>Does DESI 2024 Confirm $\Lambda$CDM?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a $\sim 2 \sigma$ discrepancy with the Planck-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology in DESI Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) data at $z_{\textrm{eff}} = 0.51$ translates into an unexpectedly large $\Omega_m$ value, $\Omega_m = 0.668^{+0.180}_{-0.169}$. We independently confirm that this anomaly drives the preference for $w_0 &gt; -1$ in DESI data confronted to the $w_0 w_a$CDM model. We show that redshift bins of DESI constraints allow $\Omega_m$ to wiggle at the $\sim 2 \sigma$ level with increasing effective redshift in the $\Lambda$CDM model. Given that LRG data at $z_{\textrm{eff}} = 0.51$ is at odds with Type Ia supernovae in overlapping redshifts, we expect that this anomaly will decrease in statistical significance with future DESI data releases leaving an increasing $\Omega_m$ trend with effective redshift at higher redshifts. We estimate the significance of the latter in DESI data at $\sim 1.8 \sigma$ and comment on how it dovetails with independent observations. It is imperative to understand what makes DESI LRG data at $z_{\textrm{eff}} = 0.51$ an outlier when it comes to $\Omega_m$ determinations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the differential equations for the two remaining integral topologies contributing to the leading colour two-loop amplitudes for $pp \rightarrow t\bar{t}j$. We derive differential equations for the master integrals by solving the integration-by-parts identities over finite fields. Of the two systems of differential equations, one is presented in canonical '${\rm d} \log$' form, while the other is found to have an elliptic sector. For the elliptic topology we identify the relevant elliptic curve, and present the differential equations in a more general form which depends quadratically on $\epsilon$ and contains non-logarithmic one-forms in addition to the canonical ${\rm d} \log$'s. We solve the systems of differential equations numerically using generalised series expansions with the boundary terms obtained using the auxiliary mass flow method. A summary of all one-loop and two-loop planar topologies is presented including the list of alphabet letters for the '${\rm d} \log$' form systems and high-precision boundary values.</description>

      <title>Holography for Sp(2$N_c$) Gauge Dynamics: from Composite Higgs to Technicolour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Sp(2$N_c$) gauge dynamics with two Dirac fermion flavours in the fundamental representation. These strongly coupled systems underlie some composite Higgs models with a global symmetry breaking pattern SU(4)$\rightarrow$Sp(4), leading to a light quartet of pseudo-Goldstone bosons that can play the role of the Higgs. Including four-fermion interactions can rotate the vacuum to a technicolour breaking pattern. Using gauge/gravity duality, we study the underlying gauge dynamics. Our model incorporates the $N_c$-specific running of the fermion anomalous dimension and can thus distinguish between specific gauge groups. We determine the bound-state spectrum of the UV SU(4)$\rightarrow$Sp(4) symmetry breaking model, also including fermion masses and mass splitting, and display the $N_c$ dependence. The inclusion of a four-fermion interaction shows the emergence of three Goldstone bosons on the path to technicolour dynamics.</description>
