      <title>Modelling financial returns with mixtures of generalized normal distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This PhD Thesis presents an investigation into the analysis of financial returns using mixture models, focusing on mixtures of generalized normal distributions (MGND) and their extensions. The study addresses several critical issues encountered in the estimation process and proposes innovative solutions to enhance accuracy and efficiency. In Chapter 2, the focus lies on the MGND model and its estimation via expectation conditional maximization (ECM) and generalized expectation maximization (GEM) algorithms. A thorough exploration reveals a degeneracy issue when estimating the shape parameter. Several algorithms are proposed to overcome this critical issue. Chapter 3 extends the theoretical perspective by applying the MGND model on several stock market indices. A two-step approach is proposed for identifying turmoil days and estimating returns and volatility. Chapter 4 introduces constrained mixture of generalized normal distributions (CMGND), enhancing interpretability and efficiency by imposing constraints on parameters. Simulation results highlight the benefits of constrained parameter estimation. Finally, Chapter 5 introduces generalized normal distribution-hidden Markov models (GND-HMMs) able to capture the dynamic nature of financial returns. This manuscript contributes to the statistical modelling of financial returns by offering flexible, parsimonious, and interpretable frameworks. The proposed mixture models capture complex patterns in financial data, thereby facilitating more informed decision-making in financial analysis and risk management.</description>

      <title>Robust Graph Neural Networks for Stability Analysis in Dynamic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current context of accelerated globalization and digitalization, the complexity and uncertainty of financial markets are increasing, and the identification and prevention of economic risks have become a key link in maintaining the stability of the financial system. Traditional risk identification methods often have limitations because they are difficult to cope with the multi-level and dynamically changing complex relationships in financial networks. With the rapid development of financial technology, graph neural network (GNN) technology, as an emerging deep learning method, has gradually shown great potential in the field of financial risk management. GNN can map transaction behaviors, financial institutions, individuals, and their interactive relationships in financial networks into graph structures, and effectively capture potential patterns and abnormal signals in financial data through embedded representation learning. Using this technology, financial institutions can extract valuable information from complex transaction networks, identify hidden dangers or abnormal behaviors that may cause systemic risks in a timely manner, optimize decision-making processes, and improve the accuracy of risk warnings. This paper explores the economic risk identification algorithm based on the GNN algorithm, aiming to provide financial institutions and regulators with more intelligent technical tools to help maintain the security and stability of the financial market. Improving the efficiency of economic risk identification through innovative technical means is expected to further enhance the risk resistance of the financial system and lay the foundation for building a robust global financial system.</description>

      <title>Germany's Tax Revenue and its Total Administrative Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tax administrative cost reduction is an economically and socially desirable goal for public policy. This article proposes total administrative cost as percentage of total tax revenue as a vivid measurand, also useful for cross-jurisdiction comparisons. Statistical data, surveys and a novel approach demonstrate: Germany's 2021 tax administrative costs likely exceeded 20% of total tax revenue, indicating need for improvement of Germany's taxation system - and for the many jurisdictions with similar tax regimes. In addition, this article outlines possible reasons for and implications of the seemingly high tax administrative burden as well as solutions.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic forecasting with a hybrid Factor-QRA approach: Application to electricity trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid approach for constricting probabilistic forecasts that combines both the Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA) method and the factor-based averaging scheme. The performance of the approach is evaluated on data sets from two European energy markets - the German EPEX SPOT and the Polish Power Exchange (TGE). The results show that the newly proposed method outperforms literature benchmarks in terms of statistical measures: the empirical coverage and the Christoffersen test for conditional coverage. Moreover, in line with recent literature trends, the economic value of forecasts is evaluated based on the trading strategy using probabilistic price predictions to optimize the operation of an energy storage system. The results suggest that apart from the use of statistical measures, there is a need for the economic evaluation of forecasts.</description>
