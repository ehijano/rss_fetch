      <title>Perspective on Non-Hermitian Elastodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manipulation of mechanical waves is a long-standing challenge for scientists and engineers, as numerous devices require their control. The current forefront of research in the control of classical waves has emerged from a seemingly unrelated field, namely, non-Hermitian quantum mechanics. By drawing analogies between this theory and those of classical systems, researchers have discovered phenomena that defy conventional intuition and have exploited them to control light, sound, and elastic waves. Here, we provide a brief perspective on recent developments, challenges and intricacies that distinguish non-Hermitian elastodynamics from optics and acoustics. We close this perspective with an outlook on potential directions such as topological phases in non-Hermitian elastodynamics and broken Hermitian symmetry in materials with electromomentum couplings.</description>

      <title>Chaos in undamped, forced oscillators via stroboscopic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-linear dynamics is not a usually covered topic in undergraduate physics courses. However, its importance within classical mechanics and the general theory of dynamical systems is unquestionable. In this work we show that this subject can be included in the schedule of an introductory classical mechanics course without the need to develop a robust theory of chaotic dynamics. To do this, we take as examples conservative non-linear oscillators subject to time-dependent periodic forces. By introducing the concept of stroboscopic maps we show that it is possible to visualize the appearance of chaos in these systems. We also address the example of the forced simple pendulum applying the same treatment. Finally, we briefly comment on the more general theory of chaos in conservative Hamiltonian systems.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity fields and parameter estimation from dielectric objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantitative phase image formation process is posed as a problem of parameter estimation from intensity measurements. This approach is inclusive of traditional pixel-oriented imaging, where the sought parameters are the pixel values. The resulting optimization process to find the parameters is then seen to depend on the Sensitivity Field: this is the gradient of the scattered field with respect to the parameters, and it turns out to obey a scattering relationship that is analogous to that of the original scattered field. Examples are given from several regimes of scattering strength.</description>

      <title>The Electric Force Between Two Straight Parallel Resistive Wires Carrying DC-Currents in the Asymptotic Limit of Infinitely Thin Wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the years 1948-2019 the ampere was defined via the magnetic force between two long thin parallel wires carrying stationary current. However, if a stationary current flows through a resistive wire, static electric charges appear on the surface of the wire, and this will lead to an additional electric force between the wires. This article discusses the ratio of electric over magnetic forces in the asymptotic limit of infinitely thin wires, which is not accessible by numerical methods. The electric force between the two wires depends also on the choice of the common ground node. For extremely thin or extremely long resistive wires the electric force dominates over the magnetic one.</description>

      <title>Effects of different loading on the bifurcation of annular elastic rods: theory vs. experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bifurcation problem of a circular Euler-Bernoulli rod subject to a uniform radial force distribution is investigated under three distinct loading conditions: (i.) hydrostatic pressure, (ii.) centrally-directed, and (iii.) dead load. Previous studies on this apparently 'familiar' structural problem have yielded controversial results, necessitating a comprehensive clarification. This study shows that results previously labelled as 'correct' or 'wrong' simply refer to different external constraints, whose presence becomes necessary only for the two latter loads, (ii.) and (iii.). Moreover, the paper presents the first experimental realization of a circular rod subjected to centrally-directed loads. The experimental findings align with the theoretical predictions and show the exploitation of a new type of load acting on a continuous structural element. The feasibility of this load is demonstrated through the use of inextensible cables and opens the way to applications in flexible robotics when cables are used for actuation.</description>

      <title>Playing Lato-lato is Difficult and This is Why</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lato-lato, a pendulum-based toy gaining popularity in Indonesian playgrounds, has sparked interest with competitions centered around maintaining its oscillatory motion. While some find it easy to play, the challenge lies in sustaining the oscillation, particularly in maintaining both "up and down collisions." Through a Newtonian dynamics numerical analysis using Python (code by ChatGPT), this study identifies two equilibrium phases - phase 1, characterized by normal pendulum motion, and phase 2, the double collision mode - by using the driven oscillation model. In addition, further analysis and discussion are done using the obtained numeric data. The difficulty in remaining in phase 2 highlights the intricate hand-eye coordination required, shedding light on the toy's appeal and the skill it demands.</description>

      <title>Machian fractons, Hamiltonian attractors and non-equilibrium steady states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $N$ fracton problem in classical mechanics, with fractons defined as point particles that conserve multipole moments up to a given order. We find that the nonlinear Machian dynamics of the fractons is characterized by late-time attractors in position-velocity space for all $N$, despite the absence of attractors in phase space dictated by Liouville's theorem. These attractors violate ergodicity and lead to non-equilibrium steady states, which always break translational symmetry, even in spatial dimensions where the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner-Coleman theorem for equilibrium systems forbids such breaking. While a full understanding of the many-body nonlinear problem is a formidable and incomplete task, we provide a conceptual understanding of our results using an adiabatic approximation for the late-time trajectories and an analogy with the idea of `order-by-disorder' borrowed from equilibrium statistical mechanics. Altogether, these fracton systems host a new paradigm for Hamiltonian dynamics and non-equilibrium many-body physics.</description>
