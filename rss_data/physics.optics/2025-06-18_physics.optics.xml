      <title>Simultaneous Charge Carrier Density Mapping of SiC Epilayers and Substrates with Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing demand for efficient power electronics, SiC-based devices are progressively becoming more relevant. In contrast to established methods such as the mercury capacitance-voltage technique, terahertz spectroscopy promises a contactless characterization. In this work, we simultaneously determine the charge carrier density of SiC epilayers and their substrates in a single measurement over a wide range of about 8x10^(15)$ cm^(-3) to 4x10^(18) cm^(-3) using time-domain spectroscopy in a reflection geometry. Furthermore, inhomogeneities in the samples are detected by mapping the determined charge carrier densities over the whole wafer. Additional theoretical calculations confirm these results and provide thickness-dependent information on the doping range of 4H-SiC, in which terahertz time-domain spectroscopy is capable of determining the charge carrier density.</description>

      <title>All-Angle Scanning Leaky-Wave Antennas and Surface-Wave Routing by Reconfigurable Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we show that propagating waves can be fully converted into surface waves and back using geometrically periodic arrays of simple electrically small metal elements loaded by adjustable reactive loads. The proposed approach allows the creation of all-angle scanning leaky-wave antennas with perfect or even superdirective aperture efficiency at all scan angles. Moreover, it is possible to co-design such leaky-wave antenna arrays with surface-wave waveguides that can guide the received power to the load or to another leaky-wave antenna section. That second section can either reradiate the received power into any direction or perform some other transformation of the reradiated wave front, for example, focusing the power at a point. These and other functionalities are realized by global optimization of the reactive loads of array elements. This global optimization, together with the use of arrays with a subwavelength geometrical period, allows proper control over both propagating and evanescent-field distributions, ensuring theoretically perfect performance at arbitrary scan angles. The proposed technique can be used in antenna engineering and in advanced designs of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces.</description>

      <title>Coupled micro-resonators for second-order integrated nonlinear optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate second-order nonlinear processes in a system of two coupled identical optical micro-resonators. The double resonance and phase-matching conditions are simultaneously obtained thanks to the frequency splitting induced by the resonator coupling. The analysis made in the framework of the coupled mode theory is applied to the second harmonic generation process in two whispering gallery mode microdisks made in III-V materials.</description>

      <title>Multi-timescale frequency-phase matching for high-yield nonlinear photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated nonlinear photonic technologies, even with state-of-the-art fabrication with only a few nanometer geometry variations, face significant challenges in achieving wafer-scale yield of functional devices. A core limitation lies in the fundamental constraints of energy and momentum conservation laws. Imposed by these laws, nonlinear processes are subject to stringent frequency and phase matching (FPM) conditions that cannot be satisfied across a full wafer without requiring a combination of precise device design and active tuning. Motivated by recent theoretical and experimental advances in integrated multi-timescale nonlinear systems, we revisit this long-standing limitation and introduce a fundamentally relaxed and passive framework: nested frequency-phase matching. As a prototypical implementation, we investigate on-chip multi-harmonic generation in a two-timescale lattice of commercially available silicon nitride (SiN) coupled ring resonators, which we directly compare with conventional single-timescale counterparts. We observe distinct and striking spatial and spectral signatures of nesting-enabled relaxation of FPM. Specifically, for the first time, we observe simultaneous fundamental, second, third, and fourth harmonic generation, remarkable 100 percent multi-functional device yield across the wafer, and ultra-broad harmonic bandwidths. Crucially, these advances are achieved without constrained geometries or active tuning, establishing a scalable foundation for nonlinear optics with broad implications for integrated frequency conversion and synchronization, self-referencing, metrology, squeezed light, and nonlinear optical computing.</description>

      <title>Integrated microheater on the 4H-silicon-carbide-on-insulator platform and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in the 4H-silicon-carbide-on-insulator (4H-SiCOI) platform has resulted in the demonstration of essential building blocks such as low-loss waveguides and microresonators. In this work, we add tunability to the 4H-SiCOI platform by integrating microheaters with compact microresonators. The strong thermo-optic effect in SiC enables a resonance tuning rate of $11.7$ pm/mW for a 36-$\mu$m-radius SiC microring, with a maximum wavelength shift up to $2.4$ nm (300 GHz). The thermal time constant of the microheater is estimated near 7 $\mu$s, corresponding to a 3-dB electrical bandwidth of 40 kHz. As a demonstration of potential applications, we employ the microheater to perform fast thermo-optic scans to deterministically access the single-soliton state of a 36-$\mu$m-radius microcomb source. In addition, an add-drop filter based on an over-coupled 18-$\mu$m-radius SiC microring is combined with the microcomb source for the selective filtering of individual comb lines, featuring an approximate 3-dB bandwidth of 5 GHz and an insertion loss of less than 1 dB. With such demonstrations, our work brings the much-needed tunability and reconfigurability to the 4H-SiCOI platform, paving the way for a wealth of chip-scale applications.</description>

      <title>Geometric spin Hall effect of spatiotemporal optical vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometric spin Hall effect of light (GSHEL), which is associated with nonzero transverse angular momentum, has been demonstrated to occur without the need for light-matter interaction and is characterized by a transverse shift. Recently, there has been a surge in research on spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOV) that carry pure transverse angular momentum. In this study, we examine the transverse shift of STOV in a tilted reference frame with respect to the optical axis. Through both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we establish a linear relationship between this shift and the topological charge. Our findings reveal that only "spatial STOV" exhibits a GSHEL shift, this phenomenon is contingent upon the spatial distribution of their angular momentum density. When present, the shift direction is consistently perpendicular to the angular momentum vector, and its magnitude is found to be inversely proportional to the cosine of the tilt angle. We explore a maximum shift value, which is proportional to $\sqrt{l{{x}_{0}}/{{k}_{0}}}$. These discoveries open up new avenues for the application in the realms of ultrafast optics and nanotechnology, offering a fresh perspective on the manipulation and measurement of light at the micro and nanoscales.</description>

      <title>Nano-resolved sensing of 3D electromagnetic fields via single emitters' extreme variation of enhanced spontaneous emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling quantum light-matter interactions at scales smaller than the diffraction limit at the single quantum emitter level is a critical challenge to the goal of advancing quantum technologies. We introduce a novel material platform that enables precise engineering of spontaneous emission changes in molecular single emitters through 3D nanofields. This platform is based on a 3D hollow plasmonic nanomaterial arranged in a square lattice, uniformly scalable to the centimeter scale while maintaining unit cell geometry. This coupled system leads to billions of Purcell-enhanced single emitters integrated into a nanodevice. Using far-field single-molecule super-resolution microscopy, we investigate emission modifications at the single-emitter level, enabling molecular position sensing with resolution surpassing the diffraction limit. By combining the nanolocalization with time correlation single photon counting, we probe molecule per molecule enhanced quantum light-matter interactions. This 3D plasmonic geometry significantly enhances light-matter interactions, revealing a broad range of lifetimes -- from nanoseconds to picoseconds -- significantly increasing the local density of states in a manner that depends on both molecular position and dipole orientation, offering extreme position sensitivity within the 3D electromagnetic landscape. By leveraging these plasmonic nanostructures and our method for measuring single-molecule Purcell-enhanced nano-resolved maps, we enable fine-tuned control of light-matter interactions. This approach enables the on-demand control of fast single-photon sources at room temperature, providing a powerful tool for molecular sensing and quantum applications at the single-emitter level.</description>

      <title>Miniaturized Chaos-assisted Spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational spectrometers are at the forefront of spectroscopy, promising portable, on-chip, or in-situ spectrum analysis through the integration of advanced computational techniques into optical systems. However, existing computational spectrometer systems have yet to fully exploit optical properties due to imperfect spectral responses, resulting in increased system complexity and compromised performance in resolution, bandwidth, and footprint. In this study, we introduce optical chaos into spectrum manipulation via cavity deformation, leveraging high spatial and spectral complexities to address this challenge. By utilizing a single chaotic cavity, we achieve high diversity in spectra, facilitating channel decorrelation of 10 pm and ensuring optimal reconstruction over 100 nm within an ultra-compact footprint of 20*22 um2 as well as an ultra-low power consumption of 16.5 mW. Our approach not only enables state-of-the-art on-chip spectrometer performance in resolution-bandwidth-footprint metric, but also has the potential to revolutionize the entire computational spectrometer ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Optical spin-orbit interaction induced by magnetic textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrary to the optical spin angular momentum (SAM), the role played by the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light in magneto-optics remains largely unexplored. However, the SAM and OAM are known to be coupled when light interacts with non-homogeneous and non-isotropic materials. Here we predict that the OAM carried by each photon in a light beam is modified upon reflection on magnetic textures like skyrmions, and that the sign of this variation is governed by the SAM of the incident field. Our predictions can be readily tested by performing circular dichroism measurements, and may provide new routes to shape light's angular momentum with magnetism.</description>

      <title>Optical Control of Fluorescence Spatial Hole Burning Effect in Monolayer WS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doping plays a crucial role in both electrical and optical properties of semiconductors. In this work, we report observation, as well as optical control, of fluorescence spatial hole burning effect in monolayer WS2. We demonstrate that the pronounced exciton-exciton annihilation process, in combination with the efficient capture of holes by intrinsic sulfur vacancy defects, induces significant photo-doping effect and eventually leads to fluorescence spatial hole burning. By means of a dual-beam pumping fluorescence imaging technique, we reveal that the recovery process of the spatial hole burning effect exhibits a double-exponential behavior. The fast recovery process originates from the release of trapped holes under the illumination of the probe beam, while the slow process corresponds to the re-adsorption of electronegative gas molecules. Surprisingly, our results demonstrate that the electronegative sulfur vacancies can achieve ultralong-term storage of holes. Moreover, both the release and the rate of release of holes can be fully controlled by laser irradiation. These findings demonstrate the great potential of transition metal dichalcogenides in the development of optically-control excitonic devices.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of lasers with complex spatio-temporal dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization is among the most fascinating dynamical behaviors through which oscillators like lasers align their temporal dynamics under weak coupling. So far, experimental studies have been restricted to lasers exhibiting structured temporal dynamics, such as periodic, mode-locked, or chaotic regimes, the latter usually induced by feedback or optical injection. We now successfully achieve synchronization of two spatially extended lasers with intrinsically chaotic dynamics. We observe synchronization when a dominant transverse mode of the master laser becomes spectrally aligned with a mode of the slave, without requiring matching between the spatial field profiles. Several dynamical regimes are identified, including synchronization of fast chaotic fluctuations and low-frequency polarization hopping, along with switching between normal and inverse synchronization. These results show that the presence of complex dynamics in space and time does not hinder synchronization; instead, it enables a variety of synchronization regimes. Our findings offer new insights into how multimode chaotic lasers can self-organize through weak coupling, highlighting the role of spectral alignment and dominant modes in the emergence of synchronized behavior. In addition, synchronizing lasers that are chaotic without feedback enables simpler and more compact systems in view of applications such as physical cryptography or optical computing.</description>

      <title>An effective microscopic model for plasmonic sensing of malaria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An effective microscopic model for plasmonic sensing is developed and studied in this work. The model is applied to a reference sensor made from a plasmonic metasurface comprised of an array of nanoholes 150 nm in diameter patterned in a 150 nm thick gold film. The sensor is functionalized to detect plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH), a malaria biomarker. The biochemistry above the sensor's metasurface is modelled as stacks of closely packed adlayers. Using the Maxwell Garnett effective medium theory we link the refractive index of the pLDH biomarker adsorbed layer to the bulk concentration of the biomarker in the buffer. The effective microscopic model we then develop accounts for the combined optical properties of the biochemistry matrix, bound pLDH, and the buffer medium. By simulating the sensor using the finite element method and an approximate analytical method, the effective model allows us to determine the sensor response, predict binding interactions, and quantify concentration changes on the sensor surface. We calculate the sensor sensitivity for the reference sensor and the theoretical limit of detection (LOD) based on spectral and transmission sensing interrogation. The lowest LOD calculated based on the model is 0.02 nM of pLDH, equivalent to 0.70 ng/mL. The effective model is quite general and could be applied to other types of plasmonic biosensors and biomarkers of different diseases. It may therefore aid in the design of new optical biosensors with improved performance.</description>

      <title>Efficient, inverse gigavoxel-scale optimization of diffractive lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalable photonic optimization holds the promise of significantly enhancing the performance of diffractive lenses across a wide range of photonic applications. However, the high computational cost of conventional electromagnetic solvers has thus far limited design domains to only a few tens of micrometers. Here, we overcome this limitation by integrating the convergent Born series with the adjoint-field optimization framework, enabling inverse design over a $110 \times 110 \times 46\ \mu\text{m}^3$ volume$-$corresponding to 1.01 gigavoxels$-$using a single, cost-effective graphics card. The optimized lens achieves a 9% improvement in axial resolution and a 20% increase in focusing efficiency compared to a standard Fresnel lens of identical diameter and numerical aperture. These gains point to immediate application opportunities for optimizing high-performance microscopy, photolithography, and optical trapping systems using modest computational resources.</description>

      <title>Near-field optical mode engineering-enabled freeform nonlocal metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanophotonic technologies inherently rely on tailoring light-matter interactions through the excitation and interference of deeply confined optical resonances. However, existing concepts in optical mode engineering remain heuristic and are challenging to extend towards complex and multi-functional resonant phenomena. Here, we introduce an inverse design framework that optimizes near-field distributions, ideally suited to tailor Mie-type modes within dielectric nanophotonic structures, and we demonstrate its powerful opportunities to facilitate the discovery of new classes of nonlocal metasurfaces. We show that freeform nonlocal metasurfaces supporting accidental bound states in the continuum can be readily optimized to tackle tailored illumination conditions, modal properties and quality factors. We further extend our approach to multifunctional and multipolar mode engineering, and experimentally demonstrate freeform planar nonlocal multi-wavelength and chiral metasurfaces. Our versatile and robust framework for freeform mode engineering has applications in a broad range of high quality-factor metasurface platforms relevant to sensing, nonlinear optics, optomechanics and quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: Using the illuminator for high numerical aperture (NA) extreme ultraviolet (EUV) exposure tool in EUV lithography can lead to support volume production of sub-2 nm logic nodes and leading-edge DRAM nodes. However, the typical design method of the illuminator has issues with the transmission owing to the limitation of optical structure that cannot further reduce process parameter k1, and uniformity due to the restriction of matching method that can only consider one factor affecting uniformity. The all-facet illuminator can improve transmission by removing relay system. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) can improve the uniformity by considering multiple factors. In this paper, a design method of the all-facet illuminator for high NA EUV lithography exposure tool and a matching method based on deep RL for the double facets are proposed. The all-facet illuminator is designed using matrix optics, and removing relay system to achieve high transmission. The double facets is matched using the deep RL framework, which includes the policy network with improved trainability and low computational demands, and the reward function with great optimization direction and fast convergence rate, enabling to rapidly generate multiple matching results with high uniformity. An all-facet illuminator for a 0.55 NA EUV lithography exposure tool is designed by the proposed method. Simulation results indicate that the transmission is greater than 35%, and uniformity exceed 99% under multiple illumination pupil shapes.</description>

      <title>Enhanced vibrational optical activity by near-zero index chiral effective media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enhancement of the inherently weak optical activity of solvated molecules by superchiral fields, crucial for detecting their chirality, is a research frontier of photonics and the basis of novel chiroptical detection schemes. Here, we show that an effective medium consisting of randomly dispersed metal-based nanoparticles embedded within an optically active solvated drug (aqueous reparixin) can enhance vibrational optical rotation and circular dichroism thanks to superchirality produced by slow light in near-zero index conditions. We evaluate from first principles the effective bianisotropic response of the bulk chiral effective medium, showing that, by adjusting the nanoparticles filling fraction, vibrational optical activity is greatly enhanced by a factor $\simeq 10^2-10^3$ at the near-zero index resonance. Our results are relevant for the development of innovative devices capable of detecting the chirality of low-volume samples, with applications in quantum chemistry and nanomedicine.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating Superresolution in Radar Range Estimation Using a Denoising Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply machine learning methods to demonstrate range superresolution in remote sensing radar detection. Specifically, we implement a denoising autoencoder to estimate the distance between two equal intensity scatterers in the subwavelength regime. The machine learning models are trained on waveforms subject to a bandlimit constraint such that ranges much smaller than the inverse bandlimit are optimized in their precision. The autoencoder achieves effective dimensionality reduction, with the bottleneck layer exhibiting a strong and consistent correlation with the true scatterer separation. We confirm reproducibility across different training sessions and network initializations by analyzing the scaled encoder outputs and their robustness to noise. We investigate the behavior of the bottleneck layer for the following types of pulses: a traditional sinc pulse, a bandlimited triangle-type pulse, and a theoretically near-optimal pulse created from a spherical Bessel function basis. The Bessel signal performs best, followed by the triangle wave, with the sinc signal performing worst, highlighting the crucial role of signal design in the success of machine-learning-based range resolution.</description>

      <title>First Steps Toward the Development of a Straight-Line Reference Alignment System for Future Accelerators at CERN Using Pseudo-Nondiffracting Layer Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents experimental results that allow for the performance evaluation of a straight-line reference alignment system based on pseudo-nondiffracting Layer beams. Sensors, developed specifically for this system, feature four linear CMOS chips and a square aperture. This allows for simultaneous measurements along the beam path without disrupting the laser reference. Measurements, conducted over a distance of 2 m from the first to the last sensor, were compared with a laser tracker measurement to assess the sensor performance. The alignment reference generated by the Layer Beams exhibited a repeatability and reproducibility root-mean-square error (RMSE) of less than 30 ${\mu}$m. The relative alignment precision for a known displacement was validated with a standard deviation of 4.3 ${\mu}$m. The results highlight the underlying sources of noise, which are induced mainly by the cover glass, the protective film of the pixels, and the dark noise of the CMOS chips. Solutions to address these challenges are proposed. Additionally, a proof-of-concept for future development of a radiation-hard sensor utilizing optical fiber matrices is demonstrated. The RMSE of the reference position detection introduced by the fiber matrix remained below 1.3 ${\mu}$m. This would allow the sensor to be used reliably in high-radiation environments typical for accelerator facilities. This study serves as a foundational step toward developing a robust straight-line reference alignment system based on pseudo-nondiffracting Layer beams intended for deployment in the accelerator facilities.</description>

      <title>Young TIM: A wave-optics simulator with slightly special powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave optics is a prominent part of the undergraduate physics curriculum, and many undergraduate labs contain experiments on wave optics. In our 3rd-year undergraduate lab, we run numerical simulations alongside the experiments (and when pandemic restrictions did not allow students into the lab, those simulations replaced some experiments). We use Young TIM, an interactive wave-optics simulator designed to be a research tool that can also be used for the dissemination of our research and for education. It has novel and unique features, including the ability to create an anaglyph of the beam as it would be seen in 3D by a binocular, probably misguided, observer staring into the beam. Here we describe how to use Young TIM, and we describe several possible numerical experiments suitable for undergraduate teaching.</description>

      <title>Time-bin encoded quantum key distribution over 120 km with a telecom quantum dot source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) with deterministic single photon sources has been demonstrated over intercity fiber and free-space channels. The previous implementations relied mainly on polarization encoding schemes, which are susceptible to birefringence, polarization-mode dispersion and polarization-dependent loss in practical fiber networks. In contrast, time-bin encoding offers inherent robustness and has been widely adopted in mature QKD systems using weak coherent laser pulses. However, its feasibility in conjunction with a deterministic single-photon source has not yet been experimentally demonstrated. In this work, we construct a time-bin encoded QKD system employing a high-brightness quantum dot (QD) single-photon source operating at telecom wavelength. Our proof-of-concept experiment successfully demonstrates the possibility of secure key distribution over fiber link of 120 km, while maintaining extraordinary long-term stability over 6 hours of continuous operation. This work provides the first experimental validation of integrating a quantum dot single-photon source with time-bin encoding in a telecom-band QKD system. In addition, it demonstrates the highest secure key rate among the time-bin QKDs based on single-photon sources. This development signifies a substantial advancement in the establishment of a robust and scalable QKD network based on solid-state single-photon technology</description>

      <title>Observation of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universal scaling in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equilibrium and nonequilibrium states of matter can exhibit fundamentally different behavior. A key example is the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in two spatial dimensions (2D KPZ), where microscopic deviations from equilibrium give rise to macroscopic scaling laws without equilibrium counterparts. While extensively studied theoretically, direct experimental evidence of 2D KPZ scaling has remained limited to interface growth so far. Here, we report the observation of universal scaling consistent with the KPZ universality class in 2D exciton-polariton condensates -- quantum fluids of light that are inherently driven and dissipative, thus breaking equilibrium conditions. Using momentum-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy as well as space- and time-resolved interferometry, we probe the phase correlations across microscopically different systems, varying drive conditions in two distinct lattice geometries. Our analysis reveals correlation dynamics and scaling exponents in excellent agreement with 2D KPZ predictions. These results establish exciton-polariton condensates as a robust experimental platform for exploring 2D nonequilibrium universality quantitatively, and open new avenues for investigating the emergence of coherence in interacting quantum systems far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Fingerprints Unlocked: Room-Temperature Single-Particle Polarized Spectroscopy Reveals Complete Symmetry Landscape in Rare-Earth Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The point group symmetry of luminescent centers-such as defects, impurities, and dopant ions-fundamentally determines optical transition characteristics, underpinning advances in materials science and optoelectronics. Conventional low-temperature spectroscopy assesses such symmetry through the splitting of optical transitions, yet lacks sensitivity to key vectorial features such as symmetry axis orientations. Here, we introduce a single-particle approach that integrates computational electromagnetism with polarization-resolved microspectroscopy at room temperature, enabling unambiguous mapping of transition dipole orientations from a single magnetic optical transition and thus direct determination of point group symmetry in rare-earth-doped microcrystals. This technique also reveals spontaneous symmetry breaking in chiral space groups during crystallization, giving rise to intrinsic single-particle optical chirality. Leveraging these symmetry insights, we establish a practical protocol for optically polarized sensing of the three-dimensional orientation (3D) of rare-earth-doped single particles in cellular environments. Our method uncovers both the vectorial point group symmetry of rare-earth ions and the chiral nature of the crystal-a level of structural information unattainable by conventional spectroscopic or crystallographic techniques. By bridging microscopic symmetry with macroscopic functionality, this work enables quantitative evaluation of the Forster dipole orientation factor (k2) for rational donor-acceptor design, and lays the foundation for next-generation energy transfer systems, ultra-bright rare-earth nanocrystals, nanophotonic materials, and real-time single-particle sensing in biological contexts.</description>

      <title>Universal Kerr-thermal dynamics of self-injection-locked microresonator dark pulses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microcombs, formed in optical microresonators driven by continuous-wave lasers, are miniaturized optical frequency combs. Leveraging integrated photonics and laser self-injection locking (SIL), compact microcombs can be constructed via hybrid integration of a semiconductor laser with a chip-based microresonator. While the current linear SIL theory has successfully addressed the linear coupling between the laser cavity and the external microresonator, it fails to describe the complicated nonlinear processes, especially for dark-pulse microcomb formation. Here, we investigate -- theoretically, numerically and experimentally -- the Kerr-thermal dynamics of a semiconductor laser self-injection-locked to an integrated silicon nitride microresonator. We unveil intriguing yet universal dark-pulse formation and switching behaviour with discrete steps, and establish a theoretical model scrutinizing the synergy of laser-microresonator mutual coupling, Kerr nonlinearity and photo-thermal effect. Numerical simulation confirms the experimental result and identifies the origins. Exploiting this unique phenomenon, we showcase an application on low-noise photonic microwave generation with phase noise purified by 23.5 dB. Our study not only adds critical insight of pulse formation in laser-microresonator hybrid systems, but also enables all-passive, photonic-chip-based microwave oscillators with high spectral purity.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate harmonic mode-locking in a semiconductor VCSEL using polarization-controlled delayed feedback. By integrating a rotatable $\lambda$/2-plate within an external cavity, we achieve precise control over pulse multiplicity and repetition rates in TE and TM modes. For the TE mode, increasing the $\lambda$/2-plate angle ($\theta$) transitions the system from disordered quasi-periodic states to stable fundamental (single-pulse) and harmonic dual-pulse mode-locking. Polarization-resolved measurements and cross-correlation analyses reveal coherent pulse alignment at half the cavity roundtrip time, enabled by polarization-mediated nonlinear dynamics. This work establishes cross-polarization feedback as a fundamental mechanism for ultrafast pulse engineering, advancing the understanding of polarization-mediated nonlinear dynamics in laser physics.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Electron Temperature Dynamics in Spintronic Terahertz Emitters Studied by Optical-Pump Terahertz-Probe Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spintronic terahertz emitters pumped by femtosecond lasers offer an increasingly popular approach to generate broadband terahertz radiation. The strength of the emitted terahertz field is limited in part by the optical damage threshold at the pump wavelength of the spintronic terahertz emitter. Their thermal management can be improved by better understanding the electron temperature relaxation in the spintronic metal layer. Here we present a measurement of the electron temperature dynamics on a picosecond timescale using optical-pump terahertz-probe spectroscopy. We observe that the optical pump induces a change in the terahertz transmission of the spintronic terahertz emitter. By measuring the resulting terahertz signal and employing a two-temperature model, we are able to calculate the dynamic electron temperature of the STE. This approach offers an advantage over other methods by avoiding additional heating of the sample by the probe pulse. This is especially significant for measurements of accumulative heat effects, which can dominate the optical damage mechanism when the spintronic terahertz emitter is pumped at a MHz repetition rate.</description>

      <title>When do molecular polaritons behave like optical filters?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review outlines several linear optical effects featured by molecular polaritons arising in the collective strong light-matter coupling regime. Under weak laser irradiation and when the single-molecule light-matter coupling can be neglected (often in the limit when the number of molecules per photon mode is large), we show that the excited-state molecular dynamics under collective strong coupling can be exactly replicated without the cavity using a shaped (or ``filtered'') laser, whose field amplitude is enhanced by the cavity quality factor, shining on the bare molecules. As a consequence, the absorption within a cavity can be understood as the overlap between the polariton transmission and the bare molecular absorption, suggesting that polaritons act in part as optical filters. This framework demystifies and provides a straightforward explanation for a large class of experiments and theoretical models in molecular polaritonics, highlighting that the same effects can be achieved without the cavity with shaped laser pulses. With a few modifications, this simple conceptual picture can also be adapted to understand the incoherent nonlinear response of polaritonic systems. This review establishes a clear distinction between polaritonic phenomena that can be fully explained through classical linear optics and those that require a quantum electrodynamics approach. It also highlights the need to differentiate between effects that necessitate polaritons (i.e., hybrid light-matter states) and those that can occur in the weak coupling regime. We further discuss that certain quantum optical effects like fluorescence can be partially described as optical filtering, whereas some others like cavity-induced Raman scattering go beyond this. Further exploration in these areas is needed to uncover novel polaritonic phenomena beyond optical filtering.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength thermometry without a priori emissivity information: from promise to disillusionment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infrared (IR) thermography provides 2D radiance maps of the IR radiation leaving the surfaces of a scene, based on preliminary calibration. Then, to convert radiance maps into temperature maps, we need to know the emissivity of each element of the scene conjugated to each of the detector elements in the camera's focal plane. Compared to the single-band approach, can multispectral thermography help solve the inverse temperature-emissivity separation problem? Multiwavelength thermometry (MWT) is known to be an underdetermined problem having a continuous infinity of solutions. For this reason, and right from the origin of MWT, it appeared necessary to introduce information on emissivity to assess temperature, for example, by means of an analytical model. Overlooking these recommendations, a number of papers appeared in the early 2000s exploring the idea that we could do without any a priori knowledge of emissivity. Growth became exponential from 2020 onward, with the allegedly successful application of neural networks, genetic algorithms, and other novel optimization methods. The aim of the present work is to recall the consequences of MWT as an underdetermined inverse problem, to highlight the errors made by ignoring them, and to bring us back to harsh reality: we must introduce information on emissivity in order to evaluate temperature accurately. Furthermore, this information has to be fully consistent with the true spectral emissivity. To this end, we propose a new method for optimal selection of the emissivity model. A series of blind tests was set up to benchmark different inversion algorithms. The results confirm the failure of the temperature-emissivity separation when no emissivity information is available, despite the multiwavelength approach, which in any case comes as no surprise.</description>
