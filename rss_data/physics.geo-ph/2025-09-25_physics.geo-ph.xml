      <title>Velocity model building from seismic images using a Convolutional Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of building a high-resolution velocity model using machine learning is hampered by generalization limitations that often limit the success of the approach on field data. This is especially true when relying on neural operators for the mapping. Thus, we propose a novel inversion framework that relies on learning to map the velocity model to a seismic image using a Convolutional Neural Operator (CNO), and then we use optimization to invert for the velocity that matches the image. The key to the success of our network is that we use the initial and true velocity models as input in the training, then we invert for the true velocity starting from the initial velocity at inference. Specifically, we first train a neural operator to accurately learn the forward mapping from seismic velocity models to RTM images, using synthetic datasets that include high-frequency structural information. Once trained, the neural operator is embedded into an inversion loop, where its differentiable nature enables efficient gradient computation via automatic differentiation. This allows us to progressively inject high-wavenumber information from RTM images into the background velocity model, thereby improving resolution without the need for traditional adjoint-state solvers. The proposed framework is validated on both synthetic and field data. Results demonstrate that the neural operator generalizes well to real seismic scenarios, maintains high inversion accuracy, and significantly reduces computational cost. This work highlights the potential of neural operators as flexible and scalable tools for efficient, data-driven seismic imaging and inversion.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Atmospheric Super-Resolution With Deep Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion modeling is a generative machine learning algorithm that can be used to sample from complex distributions. They achieve this by learning a score function, i.e., the gradient of the log-probability density of the data, and reversing a noising process using the same. Once trained, score-based diffusion models not only generate new samples but also enable zero-shot conditioning of the generated samples on observed data. This promises a novel paradigm for data and model fusion, wherein the implicitly learned distributions of pretrained score-based diffusion models can be updated given the availability of online data in a Bayesian formulation. In this article, we apply such a concept to the super-resolution of a high-dimensional dynamical system, given the real-time availability of low-resolution and experimentally observed sparse sensor measurements from multimodal data. Additional analysis on how score-based sampling can be used for uncertainty estimates is also provided. Our experiments are performed for a super-resolution task that generates the ERA5 atmospheric dataset given sparse observations from a coarse-grained representation of the same and/or from unstructured experimental observations of the IGRA radiosonde dataset. We demonstrate accurate recovery of the high dimensional state given multiple sources of low-fidelity measurements. We also discover that the generative model can balance the influence of multiple dataset modalities during spatiotemporal reconstructions.</description>

      <title>Diffusion models for multivariate subsurface generation and efficient probabilistic inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15809</link>

Abstract: Diffusion models offer stable training and state-of-the-art performance for deep generative modeling tasks. Here, we consider their use in the context of multivariate subsurface modeling and probabilistic inversion. We first demonstrate that diffusion models enhance multivariate modeling capabilities compared to variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. In diffusion modeling, the generative process involves a comparatively large number of time steps with update rules that can be modified to account for conditioning data. We propose different corrections to the popular Diffusion Posterior Sampling approach by Chung et al. (2023). In particular, we introduce a likelihood approximation accounting for the noise-contamination that is inherent in diffusion modeling. We assess performance in a multivariate geological scenario involving facies and correlated acoustic impedance. Conditional modeling is demonstrated using both local hard data (well logs) and nonlinear geophysics (fullstack seismic data). Our tests show significantly improved statistical robustness, enhanced sampling of the posterior probability density function and reduced computational costs, compared to the original approach. The method can be used with both hard and indirect conditioning data, individually or simultaneously. As the inversion is included within the diffusion process, it is faster than other methods requiring an outer-loop around the generative model, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo.</description>
