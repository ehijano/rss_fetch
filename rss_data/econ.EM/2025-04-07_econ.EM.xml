      <title>Weak instrumental variables due to nonlinearities in panel data: A Super Learner Control Function estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A triangular structural panel data model with additive separable individual-specific effects is used to model the causal effect of a covariate on an outcome variable when there are unobservable confounders with some of them time-invariant. In this setup, a linear reduced-form equation might be problematic when the conditional mean of the endogenous covariate and the instrumental variables is nonlinear. The reason is that ignoring the nonlinearity could lead to weak instruments As a solution, we propose a triangular simultaneous equation model for panel data with additive separable individual-specific fixed effects composed of a linear structural equation with a nonlinear reduced form equation. The parameter of interest is the structural parameter of the endogenous variable. The identification of this parameter is obtained under the assumption of available exclusion restrictions and using a control function approach. Estimating the parameter of interest is done using an estimator that we call Super Learner Control Function estimator (SLCFE). The estimation procedure is composed of two main steps and sample splitting. We estimate the control function using a super learner using sample splitting. In the following step, we use the estimated control function to control for endogeneity in the structural equation. Sample splitting is done across the individual dimension. We perform a Monte Carlo simulation to test the performance of the estimators proposed. We conclude that the Super Learner Control Function Estimators significantly outperform Within 2SLS estimators.</description>

      <title>Flatness-Robust Critical Bandwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Critical bandwidth (CB) is used to test the multimodality of densities and regression functions, as well as for clustering methods. CB tests are known to be inconsistent if the function of interest is constant ("flat") over even a small interval, and to suffer from low power and incorrect size in finite samples if the function has a relatively small derivative over an interval. This paper proposes a solution, flatness-robust CB (FRCB), that exploits the novel observation that the inconsistency manifests only from regions consistent with the null hypothesis, and thus identifying and excluding them does not alter the null or alternative sets. I provide sufficient conditions for consistency of FRCB, and simulations of a test of regression monotonicity demonstrate the finite-sample properties of FRCB compared with CB for various regression functions. Surprisingly, FRCB performs better than CB in some cases where there are no flat regions, which can be explained by FRCB essentially giving more importance to parts of the function where there are larger violations of the null hypothesis. I illustrate the usefulness of FRCB with an empirical analysis of the monotonicity of the conditional mean function of radiocarbon age with respect to calendar age.</description>

      <title>Does regional variation in wage levels identify the effects of a national minimum wage?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01284v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the validity of estimators that exploit regional wage differences to study the effects of a national minimum wage. It shows that variations of the ``fraction affected'' and ``effective minimum wage'' designs are vulnerable to bias from measurement error and functional form misspecification, even when standard identification assumptions hold, and that small deviations from these assumptions can substantially amplify the biases. Using simulation exercises and a case study of Brazil's minimum wage increase, the paper illustrates the practical relevance of these issues and assesses the performance of potential solutions and diagnostic tools.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Targeted Factor Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a probabilistic variant of Partial Least Squares (PLS) we call Probabilistic Targeted Factor Analysis (PTFA), which can be used to extract common factors in predictors that are useful to predict a set of predetermined target variables. Along with the technique, we provide an efficient expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to learn the parameters and forecast the targets of interest. We develop a number of extensions to missing-at-random data, stochastic volatility, and mixed-frequency data for real-time forecasting. In a simulation exercise, we show that PTFA outperforms PLS at recovering the common underlying factors affecting both features and target variables delivering better in-sample fit, and providing valid forecasts under contamination such as measurement error or outliers. Finally, we provide two applications in Economics and Finance where PTFA performs competitively compared with PLS and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) at out-of-sample forecasting.</description>

      <title>A New Design-Based Variance Estimator for Finely Stratified Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of design-based inference for the average treatment effect in finely stratified experiments. Here, by "design-based'' we mean that the only source of uncertainty stems from the randomness in treatment assignment; by "finely stratified'' we mean units are first stratified into groups of size k according to baseline covariates and then, within each group, a fixed number l &lt; k are assigned uniformly at random to treatment and the remainder to control. In this setting, we first show under mild conditions that inference using the difference-in-means estimator requires an estimator of its variance that is at least asymptotically upward-biased. We then present a novel estimator of the variance and show that it is upward-biased; furthermore, the magnitude of the bias depends in a natural way on the quality of the stratification. Importantly, this estimator remains well-defined even in the setting in which l = 1 or k - l = 1. We then compare our estimator with some well-known estimators that have been proposed previously for this case. We first show that, while these estimators are also upward-biased, the magnitude of their bias does not change in the natural way with the quality of stratification. To further discriminate among these estimators, we introduce a framework motivated by a thought experiment in which the finite population can be modeled as having been drawn once in an i.i.d. fashion from a well-behaved probability distribution. In this framework, we argue that our estimator dominates the others in terms of limiting bias, and that these improvements are strict except under exceptionally strong restrictions on the treatment effects. Finally, we illustrate our theoretical results through a simulation study, which reveals that our estimator can lead to substantially more precise inferences, especially when the quality of stratification is high.</description>

      <title>Latent Gaussian dynamic factor modeling and forecasting for multivariate count time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work considers estimation and forecasting in a multivariate, possibly high-dimensional count time series model constructed from a transformation of a latent Gaussian dynamic factor series. The estimation of the latent model parameters is based on second-order properties of the count and underlying Gaussian time series, yielding estimators of the underlying covariance matrices for which standard principal component analysis applies. Theoretical consistency results are established for the proposed estimation, building on certain concentration results for the models of the type considered. They also involve the memory of the latent Gaussian process, quantified through a spectral gap, shown to be suitably bounded as the model dimension increases, which is of independent interest. In addition, novel cross-validation schemes are suggested for model selection. The forecasting is carried out through a particle-based sequential Monte Carlo, leveraging Kalman filtering techniques. A simulation study and an application are also considered.</description>
