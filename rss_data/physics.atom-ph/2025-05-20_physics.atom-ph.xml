      <title>A cryogenic buffer gas beam source with in-situ ablation target replacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design and performance of a cryogenic buffer gas beam (CBGB) source with a load-lock system is presented. The ACME III electron electric dipole moment (eEDM) search experiment uses this source to produce a beam of cold, slow thorium monoxide (ThO) molecules. A key feature of the apparatus is its capability to replace ablation targets without interrupting vacuum or cryogenic conditions, increasing the average signal in the eEDM search. The source produces approximately $1.3 \times 10^{11}$ ground-state ThO molecules per pulse, with a rotational temperature of $4.8$ K, molecular beam solid angle of $0.31$ sr, and forward velocity of $200$ m/s. These parameters match the performance of traditional sources that require time-consuming thermal cycles for target replacement. A long-term yield improvement of about 40% is achieved when the load-lock system is used to replace targets biweekly.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Benchmarking Platform for Deep Generative Models in Molecular Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of novel pharmaceuticals represents a significant challenge in modern science, with substantial costs and time investments. Deep generative models have emerged as promising tools for accelerating drug discovery by efficiently exploring the vast chemical space. However, this rapidly evolving field lacks standardized evaluation protocols, impeding fair comparison between approaches. This research presents an extensive analysis of the Molecular Sets (MOSES) platform, a comprehensive benchmarking framework designed to standardize evaluation of deep generative models in molecular design. Through rigorous assessment of multiple generative architectures, including recurrent neural networks, variational autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks, we examine their capabilities in generating valid, unique, and novel molecular structures while maintaining specific chemical properties. Our findings reveal that different architectures exhibit complementary strengths across various metrics, highlighting the complex trade-offs between exploration and exploitation in chemical space. This study provides detailed insights into the current state of the art in molecular generation and establishes a foundation for future advancements in AI-driven drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Photonic Networking of Quantum Memories in High-Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum networking enables the exchange of quantum information between physically separated quantum systems, which has applications ranging from quantum computing to unconditionally secure communication. Such quantum information is generally represented by two-level quantum systems or qubits. Here, we demonstrate a quantum network of high-dimensional (HD) quantum memories or ``qudits" stored in individual atoms. The interference and detection of HD time-bin encoded single photons emitted from atomic qudit memories heralds maximally-entangled Bell states across pairs of atomic qudit levels. This approach expands the quantum information capacity of a quantum network while improving the entanglement success fraction beyond the standard 50\% limit of qubit-based measurement protocols.</description>

      <title>Spin manipulation and nuclear polarization enhancement in particle beams with static magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theoretical study of spin dynamics in non-relativistic particle beams with interacting angular momenta traversing static, spatially varying magnetic fields is presented. The computational framework evaluates sinusoidal magnetic field configurations, calculating key observables such as average spin projections and state populations during the interaction. It is demonstrated that such fields can effectively enhance nuclear polarization in partially, incoherently polarized hydrogen and deuterium atomic beams, as well as coherently rotationally state-selected hydrogen deuteride molecular beams. This enhancement is attributed to transitions induced within the hyperfine regime of these systems. The study spans frequency ranges from GHz scales for atoms to hundreds of kHz for molecules, corresponding to magnetic field variations on spatial scales from submillimeters to meters.</description>

      <title>From Quantum Indistinguishability to Classical Distinguishability: Statistics and Measurement of Two-Particle Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an experimental scheme to probe the quantum statistics of two identical particles. The transition between the quantum and classical statistics of two identical particles is described by the particles having identical multiple internal energy levels. We show that effective distinguishability emerges as the thermal energy increases with respect to the energy level spacing, and the mesoscopic regime bridges quantum indistinguishability and classical distinguishability. A realistic experimental approach is proposed using a two-particle interferometer, where the particles reach statistical equilibrium before the two-particle distribution is measured. The unitarity of the scattering/separation process ensures the preservation of the equilibrium distribution and allows a direct measurement of the two-particle statistical distribution. Our results show the transition between quantum and classical behavior of the two-particle distribution, which can be directly probed by a realistic experiment.</description>

      <title>Exponential enhancement of sensitivity in Ramsey interferometry with optically thick ensemble of atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ramsey interferometry is a cornerstone technique for precise measurement of time and frequency in modern clocks. The Ramsey experiments are typically done in optically dilute samples of atoms to improve homogeneity and avoid back-action of atoms on excitation pulses. In contrast to later belief, we predict and experimentally show that in optically thick samples with inhomogeneous broadening of resonant transition, the back-action can lead to the highly enhanced narrowing of Ramsey resonance. The linewidth narrowing and corresponding precision of the frequency measurement scale exponentially with an increase in optical depth of a sample and can reach the limits set by homogeneous broadening. We show that this effect is caused by a nonlinear interference of multiple echoes formed inside the atomic medium, which is experimentally confirmed with $^{167}\text{Er}^{3+}$ ions in $\text{Y}_2\text{SiO}_5$ crystal. Our findings open new opportunities for nonlinear high-resolution spectroscopy of resonant media and sensitivity enhancement in a new generation of solid state clocks.</description>

      <title>Unraveling superradiance: entanglement and mutual information in collective decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the collective decay of an initially inverted ensemble of two-level emitters into a squeezed photonic reservoir. By using a quantum-state diffusion approach to unravel the emission process, we investigate entanglement and classical correlations along individual quantum trajectories over time. This numerical analysis shows that despite an accelerated initial build-up of entanglement and a significant amount of spin squeezing in the steady state, the essential features of the superradiant burst are well described by averages over fully factorizable states. We explain this observation in terms of an almost complete factorization of all 2-local observables, which we identify as a generic property of superradiant decay. Based on this insight, we provide a purely classical theory for the burst in squeezed superradiance, which is both intuitive and exact for a large number of emitters. Moreover, we show that our numerical approach is also applicable for the investigation of subradiant states, which dominate the slow residual decay of non-uniform ensembles at very long times.</description>

      <title>Light-controlled strong coupling of optical cavity modes spaced by 200 THz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cavities have driven significant advances in optical physics and quantum science, with applications ranging from lasers and spectroscopy to quantum information processing, simulation and metrology. For standard optical cavities, each eigenmode corresponds to a single, well-defined frequency. Here, we present a macroscopic optical Fabry-P\'erot cavity whose eigenmodes are coherent superpositions of two frequency modes in the VIS-NIR range. Specifically, we demonstrate strong coupling between 384 THz (780 nm) and 580 THz (516 nm) cavity modes by incorporating an intracavity $\chi^{(2)}$ crystal driven by a non-resonant optical pump at 1529 nm. Strong coupling enables us to demonstrate frequency conversion with an end-to-end, free-space conversion efficiency of 30(1)%, limited by current cavity design and internal cavity losses. We also demonstrate coupling between distinct spatial modes at the two frequencies, extending coherent control to the spatial basis. In conjunction with improved resonator design and low-loss nonlinear crystals, we anticipate a factor of $&gt;$50 increase in two-mode-cooperativity for stronger coupling and near-unity conversion efficiency at low pump powers. This platform opens new avenues for cavity-QED experiments, with potential applications spanning cavity-mediated interactions between distinct atomic species, interconnects for quantum networking and modular computing, and spatially multimode cavity physics.</description>

Abstract: Interferometers based on ultra-cold atoms enable an absolute measurement of inertial forces with unprecedented precision. However, their resolution is fundamentally restricted by quantum fluctuations. Improved resolutions with entangled or squeezed atoms were demonstrated in internal-state measurements for thermal and quantum-degenerate atoms and, recently, for momentum-state interferometers with laser-cooled atoms. Here, we present a gravimeter based on Bose-Einstein condensates with a sensitivity of $-1.7^{+0.4}_{-0.5}\,$dB beyond the standard quantum limit. Interferometry with Bose-Einstein condensates combined with delta-kick collimation minimizes atom loss in and improves scalability of the interferometer to very-long baseline atom interferometers.</description>

      <title>Searching for dark matter with the Th-229 nuclear lineshape from laser spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent laser excitation of the low-lying Th-229 isomer transition is starting a revolution in ultralight dark matter searches. The enhanced sensitivity of this transition to the large class of dark matter models dominantly coupling to quarks and gluons will ultimately allow us to probe coupling strengths eight orders of magnitude smaller than the current bounds from optical atomic clocks, which are mainly sensitive to dark matter couplings to electrons and photons. We argue that, with increasing precision, observations of the Th-229 excitation spectrum will soon give world-leading constraints. Using data from the pioneering laser excitation of Th-229 by Tiedau et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 182501 (2024)], we present a first dark matter search in the excitation spectrum. While the exclusion limits of our detailed study of the lineshape are still below the sensitivity of currently operating clock experiments, we project the measurement of Zhang et al. [Nature 663, 63 (2024)] to surpass it.</description>

Abstract: We propose to employ the amplification mechanism of Grover's search algorithm to efficiently prepare entangled states of an ensemble of qubits. The conditional change of sign employed in the algorithm can be implemented by the phase shift of photons scattered on an optical cavity hosting an atomic ensemble. We show that collective Dicke states, GHZ states, and Schr\"odinger cat superpositions of $N$ atoms may be prepared deterministically by few ($\sim N^{1/4}$) photon scattering events without individual addressing of the atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18884v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that iteration of a few ( $\sim N^{1/4}$) unitary steps of Grover's algorithm suffices to perfectly prepare a Dicke state of $N$ atoms in a cavity. We also show that a few subsequent Grover steps can be employed to generate GHZ and Cat states. The Grover iteration is physically realized by global qubit rotations and by the phase shift of single photons reflected on the cavity. Our protocols are deterministic and require no individual addressing of the atoms. A detailed error analysis accounting for spatial mode matching of the photon to the cavity, spontaneous emission, mirror scattering, and the finite bandwidth of the photon mode is used to predict the fidelity of the prepared states as a function of system parameters and atom-cavity cooperativity. The fidelity can be increased by heralding on detection of the reflected photon.</description>

      <title>Chip-Scale Atomic Birefringent Diffractive-Optical-Elements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interaction between light and vapors in the presence of magnetic fields is fundamental to many quantum technologies and applications. Recently, the ability to geometrically confine atoms into periodic structures has enabled the creation of chip-scale, micromachined hybrid atomic-diffractive optical elements. However, applying magnetic fields to such structures remains largely unexplored, offering potential for both fundamental and applied insights. Here, we present measurements of an atomic-diffractive optical element subject to magnetic fields. In contrast to the well-known polarization rotation in a Faraday medium, these diffractive atomic elements exhibit additional, rapidly oscillating rotation terms, which we validate both theoretically and experimentally. Moreover, we find that the introduction of spatially varying magnetic fields leads to a reduction in fringe visibility, which can be leveraged for gradiometric applications. Together, these effects establish a chip-scale platform where diffraction and quantum sensing are inseparably co-engineered, unveiling previously inaccessible regimes of atom-photon-magnetic interaction. By probing the magneto-optic response of periodically confined vapors, our results lay the groundwork for integrated smart-cell magnetometers and open new avenues for flat-optics-enabled quantum photonic devices.</description>
