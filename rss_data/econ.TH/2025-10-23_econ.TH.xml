      <title>Prejudice driven spite: A discontinuous phase transition in ultimatum game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a mix of prejudiced and unprejudiced individuals engaged in strategic interactions, the individual intensity of prejudice is expected to have effect on overall level of societal prejudice. High level of prejudice should lead to discrimination that may manifest as unfairness and, perhaps, even spite. In this paper, we investigate this idea in the classical paradigm of the ultimatum game which we theoretically modify to introduce prejudice at the level of players, terming its intensity as prejudicity. The stochastic evolutionary game dynamics, in the regime of replication-selection, reveals the emergence of spiteful behaviour as a dominant behaviour via a first order phase transition -- a discontinuous jump in the frequency of spiteful individuals at a threshold value of prejudicity. The phase transition is quite robust and becomes progressively conspicuous in the limit of large population size where deterministic evolutionary game dynamics, viz., replicator dynamics, approximates the system closely. The emergence of spite driven by prejudice is also found to persist when one considers long-term evolutionary dynamics in the mutation-selection dominated regime.</description>

      <title>Impartial Selection with Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the selection of agents based on mutual nominations, a theoretical problem with many applications from committee selection to AI alignment. As agents both select and are selected, they may be incentivized to misrepresent their true opinion about the eligibility of others to influence their own chances of selection. Impartial mechanisms circumvent this issue by guaranteeing that the selection of an agent is independent of the nominations cast by that agent. Previous research has established strong bounds on the performance of impartial mechanisms, measured by their ability to approximate the number of nominations for the most highly nominated agents. We study to what extent the performance of impartial mechanisms can be improved if they are given a prediction of a set of agents receiving a maximum number of nominations. Specifically, we provide bounds on the consistency and robustness of such mechanisms, where consistency measures the performance of the mechanisms when the prediction is accurate and robustness its performance when the prediction is inaccurate. For the general setting where up to $k$ agents are to be selected and agents nominate any number of other agents, we give a mechanism with consistency $1-O\big(\frac{1}{k}\big)$ and robustness $1-\frac{1}{e}-O\big(\frac{1}{k}\big)$. For the special case of selecting a single agent based on a single nomination per agent, we prove that $1$-consistency can be achieved while guaranteeing $\frac{1}{2}$-robustness. A close comparison with previous results shows that (asymptotically) optimal consistency can be achieved with little to no sacrifice in terms of robustness.</description>

      <title>Stability and slow dynamics of an interior spiky pattern in a one-dimensional spatial Solow model with capital-induced labor migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most significant findings in the study of spatial Solow-Swan models is the emergence of economic agglomeration, in which economic activities concentrate in specific regions. Such agglomeration provides a fundamental mechanism driving the spatial patterns of urbanization, labor migration, productivity growth, and resource allocation. In this paper, we consider the one-dimensional spatial Solow-Swan model with capital-induced labor migration, which captures the dynamic interaction between labor and capital through migration and accumulation. Focusing on the regime of sufficiently small capital diffusivity, we first construct an interior spike (spiky economic agglomeration) quasi-equilibrium. Next, we perform the linear stability of the corresponding spike equilibrium by using a hybrid asymptotic and numerical method. We show that a single interior spike remains stable for small reaction-time constants but undergoes a Hopf bifurcation when the constant is sufficiently large, leading to oscillations in spike height (economic fluctuation). Finally, we derive a differential-algebraic system to capture the slow drift motion of quasi-equilibrium (core-periphery shift). Numerical simulations are carried out to support our theoretical studies and reveal some intriguing yet unexplained dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Combinatorial Multi-Round Ascending Auction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.11783v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Combinatorial Multi-Round Ascending Auction (CMRA) is a new auction format used in recent European spectrum auctions. We show that an auction-specific version of truthful bidding leads to an efficient allocation. We then characterize different ex-post equilibria that feature truthful bidding, demand expansion, and demand reduction. The truthtelling equilibrium is fragile to small asymmetries in the bidders' caps. Moreover, if bidders are sufficiently symmetric, the CMRA is vulnerable to risk-free collusion. We propose an alternative activity rule that prevents such collusive strategies while keeping other equilibria intact. We discuss outcomes of several Danish CMRAs in light of our equilibrium predictions.</description>

      <title>Desirable Rankings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.11684v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of aggregating individual preferences over alternatives into a collective ranking. A distinctive feature of our setting is that agents are matched to alternatives. Applications include rankings of colleges or academic journals. The foundation of our approach is that alternatives agents desire- that is, those they rank above their match-should also be ranked higher socially. We introduce axioms to formalize this idea and call rankings that satisfy them desirable. We develop an algorithm to construct desirable rankings and prove that, as the market becomes large, desirable rankings converge to the true underlying ranking of the alternatives by quality. We support this convergence result through simulations and demonstrate the practical usefulness of our approach by ranking Chilean medical programs with data from their centralized admission system. Finally, we compare performance and show that our approach outperforms two benchmarks: revealed preference rankings and Borda counts.</description>
