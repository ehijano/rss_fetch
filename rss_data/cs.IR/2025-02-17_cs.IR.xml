      <title>A Survey on LLM-based News Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: News recommender systems play a critical role in mitigating the information overload problem. In recent years, due to the successful applications of large language model technologies, researchers have utilized Discriminative Large Language Models (DLLMs) or Generative Large Language Models (GLLMs) to improve the performance of news recommender systems. Although several recent surveys review significant challenges for deep learning-based news recommender systems, such as fairness, privacy-preserving, and responsibility, there is a lack of a systematic survey on Large Language Model (LLM)-based news recommender systems. In order to review different core methodologies and explore potential issues systematically, we categorize DLLM-based and GLLM-based news recommender systems under the umbrella of LLM-based news recommender systems. In this survey, we first overview the development of deep learning-based news recommender systems. Then, we review LLM-based news recommender systems based on three aspects: news-oriented modeling, user-oriented modeling, and prediction-oriented modeling. Next, we examine the challenges from various perspectives, including datasets, benchmarking tools, and methodologies. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze how large language model technologies affect the performance of different news recommender systems. Finally, we comprehensively explore the future directions for LLM-based news recommendations in the era of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Data and Decision Traceability for the Welder's Arc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space Protocol is applying the principles derived from MITRE and NIST's Supply Chain Traceability: Manufacturing Meta-Framework (NIST IR 8536) to a complex multi party system to achieve introspection, auditing, and replay of data and decisions that ultimately lead to a end decision. The core goal of decision traceability is to ensure transparency, accountability, and integrity within the WA system. This is accomplished by providing a clear, auditable path from the system's inputs all the way to the final decision. This traceability enables the system to track the various algorithms and data flows that have influenced a particular outcome.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Large Recommendation Model: Towards a Resource-Optimal Scaling Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of scaling up recommendation models confronts intrinsic tensions between expanding model capacity and preserving computational tractability. While prior studies have explored scaling laws for recommendation systems, their resource-intensive paradigms -- often requiring tens of thousands of A100 GPU hours -- remain impractical for most industrial applications. This work addresses a critical gap: achieving sustainable model scaling under strict computational budgets. We propose Climber, a resource-efficient recommendation framework comprising two synergistic components: the ASTRO model architecture for algorithmic innovation and the TURBO acceleration framework for engineering optimization. ASTRO (Adaptive Scalable Transformer for RecOmmendation) adopts two core innovations: (1) multi-scale sequence partitioning that reduces attention complexity from O(n^2d) to O(n^2d/Nb) via hierarchical blocks, enabling more efficient scaling with sequence length; (2) dynamic temperature modulation that adaptively adjusts attention scores for multimodal distributions arising from inherent multi-scenario and multi-behavior interactions. Complemented by TURBO (Two-stage Unified Ranking with Batched Output), a co-designed acceleration framework integrating gradient-aware feature compression and memory-efficient Key-Value caching, Climber achieves 5.15x throughput gains without performance degradation. Comprehensive offline experiments on multiple datasets validate that Climber exhibits a more ideal scaling curve. To our knowledge, this is the first publicly documented framework where controlled model scaling drives continuous online metric growth (12.19% overall lift) without prohibitive resource costs. Climber has been successfully deployed on Netease Cloud Music, one of China's largest music streaming platforms, serving tens of millions of users daily.</description>

      <title>ArchRAG: Attributed Community-based Hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven effective in integrating external knowledge into large language models (LLMs) for question-answer (QA) tasks. The state-of-the-art RAG approaches often use the graph data as the external data since they capture the rich semantic information and link relationships between entities. However, existing graph-based RAG approaches cannot accurately identify the relevant information from the graph and also consume large numbers of tokens in the online retrieval process. To address these issues, we introduce a novel graph-based RAG approach, called Attributed Community-based Hierarchical RAG (ArchRAG), by augmenting the question using attributed communities, and also introducing a novel LLM-based hierarchical clustering method. To retrieve the most relevant information from the graph for the question, we build a novel hierarchical index structure for the attributed communities and develop an effective online retrieval method. Experimental results demonstrate that ArchRAG outperforms existing methods in terms of both accuracy and token cost.</description>

      <title>A Survey on LLM-powered Agents for Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems are essential components of many online platforms, yet traditional approaches still struggle with understanding complex user preferences and providing explainable recommendations. The emergence of Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents offers a promising approach by enabling natural language interactions and interpretable reasoning, potentially transforming research in recommender systems. This survey provides a systematic review of the emerging applications of LLM-powered agents in recommender systems. We identify and analyze three key paradigms in current research: (1) Recommender-oriented approaches, which leverage intelligent agents to enhance the fundamental recommendation mechanisms; (2) Interaction-oriented approaches, which facilitate dynamic user engagement through natural dialogue and interpretable suggestions; and (3) Simulation-oriented approaches, which employ multi-agent frameworks to model complex user-item interactions and system dynamics. Beyond paradigm categorization, we analyze the architectural foundations of LLM-powered recommendation agents, examining their essential components: profile construction, memory management, strategic planning, and action execution. Our investigation extends to a comprehensive analysis of benchmark datasets and evaluation frameworks in this domain. This systematic examination not only illuminates the current state of LLM-powered agent recommender systems but also charts critical challenges and promising research directions in this transformative field.</description>

      <title>Semantica: Decentralized Search using a LLM-Guided Semantic Tree Overlay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Centralized search engines are key for the Internet, but lead to undesirable concentration of power. Decentralized alternatives fail to offer equal document retrieval accuracy and speed. Nevertheless, Semantic Overlay Networks can come close to the performance of centralized solutions when the semantics of documents are properly captured. This work uses embeddings from Large Language Models to capture semantics and fulfill the promise of Semantic Overlay Networks. Our proposed algorithm, called Semantica, constructs a prefix tree (trie) utilizing document embeddings calculated by a language model. Users connect to each other based on the embeddings of their documents, ensuring that semantically similar users are directly linked. Thereby, this construction makes it more likely for user searches to be answered by the users that they are directly connected to, or by the users they are close to in the network connection graph. The implementation of our algorithm also accommodates the semantic diversity of individual users by spawning "clone" user identifiers in the tree. Our experiments use emulation with a real-world workload to show Semantica's ability to identify and connect to similar users quickly. Semantica finds up to ten times more semantically similar users than current state-of-the-art approaches. At the same time, Semantica can retrieve more than two times the number of relevant documents given the same network load. We also make our code publicly available to facilitate further research in the area.</description>

      <title>SessionRec: Next Session Prediction Paradigm For Generative Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce SessionRec, a novel next-session prediction paradigm (NSPP) for generative sequential recommendation, addressing the fundamental misalignment between conventional next-item prediction paradigm (NIPP) and real-world recommendation scenarios. Unlike NIPP's item-level autoregressive generation that contradicts actual session-based user interactions, our framework introduces a session-aware representation learning through hierarchical sequence aggregation (intra/inter-session), reducing attention computation complexity while enabling implicit modeling of massive negative interactions, and a session-based prediction objective that better captures users' diverse interests through multi-item recommendation in next sessions. Moreover, we found that incorporating a rank loss for items within the session under the next session prediction paradigm can significantly improve the ranking effectiveness of generative sequence recommendation models. We also verified that SessionRec exhibits clear power-law scaling laws similar to those observed in LLMs. Extensive experiments conducted on public datasets and online A/B test in Meituan App demonstrate the effectiveness of SessionRec. The proposed paradigm establishes new foundations for developing industrial-scale generative recommendation systems through its model-agnostic architecture and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Cross-Stage Coordination Pre-ranking Model for Online Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale recommendation systems often adopt cascading architecture consisting of retrieval, pre-ranking, ranking, and re-ranking stages. With strict latency requirements, pre-ranking utilizes lightweight models to perform a preliminary selection from massive retrieved candidates. However, recent works focus solely on improving consistency with ranking, relying exclusively on downstream stages. Since downstream input is derived from the pre-ranking output, they will exacerbate the sample selection bias (SSB) issue and Matthew effect, leading to sub-optimal results. To address the limitation, we propose a novel Hybrid Cross-Stage Coordination Pre-ranking model (HCCP) to integrate information from upstream (retrieval) and downstream (ranking, re-ranking) stages. Specifically, cross-stage coordination refers to the pre-ranking's adaptability to the entire stream and the role of serving as a more effective bridge between upstream and downstream. HCCP consists of Hybrid Sample Construction and Hybrid Objective Optimization. Hybrid sample construction captures multi-level unexposed data from the entire stream and rearranges them to become the optimal guiding "ground truth" for pre-ranking learning. Hybrid objective optimization contains the joint optimization of consistency and long-tail precision through our proposed Margin InfoNCE loss. It is specifically designed to learn from such hybrid unexposed samples, improving the overall performance and mitigating the SSB issue. The appendix describes a proof of the efficacy of the proposed loss in selecting potential positives. Extensive offline and online experiments indicate that HCCP outperforms SOTA methods by improving cross-stage coordination. It contributes up to 14.9% UCVR and 1.3% UCTR in the JD E-commerce recommendation system. Concerning code privacy, we provide a pseudocode for reference.</description>

      <title>Prioritized Ranking Experimental Design Using Recommender Systems in Two-Sided Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interdependencies between units in online two-sided marketplaces complicate estimating causal effects in experimental settings. We propose a novel experimental design to mitigate the interference bias in estimating the total average treatment effect (TATE) of item-side interventions in online two-sided marketplaces. Our Two-Sided Prioritized Ranking (TSPR) design uses the recommender system as an instrument for experimentation. TSPR strategically prioritizes items based on their treatment status in the listings displayed to users. We designed TSPR to provide users with a coherent platform experience by ensuring access to all items and a consistent realization of their treatment by all users. We evaluate our experimental design through simulations using a search impression dataset from an online travel agency. Our methodology closely estimates the true simulated TATE, while a baseline item-side estimator significantly overestimates TATE.</description>

      <title>KGGen: Extracting Knowledge Graphs from Plain Text with Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent interest in building foundation models for KGs has highlighted a fundamental challenge: knowledge-graph data is relatively scarce. The best-known KGs are primarily human-labeled, created by pattern-matching, or extracted using early NLP techniques. While human-generated KGs are in short supply, automatically extracted KGs are of questionable quality. We present a solution to this data scarcity problem in the form of a text-to-KG generator (KGGen), a package that uses language models to create high-quality graphs from plaintext. Unlike other KG extractors, KGGen clusters related entities to reduce sparsity in extracted KGs. KGGen is available as a Python library (\texttt{pip install kg-gen}), making it accessible to everyone. Along with KGGen, we release the first benchmark, Measure of of Information in Nodes and Edges (MINE), that tests an extractor's ability to produce a useful KG from plain text. We benchmark our new tool against existing extractors and demonstrate far superior performance.</description>

      <title>ProReco: A Process Discovery Recommender System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Process discovery aims to automatically derive process models from historical execution data (event logs). While various process discovery algorithms have been proposed in the last 25 years, there is no consensus on a dominating discovery algorithm. Selecting the most suitable discovery algorithm remains a challenge due to competing quality measures and diverse user requirements. Manually selecting the most suitable process discovery algorithm from a range of options for a given event log is a time-consuming and error-prone task. This paper introduces ProReco, a Process discovery Recommender system designed to recommend the most appropriate algorithm based on user preferences and event log characteristics. ProReco incorporates state-of-the-art discovery algorithms, extends the feature pools from previous work, and utilizes eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques to provide explanations for its recommendations.</description>

      <title>Middleman Bias in Advertising: Aligning Relevance of Keyphrase Recommendations with Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: E-commerce sellers are recommended keyphrases based on their inventory on which they advertise to increase buyer engagement (clicks/sales). Keyphrases must be pertinent to items; otherwise, it can result in seller dissatisfaction and poor targeting -- towards that end relevance filters are employed. In this work, we describe the shortcomings of training relevance filter models on biased click/sales signals. We re-conceptualize advertiser keyphrase relevance as interaction between two dynamical systems -- Advertising which produces the keyphrases and Search which acts as a middleman to reach buyers. We discuss the bias of search relevance systems (middleman bias) and the need to align advertiser keyphrases with search relevance signals. We also compare the performance of cross encoders and bi-encoders in modeling this alignment and the scalability of such a solution for sellers at eBay.</description>

      <title>The 2021 Tokyo Olympics Multilingual News Article Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a dataset of multilingual news articles covering the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. A total of 10,940 news articles were gathered from 1,918 different publishers, covering 1,350 sub-events of the 2021 Olympics, and published between July 1, 2021, and August 14, 2021. These articles are written in nine languages from different language families and in different scripts. To create the dataset, the raw news articles were first retrieved via a service that collects and analyzes news articles. Then, the articles were grouped using an online clustering algorithm, with each group containing articles reporting on the same sub-event. Finally, the groups were manually annotated and evaluated. The development of this dataset aims to provide a resource for evaluating the performance of multilingual news clustering algorithms, for which limited datasets are available. It can also be used to analyze the dynamics and events of the 2021 Tokyo Olympics from different perspectives. The dataset is available in CSV format and can be accessed from the CLARIN.SI repository.</description>

      <title>ChorusCVR: Chorus Supervision for Entire Space Post-Click Conversion Rate Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Post-click conversion rate (CVR) estimation is a vital task in many recommender systems of revenue businesses, e.g., e-commerce and advertising. In a perspective of sample, a typical CVR positive sample usually goes through a funnel of exposure to click to conversion. For lack of post-event labels for un-clicked samples, CVR learning task commonly only utilizes clicked samples, rather than all exposed samples as for click-through rate (CTR) learning task. However, during online inference, CVR and CTR are estimated on the same assumed exposure space, which leads to a inconsistency of sample space between training and inference, i.e., sample selection bias (SSB). To alleviate SSB, previous wisdom proposes to design novel auxiliary tasks to enable the CVR learning on un-click training samples, such as CTCVR and counterfactual CVR, etc. Although alleviating SSB to some extent, none of them pay attention to the discrimination between ambiguous negative samples (un-clicked) and factual negative samples (clicked but un-converted) during modelling, which makes CVR model lacks robustness. To full this gap, we propose a novel ChorusCVR model to realize debiased CVR learning in entire-space.</description>

      <title>Graph Foundation Models for Recommendation: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommender systems (RS) serve as a fundamental tool for navigating the vast expanse of online information, with deep learning advancements playing an increasingly important role in improving ranking accuracy. Among these, graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at extracting higher-order structural information, while large language models (LLMs) are designed to process and comprehend natural language, making both approaches highly effective and widely adopted. Recent research has focused on graph foundation models (GFMs), which integrate the strengths of GNNs and LLMs to model complex RS problems more efficiently by leveraging the graph-based structure of user-item relationships alongside textual understanding. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of GFM-based RS technologies by introducing a clear taxonomy of current approaches, diving into methodological details, and highlighting key challenges and future directions. By synthesizing recent advancements, we aim to offer valuable insights into the evolving landscape of GFM-based recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Dataset Size for Recommender Systems: Evaluating Algorithms' Performance via Downsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08845</link>

Abstract: This thesis investigates dataset downsampling as a strategy to optimize energy efficiency in recommender systems while maintaining competitive performance. With increasing dataset sizes posing computational and environmental challenges, this study explores the trade-offs between energy efficiency and recommendation quality in Green Recommender Systems, which aim to reduce environmental impact. By applying two downsampling approaches to seven datasets, 12 algorithms, and two levels of core pruning, the research demonstrates significant reductions in runtime and carbon emissions. For example, a 30% downsampling portion can reduce runtime by 52% compared to the full dataset, leading to a carbon emission reduction of up to 51.02 KgCO2e during the training of a single algorithm on a single dataset. The analysis reveals that algorithm performance under different downsampling portions depends on factors like dataset characteristics, algorithm complexity, and the specific downsampling configuration (scenario dependent). Some algorithms, which showed lower nDCG@10 scores compared to higher-performing ones, exhibited lower sensitivity to the amount of training data, offering greater potential for efficiency in lower downsampling portions. On average, these algorithms retained 81% of full-size performance using only 50% of the training set. In certain downsampling configurations, where more users were progressively included while keeping the test set size fixed, they even showed higher nDCG@10 scores than when using the full dataset. These findings highlight the feasibility of balancing sustainability and effectiveness, providing insights for designing energy-efficient recommender systems and promoting sustainable AI practices.</description>

      <title>Accuracy and Political Bias of News Source Credibility Ratings by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Search engines increasingly leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate direct answers, and AI chatbots now access the Internet for fresh data. As information curators for billions of users, LLMs must assess the accuracy and reliability of different sources. This paper audits nine widely used LLMs from three leading providers -- OpenAI, Google, and Meta -- to evaluate their ability to discern credible and high-quality information sources from low-credibility ones. We find that while LLMs can rate most tested news outlets, larger models more frequently refuse to provide ratings due to insufficient information, whereas smaller models are more prone to making errors in their ratings. For sources where ratings are provided, LLMs exhibit a high level of agreement among themselves (average Spearman's $\rho = 0.79$), but their ratings align only moderately with human expert evaluations (average $\rho = 0.50$). Analyzing news sources with different political leanings in the US, we observe a liberal bias in credibility ratings yielded by all LLMs in default configurations. Additionally, assigning partisan roles to LLMs consistently induces strong politically congruent bias in their ratings. These findings have important implications for the use of LLMs in curating news and political information.</description>

      <title>ResearchArena: Benchmarking Large Language Models' Ability to Collect and Organize Information as Research Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across many natural language processing tasks but face challenges in domain-specific, analytical tasks such as conducting research surveys. This study introduces ResearchArena, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in conducting academic surveys$\unicode{x2013}$a foundational step in academic research. ResearchArena models the process in three stages: (1) information discovery, identifying relevant literature; (2) information selection, evaluating papers' relevance and impact; and (3) information organization, structuring knowledge into hierarchical frameworks such as mind-maps. Notably, mind-map construction is treated as a bonus task, reflecting its supplementary role in survey-writing. To support these evaluations, we construct an offline environment of 12M full-text academic papers and 7.9K survey papers. To ensure ethical compliance, we do not redistribute copyrighted materials; instead, we provide code to construct the environment from the Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus (S2ORC). Preliminary evaluations reveal that LLM-based approaches underperform compared to simpler keyword-based retrieval methods, underscoring significant opportunities for advancing LLMs in autonomous research.</description>

      <title>Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation for Dynamic Few-shot Text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text classification is a fundamental task in data mining, pivotal to various applications such as tabular understanding and recommendation. Although neural network-based models, such as CNN and BERT, have demonstrated remarkable performance in text classification, their effectiveness heavily relies on abundant labeled training data. This dependency makes these models less effective in dynamic few-shot text classification, where labeled data is scarce, and new target labels frequently appear based on application needs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise due to their extensive pretraining and contextual understanding ability. Current approaches provide LLMs with text inputs, candidate labels, and additional side information (e.g., descriptions) to classify texts. However, their effectiveness is hindered by the increased input size and the noise introduced through side information processing. To address these limitations, we propose a graph-based online retrieval-augmented generation framework, namely GORAG, for dynamic few-shot text classification. Rather than treating each input independently, GORAG constructs and maintains a weighted graph by extracting side information across all target texts. In this graph, text keywords and labels are represented as nodes, with edges indicating the correlations between them. To model these correlations, GORAG employs an edge weighting mechanism to prioritize the importance and reliability of extracted information and dynamically retrieves relevant context using a minimum-cost spanning tree tailored for each text input. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that GORAG outperforms existing approaches by providing more comprehensive and precise contextual information.</description>
