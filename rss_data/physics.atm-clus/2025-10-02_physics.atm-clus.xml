      <title>Imaging and controlling electron motion and chemical structural dynamics of biological system in real time and space</title>

Abstract: Ultrafast electron microscopy (UEM) has found widespread applications in physics, chemistry, and materials science, enabling real-space imaging of dynamics on ultrafast timescales. Recent advances have pushed the temporal resolution of UEM into the attosecond regime, enabling the attomicroscopy technique to directly visualize electron motion. In this work, we extend the capabilities of this powerful imaging tool to investigate ultrafast electron dynamics in a biological system by imaging and controlling light induced electronic and chemical changes in the conductive network of multicellular cable bacteria. Using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), we first observed a laser induced increase in {\pi}-electron density, accompanied by spectral peak broadening and a blueshift features indicative of enhanced conductivity and structural modification. We also traced the effect of ultrafast laser pumping on bulk plasmon electron oscillations by monitoring changes in the plasmon like resonance peak. Additionally, we visualized laser induced chemical structural changes in cable bacteria in real space. The imaging results revealed carbon enrichment alongside a depletion of nitrogen and oxygen, highlighting the controllability of chemical dynamics. Moreover, time resolved EELS measurements further revealed a picosecond scale decay and recovery of both {\pi}-electron and plasmonic features, attributed to electron phonon coupling. In addition to shedding light on the mechanism of electron motion in cable bacteria, these findings demonstrate ultrafast modulation and switching of conductivity, underscoring their potential as bio-optoelectronic components operating on ultrafast timescales.</description>

      <title>Attosecond-resolved probing of recolliding electron wave packets in liquids and aqueous solutions</title>

Abstract: High-harmonic spectroscopy (HHS) in liquids promises real-time access to ultrafast electronic dynamics in the native environment of chemical and biological processes. While electron recollision has been established as the dominant mechanism of high-harmonic generation (HHG) in liquids, resolving the underlying electron dynamics has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate attosecond-resolved measurements of recolliding electron wave packets, extending HHS from neat liquids to aqueous solutions. Using phase-controlled two-colour fields, we observe a linear scaling of the two-colour delay that maximizes even-harmonic emission with photon energy, yielding slopes of 208+/-55 as/eV in ethanol and 124+/-42 as/eV in water, the latter matching ab initio simulations (125+/-48 as/eV). In aqueous salt solutions, we uncover interference minima whose appearance depends on solute type and concentration, arising from destructive interference between solute and solvent emission. By measuring the relative phase of solvent and solute HHG, we retrieve a variation of electron transit time by 113+/-32 as/eV, consistent with our neat-liquid results. These findings establish HHS as a powerful attosecond-resolved probe of electron dynamics in disordered media, opening transformative opportunities for studying ultrafast processes such as energy transfer, charge migration, and proton dynamics in liquids and solutions.</description>
