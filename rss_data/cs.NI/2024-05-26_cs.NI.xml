      <title>SATSense: Multi-Satellite Collaborative Framework for Spectrum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit satellite Internet has recently been deployed, providing worldwide service with non-terrestrial networks. With the large-scale deployment of both non-terrestrial and terrestrial networks, limited spectrum resources will not be allocated enough. Consequently, dynamic spectrum sharing is crucial for their coexistence in the same spectrum, where accurate spectrum sensing is essential. However, spectrum sensing in space is more challenging than in terrestrial networks due to variable channel conditions, making single-satellite sensing unstable. Therefore, we first attempt to design a collaborative sensing scheme utilizing diverse data from multiple satellites. However, it is non-trivial to achieve this collaboration due to heterogeneous channel quality, considerable raw sampling data, and packet loss. To address the above challenges, we first establish connections between the satellites by modeling their sensing data as a graph and devising a graph neural network-based algorithm to achieve effective spectrum sensing. Meanwhile, we establish a joint sub-Nyquist sampling and autoencoder data compression framework to reduce the amount of transmitted sensing data. Finally, we propose a contrastive learning-based mechanism compensates for missing packets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed strategy can achieve efficient spectrum sensing performance and outperform the conventional deep learning algorithm in spectrum sensing accuracy.</description>

      <title>UAV-assisted C-RAN for On-demand Cellular Coverage: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of beyond fifth-generation (5G) infrastructure over disaster-affected regions, temporary hotspot situations (e.g., massive gatherings, etc.), complex terrains (e.g., sea, hills, marshes, etc.) poses numerous challenges for cellular service providers. Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as potential candidates to overcome the aforementioned technical issues based on their multi-role capabilities to serve as aerial base stations, mobile relays, and flying wireless access points. As such, the UAVs can act as portable platforms that can be deployed immediately on demand without requiring massive ground infrastructure to support wireless services. This article introduces the integration of UAVs to cloud radio access networks (C-RAN) for beyond 5G applications. The article mainly focuses on the underlying opportunities and challenges to realize the UAV-assisted C-RAN (UC-RAN) architecture in view of three generic application scenarios, i.e., disaster management, hotspots, and complex terrains. A preliminary performance analysis via simulation is further provided for the proposed UC-RAN under hotspot application scenario based on the relevant metrics.</description>

      <title>Multi-Gigabit Interactive Extended Reality over Millimeter-Wave: An End-to-End System Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving high-quality wireless interactive Extended Reality (XR) will require multi-gigabit throughput at extremely low latency. The Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) frequency bands, between 24 and 300GHz, can achieve such extreme performance. However, maintaining a consistently high Quality of Experience with highly mobile users is challenging, as mmWave communications are inherently directional. In this work, we present and evaluate an end-to-end approach to such a mmWave-based mobile XR system. We perform a highly realistic simulation of the system, incorporating accurate XR data traffic, detailed mmWave propagation models and actual user motion. We evaluate the impact of the beamforming strategy and frequency on the overall performance. In addition, we provide the first system-level evaluation of the CoVRage algorithm, a proactive and spatially aware user-side beamforming approach designed specifically for highly mobile XR environments.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air Runtime Wi-Fi MAC Address Re-randomization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medium Access Control (MAC) address randomization is a key component for privacy protection in Wi-Fi networks. Current proposals periodically change the mobile device MAC addresses when it disconnects from the Access Point (AP). This way frames cannot be linked across changes, but the mobile device presence is exposed as long as it remains connected: all its communication is trivially linkable by observing the randomized yet same MAC address throughout the connection. Our runtime MAC re-randomization scheme addresses this issue, reducing or eliminating Wi-Fi frames linkability without awaiting for or requiring a disconnection. Our MAC re-randomization is practically 'over-the-air': MAC addresses are re-randomized just before transmission, while the protocol stacks (at the mobile and the AP) maintain locally the original connection MAC addresses - making our MAC layer scheme transparent to upper layers. With an implementation and a set of small-scale experiments with off-the-shelf devices, we show the feasibility of our scheme and the potential towards future deployment.</description>

      <title>P4Control: Line-Rate Cross-Host Attack Prevention via In-Network Information Flow Control Enabled by Programmable Switches and eBPF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern targeted attacks such as Advanced Persistent Threats use multiple hosts as stepping stones and move laterally across them to gain deeper access to the network. However, existing defenses lack end-to-end information flow visibility across hosts and cannot block cross-host attack traffic in real time. In this paper, we propose P4Control, a network defense system that precisely confines end-to-end information flows in a network and prevents cross-host attacks at line rate. P4Control introduces a novel in-network decentralized information flow control (DIFC) mechanism and is the first work that enforces DIFC at the network level at network line rate. This is achieved through: (1) an in-network primitive based on programmable switches for tracking inter-host information flows and enforcing line-rate DIFC policies; (2) a lightweight eBPF-based primitive deployed on hosts for tracking intra-host information flows. P4Control also provides an expressive policy framework for specifying DIFC policies against different attack scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations to show that P4Control can effectively prevent cross-host attacks in real time, while maintaining line-rate network performance and imposing minimal overhead on the network and host machines. It is also noteworthy that P4Control can facilitate the realization of a zero trust architecture through its fine-grained least-privilege network access control.</description>

      <title>Surveilling the Masses with Wi-Fi-Based Positioning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wi-Fi-based Positioning Systems (WPSes) are used by modern mobile devices to learn their position using nearby Wi-Fi access points as landmarks. In this work, we show that Apple's WPS can be abused to create a privacy threat on a global scale. We present an attack that allows an unprivileged attacker to amass a worldwide snapshot of Wi-Fi BSSID geolocations in only a matter of days. Our attack makes few assumptions, merely exploiting the fact that there are relatively few dense regions of allocated MAC address space. Applying this technique over the course of a year, we learned the precise locations of over 2 billion BSSIDs around the world.
  The privacy implications of such massive datasets become more stark when taken longitudinally, allowing the attacker to track devices' movements. While most Wi-Fi access points do not move for long periods of time, many devices -- like compact travel routers -- are specifically designed to be mobile. We present several case studies that demonstrate the types of attacks on privacy that Apple's WPS enables: We track devices moving in and out of war zones (specifically Ukraine and Gaza), the effects of natural disasters (specifically the fires in Maui), and the possibility of targeted individual tracking by proxy -- all by remotely geolocating wireless access points. We provide recommendations to WPS operators and Wi-Fi access point manufacturers to enhance the privacy of hundreds of millions of users worldwide. Finally, we detail our efforts at responsibly disclosing this privacy vulnerability, and outline some mitigations that Apple and Wi-Fi access point manufacturers have implemented both independently and as a result of our work.</description>

      <title>Throughput Requirements for RAN Functional Splits in 3D-Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of non-terrestrial communication necessitates its integration with existing terrestrial networks, as highlighted in 3GPP Releases 16 and 17. This paper analyses the concept of functional splits in 3D-Networks. To manage this complex structure effectively, the adoption of a Radio Access Network (RAN) architecture with Functional Split (FS) offers advantages in flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency. RAN achieves this by disaggregating functionalities into three separate units. Analogous to the terrestrial network approach, 3GPP is extending this concept to non-terrestrial platforms as well. This work presents a general analysis of the requested Fronthaul (FH) data rate on feeder link between a non-terrestrial platform and the ground-station. Each split option is a trade-of between FH data rate and the respected complexity. Since flying nodes face more limitations regarding power consumption and complexity on board in comparison to terrestrial ones, we are investigating the split options between lower and higher physical layer.</description>

      <title>FitNets: An Adaptive Framework to Learn Accurate Traffic Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning precise distributions of traffic features (e.g., burst sizes, packet inter-arrival time) is still a largely unsolved problem despite being critical for management tasks such as capacity planning or anomaly detection. A key limitation nowadays is the lack of feedback between the control plane and the data plane. Programmable data planes offer the opportunity to create systems that let data- and control plane to work together, compensating their respective shortcomings.
  We present FitNets, an adaptive network monitoring system leveraging feedback between the data- and the control plane to learn accurate traffic distributions. In the control plane, FitNets relies on Kernel Density Estimators which allow to provably learn distributions of any shape. In the data plane, FitNets tests the accuracy of the learned distributions while dynamically adapting data collection to the observed distribution fitness, prioritizing under-fitted features.
  We have implemented FitNets in Python and P4 (including on commercially available programmable switches) and tested it on real and synthetic traffic traces. FitNets is practical: it is able to estimate hundreds of distributions from up to 60 millions samples per second, while providing accurate error estimates and adapting to complex traffic patterns.</description>
