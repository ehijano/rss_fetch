      <title>The ArgusSpec Prototype: Autonomous Spectroscopic Follow-up of Flares Detected by Large Array Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ArgusSpec is a prototype autonomous spectroscopic follow-up instrument designed to characterize flares detected by the Argus Pathfinder telescope array by taking short exposure (30 s) broadband spectra (370 - 750 nm) at low resolutions (R~150 at 500 nm). The instrument is built from consumer off-the-shelf astronomical equipment, assembled inside a shipping container, and deployed alongside the Argus Pathfinder at a dark sky observing site in Western North Carolina. The \$35k prototype ArgusSpec was designed, built, and deployed in under a year, largely from existing parts, and has been operating on-sky since March 2023. With current hardware and software, the system is capable of receiving an observation, slewing, performing autonomous slit acquisition, and beginning data acquisition within an average of 32 s. With Argus Pathfinder's 1-second-cadence survey reporting alerts of rising sources within 2 s of onset, ArgusSpec can reach new targets well within a minute of the start of the event. As built, ArgusSpec can observe targets down to a 20$\sigma$ limiting magnitude of $m_V$~13 at 30 s cadence with an optical resolution of R~150 (at 500 nm). With automated rapid acquisition demonstrated, later hardware upgrades will significantly improve the limiting magnitude, and potentially enable deep spectroscopy by the coaddition of data from an array of ArgusSpec systems. ArgusSpec's primary science driver is the characterization of the blackbody evolution of flares from nearby M-dwarfs. Large flares emitted by these stars could have significant impacts on the potential habitability of any orbiting exoplanets, but our current understanding of these events is in large part built on observations from a handful of active stars. ArgusSpec will characterize large numbers of flares, building a spectroscopic library of the most extreme events from a wide variety of stellar masses and ages.</description>

      <title>A clear case for dust obscuration of the lunar retroreflectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The passive retroreflector arrays placed on the moon by Apollo 11, 14 and 15 astronauts continue to produce valuable Earth-Moon range measurements that enable high-precision tests of gravitational physics, as well as studies of geo- and selenophysics. The optical throughput of these retroreflectors has declined since their deployment, with an additional signal loss at full moon when the reflectors experience direct solar illumination. We show that the loss in return rate can be attributed to the accumulation of a thin layer of lunar dust on the surfaces of the corner cube retroreflectors. First, a careful analysis of the optical link budget for the Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation (APOLLO) experiment reveals that the lunar return rate is 15--20 times smaller than predicted, a deficit that can be explained by a reflector dust covering fraction of ${\sim} 50$\%. Second, range measurements taken during a lunar eclipse indicate that the solar illumination of the retroreflectors degrades their throughput by an additional factor of ${\sim}15$. Finally, a numerical simulation of heat transfer in dust-coated reflectors is able to model the resulting thermal lensing effect, in which thermal gradients in the retroreflectors degrade their far-field diffraction pattern. A comparison of this simulation to eclipse measurements finds a dust coverage fraction of ${\sim}50$%. Taken together, the link analysis, eclipse observations and thermal modeling support the claim that the retroreflectors are obscured by lunar dust, with both link budget and simulation independently finding the dust fraction to be $\sim$50%.</description>

      <title>Piggybacking astronomical hazard investigations on scientific Big Data missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current and upcoming large optical and near-infrared astronomical surveys have fundamental science as their primary drivers. To cater to those, these missions scan large frac- tions of the entire sky at multiple wavelengths and epochs. These aspects make these data sets also valuable for investigations into astronomical hazards for life on Earth. The Netherlands Research School for Astronomy (NOVA) is a partner in several optical / near-infrared surveys. In this paper we focus on the astronomical hazard value for two sets of those: the surveys with the OmegaCAM wide-field imager at the VST and with the Euclid Mission. For each of them we provide a brief overview of the astronomical survey hardware, the data and the information systems. We present first results related to the astronomical hazard investigations. We evaluate to what extent the existing functionality of the information systems covers the needs for the astronomical hazard investigations</description>

      <title>Object classification with Convolutional Neural Networks: from KiDS to Euclid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale imaging surveys have grown about 1000 times faster than the number of astronomers in the last 3 decades. Using Artificial Intelligence instead of astronomer's brains for interpretative tasks allows astronomers to keep up with the data. We give a progress report on using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify three classes of rare objects (galaxy mergers, strong gravitational lenses and asteroids) in the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) and the Euclid Survey.</description>

      <title>Development of a near-infrared wide-field integral field unit by ultra-precision diamond cutting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) is an observational method to obtain spatially resolved spectra over a specific field of view (FoV) in a single exposure. In recent years, near-infrared IFS has gained importance in observing objects with strong dust attenuation or at high redshift. One limitation of existing near-infrared IFS instruments is their relatively small FoV, less than 100 arcsec$^2$, compared to optical instruments. Therefore, we have developed a near-infrared (0.9-2.5 $\mathrm{\mu}$m) image-slicer type integral field unit (IFU) with a larger FoV of 13.5 $\times$ 10.4 arcsec$^2$ by matching a slice width to a typical seeing size of 0.4 arcsec. The IFU has a compact optical design utilizing off-axis ellipsoidal mirrors to reduce aberrations. Complex optical elements were fabricated using an ultra-precision cutting machine to achieve RMS surface roughness of less than 10 nm and a P-V shape error of less than 300 nm. The ultra-precision machining can also simplify alignment procedures. The on-sky performance evaluation confirmed that the image quality and the throughput of the IFU were as designed. In conclusion, we have successfully developed a compact IFU utilizing an ultra-precision cutting technique, almost fulfilling the requirements.</description>

      <title>PI-AstroDeconv: A Physics-Informed Unsupervised Learning Method for Astronomical Image Deconvolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the imaging process of an astronomical telescope, the deconvolution of its beam or Point Spread Function (PSF) is a crucial task. However, deconvolution presents a classical and challenging inverse computation problem. In scenarios where the beam or PSF is complex or inaccurately measured, such as in interferometric arrays and certain radio telescopes, the resultant blurry images are often challenging to interpret visually or analyze using traditional physical detection methods. We argue that traditional methods frequently lack specific prior knowledge, thereby leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue and achieve image deconvolution and reconstruction, we propose an unsupervised network architecture that incorporates prior physical information. The network adopts an encoder-decoder structure while leveraging the telescope's PSF as prior knowledge. During network training, we introduced accelerated Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) convolution to enable efficient processing of high-resolution input images and PSFs. We explored various classic regression networks, including autoencoder (AE) and U-Net, and conducted a comprehensive performance evaluation through comparative analysis.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave constraints on planetary-mass primordial black holes using LIGO O3a data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from sub-solar mass inspiraling compact objects would provide smoking-gun evidence for primordial black holes (PBHs). We perform the first search for inspiraling planetary-mass PBHs, both in equal-mass or asymmetric mass ratio binaries, using data from the first half of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA third observing run. We do not find any significant candidates, but determine the maximum luminosity distance reachable with our search to be of $O(0.1-100)$ kpc, and corresponding model-independent upper limits on the merger rate densities to be $O(10^{3}-10^{-7})$ kpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$ for systems with chirp masses $O(10^{-4}-10^{-2})M_\odot$, respectively. Furthermore, we interpret these rate densities as arising from PBH binaries, and thereby constrain the fraction of dark matter that these objects could compose. For equal-mass PBH binaries, we find $f_\text{PBH}&lt;$ [1, 0.04] for $m_\text{PBH}\in [2\times 10^{-3},10^{-2}]M_\odot$, respectively. For asymmetric mass-ratio binaries, where $m_1=2.5M_\odot$ and $m_2\ll m_1$, we constrain the mass function $f(m_2)&lt;1$ for $m_2\in [1.5\times10^{-5},2\times10^{-4}]M_\odot$, assuming $f_\text{PBH}=0.1$ and $f(m_1)\sim 1$. Our results constitute the first gravitational-wave constraints on planetary-mass PBHs in both equal-mass and highly asymmetric mass-ratio systems, provide a computationally efficient alternative to matched filtering in this mass regime, and complement microlensing experiments to probe the existence of these objects. The data necessary to produce the upper limit plots has also been released on Zenodo.</description>

      <title>Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) Science: Resolving the Hot and Ionized Universe through the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An omnipresent feature of the multi-phase ``cosmic web'' is that warm/hot (&gt;$10^5$ K) ionized gas pervades it. This gas constitutes a relevant contribution to the overall universal matter budget across multiple scales, from the several tens of Mpc-scale IGM filaments, to the Mpc ICM, all the way down to the CGM surrounding individual galaxies, on scales from ~1 kpc up to their respective virial radii (~100 kpc). The study of the hot baryonic component of cosmic matter density represents a powerful means for constraining the intertwined evolution of galactic populations and large-scale cosmological structures, for tracing the matter assembly in the Universe and its thermal history. To this end, the SZ effect provides the ideal observational tool for measurements out to the beginnings of structure formation. The SZ effect is caused by the scattering of the photons from the cosmic microwave background off the hot electrons embedded within cosmic structures, and provides a redshift-independent perspective on the thermal and kinematic properties of the warm/hot gas. Still, current and future (sub)mm facilities have been providing only a partial view of the SZ Universe due to any combination of: limited angular resolution, spectral coverage, field of view, spatial dynamic range, sensitivity. In this paper, we motivate the development of a wide-field, broad-band, multi-chroic continuum instrument for the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) by identifying the scientific drivers that will deepen our understanding of the complex thermal evolution of cosmic structures. On a technical side, this will necessarily require efficient multi-wavelength mapping of the SZ signal with an unprecedented spatial dynamic range (from arcsecond to degree scales) and we employ theoretical forecasts to determine the key instrumental constraints for achieving our goals.

      <title>Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) Science: Our Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As we learn more about the multi-scale interstellar medium (ISM) of our Galaxy, we develop a greater understanding for the complex relationships between the large-scale diffuse gas and dust in Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs), how it moves, how it is affected by the nearby massive stars, and which portions of those GMCs eventually collapse into star forming regions. The complex interactions of those gas, dust and stellar populations form what has come to be known as the ecology of our Galaxy. Because we are deeply embedded in the plane of our Galaxy, it takes up a significant fraction of the sky, with complex dust lanes scattered throughout the optically recognisable bands of the Milky Way. These bands become bright at (sub-)millimetre wavelengths, where we can study dust thermal emission and the chemical and kinematic signatures of the gas. To properly study such large-scale environments, requires deep, large area surveys that are not possible with current facilities. Moreover, where stars form, so too do planetary systems, growing from the dust and gas in circumstellar discs, to planets and planetesimal belts. Understanding the evolution of these belts requires deep imaging capable of studying belts around young stellar objects to Kuiper belt analogues around the nearest stars. Here we present a plan for observing the Galactic Plane and circumstellar environments to quantify the physical structure, the magnetic fields, the dynamics, chemistry, star formation, and planetary system evolution of the galaxy in which we live with AtLAST; a concept for a new, 50m single-dish sub-mm telescope with a large field of view which is the only type of facility that will allow us to observe our Galaxy deeply and widely enough to make a leap forward in our understanding of our local ecology.</description>

      <title>Science development study for the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) - Solar and stellar observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations at (sub-)millimeter wavelengths offer a complementary perspective on our Sun and other stars, offering significant insights into both the thermal and magnetic composition of their chromospheres. Despite the fundamental progress in (sub-)millimeter observations of the Sun, some important aspects require diagnostic capabilities that are not offered by existing observatories. In particular, simultaneously observations of the radiation continuum across an extended frequency range would facilitate the mapping of different layers and thus ultimately the 3D structure of the solar atmosphere. Mapping large regions on the Sun or even the whole solar disk at a very high temporal cadence would be crucial for systematically detecting and following the temporal evolution of flares, while synoptic observations, i.e., daily maps, over periods of years would provide an unprecedented view of the solar activity cycle in this wavelength regime. As our Sun is a fundamental reference for studying the atmospheres of active main sequence stars, observing the Sun and other stars with the same instrument would unlock the enormous diagnostic potential for understanding stellar activity and its impact on exoplanets. The Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), a single-dish telescope with 50\,m aperture proposed to be built in the Atacama desert in Chile, would be able to provide these observational capabilities. Equipped with a large number of detector elements for probing the radiation continuum across a wide frequency range, AtLAST would address a wide range of scientific topics including the thermal structure and heating of the solar chromosphere, flares and prominences, and the solar activity cycle. In this white paper, the key science cases and their technical requirements for AtLAST are discussed.</description>

      <title>Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) Science: The hidden circumgalactic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our knowledge of galaxy formation and evolution has incredibly progressed through multi-wavelength observational constraints of the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies at all cosmic epochs. However, little is known about the physical properties of the more diffuse and lower surface brightness reservoir of gas and dust that extends beyond ISM scales and fills dark matter haloes of galaxies up to their virial radii, the circumgalactic medium (CGM). New theoretical studies increasingly stress the relevance of the latter for understanding the feedback and feeding mechanisms that shape galaxies across cosmic times, whose cumulative effects leave clear imprints into the CGM. Recent studies are showing that a -- so far unconstrained -- fraction of the CGM mass may reside in the cold (T &lt; 1e4 K) molecular and atomic phase, especially in high-redshift dense environments. These gas phases, together with the warmer ionised phase, can be studied in galaxies from z ~ 0 to z ~ 10 through bright far-infrared and sub-millimeter emission lines such as [C II] 158${\mu}$m, [O III] 88 ${\mu}$m, [C I] 609${\mu}$m, [C I] 370${\mu}$m, and the rotational transitions of CO. Imaging such hidden cold CGM can lead to a breakthrough in galaxy evolution studies but requires a new facility with the specifications of the proposed Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST). In this paper, we use theoretical and empirical arguments to motivate future ambitious CGM observations with AtLAST and describe the technical requirements needed for the telescope and its instrumentation to perform such science.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the physical processes that regulate star formation and galaxy evolution are major areas of activity in modern astrophysics. Nearby galaxies offer unique opportunities to inspect interstellar medium (ISM), star formation (SF), radiative, dynamic and magnetic physics in great detail from sub-galactic (kpc) scales to sub-cloud (sub-pc) scales, from quiescent galaxies to starbursts, and from field galaxies to overdensities. In this case study, we discuss the major breakthroughs in this area of research that will be enabled by the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), a proposed 50-m single-dish submillimeter telescope. The new discovery space of AtLAST comes from its exceptional sensitivity, in particular to extended low surface brightness emission, a very large 2 degree field of view, and correspondingly high mapping efficiency. This paper focuses on four themes which will particularly benefit from AtLAST: 1) the LMC and SMC, 2) extragalactic magnetic fields, 3) the physics and chemistry of the interstellar medium, and 4) star formation and galaxy evolution. With ~1000-2000h surveys each, AtLAST could deliver deep dust continuum maps of the entire LMC and SMC fields at parsec-scale resolution, high-resolution maps of the magnetic field structure, gas density, temperature and composition of the dense and diffuse ISM in ~100 nearby galaxies, as well as the first large-scale blind CO survey in the nearby Universe, delivering molecular gas masses for up to 10^6 galaxies (3 orders of magnitude more than current samples). Through such observing campaigns, AtLAST will have a profound impact on our understanding of the baryon cycle and star formation across a wide range of environments.</description>

      <title>First-principle event reconstruction by time-charge readouts for the Taishan Antineutrino Observatory</title>

Abstract: The Taishan Antineutrino Observatory (TAO) is a liquid-scintillator satellite experiment of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) to measure the reference reactor neutrino spectrum with sub-percent energy resolution. We use inhomogeous Poisson process and Tweedie generalized linear model (GLM) to calibrate the detector response and the charge distribution of a SiPM. We develop a pure probabilistic method using time and charge of SiPMs from first principles to reconstruct point-like events in the TAO central detector. Thanks to our precise model and the high photo-coverage and quantum efficiency of the SiPM tiles at TAO, we achieve a vertex position resolution better than 16 mm and an energy resolution of about 2% at 1 MeV, marking the world's best performance of liquid scintillator detectors. Our methodology is applicable to other experiments that utilize PMTs for time and charge readouts.</description>

      <title>Time delay interferometry with minimal null frequencies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time delay interferometry (TDI) is a key technique employed in gravitational wave (GW) space missions to mitigate laser frequency noise by combining multiple laser links and establishing an equivalent equal arm interferometry. The null frequencies will be introduced in noise spectra and GW response when the periodical signal/noise is canceled in synthesized laser links. These frequencies are characteristic frequencies (CFs) of a TDI which related to its geometry of combination. In this work, we propose a second-generation TDI configuration referred to as hybrid Relay, whose CFs are only one-quarter that of the fiducial second-generation Michelson observables. We examine the performance of novel TDI configuration in laser noise cancellation and clock noise suppression and justify its essential capabilities. To assess its robustness for signal extraction, we simulate data containing GW signals from massive black hole binaries and perform parameter inferences with comparisons against the fiducial Michelson TDI configuration. The results demonstrate that the newly proposed TDI solution could be more robust than Michelson in fulfilling data analysis.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of binary black hole harmonics in LIGO using deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave signals from coalescing compact binaries in the LIGO and Virgo interferometers are primarily detected by the template based matched filtering method. While this method is optimal for stationary and Gaussian data scenarios, its sensitivity is often affected by non stationary noise transients in the detectors. Moreover, most of the current searches do not account for the effects of precession of black hole spins and higher order waveform harmonics, focusing solely on the leading order quadrupolar modes. This limitation impacts our search for interesting astrophysical sources, such as intermediate mass black hole binaries and hierarchical mergers. Here we show for the first time that deep learning can be used for accurate waveform reconstruction of precessing binary black hole signals with higher order modes. This approach can also be adapted into a rapid trigger generation algorithm to enhance online searches. Our model, tested on simulated injections in real LIGO noise from the third observing run achieved high-degree of overlap with injected signals. This accuracy was consistent across a wide range of black hole masses and spin configurations chosen for this study. When applied to real gravitational wave events, our reconstructions achieved between 0.85 and 0.98 overlaps with those obtained by Coherent WaveBurst (unmodeled) and LALInference (modeled) analyses. These results suggest that deep learning is a potent tool for analyzing signals from a diverse catalog of compact binaries.</description>

      <title>SATDI: Simulation and Analysis for Time-Delay Interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-delay interferometry (TDI) is essential for space-based gravitational wave (GW) missions to effectively suppress laser frequency noise and achieve targeting sensitivity. The principle of the TDI is to synthesize multiple laser link measurements between spacecraft and create virtual equal-arm interferometry. This process blends instrumental noises and tunes the response function to GW, yielding data characterized by TDI combinations. Extracting signals requires modeling GW signals under TDI operations in the frequency domain. In this work, we introduce a versatile framework, SATDI, which integrates simulation and analysis for TDI. The simulation aims to implement TDI to instrumental noises and GW signals, investigate influential factors in noise suppressions, and explore GW characterizations across different TDI configurations. The analysis component focuses on developing robust algorithms for modeling TDI responses to extract GWs and accurately determine source parameters. LISA is selected as the representative space mission to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. We simulate and analyze data containing GW signals from massive black hole binary coalescence, examining data from both first-generation and second-generation TDI Michelson configurations. The results not only validate the framework but also illustrate the influence of different factors on parameter estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The future Japanese project for the detection of gravitational waves in space is planned as DECIGO. To achieve various scientific missions, including the verification of cosmic inflation through the detection of primordial gravitational waves as the main objective, DECIGO is designed to have high sensitivity in the frequency band from $0.1$ to $1$ Hz, with arms of length 1000 km. Furthermore, the use of the Fabry-Perot cavity in these arms has been established for the DECIGO project. In this paper, we scrutinize the significance of the Fabry-Perot cavity for promoting this project, with a focus on the possibility of observing gravitational waves from cosmic inflation and binary compact star systems as indicators. The results show that using the Fabry-Perot cavity is extremely beneficial for detecting them, and it is anticipated to enable the opening of a new window in gravitational wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Towards atmospheric retrievals of panchromatic light-curves: ExPLOR-ing generalized inversion techniques for transiting exoplanets with JWST and Ariel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional atmospheric retrieval codes are designed to extract information, such as chemical abundances, thermal structures and cloud properties, from fully "reduced" spectra obtained during transit or eclipse. Reduced spectra, however, are assembled by fitting a series of simplified light-curves to time series observations, wavelength-by-wavelength. Thus, spectra are a post-processed summary statistics of the original data, which by definition does not encode all the available information (i.e., astrophysical signal, model covariance, instrumental noise). Here, we explore an alternative inversion strategy where the atmospheric retrieval is performed on the light-curve directly -- i.e., closer to the data. This method is implemented in ExPLOR (EXoplanet Panchromatic Light-curve Observation and Retrieval), a novel atmospheric retrieval code inheriting from the TauREx project. By explicitly considering time in the model, ExPLOR naturally handles transit, eclipse, phase-curve and other complex geometries for transiting exoplanets. In this paper, we have validated this new technique by inverting simulated panchromatic light-curves. The model was tested on realistic simulations of a WASP-43b like exoplanet as observed with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Ariel telescope. By comparing our panchromatic light-curve approach against conventional spectral retrievals on mock scenarios, we have identified key breaking points in information and noise propagation when employing past literature techniques. Throughout the paper, we discuss the importance of developing "closer-to-data" approaches such as the method presented in this work, and highlight the inevitable increase in model complexity and computing requirements associated with the recent JWST revolution.</description>

      <title>Astronomy in Colombia: a bibliometric perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Colombia, astronomical research is experiencing accelerated growth. In order to better understand its evolution and current state, we conducted a bibliometric study using data from the Astrophysics Data System (ADS) and Web of Science (WoS). In ADS, we identified 422 peer-reviewed publications from 1980, the year of the first publication, until 2023, which was the cutoff date for our study. Among the 25 Colombian institutions identified as participants in at least one publication, the contributions of four universities stand out: Universidad de los Andes, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Universidad Industrial de Santander, and Universidad de Antioquia, with 104, 78, 68, and 67 publications, respectively. By cross-referencing information from ADS and WoS, we found that the areas with the greatest impact in publications are threefold: high-energy and fundamental physics, stars and stellar physics, and galaxies and cosmology. Globally, according to WoS, Colombia ranks 52nd in the number of peer-reviewed publications between 2019 and 2023, and fifth in Latin America. Additionally, we identified three highly cited publications (top 1% worldwide) belonging to the field of observational cosmology. When analyzing countries with equal or greater bibliographic production, we estimate that Colombian production is approximately four times lower than expected considering its population and GDP.</description>

      <title>Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) Science: Planetary and Cometary Atmospheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of planets and small bodies within our Solar System is fundamental for understanding the formation and evolution the Earth and other planets. Compositional and meteorological studies of the giant planets provide a foundation for understanding the nature of the most commonly observed exoplanets, while spectroscopic observations of the atmospheres of terrestrial planets, moons, and comets provide insights into the past and present-day habitability of planetary environments, and the availability of the chemical ingredients for life. While prior and existing (sub)millimeter observations have led to major advances in these areas, progress is hindered by limitations in the dynamic range, spatial and temporal coverage, as well as sensitivity of existing telescopes and interferometers. Here, we summarize some of the key planetary science use cases that factor into the design of the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), a proposed 50-m class single dish facility: (1) to more fully characterize planetary wind fields and atmospheric thermal structures, (2) to measure the compositions of icy moon atmospheres and plumes, (3) to obtain detections of new, astrobiologically relevant gases and perform isotopic surveys of comets, and (4) to perform synergistic, temporally-resolved measurements in support of dedicated interplanetary space missions. The improved spatial coverage (several arcminutes), resolution ($\sim1.2''-12''$), bandwidth (several tens of GHz), dynamic range ($\sim10^5$) and sensitivity ($\sim1$~mK km s$^{-1}$) required by these science cases would enable new insights into the chemistry and physics of planetary environments, the origins of prebiotic molecules and the habitability of planetary systems in general.</description>

      <title>Design and performance of a Collimated Beam Projector for telescope transmission measurement using a broadband light source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae are the most direct cosmological probe to study dark energy in the recent Universe, for which the photometric calibration of astronomical instruments remains one major source of systematic uncertainties. To address this, recent advancements introduce Collimated Beam Projectors (CBP), aiming to enhance calibration by precisely measuring a telescope's throughput as a function of wavelength. This work describes the performance of a prototype portable CBP. The experimental setup consists of a broadband Xenon light source replacing a more customary but much more demanding high-power laser source, coupled with a monochromator emitting light inside an integrating sphere monitored with a photodiode and a spectrograph. Light is injected at the focus of the CBP telescope projecting a collimated beam onto a solar cell whose quantum efficiency has been obtained by comparison with a NIST-calibrated photodiode. The throughput and signal-to-noise ratio achieved by comparing the photocurrent signal in the CBP photodiode to the one in the solar cell are computed. We prove that the prototype, in its current state of development, is capable of achieving 1.2 per cent and 2.3 per cent precision on the integrated g and r bands of the ZTF photometric filter system respectively, in a reasonable amount of integration time. Central wavelength determination accuracy is kept below $\sim$ {0.91} nm and $\sim$ {0.58} nm for g and r bands. The expected photometric uncertainty caused by filter throughput measurement is approximately 5 mmag on the zero-point magnitude. Several straightforward improvement paths are discussed to upgrade the current setup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With significantly improved sensitivity, the Einstein Telescope (ET), along with other upcoming gravitational wave detectors, will mark the beginning of precision gravitational wave astronomy. However, the pursuit of surpassing current detector capabilities requires careful consideration of technical constraints inherent in existing designs. The significant improvement of ET lies in the low-frequency range, where it anticipates a one million-fold increase in sensitivity compared to current detectors. Angular control noise is a primary limitation for LIGO detectors in this frequency range, originating from the need to maintain optical alignment. Given the expected improvements in ET's low-frequency range, precise assessment of angular control noise becomes crucial for achieving target sensitivity. To address this, we developed a model of the angular control system of Advanced Virgo, closely matching experimental data and providing a robust foundation for modeling future-generation detectors. Our model, for the first time, enables replication of the measured coupling level between angle and length. Additionally, our findings confirm that Virgo, unlike LIGO, is not constrained by alignment control noise, even if the detector were operating at full power.</description>

      <title>Morphological Parameters and Associated Uncertainties for 8 Million Galaxies in the Hyper Suprime-Cam Wide Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.00051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the Galaxy Morphology Posterior Estimation Network (GaMPEN) to estimate morphological parameters and associated uncertainties for $\sim 8$ million galaxies in the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Wide survey with $z \leq 0.75$ and $m \leq 23$. GaMPEN is a machine learning framework that estimates Bayesian posteriors for a galaxy's bulge-to-total light ratio ($L_B/L_T$), effective radius ($R_e$), and flux ($F$). By first training on simulations of galaxies and then applying transfer learning using real data, we trained GaMPEN with $&lt;1\%$ of our dataset. This two-step process will be critical for applying machine learning algorithms to future large imaging surveys, such as the Rubin-Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (NGRST), and Euclid. By comparing our results to those obtained using light-profile fitting, we demonstrate that GaMPEN's predicted posterior distributions are well-calibrated ($\lesssim 5\%$ deviation) and accurate. This represents a significant improvement over light profile fitting algorithms which underestimate uncertainties by as much as $\sim60\%$. For an overlapping sub-sample, we also compare the derived morphological parameters with values in two external catalogs and find that the results agree within the limits of uncertainties predicted by GaMPEN. This step also permits us to define an empirical relationship between the S\'ersic index and $L_B/L_T$ that can be used to convert between these two parameters. The catalog presented here represents a significant improvement in size ($\sim10 \times $), depth ($\sim4$ magnitudes), and uncertainty quantification over previous state-of-the-art bulge+disk decomposition catalogs. With this work, we also release GaMPEN's source code and trained models, which can be adapted to other datasets.</description>

      <title>Small amplitude red giants elucidate the nature of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch as a standard candle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) is an important standard candle for determining luminosity distances. Although several $10^5$ small amplitude red giant stars (SARGs) have been discovered, variability was previously considered irrelevant for the TRGB as a standard candle. Here, we show that all stars near the TRGB are SARGs that follow several period-luminosity sequences, of which sequence A is younger than sequence B as predicted by stellar evolution. We measure apparent TRGB magnitudes, m$_{\mathrm{TRGB}}$, in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), using Sobel filters applied to photometry from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment and the ESA Gaia mission, and we identify several weaknesses in a recent LMC-based TRGB calibration used to measure the Hubble constant. We consider four samples: all Red Giants (RGs), SARGs, and sequences A &amp; B. The B-sequence is best suited for measuring distances to old RG populations, with M$_{\mathrm{F814W,0}}$ = -4.025 $\pm$ 0.014(stat.) $\pm$ 0.033(syst.) mag assuming the LMC's geometric distance. Control of systematics is demonstrated using detailed simulations. Population diversity affects m$_{\mathrm{TRGB}}$ at a level exceeding the stated precision: the SARG and A-sequence samples yield 0.039 mag and 0.085 mag fainter (at 5{\sigma} significance) m$_{\mathrm{TRGB}}$ values, respectively. Ensuring equivalent RG populations is crucial to measuring accurate TRGB distances. Additionally, luminosity function smoothing ($\sim$ 0.02 mag) and edge detection response weighting (as much as -0.06 mag) can further bias TRGB measurements, with the latter introducing a tip-contrast relation. We are optimistic that variable red giants will enable further improvements to the TRGB as a standard candle.</description>

      <title>Spectral method for metric perturbations of black holes: Kerr background case in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach, $\textit{Metric pErTuRbations wIth speCtral methodS}$ (METRICS), to calculate the gravitational metric perturbations and the quasinormal-mode frequencies of rotating black holes of any spin without decoupling the linearized field equations. We demonstrate the method by applying it to perturbations of Kerr black holes of any spin, simultaneously solving all ten linearized Einstein equations in the Regge-Wheeler gauge through purely algebraic methods and computing the fundamental (co-rotating) quadrupole mode frequency at various spins. We moreover show that the METRICS approach is accurate and precise, yielding (i) quasinormal mode frequencies that agree with Leaver's, continuous-fraction solution with a relative fractional error smaller than $10^{-5}$ for all dimensionless spins below up to 0.95, and (ii) metric perturbations that lead to Teukolsky functions that also agree with Leaver's solution with mismatches below $1\%$ for all spins below 0.9. By not requiring the decoupling or the angular separation of the linearized field equations, the METRICS approach has the potential to be straightforwardly adapted for the computation of the quasinormal-mode frequencies of rotating black holes of any spin beyond general relativity or in the presence of matter.</description>

      <title>Bayesian power spectral estimation of gravitational wave detector noise revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11808</link>

Abstract: The analysis of gravitational wave interferometer data requires estimates for the noise covariance matrix. For stationary noise, this amounts to estimating the power spectrum. Classical methods such as Welch averaging are used in many analyses, but this method require large stretches of ``off-source'' data, where the assumption of stationarity may break down. For this reason, Bayesian spectral estimates using only ``on-source'' data are becoming more widely used, but the Bayesian approach tends to be slower, and more computationally expensive than classical methods. Here we introduce numerous improvements in speed and performance for the BayesWave trans-dimensional Bayesian spectral estimation algorithm, and introduce a new, low-latency fixed dimension Bayesian spectral estimation algorithm, FastSpec, which serves as both a starting point for the BayesWave analysis, and as a stand-alone fast spectral estimation tool. The performance of the Welch, BayesWave and FastSpec algorithms are compared by applying statistical tests for normality to the whitened frequency domain data. Bayesian spectral estimation methods are shown to significantly outperform the classical approach.</description>

      <title>The Binary Broadening Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an extended formalism for the spectral broadening function (BF) based on the multiplication rule of block matrices. The formalism, which we named the binary broadening function (BBF), can produce decomposed BFs for individual components of a binary star system by using two spectral templates. The decomposed BFs can be used to derive precise rotational profiles and radial velocities for individual components. We test the BBF on simulated spectra and actual observational spectra to show that the method is feasible on spectroscopic binaries, even when the spectral lines of two stellar components are heavily blended. To demonstrate the capability of the method, we conduct a simulation of `sketching' (imaging) a transiting circumbinary exoplanet using the BBF. We also discuss issues of implementation such as the variation of BBF with biased templates, the pros and cons of BBF, and cases when the method is not applicable.</description>

      <title>How do wavelength correlations affect transmission spectra? Application of a new fast and flexible 2D Gaussian process framework to transiting exoplanet spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of Gaussian processes (GPs) is a common approach to account for correlated noise in exoplanet time series, particularly for transmission and emission spectroscopy. This analysis has typically been performed for each wavelength channel separately, with the retrieved uncertainties in the transmission spectrum assumed to be independent. However, the presence of noise correlated in wavelength could cause these uncertainties to be correlated, which could significantly affect the results of atmospheric retrievals. We present a method that uses a GP to model noise correlated in both wavelength and time simultaneously for the full spectroscopic dataset while avoiding the use of a 'common-mode' correction. To make this analysis computationally tractable, we introduce a new fast and flexible GP method that can analyse 2D datasets when the input points lie on a (potentially non-uniform) 2D grid - in our case a time by wavelength grid - and the kernel function has a Kronecker product structure. This simultaneously fits all light curves and enables the retrieval of the covariance matrix of the transmission spectrum. By testing on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that our new approach can reliably recover atmospheric features contaminated by noise correlated in time and wavelength. In contrast, fitting each spectroscopic light curve separately performed poorly when wavelength-correlated noise was present. It frequently underestimated the uncertainty of the scattering slope and overestimated the uncertainty in the strength of sharp absorption peaks in transmission spectra. Two archival VLT/FORS2 transit observations of WASP-31b were re-analysed, with our method strongly constraining the presence of wavelength-correlated noise in both datasets and recovering significantly different constraints on atmospheric features such as the scattering slope and strength of sodium and potassium features.</description>
