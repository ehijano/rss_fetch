      <title>Self-Supervised Diffusion Model for 3-D Seismic Data Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic data reconstruction is an effective tool for compensating nonuniform and incomplete seismic geometry. Compared with methods for 2D seismic data, 3D reconstruction methods could consider more spatial structure correlation in seismic data. In the early studies, 3D reconstruction methods are mainly theory-driven and have some limitations due to their prior assumptions on the seismic data. To release these limitations, deep learning-based reconstruction methods rise and show potential in dealing with reconstruction problems. However, there are mainly two shortcomings in existing deep learning-methods. On the one hand, most of existing deep learning-based methods adopt the convolutional neural network, having some difficulties in dealing with data with complex or time-varying distributions. Recently, the diffusion model has been reported to possess the capability to solve data with complex distributions by gradually complicating the distribution of data to optimize the network. On the other hand, existing methods need enough paired-data to train the network, which are very hard to obtain especially for the starved 3D seismic data. Deep prior-based unsupervised and sampling-based self-supervised networks offer an available solution to this problem. In this paper, we develop a self-supervised diffusion model (S2DM) for 3D seismic data reconstruction. The proposed model mainly contains a diffusion restoration model and a variational time-spatial module. Extensive synthetic and field experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed S2DM algorithm.</description>

      <title>Climate control in termite mounds: A review and new insights from X-ray tomography and flow field simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating the thermoregulation and ventilation processes in termite mound holds great interest, in particular for its potential implications in advancing eco-friendly building designs. In this article we discuss major results on these processes in termite mounds of varying sizes and ventilation types. Additionally, we propose the integration of X-ray tomography to gain insights into the contribution of architectural features of termite mounds to thermoregulation and ventilation. Finally, we assess the contributions of numerical flow field simulations to this research domain. Our objective is to consolidate existing knowledge, identify research gaps, and propose an interdisciplinary approach to foster our understanding of temperature regulation and gas exchange in termite mounds.</description>

      <title>Energy Mapping of Existing Building Stock in Cambridge using Energy Performance Certificates and Thermal Infrared Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy performance certificate (EPC) and thermal infrared (TIR) images both play a key role in the energy performance mapping of the urban building stock. In this paper, we developed parametric building archetypes using an EPC database and conducted temperature clustering on TIR images acquired through drones and satellite datasets. We evaluated 1725 EPCs of existing building stock in Cambridge, UK to generate energy consumption profiles. Drone-based TIR images of individual buildings in two Cambridge University colleges were processed using a machine learning pipeline for thermal anomaly detection and investigated the influence of two specific factors that affect the reliability of TIR for energy management applications: ground sample distance (GSD) and angle of view (AOV). The EPC-level results suggest that the construction year of the buildings influences their energy consumption. For example, modern buildings were over 30% more energy-efficient than older ones. Parallelly, older buildings were found to show almost double the energy savings potential through retrofitting than newly constructed buildings. TIR imaging results showed that thermal anomalies can only be properly identified in images with a GSD of 1m/pixel or less. A GSD of 1-6m/pixel can detect hot areas of building surfaces. We found that a GSD &gt; 6m/pixel cannot characterise individual buildings but does help identify urban heat island effects. Additional sensitivity analysis showed that building thermal anomaly detection is more sensitive to AOV than to GSD. Our study informs newer approaches to building energy diagnostics using thermography and supports decision-making for retrofitting at a large scale.</description>

      <title>Elasticity and acoustic velocities of $\delta$-AlOOH at extreme conditions: a methodology assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrous phases play a fundamental role in the deep-water cycle on Earth. Understanding their stability and thermoelastic properties is essential for constraining their abundance using seismic tomography. However, determining their elastic properties at extreme conditions is notoriously challenging. The challenges stem from the complex behavior of hydrogen bonds under high pressures and temperatures (P,Ts). In this study, we evaluate how advanced molecular dynamics simulation techniques can address these challenges by investigating the adiabatic elasticity and acoustic velocities of $\delta$-AlOOH, a critical and prototypical high-pressure hydrous phase. We compared the performances of three methods to assess their viability and accuracy. The thermoelastic tensor was computed up to 140 GPa and temperatures up to 2,700 K using molecular dynamics with a DeePMD machine-learning interatomic potential based on the SCAN meta-GGA functional. The excellent agreement with ambient condition single-crystal ultrasound measurements and the correct description of velocity changes induced by H-bond disorder-symmetrization transition observed at 10 GPa in Brillouin scattering measurements underscores the accuracy and efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of a Long-term spatially Contiguous Solar-Induced Fluorescence (LCSIF) over 1982-2022</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Satellite-observed solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a powerful proxy for diagnosing the photosynthetic characteristics of terrestrial ecosystems. Despite the increasing spatial and temporal resolutions of these satellite retrievals, records of SIF are primarily limited to the recent decade, impeding their application in detecting long-term dynamics of ecosystem function and structure. In this study, we leverage the two surface reflectance bands (red and near-infrared) available both from Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR, 1982-2022) and MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, 2001-2022). Importantly, we calibrate and orbit-correct the AVHRR bands against their MODIS counterparts during their overlapping period. Using the long-term bias-corrected reflectance data, a neural network is then built to reproduce the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 SIF using AVHRR and MODIS, and used to map SIF globally over the entire 1982-2022 period. Compared with the previous MODIS-based CSIF product relying on four reflectance bands, our two-band-based product has similar skill but can be advantageously extended to the bias-corrected AVHRR period. Further comparison with three widely used vegetation indices (NDVI, kNDVI, NIRv; all based empirically on red and near-infrared bands) shows a higher or comparable correlation of LCSIF with satellite SIF and site-level GPP estimates across vegetation types, ensuring a greater capacity of LCSIF for representing terrestrial photosynthesis. Globally, LCSIF-AVHRR shows an accelerating upward trend since 1982, with an average rate of 0.0025 mW m-2 nm-1 sr-1 per decade during 1982-2000 and 0.0038 mW m-2 nm-1 sr-1 per decade during 2001-2022. Our LCSIF data provide opportunities to better understand the long-term dynamics of ecosystem photosynthesis and their underlying driving processes.</description>

      <title>Mapping finite-fault slip with spatial correlation between seismicity and point-source Coulomb failure stress change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most earthquake energy release arises during fault slip many kilometers below the Earth's surface. Understanding earthquakes and their hazard requires mapping the geometry and distribution of this slip. Such finite-fault maps are typically derived from surface phenomena, such as seismic and geodetic ground motions. Here we introduce an imaging procedure for mapping finite-fault slip directly from seismicity and aftershocks - phenomena occurring at depth around an earthquake rupture. For specified source and receiver faults, we map source-fault slip in 3D by correlation of point-source Coulomb failure stress change (${\Delta}$CFS) kernels across the distribution of seismicity around an earthquake. These seismicity-stress maps show relative, static fault slip compatible with the surrounding seismicity given the physics of ${\Delta}$CFS; they can aid other slip inversions and aftershock forecasting, and be obtained for early instrumental earthquakes. We verify this procedure recovers synthetic fault slip, and matches independent estimates of slip for the 2004 Mw 6.0 Parkfield and 2021 Mw 6.0 Antelope Valley California earthquakes. For the 2018 Mw 7.1 Anchorage Alaska intra-slab earthquake, seismicity-stress maps, combined with multi-scale precise hypocenter relocation, resolve the enigma of which mainshock faulting plane ruptured (the gently east-dipping plane), and clarify slab structures activated in the energetic aftershock sequence.</description>

      <title>Nowcasting Earthquakes with QuakeGPT: Methods and First Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Earthquake nowcasting has been proposed as a means of tracking the change in large earthquake potential in a seismically active area. The method was developed using observable seismic data, in which probabilities of future large earthquakes can be computed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) methods. Furthermore, analysis of the Shannon information content of the earthquake catalogs has been used to show that there is information contained in the catalogs, and that it can vary in time. Here we discuss a new method for earthquake nowcasting that uses an AI-enhanced deep learning model "QuakeGPT" that is based on an attention-based science transformer adapted for time series forecasting. Such dot product attention-based transformers were introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017), and are the basis for the new large language models such as ChatGPT. To use these science transformers, they must first be trained on a large corpus of data. A problem is that the existing history of reliable earthquake catalog data extends back in time only a few decades, which is almost certainly too short to train a model for reliable nowcasting/forecasting. As a result, we turn to earthquake simulations to train the transformer model. Specifically we discuss a simple stochastic earthquake simulation model "ERAS" that has recently been introduced. The ERAS model is similar to the more common "ETAS" models, the difference being that the ERAS model has only 2 novel, adjustable parameters, rather than the 6-8 adjustable parameters that characterize most ETAS models. Using this ERAS model, we then define a transformer model and train it using a long catalog of ERAS simulations, then apply it to an ERAS validation dataset with the transformer model. In this paper, we describe this new method and assess the applicability to observed earthquake catalogs for use in nowcasting/forecasting.</description>
