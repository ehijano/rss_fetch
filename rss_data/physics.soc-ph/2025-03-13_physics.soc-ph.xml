      <title>Spontaneous gait synchronisation in the wild: exploring the effect of distance and level of interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08967v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gait synchronization in pedestrians is influenced by biomechanical, environmental, and cognitive factors. Studying gait in ecological settings provides insights often missed in controlled experiments. This study tackles the challenges of assessing gait coordination in real-world interactions using a dataset of uninstructed pedestrian trajectories recorded in an underground pedestrian street network. The data are annotated for group relations, interaction levels, and physical contact. The main goals of our study is to devise a method to identify gait synchronisation from trajectory data and to provide an in-depth analysis of social factors affecting gait synchronisation in pedestrian groups. To that end, we first propose a method to extract gait residuals from pedestrian trajectories, which capture motion of the body caused by gait-induced oscillations. We thereafter apply a suite of analytical techniques spanning both frequency and nonlinear domains. Frequency-based methods, including the Gait Synchronisation Index and Cross Wavelet Coherence, quantify the alignment of oscillatory patterns in gait. Complementary nonlinear measures, such as Lyapunov exponents, determinism, and recurrence quantification metrics, offer deeper insights into the dynamical stability and predictability of coupled gaits. Results show that higher social interaction and closer distances enhance gait synchronization, reducing stride frequency variation and increasing stability. Additionally, triad formation and relative positioning are shown to influence synchronisation. Overall, our findings suggest that social interactions shape pedestrian gait coordination, with interaction level and distance being key factors.</description>

      <title>Universality classes in the time evolution of epidemic outbreaks on complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the temporal evolution of epidemic outbreaks in complex networks and identify two distinct universality classes governing their spreading dynamics. Using analytical arguments and large-scale simulations of the susceptible-infected (SI) model, we show that epidemic prevalence follows either a Gompertz-like curve in small-world networks or an Avrami-like curve in fractal complex networks. These findings challenge the traditional mean-field prediction of early-stage exponential growth of infections and highlight the crucial role of network topology in shaping epidemic dynamics. Our results demonstrate that the widely used mean-field approximation, even in its heterogeneous form, fails to accurately describe epidemic spreading, as the assumption of early exponential growth is not justified in either universality class. Additionally, we show that in fractal networks, the basic reproduction number loses its traditional predictive power, as the spreading dynamics are instead governed by microscopic scaling exponents of the network's self-similar structure. This shift underscores the need to revise classical epidemiological models when applied to systems with fractal topology. Our findings provide a refined theoretical framework for modeling spreading processes in complex networks, offering new perspectives for epidemic prediction and control.</description>

      <title>Study on Dynamical Behavior of Coinfection Infectious Disease Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper conducts research on the established model and presents the main conclusions . Firstly, by separately considering the infectivity of each of the two infectious diseases and the infectivity of the population simultaneously infected with the two infectious diseases, the existence of three types of boundary equilibrium points is determined, as well as the existence of the interior equilibrium point when the parameters are under specific conditions. Then, the stability of the equilibrium points is analyzed. It is concluded that under different parameter conditions, the stability of the disease free equilibrium point can exhibit various scenarios, such as a stable node or a saddle-node, etc. For the boundary equilibrium points, the situation is more intricate,and a cusp may occur. The stability of the interior equilibrium point under specific conditions is also presented. Finally,the degeneracy of the equilibrium points is studied through the bifurcation theory.Mainly, the saddle-node bifurcation occurring at the interior equilibrium point is obtained, and when the infection rate of the first infectious disease, the infection rate of the second infectious disease, and the infection rate of the co-infected population to other populations are selected as bifurcation parameters, a codimension 3 B-T bifurcation is obtained.</description>

      <title>Near-future projections in continuous agent-based models for crowd dynamics: mathematical structures in use and their implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12798v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the theoretical foundations of pedestrian models for crowd dynamics. While the topic gains momentum, current models differ widely in their mathematical structure, even if we only consider continuous agent-based models. To clarify their underpinning, we first lay the mathematical foundations of the common hierarchical decomposition into strategic, tactical, and operational levels and underline the practical interest in preserving the continuity between the latter two levels by working with a floor field, rather than way-points. Turning to local navigation, we clarify how three archetypical approaches, namely, purely reactive models, anticipatory models based on the idea of times to collision, and game theory, differ in the way they extrapolate trajectories in the near future. We also insist on the oft-overlooked distinction between processes pertaining to decision-making and physical contact forces. The implications of these differences are illustrated with a comparison of the numerical predictions of these models in the simple scenario of head-on collision avoidance between agents, by varying the walking speed, the reaction times, and the degree of courtesy of the agents, notably.</description>

      <title>Symmetries, Scaling Laws and Phase Transitions in Consumer Advertising Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02175v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how consumers respond to business advertising efforts is essential for optimizing marketing investment. This research introduces a new modeling approach based on the concepts of symmetries and scaling laws in physics to describe consumer response to advertising dynamics. Drawing from mathematical frameworks used in physics and social sciences, we propose a model that accounts for a key aspect: the saturation effect. The model is validated against commonly used models, including the Michaelis-Menten and Hill equations, showing its ability to better capture nonlinearities in advertising effects. We introduce new key parameters like Marketing Sensitivity, Response Sensitivity, and Behavioral Sensitivit, that offer additional insights into the drivers of audience engagement and advertising performance. Our model provides a rigorous yet practical tool for understanding audience behavior, contributing to the improvement of budget allocation strategies.</description>

      <title>Enforcing Katz and PageRank Centrality Measures in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of enforcing a desired centrality measure in complex networks, while still keeping the original pattern of the network. Specifically, by representing the network as a graph with suitable nodes and weighted edges, we focus on computing the smallest perturbation on the weights required to obtain a prescribed PageRank or Katz centrality index for the nodes. Our approach relies on optimization procedures that scale with the number of modified edges, enabling the exploration of different scenarios and altering network structure and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Coalescing Force of Group Pressure: Consensus in Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04301v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work extends the recent opinion dynamics model from Cheng et al., emphasizing the role of group pressure in consensus formation. We generalize the findings to incorporate social influence algorithms with general time-varying, opinion-dependent weights and multidimensional opinions, beyond bounded confidence dynamics. We demonstrate that, with uniformly positive conformity levels, group pressure consistently drives consensus and provide a tighter estimate for the convergence rate. Unlike previous models, the common public opinion in our framework can assume arbitrary forms within the convex hull of current opinions, offering flexibility applicable to real-world scenarios such as opinion polls with random participant selection. This analysis provides deeper insights into how group pressure mechanisms foster consensus under diverse conditions.</description>

      <title>Topological Components in a Community Currency Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transaction data from digital payment systems can be used to study economic processes in such detail that was not possible previously. Here, data from the Sarafu token network, a Community Inclusion Currency in Kenya, is analysed. During the COVID-19 emergency, Sarafu was distributed as part of a humanitarian aid project. In this work, the transactions are analysed using network science. A topological categorisation is defined to identify cyclic and acyclic components. Furthermore, temporal aspects of the circulation that takes place within these components are considered. The significant presence of different types of strongly connected components compared to randomised null models shows the importance of cycles in this economic network. Especially, indicating their key role in currency recirculation. In some acyclic components, the most significant triad suggests the presence of a group of users collecting currency from accounts that are active only once, hinting at a possible misuse of the system. In some other acyclic components, small isolated groups of users were active only once, suggesting the presence of users only interested in trying the system out. The methods used in this paper can answer specific questions related to user activities, currency design, and assessment of monetary interventions. The methodology provides a general quantitative tool to analyse the behaviour of users in a currency network.</description>
