      <title>Elliptical stability of hopfions in bulk helimagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic hopfions are three-dimensional topological solitons with non-zero Hopf index ${\cal H}$ in the vector field of material's local magnetization. In this Letter elliptical stability of hopfions with ${\cal H}=1$ in a classical helimagnet is studied on the basis of a variational model. It is shown that, depending on their internal structure (vortex and antivortex tubes ordering), the hopfions can either be stable in a bulk magnet or unstable with respect to elongation along their central axis. It is found that the energy of stable hopfions is always below the energy of the $2\pi$-skyrmion lattice in the same material, suggesting the possibility to use $2\pi$-skyrmions as a precursor for hopfion nucleation. Stability diagram for hopfions on the magnetic anisotropy-field phase diagram is computed numerically. Explicit analytical expressions for some of its critical lines are derived.</description>

      <title>On the Fractional Dynamics of Kinks in sine-Gordon Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work we explore the dynamics of single kinks, kink-anti-kink pairs and bound states in the prototypical fractional Klein-Gordon example of the sine-Gordon equation. In particular, we modify the order $\beta$ of the temporal derivative to that of a Caputo fractional type and find that, for $1&lt;\beta&lt;2$, this imposes a dissipative dynamical behavior on the coherent structures. We also examine the variation of a fractional Riesz order $\alpha$ on the spatial derivative. Here, depending on whether this order is below or above the harmonic value $\alpha=2$, we find, respectively, monotonically attracting kinks, or non-monotonic and potentially attracting or repelling kinks, with a saddle equilibrium separating the two. Finally, we also explore the interplay of the two derivatives, when both Caputo temporal and Riesz spatial derivatives are involved.</description>

      <title>Influence of density-dependent diffusion on pattern formation in a bounded habitat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11638v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considering a nonlocal version of the Fisher-KPP equation, we explore the impact of heterogeneous diffusion on pattern formation within a bounded region (refuge). Under homogeneous diffusion, it is established that, nonlocality can lead to spontaneous pattern formation under certain parameter conditions, otherwise, when the homogeneous state is stable, spatial perturbations such as the existence of a refuge (high quality region within a hostile environment) can induce patterns. To understand how density-dependent diffusivity influences these forms of pattern formation, we examine diffusivity reactions to both rarefaction or overcrowding. Additionally, for comparison, we investigate the scenario where diffusivity levels vary spatially, inside and outside the refuge. We find that state-dependent diffusivity affects the shape and stability of patterns, potentially triggering either explosive growth or fragmentation of the population distribution, depending on how diffusion responses to density changes.</description>

      <title>Practical realization of chiral nonlinearity for strong topological protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear topology has been much less inquired compared to its linear counterpart. Existing advances have focused on nonlinearities of limited magnitudes and fairly homogeneous types. As such, the realizations have rarely been concerned with the requirements for nonlinearity. Here we explore nonlinear topological protection by determining nonlinear rules and demonstrate their relevance in real-world experiments. We take advantage of chiral symmetry and identify the condition for its continuation in general nonlinear environments. Applying it to one-dimensional topological lattices, we show possible evolution paths for zero-energy edge states that preserve topologically nontrivial phases regardless of the specifics of the chiral nonlinearities. Based on an acoustic prototype design with non-local nonlinearities, we theoretically, numerically, and experimentally implement the nonlinear topological edge states that persist in all nonlinear degrees and directions without any frequency shift. Our findings unveil a broad family of nonlinearities compatible with topological non-triviality, establishing a solid ground for future drilling in the emergent field of nonlinear topology.</description>
