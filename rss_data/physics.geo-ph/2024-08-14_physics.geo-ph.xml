      <title>Low inertia reversing geodynamos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convection driven geodynamo models in rotating spherical geometry have regimes in which reversals occur. However, reversing dynamo models are usually found in regimes where the kinetic and magnetic energy is comparable, so that inertia is playing a significant role in the dynamics. In the Earth's core, the Rossby number is very small, and the magnetic energy is much larger than the kinetic energy. Here we investigate dynamo models in the strong field regime, where magnetic forces have a significant effect on convection. In the core, the strong field is achieved by having the magnetic Prandtl number Pm small, but the Ekman number E extremely small. In simulations, very small E is not possible, but the strong field regime can be reached by increasing Pm. However, if Pm is raised while the fluid Prandtl number is fixed at unity, the most common choice, the Peclet number number becomes small, so that the linear terms in the heat (or composition) equation dominate, which is also far from Earth-like behaviour. Here we increase Pr and Pm together, so that nonlinearity is important in the heat equation and the dynamo is strong field. We find that Earth-like reversals are possible at numerically achievable parameter values, and the simulations have Earth-like magnetic fields away from the times at which it reverses. The magnetic energy is much greater than the kinetic energy except close to reversal times.</description>

      <title>Detection and tracking of barchan dunes using Artificial Intelligence</title>

Abstract: Barchans are crescent-shape dunes ubiquitous on Earth and other celestial bodies, which are organized in barchan fields where they interact with each other. Over the last decades, satellite images have been largely employed to detect barchans on Earth and on the surface of Mars, with AI (Artificial Intelligence) becoming an important tool for monitoring those bedforms. However, automatic detection reported in previous works is limited to isolated dunes and does not identify successfully groups of interacting barchans. In this paper, we inquire into the automatic detection and tracking of barchans by carrying out experiments and exploring the acquired images using AI. After training a neural network with images from controlled experiments where complex interactions took place between dunes, we did the same for satellite images from Earth and Mars. We show, for the first time, that a neural network trained properly can identify and track barchans interacting with each other in different environments, using different image types (contrasts, colors, points of view, resolutions, etc.), with confidence scores (accuracy) above 70%. Our results represent a step further for automatically monitoring barchans, with important applications for human activities on Earth, Mars and other celestial bodies.</description>

      <title>Lightning declines over shipping lanes following regulation of fuel sulfur emissions</title>

Abstract: Aerosol interactions with clouds represent a significant uncertainty in our understanding of the Earth system. Deep convective clouds may respond to aerosol perturbations in several ways that have proven difficult to elucidate with observations. Here, we leverage the two busiest maritime shipping lanes in the world, which emit aerosol particles and their precursors into an otherwise relatively clean tropical marine boundary layer, to make headway on the influence of aerosol on deep convective clouds. The recent seven-fold change in allowable fuel sulfur by the International Maritime Organization allows us to test the sensitivity of the lightning to changes in ship plume aerosol size distributions. We find that, across a range of atmospheric thermodynamic conditions, the previously documented enhancement of lightning over the shipping lanes has fallen by over 40\%. The enhancement is therefore at least partially aerosol-mediated, a conclusion that is supported by observations of droplet number at cloud base, which show a similar decline over the shipping lane. These results have fundamental implications for our understanding of aerosol-cloud interactions, suggesting that deep convective clouds are impacted by the aerosol number distribution in the remote marine environment.</description>

      <title>The physical mechanism of the streaming instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main hurdle of planet formation theory is the metre-scale barrier. One of the most promising ways to overcome it is via the streaming instability (SI). Unfortunately, the mechanism responsible for the onset of this instability remains mysterious. It has recently been shown that the SI is a Resonant Drag Instability (RDI) involving inertial waves. We build on this insight and clarify the physical picture of how the SI develops, while bolstering this picture with transparent mathematics. Like all RDIs, the SI is built on a feedback loop: in the `forward action', an inertial wave concentrates dust into clumps; in the `backward reaction', those drifting dust clumps excite an inertial wave. Each process breaks into two mechanisms, a fast one and a slow one. At resonance, each forward mechanism can couple with a backward mechanism to close a feedback loop. Unfortunately, the fast-fast loop is stable, so the SI uses the fast-slow and slow-fast loops. Despite this last layer of complexity, we hope that our explanation will help understand how the SI works, in which conditions it can grow, how it manifests itself, and how it saturates.</description>

      <title>Barchan-barchan dune repulsion investigated at the grain scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Barchans are eolian dunes of crescent shape found on Earth, Mars and other celestial bodies. Among the different types of barchan-barchan interaction, there is one, known as chasing, in which the dunes remain close but without touching each other. In this paper, we investigate the origins of this barchan-barchan dune repulsion by carrying out grain-scale numerical computations in which a pair of granular heaps is deformed by the fluid flow into barchan dunes that interact with each other. In our simulations, data such as position, velocity and resultant force are computed for each individual particle at each time step, allowing us to measure details of both the fluid and grains that explain the repulsion. We show the trajectories of grains, time-average resultant forces, and mass balances for each dune, and that the downstream barchan shrinks faster than the upstream one, keeping, thus, a relatively high velocity although in the wake of the upstream barchan. In its turn, this fast shrinkage is caused by the flow disturbance, which induces higher erosion on the downstream barchan and its circumvention by grains leaving the upstream dune. Our results help explaining the mechanisms behind the distribution of barchans in dune fields found on Earth and Mars.</description>

      <title>Magnetic signals from oceanic tides: new satellite observations and applications</title>

Abstract: Tidal flow of seawater across the Earth's magnetic field induces electric currents and magnetic fields within the ocean and solid Earth. The amplitude and phase of the induced fields depends on electrical properties of both the seawater and the solid Earth, thus can be used as a proxy to study seabed properties or potentially for monitoring long-term trends in the global ocean climatology. This paper presents new global oceanic tidal magnetic field models and their uncertainties for four tidal constituents, including $M_2, N_2, O_1$ and for the first time $Q_1$. Models are obtained through a robust least-squares analysis of magnetic field observations from the \textit{Swarm} and CHAMP satellites using a specially designed data selection scheme. We compare the retrieved magnetic signals with several alternative models reported in the literature. Additionally, we validate them using a series of high-resolution global 3-D electromagnetic simulations and place constraints on the conductivity of sub-oceanic mantle for all tidal constituents, revealing an excellent agreement between all tidal constituents and the oceanic upper mantle structure.</description>

      <title>Data Science for Geographic Information Systems</title>

Abstract: The integration of data science into Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has facilitated the evolution of these tools into complete spatial analysis platforms. The adoption of machine learning and big data techniques has equipped these platforms with the capacity to handle larger amounts of increasingly complex data, transcending the limitations of more traditional approaches. This work traces the historical and technical evolution of data science and GIS as fields of study, highlighting the critical points of convergence between domains, and underlining the many sectors that rely on this integration. A GIS application is presented as a case study in the disaster management sector where we utilize aerial data from Tr\'oia, Portugal, to emphasize the process of insight extraction from raw data. We conclude by outlining prospects for future research in integration of these fields in general, and the developed application in particular.</description>
