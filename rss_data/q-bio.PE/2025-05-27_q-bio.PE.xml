      <title>Computing phylogenetic invariants for time-reversible models: from TN93 to its submodels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phylogenetic invariants are equations that vanish on algebraic varieties associated with Markov processes that model molecular substitutions on phylogenetic trees. For practical applications, it is essential to understand these equations across a wide range of substitution models. Recent work has shown that, for equivariant models, phylogenetic invariants can be derived from those of the general Markov model by restricting to the linear space defined by the model (namely, the space of mixtures of distributions on the model). Following this philosophy, we describe the space of mixtures and phylogenetic invariants for time-reversible models that are not equivariant. Specifically, we study two submodels of the Tamura-Nei nucleotide substitution model (Felsenstein 81 and 84) using an orthogonal change of basis recently introduced for algebraic time-reversible models.
  For tripods, we prove that the algebraic variety of each submodel coincides with the variety of Tamura-Nei intersected with the linear space of the submodel. In the case of quartets, we show that it is an irreducible component of this intersection. Moreover, we demonstrate that it suffices to consider only the binomial equations defining the linear space, which correspond to the natural symmetries of the model in the new coordinates. For each submodel, we explicitly provide equations defining a local complete intersection that characterizes the phylogenetic variety on a dense open subset containing the biologically relevant points.</description>

      <title>Response to comment on Mutualism weaken the latitudinal diversity gradient among oceanic islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our original paper (Delavaux et al. 2024; https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07110-y), we find that the latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) in plant species richness is reduced on oceanic islands worldwide. Moreover, we find that plants that associate with mutualists, including pollinators, AM fungi, and N-fixing bacteria, disproportionately contribute to this reduction. To make this assertion, we fit models of continental diversity to absolute latitude and compared mainland diversity estimated by these models to the observed diversity of individual islands. The critique of our work by Pitcher and Hartig (arXiv:2411.15105) questions our results through a reanalysis of the data. In their reanalysis, they add longitude as a predictor of richness on islands. However, we have several concerns about this reanalysis. In particular, we question (1) the biological/physical basis of predicting species richness with longitude as well as modelling non-linear relationships potentially leading to spurious relationships and (2) the justification for how this comment calculated island deficits from the data. Additionally, (3) described analyses and provided code (https://github.com/MaximilianPi/IslandLDG) are in many cases insufficient to understand or meaningfully engage with this work, precluding productive discussion about cited analytical concerns. Given these major issues with the reanalysis, we reject the conclusions from this critique that our prior results are due to statistical artifacts. We therefore do not have reason to question our original conclusion that the latitudinal diversity gradient is weakened by mutualisms among oceanic islands worldwide.</description>

      <title>Effect of Vaccine Dose Intervals: Considering Immunity Levels, Vaccine Efficacy, and Strain Variants for Disease Control Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present an immuno-epidemic model to understand mitigation options during an epidemic break. The model incorporates comorbidity and multiple-vaccine doses through a system of coupled integro-differential equations to analyze the epidemic rate and intensity from a knowledge of the basic reproduction number and time-distributed rate functions. Our modeling results show that the interval between vaccine doses is a key control parameter that can be tuned to significantly influence disease spread. We show that multiple doses induce a hysteresis effect in immunity levels that offers a better mitigation alternative compared to frequent vaccination which is less cost-effective while being more intrusive. Optimal dosing intervals, emphasizing the cost-effectiveness of each vaccination effort, and determined by various factors such as the level of immunity and efficacy of vaccines against different strains, appear to be crucial in disease management. The model is sufficiently generic that can be extended to accommodate specific disease forms.</description>

      <title>Identifying Heart Attack Risk in Vulnerable Population: A Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased the incidence of post-infection cardiovascular events, particularly myocardial infarction, in individuals over 40. While the underlying mechanisms remain elusive, this study employs a hybrid machine learning approach to analyze epidemiological data in assessing 13 key heart attack risk factors and their susceptibility. Based on a unique dataset that combines demographic, biochemical, ECG, and thallium stress-tests, this study categorizes distinct subpopulations against varying risk profiles and then divides the population into 'at-risk' (AR) and 'not-at-risk' (NAR) groups using clustering algorithms. The study reveals strong association between the likelihood of experiencing a heart attack on the 13 risk factors studied. The aggravated risk for postmenopausal patients indicates compromised individual risk factors due to estrogen depletion that may be, further compromised by extraneous stress impacts, like anxiety and fear, aspects that have traditionally eluded data modeling predictions.</description>

      <title>Perfect taxon sampling and fixing taxon traceability: Introducing a class of phylogenetically decisive collections of taxon sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3472</link>
      <description>arXiv:1206.3472v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phylogenetically decisive collections of taxon sets have the property that if trees are chosen for each of their elements, as long as these trees are compatible, the resulting supertree is unique. This means that as long as the trees describing the phylogenetic relationships of the (input) species sets are compatible, they can only be combined into a common supertree in precisely one way. This setting is sometimes also referred to as \enquote{perfect taxon sampling}. While for rooted trees, the decision if a given set of input taxon sets is phylogenetically decisive can be made in polynomial time, the decision problem to determine whether a collection of taxon sets is phylogenetically decisive concerning \emph{unrooted} trees is unfortunately coNP-complete and therefore in practice hard to solve for large instances. This shows that recognizing such sets is often difficult. In this paper, we explain phylogenetic decisiveness and introduce a class of input taxon sets, namely so-called \emph{fixing taxon traceable} sets, which are guaranteed to be phylogenetically decisive and which can be recognized in polynomial time. Using both combinatorial approaches as well as simulations, we compare properties of fixing taxon traceability and phylogenetic decisiveness, e.g., by deriving lower and upper bounds for the number of quadruple sets (i.e., sets of 4-tuples) needed in the input set for each of these properties. In particular, we correct an erroneous lower bound concerning phylogenetic decisiveness from the literature.
  We have implemented the algorithm to determine if a given collection of taxon sets is fixing taxon traceable in \textsf{R} and made our software package \verb+FixingTaxonTraceR+ publicly available.</description>

      <title>Effective growth rates in a periodically changing environment: From mutation to invasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic individual-based model of adaptive dynamics for an asexually reproducing population with mutation, with linear birth and death rates, as well as a density-dependent competition. To depict repeating changes of the environment, all of these parameters vary over time as piecewise constant and periodic functions, on an intermediate time-scale between those of stabilization of the resident population (fast) and exponential growth of mutants (slow). Studying the growth of emergent mutants and their invasion of the resident population in the limit of small mutation rates for a simultaneously diverging population size, we are able to determine their effective growth rates. We describe this growth as a mesoscopic scaling-limit of the orders of population sizes, where we observe an averaging effect of the invasion fitness. Moreover, we prove a limit result for the sequence of consecutive macroscopic resident traits that is similar to the so-called trait-substitution-sequence.</description>

      <title>A data augmentation strategy for deep neural networks with application to epidemic modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we integrate the predictive capabilities of compartmental disease dynamics models with machine learning ability to analyze complex, high-dimensional data and uncover patterns that conventional models may overlook. Specifically, we present a proof of concept demonstrating the application of data-driven methods and deep neural networks to a recently introduced Susceptible-Infected-Recovered type model with social features, including a saturated incidence rate, to improve epidemic prediction and forecasting. Our results show that a robust data augmentation strategy trough suitable data-driven models can improve the reliability of Feed-Forward Neural Networks and Nonlinear Autoregressive Networks, providing a complementary strategy to Physics-Informed Neural Networks, particularly in settings where data augmentation from mechanistic models can enhance learning. This approach enhances the ability to handle nonlinear dynamics and offers scalable, data-driven solutions for epidemic forecasting, prioritizing predictive accuracy over the constraints of physics-based models. Numerical simulations of the lockdown and post-lockdown phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy and Spain validate our methodology.</description>

      <title>Agent-based Monte Carlo simulations for reaction-diffusion models, population dynamics, and epidemic spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an overview of Monte Carlo algorithms based on Markovian stochastic dynamics of interacting and reacting many-particle systems not in thermal equilibrium. These agent-based simulations are an effective way of introducing students to current research without requiring much prior knowledge or experience. By starting from the direct visualization of the data, students can gain immediate insight into emerging macroscopic features of a complex system and subsequently apply more sophisticated data analysis to quantitatively characterize its rich dynamical properties, both in the stationary and transient regimes. We utilize simulations of reaction-diffusion systems, stochastic models for population dynamics and epidemic spreading, to exemplify how interdisciplinary computational research can be effectively utilized in bottom-up undergraduate and graduate education through learning by doing. We also give helpful hints for the practical implementation of Monte Carlo algorithms, provide sample codes, explain some typical data analysis tools, and describe various potential error sources and pitfalls and tips for avoiding them.</description>
