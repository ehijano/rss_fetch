      <title>Normalizer Quotients of Symmetric Groups and Inner Holomorphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every finite group $T$ is isomorphic to a normalizer quotient $N_{S_n}(H)/H$ for some $n$ and a subgroup $H\leq S_n$. We show that this holds for all large enough $n\ge n_0(T)$ and also with $S_n$ replaced by $A_n$. The two main ingredients in the proof are a recent construction due to Cornulier and Sambale of a finite group $G$ with $\mathrm{Out}(G)\cong T$ (for any given finite group $T$) and the determination of the normalizer in $\mathrm{Sym(G)}$ of the inner holomorph $\mathrm{InHol}(G)\leq\mathrm{Sym}(G)$ for any centerless indecomposable finite group $G$, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The balancing index over the alternating group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The balancing index of a polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ is the least positive sum of coefficients in an integer linear combination of permuted copies of $f$ which produces a symmetric polynomial. Here we consider the restricted problem in which only even permutations are used.</description>

      <title>Soluble skew left braces and soluble solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13475v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of non-degenerate set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation calls for a deep understanding of the algebraic structure of a skew left brace. In this paper, the skew brace theoretical property of solubility is introduced and studied. It leads naturally to the notion of solubility of solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. It turns out that soluble non-degenerate set-theoretic solutions are characterised by soluble skew left braces. The rich ideal structure of soluble skew left braces is also shown. A worked example showing the relevance of the brace theoretical property of solubility is also presented.</description>

      <title>The isomorphism problem for small-rose generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A generalized Baumslag-Solitar group is a finitely generated group that acts on a tree with infinite-cyclic vertex and edge stabilizers. In this paper, we show that the isomorphism problem is solvable for small rose non-ascending generalized Baumslag- Solitar groups.</description>

      <title>Rota-Baxter operators, differential operators, pre- and Novikov structures on groups and Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rota-Baxter operators on various structures have found important applications in diverse areas, from renormalization of quantum field theory to Yang-Baxter equations. Relative Rota-Baxter operators on Lie algebras are closely related to pre-Lie algebras and post-Lie algebras. Some of their group counterparts have been introduced to study post-groups, skew left braces and set-theoretic solutions of Yang-Baxter equations, but searching suitable notions of relative Rota-Baxter operators on groups with weight zero and pre-groups has been challenging and has been the focus of recent studies, by provisionally imposing an abelian condition.
  Arising from the works of Balinsky-Novikov and Gelfand-Dorfman, Novikov algebras and their constructions from differential commutative algebras have led to broad applications. Finding their suitable counterparts for groups and Lie algebras has also attracted quite much recent attention.
  This paper uses one-sided-inverse pairs of maps to give a perturbative approach to a general notion of relative Rota-Baxter operators and differential operators on a group and a Lie algebra with limit-weight. With the extra condition of limit-abelianess on the group or Lie algebra, we give an interpretation of relative Rota-Baxter and differential operators with weight zero. These operators motivate us to define pre-groups and Novikov groups respectively as the induced structures. The tangent maps of these operators are shown to give Rota-Baxter and differential operators with weight zero on Lie algebras. The tangent spaces of the pre-Lie and Novikov Lie groups are pre-Lie algebras and Novikov Lie algebras, fulfilling the expected property. Furthermore, limit-weight relative Rota-Baxter operators on groups give rise to skew left braces and then set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation.</description>
