      <title>Fiber neural networks for the intelligent optical fiber communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical neural networks have long cast attention nowadays. Like other optical structured neural networks, fiber neural networks which utilize the mechanism of light transmission to compute can take great advantages in both computing efficiency and power cost. Though the potential ability of optical fiber was demonstrated via the establishing of fiber neural networks, it will be of great significance of combining both fiber transmission and computing functions so as to cater the needs of future beyond 5G intelligent communication signal processing. Thus, in this letter, the fiber neural networks and their related optical signal processing methods will be both developed. In this way, information derived from the transmitted signals can be directly processed in the optical domain rather than being converted to the electronic domain. As a result, both prominent gains in processing efficiency and power cost can be further obtained. The fidelity of the whole structure and related methods is demonstrated by the task of modulation format recognition which plays important role in fiber optical communications without losing the generality.</description>

      <title>A Recursion-Based SNR Determination Method for Short Packet Transmission: Analysis and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The short packet transmission (SPT) has gained much attention in recent years. In SPT, the most significant characteristic is that the finite blocklength code (FBC) is adopted. With FBC, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) cannot be expressed as an explicit function with respect to the other transmission parameters. This raises the following two problems for the resource allocation in SPTs: (i) The exact value of the SNR is hard to determine, and (ii) The property of SNR w.r.t. the other parameters is hard to analyze, which hinders the efficient optimization of them. To simultaneously tackle these problems, we have developed a recursion method in our prior work. To emphasize the significance of this method, we further analyze the convergence rate of the recursion method and investigate the property of the recursion function in this paper. Specifically, we first analyze the convergence rate of the recursion method, which indicates it can determine the SNR with low complexity. Then, we analyze the property of the recursion function, which facilitates the optimization of the other parameters during the recursion. Finally, we also enumerate some applications for the recursion method. Simulation results indicate that the recursion method converges faster than the other SNR determination methods. Besides, the results also show that the recursion-based methods can almost achieve the optimal solution of the application cases.</description>

      <title>pyPCG: A Python Toolbox Specialized for Phonocardiography Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonocardiography has recently gained popularity in low-cost and remote monitoring, including passive fetal heart monitoring. Development for methods which analyse phonocardiographical data try to capitalize on this opportunity, and in recent years a multitude of such algorithms and models have been published. Although there is little to no standardization in these published algorithms and multiple parts of these models have to be reimplemented on a case-by-case basis. Datasets containing heart sound recordings also lack standardization in both data storage and labeling, especially in fetal phonocardiography. We are presenting a toolbox that can serve as a basis for a future standard framework for heart sound analysis. This toolbox contains some of the most widely used processing steps, and with these, complex analysis processes can be created. These functions can be individually tested. Due to the interdependence of the steps, we validated the current segmentation stage using a manually labeled fetal phonocardiogram dataset comprising 50 one-minute abdominal PCG recordings, which include 6,758 S1 and 6,729 S2 labels. Our results were compared to other common and available segmentation methods, peak detection with the Neurokit2 library, and the Hidden Semi-Markov Model by Springer et al. With a 30 ms tolerance our best model achieved a 97.1% F1 score and 10.8 +/- 7.9 ms mean absolute error for S1 detection. This detection accuracy outperformed all tested methods. With this a more accurate S2 detection method can be created as a multi-step process. After an accurate segmentation the extracted features should be representative of the selected segments, which allows for more accurate statistics or classification models. The toolbox contains functions for both feature extraction and statistics creation which are compatible with the previous steps.</description>

      <title>Localization in Dynamic Indoor MIMO-OFDM Wireless Systems using Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for predicting the location of user equipment (UE) using wireless fingerprints in dynamic indoor non-line-of-sight (NLoS) environments. In particular, our method copes with the challenges posed by the drift, birth, and death of scattering clusters resulting from dynamic changes in the wireless environment. Prominent examples of such dynamic wireless environments include factory floors or offices, where the geometry of the environment undergoes changes over time. These changes affect the distribution of wireless fingerprints, demonstrating some similarity between the distributions before and after the change. Consequently, the performance of a location estimator initially designed for a specific environment may degrade significantly when applied after changes have occurred in that environment. To address this limitation, we propose a domain adaptation framework that utilizes neural networks to align the distributions of wireless fingerprints collected both before and after environmental changes. By aligning these distributions, we design an estimator capable of predicting UE locations from their wireless fingerprints in the new environment. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in localizing UEs in dynamic wireless environments.</description>

      <title>Malicious RIS Meets RSMA: Unveiling the Robustness of Rate Splitting to RIS-Induced Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the robustness of rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) to imperfect channel state information (CSI) is well-documented, its susceptibility to attacks launched with malicious reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) remains unexplored. This paper fills this gap by investigating three potential RIS-induced attacks against RSMA in a multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network: random interference, aligned interference, and mitigation attack. The random interference attack employs random RIS coefficients to disrupt RSMA. The other two attacks are triggered by optimizing the RIS through weighted-sum strategies based on the projected gradient method. Simulation results reveal significant degradation caused by all the attacks under perfect CSI conditions. Remarkably, when imperfect CSI is considered, RSMA, owing to its flexible power allocation strategy designed to counter CSI-related interference, can be robust to the attacks even when the base station is blind to them. It is also shown that RSMA can significantly outperform conventional space-division multiple access (SDMA).</description>

      <title>GNSS Interference Classification Using Federated Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expanding use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in vital areas like traffic management, surveillance, and environmental monitoring highlights the need for robust communication and navigation systems. Particularly vulnerable are Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), which face a spectrum of interference and jamming threats that can significantly undermine their performance. While traditional deep learning approaches are adept at mitigating these issues, they often fall short for UAV applications due to significant computational demands and the complexities of managing large, centralized datasets. In response, this paper introduces Federated Reservoir Computing (FedRC) as a potent and efficient solution tailored to enhance interference classification in GNSS systems used by UAVs. Our experimental results demonstrate that FedRC not only achieves faster convergence but also sustains lower loss levels than traditional models, highlighting its exceptional adaptability and operational efficiency.</description>

      <title>DCSK-based Waveform Design for Self-sustainable RIS-aided Noncoherent SWIPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of transmit waveform design in the context of a chaotic signal-based self-sustainable reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided system for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). Specifically, we propose a differential chaos shift keying (DCSK)-based RIS-aided point-to-point set-up, where the RIS is partitioned into two non-overlapping surfaces. The elements of the first sub-surface perform energy harvesting (EH), which in turn, provide the required power to the other sub-surface operating in the information transfer (IT) mode. In this framework, by considering a generalized frequency-selective Nakagami-m fading scenario as well as the nonlinearities of the EH process, we derive closed-form analytical expressions for both the bit error rate (BER) at the receiver and the harvested power at the RIS. Our analysis demonstrates, that both these performance metrics depend on the parameters of the wireless channel, the transmit waveform design, and the number of reflecting elements at the RIS, which switch between the IT and EH modes, depending on the application requirements. Moreover, we show that, having more reflecting elements in the IT mode is not always beneficial and also, for a given acceptable BER, we derive a lower bound on the number of RIS elements that need to be operated in the EH mode. Furthermore, for a fixed RIS configuration, we investigate a trade-off between the achievable BER and the harvested power at the RIS and accordingly, we propose appropriate transmit waveform designs. Finally, our numerical results illustrate the importance of our intelligent DCSK-based waveform design on the considered framework.</description>

      <title>Towards Neuromorphic Processing for Next-Generation MU-MIMO Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upcoming physical layer (PHY) processing solutions, leveraging multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) advances, are expected to support broad transmission bandwidths and the concurrent transmission of multiple information streams. However, the inherent computational complexities of conventional MIMO PHY algorithms pose significant practical challenges, not only in meeting the strict real-time processing latency requirements but also in maintaining practical computational power consumption budgets. Novel computing paradigms, such as neuromorphic computing, promise substantial gains in computational power efficiency. However, it is unknown whether it is feasible or efficient to realize practical PHY algorithms on such platforms. In this work, we evaluate for the first time the potential of neuromorphic computing principles for multi-user (MU)-MIMO detection. In particular, we developed the first spiking-based MU-MIMO simulator that meets practical error-rate targets, suggesting power gains of at least one order of magnitude when realized on actual neuromorphic hardware, compared to conventional processing platforms. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future research directions that could unlock practical neuromorphic-based MU-MIMO systems and revolutionize PHY power efficiency.</description>

      <title>Near-field orthogonality and cosine beams for near-field space division multiple access in 6G communications and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial division multiple access (SDMA), a powerful method routinely applied in multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications, relies on the angular orthogonality of beams in the far field, to distinguish multiple users at different angles. Yet, with the gradual shift of wireless connectivity to the near-field of large radiating apertures, the applicability of classical SDMA becomes questionable. Therefore, to enable near-field multiple access, it is necessary to design beams that have the desired orthogonality in the near-field. In this work, we propose the concept of near-field space division multiple access (NF-SDMA), to enable SDMA in the near-field. We demonstrate analytically that the orthogonality of beams is preserved at any location of the receiver, from the near-field to the far-field of the transmitter. By judicious design, we select the family of cosine beams and we prove that they satisfy the orthogonality condition, offering a multitude of communication modes in the near-field. We demonstrate how the correlation of beams generated with uniform linear arrays (ULAs) is extended to uniform planar arrays (UPAs) in a straightforward and insightful manner. To test our analytical findings, we propagate the designed beams numerically, and we measure their orthogonality both at the transmitter and the receiver. We verify that the orthogonality of the proposed beams is successfully retrieved at a receiver that resides in the near-field of the transmitter, and is also robust to displacements of the receiver. Based on our findings, we propose codebook designs for NF-SDMA that are applicable for receivers with many elements and even with single antennas.</description>

      <title>Active STAR-RIS Empowered Edge System for Enhanced Energy Efficiency and Task Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of data-intensive and low-latency applications has driven the development of multi-access edge computing (MEC) as a viable solution to meet the increasing demands for high-performance computing and storage capabilities at the network edge. Despite the benefits of MEC, challenges such as obstructions cause non-line-of-sight (NLoS) communication to persist. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and the more advanced simultaneously transmitting and reflecting (STAR)-RISs have emerged to address these challenges; however, practical limitations and multiplicative fading effects hinder their efficacy. We propose an active STAR-RIS-assisted MEC system to overcome these obstacles, leveraging the advantages of active STAR-RIS. The main contributions consist of formulating an optimization problem to minimize energy consumption with task queue stability by jointly optimizing the partial task offloading, amplitude, phase shift coefficients, amplification coefficients, transmit power of the base station (BS), and admitted tasks. Furthermore, we decompose the non-convex problem into manageable sub-problems, employing sequential fractional programming for transmit power control, convex optimization technique for task offloading, and Lyapunov optimization with double deep Q-network (DDQN) for joint amplitude, phase shift, amplification, and task admission. Extensive performance evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system over benchmark schemes, highlighting its potential for enhancing MEC system performance. Numerical results indicate that our proposed system outperforms the conventional STAR-RIS-assisted by 18.64\% and the conventional RIS-assisted system by 30.43\%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Balancing AoI and Rate for Mission-Critical and eMBB Coexistence with Puncturing, NOMA,and RSMA in Cellular Uplink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through the lens of average and peak age-of-information (AoI), this paper takes a fresh look into the uplink medium access solutions for mission-critical (MC) communication coexisting with enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) service. Considering the stochastic packet arrivals from an MC user, we study three access schemes: orthogonal multiple access (OMA) with eMBB preemption (puncturing), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), the latter two both with concurrent eMBB transmissions. Puncturing is found to reduce both average AoI and peak AoI (PAoI) violation probability but at the expense of decreased eMBB user rates and increased signaling complexity. Conversely, NOMA and RSMA offer higher eMBB rates but may lead to MC packet loss and AoI degradation. The paper systematically investigates the conditions under which NOMA or RSMA can closely match the average AoI and PAoI violation performance of puncturing while maintaining data rate gains. Closed-form expressions for average AoI and PAoI violation probability are derived, and conditions on the eMBB and MC channel gain difference with respect to the base station are analyzed. Additionally, optimal power and rate splitting factors in RSMA are determined through an exhaustive search to minimize MC outage probability. Notably, our results indicate that with a small loss in the average AoI and PAoI violation probability the eMBB rate in NOMA and RSMA can be approximately five times higher than that achieved through puncturing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter focuses on enhancing target detection performance for a multi-user integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system using orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS)-aided cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology in high-speed vehicular environments. We propose a sensing-centric (SC) approach for target detection using communication signals with or without sensing signals. Power allocation is optimized to maximize the sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the proposed SC scheme while ensuring a required quality-of-service (QoS) for the communication user equipment (UEs), and adhering to each access points (APs) power budget. Numerical results show that the proposed SC scheme vastly outperforms a communication-centric method that minimizes the total power consumed at the APs subject to the same constraints.</description>

      <title>Predictability of Performance in Communication Networks Under Markovian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the emergence of time-critical applications in modern communication networks, there is a growing demand for proactive network adaptation and quality of service (QoS) prediction. However, a fundamental question remains largely unexplored: how can we quantify and achieve more predictable communication systems in terms of performance? To address this gap, this paper introduces a theoretical framework for defining and analyzing predictability in communication systems, with a focus on the impact of observations for performance forecasting. We establish a mathematical definition of predictability based on the total variation distance between forecast and marginal performance distributions. A system is deemed unpredictable when the forecast distribution, providing the most comprehensive characterization of future states using all accessible information, is indistinguishable from the marginal distribution, which depicts the system's behavior without any observational input. This framework is applied to multi-hop systems under Markovian conditions, with a detailed analysis of Geo/Geo/1 queuing models in both single-hop and multi-hop scenarios. We derive exact and approximate expressions for predictability in these systems, as well as upper bounds based on spectral analysis of the underlying Markov chains. Our results have implications for the design of efficient monitoring and prediction mechanisms in future communication networks aiming to provide deterministic services.</description>

      <title>Bussgang revisited: effect of quantization on signal to distortion plus noise ratio with non-Gaussian signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantization plays an important role in the physical layer (PHY) disaggregation which is fundamental to the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture, since digitized signals must be transmitted over fronthaul connections. In this paper we explore the effect of quantization on PHY performance, drawing on the Bussgang decomposition and the implications of the Bussgang theorem and extending it to the case of non-Gaussian signals. We first prove several theorems regarding the signal to distortion plus noise ratio for a general non-linearity, applicable to both the Gaussian and the non-Gaussian case, showing that the decomposition can be applied to the non-Gaussian case, but that formulae previously introduced should be amended. We then apply these results to the non-linearity created by quantization, both for Gaussian and non-Gaussian signal distributions, and give numerical results derived from both theory and simulation.</description>

      <title>Quadratic estimation for stochastic systems in the presence of random parameter matrices, time-correlated additive noise and deception attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networked systems usually face different random uncertainties that make the performance of the least-squares (LS) linear filter decline significantly. For this reason, great attention has been paid to the search for other kinds of suboptimal estimators. Among them, the LS quadratic estimation approach has attracted considerable interest in the scientific community for its balance between computational complexity and estimation accuracy. When it comes to stochastic systems subject to different random uncertainties and deception attacks, the quadratic estimator design has not been deeply studied. In this paper, using covariance information, the LS quadratic filtering and fixed-point smoothing problems are addressed under the assumption that the measurements are perturbed by a time-correlated additive noise, as well as affected by random parameter matrices and exposed to random deception attacks. The use of random parameter matrices covers a wide range of common uncertainties and random failures, thus better reflecting the engineering reality. The signal and observation vectors are augmented by stacking the original vectors with their second-order Kronecker powers; then, the linear estimator of the original signal based on the augmented observations provides the required quadratic estimator. A simulation example illustrates the superiority of the proposed quadratic estimators over the conventional linear ones and the effect of the deception attacks on the estimation performance.</description>

      <title>Target Localization in Cooperative ISAC Systems: A Scheme Based on 5G NR OFDM Signals</title>

Abstract: The integration of sensing capabilities into communication systems, by sharing physical resources, has a significant potential for reducing spectrum, hardware, and energy costs while inspiring innovative applications. Cooperative networks, in particular, are expected to enhance sensing services by enlarging the coverage area and enriching sensing measurements, thus improving the service availability and accuracy. This paper proposes a cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework by leveraging information-bearing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals transmitted by access points (APs). Specifically, we propose a two-stage scheme for target localization, where communication signals are reused as sensing reference signals based on the system information shared at the central processing unit (CPU). In Stage I, we propose a twodimensional fast Fourier transform (2D-FFT)-based algorithm to measure the ranges of scattered paths induced by targets, through the extraction of delay and Doppler information from the sensing channels between APs. Then, the target locations are estimated in Stage II based on these range measurements. Considering the potential occurrence of ill-conditioned measurements with large error during the extraction of time-frequency information, we propose an efficient algorithm to match the range measurements with the targets while eliminating ill-onditioned measurements, achieving high-accuracy target localization. In addition, based on the transmission configurations defined in the fifth generation (5G) standards, we elucidate the performance trade-offs in both communication and sensing, and extend the proposed sensing scheme for general scenarios. Finally, numerical results confirm the effectiveness of our sensing scheme and the cooperative gain of the ISAC framework.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Double-Active-RIS-aided Communication Systems with Inter-Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a double-active-reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided downlink wireless communication system, where a multi-antenna base station (BS) serves multiple single-antenna users with both double reflection and single reflection links. Due to the signal amplification capability of active RISs, they can effectively mitigate the multiplicative fading effect. However, this also induces signal bouncing between the two active RISs that cannot be ignored. This phenomenon is termed as the "inter-excitation" effect and is characterized in the received signal by proposing a feedback-type model. Based on the signal model, we formulate a weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problem by jointly optimizing the beamforming matrix at the BS and the reflecting coefficient matrices at the two active RISs, subject to power constraints at the BS and active RISs, as well as the maximum amplification gain constraints of the active RISs. To solve this non-convex problem, we first transform the problem into a more tractable form using the fractional programming (FP) method. Then, by introducing auxiliary variables, the problem can be converted into an equivalent form that can be solved by using a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) algorithm. Finally, simulation results indicate that it proposed scheme outperforms benchmark schemes with single active RIS and double passive RISs in terms of achievable rate. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can enhance the WSR by 30\% compared to scenarios that do not take this effect into account when the maximum amplification gain is 40 dB. Additionally, the proposed scheme is capable of achieving high WSR performance at most locations where double active RISs are deployed between the BS and the users, thereby providing greater flexibility in their positioning.</description>

      <title>Doubly-Dynamic ISAC Precoding for Vehicular Networks: A Constrained Deep Reinforcement Learning (CDRL) Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology is essential for supporting vehicular networks. However, the communication channel in this scenario exhibits time variations, and the potential targets may move rapidly, resulting in double dynamics. This nature poses a challenge for real-time precoder design. While optimization-based solutions are widely researched, they are complex and heavily rely on perfect channel-related information, which is impractical in double dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose using constrained deep reinforcement learning to facilitate dynamic updates to the ISAC precoder. Additionally, the primal dual-deep deterministic policy gradient and Wolpertinger architecture are tailored to efficiently train the algorithm under complex constraints and varying numbers of users. The proposed scheme not only adapts to the dynamics based on observations but also leverages environmental information to enhance performance and reduce complexity. Its superiority over existing candidates has been validated through experiments.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming and Antenna Position Optimization for Movable Antenna-Assisted Spectrum Sharing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluid antennas (FAs) and movable antennas (MAs) have drawn increasing attention in wireless communications recently due to their ability to create favorable channel conditions via local antenna movement within a confined region. In this letter, we advance their application for cognitive radio to facilitate efficient spectrum sharing between primary and secondary communication systems. In particular, we aim to jointly optimize the transmit beamforming and MA positions at a secondary transmitter (ST) to maximize the received signal power at a secondary receiver (SR) subject to the constraints on its imposed co-channel interference power with multiple primary receivers (PRs). However, such an optimization problem is difficult to be optimally solved due to the highly nonlinear functions of the received signal/interference power at the SR/all PRs in terms of the MA positions. To drive useful insights, we first perform theoretical analyses to unveil MAs' capability to achieve maximum-ratio transmission with the SR and effective interference mitigation for all PRs at the same time. To solve the MA position optimization problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms can significantly outperform the conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs) and other baseline schemes.</description>

      <title>Single-BS Simultaneous Environment Sensing and UE Localization without LoS Path by Exploiting Near-Field Scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20536v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the mobile communication network evolves over the past few decades, localizing user equipment (UE) has become an important network service. While localization in line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios has reached a level of maturity, it is known that in far-field scenarios without a LoS path nor any prior information about the scatterers, accurately localizing the UE is impossible. In this letter, we show that this becomes possible if there are scatterers in the near-field region of the base station (BS) antenna arrays. Specifically, by exploiting the additional distance sensing capability of extremely large-scale antenna arrays (XL-arrays) provided by near-field effects, we propose a novel method that simultaneously performs environment sensing and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) UE localization using one single BS. In the proposed method, the BS leverages the near-field characteristics of XL-arrays to directly estimate the locations of the near-field scatterers with array signal processing, which then serves as virtual anchors for UE localization. Then, the propagation delay for each path is estimated and the position of the UE is obtained based on the positions of scatterers and the path delays. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior accuracy and robustness with similar complexity compared with benchmark methods.</description>

      <title>Flexible Beam Coverage Optimization for Movable-Antenna Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluid antennas (FAs) and movable antennas (MAs) have attracted increasing attention in wireless communications recently. As compared to the conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs), their geometry can be dynamically reconfigured, such that more flexible beamforming can be achieved for signal coverage and/or interference nulling. In this paper, we investigate the use of MAs to achieve uniform coverage for multiple regions with arbitrary number and width in the spatial domain. In particular, we aim to jointly optimize the MAs weights and positions within a linear array to maximize the minimum beam gain over the desired spatial regions. However, the resulting problem is non-convex and difficult to be optimally solved. To tackle this difficulty, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution, where the MAs weights and positions are alternately optimized by applying successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. Numerical results show that our proposed MAbased beam coverage scheme can achieve much better performance than conventional FPAs.</description>

      <title>On the Optimal Radius and Subcarrier Mapping for Binary Modulation on Conjugate-Reciprocal Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the radius maximizing reliability for binary modulation on conjugate-reciprocal zeros (BMOCZ) implemented with both maximum likelihood (ML) and direct zero-testing (DiZeT) decoders. We first show that the optimal radius for BMOCZ is a function of the employed decoder and that the radius maximizing the minimum distance between polynomial zeros does not maximize the minimum distance of the final code. While maximizing zero separation offers an almost optimal solution with the DiZeT decoder, simulations show that the ML decoder outperforms the DiZeT decoder in both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and fading channels when the radius is chosen to maximize codeword separation. Finally, we analyze different sequence-to-subcarrier mappings for BMOCZ-based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). We highlight a flexible time-frequency OFDM waveform that avoids distortion introduced by a frequency-selective channel at the expense of a higher peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR).</description>

      <title>Concept-based explainability for an EEG transformer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models are complex due to their size, structure, and inherent randomness in training procedures. Additional complexity arises from the selection of datasets and inductive biases. Addressing these challenges for explainability, Kim et al. (2018) introduced Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs), which aim to understand deep models' internal states in terms of human-aligned concepts. These concepts correspond to directions in latent space, identified using linear discriminants. Although this method was first applied to image classification, it was later adapted to other domains, including natural language processing. In this work, we attempt to apply the method to electroencephalogram (EEG) data for explainability in Kostas et al.'s BENDR (2021), a large-scale transformer model. A crucial part of this endeavor involves defining the explanatory concepts and selecting relevant datasets to ground concepts in the latent space. Our focus is on two mechanisms for EEG concept formation: the use of externally labeled EEG datasets, and the application of anatomically defined concepts. The former approach is a straightforward generalization of methods used in image classification, while the latter is novel and specific to EEG. We present evidence that both approaches to concept formation yield valuable insights into the representations learned by deep EEG models.</description>
