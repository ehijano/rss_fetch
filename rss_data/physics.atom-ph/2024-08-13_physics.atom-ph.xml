      <title>Operating a multi-ion clock with dynamical decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study and characterize a quasi-continuous dynamical decoupling (QCDD) scheme that effectively suppresses dominant frequency shifts in a multi-ion optical clock. Addressing the challenge of inhomogeneous frequency shifts in such systems, our scheme mitigates primary contributors, namely the electric quadrupole shift (QPS) and the linear Zeeman shift (LZS). Based on $^{88}$Sr$^+$ ions, we implement a QCDD scheme in linear chains of up to 7 ions and demonstrate a significant suppression of the shift by more than three orders of magnitude, leading to relative frequency inhomogeneity below $7\cdot10^{-17}$. Additionally, we evaluate the associated systematic shift arising from the radiofrequency (RF) drive used in the QCDD scheme, showing that, in the presented realization, its contribution to the systematic relative frequency uncertainty is below $10^{-17}$, with potential for further improvement. These results provide a promising avenue toward implementing multi-ion clocks exhibiting an order of magnitude or more improvement in stability while maintaining a similar high degree of accuracy to that of single-ion clocks.</description>

      <title>Broad Instantaneous Bandwidth Microwave Spectrum Analyzer with a Microfabricated Atomic Vapor Cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on broad instantaneous bandwidth microwave spectrum analysis with hot $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atoms in a microfabricated vapor cell in a large magnetic field gradient. The sensor is a MEMS atomic vapor cell filled with isotopically pure $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ and $\mathrm{N}_2$ buffer gas to localize the motion of the atoms. The microwave signals of interest are coupled through a coplanar waveguide to the cell, inducing spin flip transitions between optically pumped ground states of the atoms. A static magnetic field with large gradient maps the $\textit{frequency spectrum}$ of the input microwave signals to a position-dependent $\textit{spin-flip pattern}$ on absorption images of the cell recorded with a laser beam onto a camera. In our proof-of-principle experiment, we demonstrate a microwave spectrum analyzer that has $\approx$ 1 GHz instantaneous bandwidth centered around 13 GHz, 3 MHz frequency resolution, 2 kHz refresh rate, and a -23 dBm single-tone microwave power detection limit in 1 s measurement time. A theoretical model is constructed to simulate the image signals by considering the processes of optical pumping, microwave interaction, diffusion of $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atoms, and laser absorption. We expect to reach more than 25 GHz instantaneous bandwidth in an optimized setup, limited by the applied magnetic field gradient. Our demonstration offers a practical alternative to conventional microwave spectrum analyzers based on electronic heterodyne detection.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections of the order $\alpha\,(Z\,\alpha)^6$ for rotational states of two-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analytical calculation of the complete $\alpha\,(Z\,\alpha)^6$ one-loop radiative correction to energies of two-body systems with the angular momenta $l&gt;0$, consisting of a pointlike particle and an extended-size nucleus with arbitrary masses and spin 1/2, is presented. The obtained results apply to a wide variety of two-body systems, such as hydrogen, muonium, positronium, and antiprotonic atoms.</description>

      <title>In situ observation of chemistry in Rydberg molecules within a coherent solvent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13762v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We often infer the state of systems in nature indirectly, for example, in high-energy physics by the interaction of particles with an ambient medium. We adapt this principle to energies $9$ orders of magnitude smaller, to classify the final state of exotic molecules after internal conversion of their electronic state, through their interaction with an ambient quantum fluid, a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The BEC is the ground-state of a million bosonic atoms near zero temperature, and a single embedded ultra-long range Rydberg molecule can coherently excite waves in this fluid, which carry telltale signatures of its dynamics. Bond lengths exceeding a micrometer allow us to observe the molecular fingerprint on the BEC in-situ, via optical microscopy. Interpreting images in comparison with simulations strongly suggests that the molecular electronic state rapidly converts from the initially excited S and D orbitals to a much more complex molecular state (called "trilobite''), marked by a maximally localized electron. This internal conversion liberates energy, such that one expects final-state particles to move rapidly through the medium, which is however ruled out by comparing experiment and simulations. The molecule thus must strongly decelerate in the medium, for which we propose a plausible mechanism. Our experiment demonstrates a medium that facilitates and records an electronic state change of embedded exotic molecules in ultra-cold chemistry, with sufficient sensitivity to constrain velocities of final-state particles.</description>

      <title>Towards the "puzzle" of Chromium dimer Cr$_2$: predicting the Born-Oppenheimer rovibrational spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The experimentally-observed non-trivial electronic structure of the Cr$_2$ dimer has made the calculation of its potential energy curve a theoretical challenge in the last decades. By matching the perturbation theory at small internuclear distances $R$ and the multipole expansion at large distances $R$ (supposedly both of asymptotic nature), and by adding a few Rydberg-Klein-Rees (RKR) turning points, extracted from experimental data by Casey-Leopold (1993), the analytic form of the potential energy curve for the ground state $X^1\Sigma^+$ of the Cr$_2$ dimer is found for the first time for the whole range of internuclear distances $R$. This has the form of a two-point Pad\'e approximant and provides an accuracy of 3-4 decimal digits in 29 experimental vibrational energies. The resulting ground state $X^1\Sigma^+$ potential curve supports 19694 rovibrational states with a maximal vibrational number $\nu_\text{max}=104$ at zero angular momentum and with a maximal angular momentum $L_\text{max}=312$ with energies $&gt; 10^{-4}$ { hartree}, and additionally 218 weakly-bound states (close to the dissociation limit) with energies $&lt; 10^{-4}$ { hartree}.</description>
