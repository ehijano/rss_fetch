      <title>Deep Learning for Dermatology: An Innovative Framework for Approaching Precise Skin Cancer Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skin cancer can be life-threatening if not diagnosed early, a prevalent yet preventable disease. Globally, skin cancer is perceived among the finest prevailing cancers and millions of people are diagnosed each year. For the allotment of benign and malignant skin spots, an area of critical importance in dermatological diagnostics, the application of two prominent deep learning models, VGG16 and DenseNet201 are investigated by this paper. We evaluate these CNN architectures for their efficacy in differentiating benign from malignant skin lesions leveraging enhancements in deep learning enforced to skin cancer spotting. Our objective is to assess model accuracy and computational efficiency, offering insights into how these models could assist in early detection, diagnosis, and streamlined workflows in dermatology. We used two deep learning methods DenseNet201 and VGG16 model on a binary class dataset containing 3297 images. The best result with an accuracy of 93.79% achieved by DenseNet201. All images were resized to 224x224 by rescaling. Although both models provide excellent accuracy, there is still some room for improvement. In future using new datasets, we tend to improve our work by achieving great accuracy.</description>

      <title>Promptable segmentation with region exploration enables minimal-effort expert-level prostate cancer delineation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Accurate segmentation of prostate cancer on magnetic resonance (MR) images is crucial for planning image-guided interventions such as targeted biopsies, cryoablation, and radiotherapy. However, subtle and variable tumour appearances, differences in imaging protocols, and limited expert availability make consistent interpretation difficult. While automated methods aim to address this, they rely on large expertly-annotated datasets that are often inconsistent, whereas manual delineation remains labour-intensive. This work aims to bridge the gap between automated and manual segmentation through a framework driven by user-provided point prompts, enabling accurate segmentation with minimal annotation effort.
  Methods: The framework combines reinforcement learning (RL) with a region-growing segmentation process guided by user prompts. Starting from an initial point prompt, region-growing generates a preliminary segmentation, which is iteratively refined through RL. At each step, the RL agent observes the image and current segmentation to predict a new point, from which region growing updates the mask. A reward, balancing segmentation accuracy and voxel-wise uncertainty, encourages exploration of ambiguous regions, allowing the agent to escape local optima and perform sample-specific optimisation. Despite requiring fully supervised training, the framework bridges manual and fully automated segmentation at inference by substantially reducing user effort while outperforming current fully automated methods.
  Results: The framework was evaluated on two public prostate MR datasets (PROMIS and PICAI, with 566 and 1090 cases). It outperformed the previous best automated methods by 9.9% and 8.9%, respectively, with performance comparable to manual radiologist segmentation, reducing annotation time tenfold.</description>

      <title>TopoGate: Quality-Aware Topology-Stabilized Gated Fusion for Longitudinal Low-Dose CT New-Lesion Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Longitudinal low-dose CT follow-ups vary in noise, reconstruction kernels, and registration quality. These differences destabilize subtraction images and can trigger false new lesion alarms. We present TopoGate, a lightweight model that combines the follow-up appearance view with the subtraction view and controls their influence through a learned, quality-aware gate. The gate is driven by three case-specific signals: CT appearance quality, registration consistency, and stability of anatomical topology measured with topological metrics. On the NLST--New-Lesion--LongCT cohort comprising 152 pairs from 122 patients, TopoGate improves discrimination and calibration over single-view baselines, achieving an area under the ROC curve of 0.65 with a standard deviation of 0.05 and a Brier score of 0.14. Removing corrupted or low-quality pairs, identified by the quality scores, further increases the area under the ROC curve from 0.62 to 0.68 and reduces the Brier score from 0.14 to 0.12. The gate responds predictably to degradation, placing more weight on appearance when noise grows, which mirrors radiologist practice. The approach is simple, interpretable, and practical for reliable longitudinal LDCT triage.</description>

      <title>MeDUET: Disentangled Unified Pretraining for 3D Medical Image Synthesis and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) and diffusion models have advanced representation learning and image synthesis. However, in 3D medical imaging, they remain separate: diffusion for synthesis, SSL for analysis. Unifying 3D medical image synthesis and analysis is intuitive yet challenging, as multi-center datasets exhibit dominant style shifts, while downstream tasks rely on anatomy, and site-specific style co-varies with anatomy across slices, making factors unreliable without explicit constraints. In this paper, we propose MeDUET, a 3D Medical image Disentangled UnifiEd PreTraining framework that performs SSL in the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) latent space which explicitly disentangles domain-invariant content from domain-specific style. The token demixing mechanism serves to turn disentanglement from a modeling assumption into an empirically identifiable property. Two novel proxy tasks, Mixed-Factor Token Distillation (MFTD) and Swap-invariance Quadruplet Contrast (SiQC), are devised to synergistically enhance disentanglement. Once pretrained, MeDUET is capable of (i) delivering higher fidelity, faster convergence, and improved controllability for synthesis, and (ii) demonstrating strong domain generalization and notable label efficiency for analysis across diverse medical benchmarks. In summary, MeDUET converts multi-source heterogeneity from an obstacle into a learning signal, enabling unified pretraining for 3D medical image synthesis and analysis.

      <title>From Global Radiomics to Parametric Maps: A Unified Workflow Fusing Radiomics and Deep Learning for PDAC Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiomics and deep learning both offer powerful tools for quantitative medical imaging, but most existing fusion approaches only leverage global radiomic features and overlook the complementary value of spatially resolved radiomic parametric maps. We propose a unified framework that first selects discriminative radiomic features and then injects them into a radiomics-enhanced nnUNet at both the global and voxel levels for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) detection. On the PANORAMA dataset, our method achieved AUC = 0.96 and AP = 0.84 in cross-validation. On an external in-house cohort, it achieved AUC = 0.95 and AP = 0.78, outperforming the baseline nnUNet; it also ranked second in the PANORAMA Grand Challenge. This demonstrates that handcrafted radiomics, when injected at both global and voxel levels, provide complementary signals to deep learning models for PDAC detection. Our code can be found at https://github.com/briandzt/dl-pdac-radiomics-global-n-paramaps</description>

      <title>RamanSeg: Interpretability-driven Deep Learning on Raman Spectra for Cancer Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Histopathology, the current gold standard for cancer diagnosis, involves the manual examination of tissue samples after chemical staining, a time-consuming process requiring expert analysis. Raman spectroscopy is an alternative, stain-free method of extracting information from samples. Using nnU-Net, we trained a segmentation model on a novel dataset of spatial Raman spectra aligned with tumour annotations, achieving a mean foreground Dice score of 80.9%, surpassing previous work. Furthermore, we propose a novel, interpretable, prototype-based architecture called RamanSeg. RamanSeg classifies pixels based on discovered regions of the training set, generating a segmentation mask. Two variants of RamanSeg allow a trade-off between interpretability and performance: one with prototype projection and another projection-free version. The projection-free RamanSeg outperformed a U-Net baseline with a mean foreground Dice score of 67.3%, offering a meaningful improvement over a black-box training approach.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Completeness Perception with Diffusion Transformer for Unified 3D MRI Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Missing data problems, such as missing modalities in multi-modal brain MRI and missing slices in cardiac MRI, pose significant challenges in clinical practice. Existing methods rely on external guidance to supply detailed missing state for instructing generative models to synthesize missing MRIs. However, manual indicators are not always available or reliable in real-world scenarios due to the unpredictable nature of clinical environments. Moreover, these explicit masks are not informative enough to provide guidance for improving semantic consistency. In this work, we argue that generative models should infer and recognize missing states in a self-perceptive manner, enabling them to better capture subtle anatomical and pathological variations. Towards this goal, we propose CoPeDiT, a general-purpose latent diffusion model equipped with completeness perception for unified synthesis of 3D MRIs. Specifically, we incorporate dedicated pretext tasks into our tokenizer, CoPeVAE, empowering it to learn completeness-aware discriminative prompts, and design MDiT3D, a specialized diffusion transformer architecture for 3D MRI synthesis, that effectively uses the learned prompts as guidance to enhance semantic consistency in 3D space. Comprehensive evaluations on three large-scale MRI datasets demonstrate that CoPeDiT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior robustness, generalizability, and flexibility.

      <title>LGD-Net: Latent-Guided Dual-Stream Network for HER2 Scoring with Task-Specific Domain Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a critical task to evalaute HER2 expression level accurately for breast cancer evaluation and targeted treatment therapy selection. However, the standard multi-step Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining is resource-intensive, expensive, and time-consuming, which is also often unavailable in many areas. Consequently, predicting HER2 levels directly from H&amp;E slides has emerged as a potential alternative solution. It has been shown to be effective to use virtual IHC images from H&amp;E images for automatic HER2 scoring. However, the pixel-level virtual staining methods are computationally expensive and prone to reconstruction artifacts that can propagate diagnostic errors. To address these limitations, we propose the Latent-Guided Dual-Stream Network (LGD-Net), a novel framework that employes cross-modal feature hallucination instead of explicit pixel-level image generation. LGD-Net learns to map morphological H&amp;E features directly to the molecular latent space, guided by a teacher IHC encoder during training. To ensure the hallucinated features capture clinically relevant phenotypes, we explicitly regularize the model training with task-specific domain knowledge, specifically nuclei distribution and membrane staining intensity, via lightweight auxiliary regularization tasks. Extensive experiments on the public BCI dataset demonstrate that LGD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baseline methods while enabling efficient inference using single-modality H&amp;E inputs.</description>

      <title>ZACH-ViT: Regime-Dependent Inductive Bias in Compact Vision Transformers for Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Transformers rely on positional embeddings and class tokens that encode fixed spatial priors. While effective for natural images, these priors may hinder generalization when spatial layout is weakly informative or inconsistent, a frequent condition in medical imaging and edge-deployed clinical systems. We introduce ZACH-ViT (Zero-token Adaptive Compact Hierarchical Vision Transformer), a compact Vision Transformer that removes both positional embeddings and the [CLS] token, achieving permutation invariance through global average pooling over patch representations. The term "Zero-token" specifically refers to removing the dedicated [CLS] aggregation token and positional embeddings; patch tokens remain unchanged and are processed normally. Adaptive residual projections preserve training stability in compact configurations while maintaining a strict parameter budget.
  Evaluation is performed across seven MedMNIST datasets spanning binary and multi-class tasks under a strict few-shot protocol (50 samples per class, fixed hyperparameters, five random seeds). The empirical analysis demonstrates regime-dependent behavior: ZACH-ViT (0.25M parameters, trained from scratch) achieves its strongest advantage on BloodMNIST and remains competitive with TransMIL on PathMNIST, while its relative advantage decreases on datasets with strong anatomical priors (OCTMNIST, OrganAMNIST), consistent with the architectural hypothesis. These findings support the view that aligning architectural inductive bias with data structure can be more important than pursuing universal benchmark dominance. Despite its minimal size and lack of pretraining, ZACH-ViT achieves competitive performance while maintaining sub-second inference times, supporting deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. Code and models are available at https://github.com/Bluesman79/ZACH-ViT.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Noise: Why Diffusion Models Don't Need Noise Conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous (noise-agnostic) generative models, such as Equilibrium Matching and blind diffusion, challenge the standard paradigm by learning a single, time-invariant vector field that operates without explicit noise-level conditioning. While recent work suggests that high-dimensional concentration allows these models to implicitly estimate noise levels from corrupted observations, a fundamental paradox remains: what is the underlying landscape being optimized when the noise level is treated as a random variable, and how can a bounded, noise-agnostic network remain stable near the data manifold where gradients typically diverge? We resolve this paradox by formalizing Marginal Energy, $E_{\text{marg}}(\mathbf{u}) = -\log p(\mathbf{u})$, where $p(\mathbf{u}) = \int p(\mathbf{u}|t)p(t)dt$ is the marginal density of the noisy data integrated over a prior distribution of unknown noise levels. We prove that generation using autonomous models is not merely blind denoising, but a specific form of Riemannian gradient flow on this Marginal Energy. Through a novel relative energy decomposition, we demonstrate that while the raw Marginal Energy landscape possesses a $1/t^p$ singularity normal to the data manifold, the learned time-invariant field implicitly incorporates a local conformal metric that perfectly counteracts the geometric singularity, converting an infinitely deep potential well into a stable attractor. We also establish the structural stability conditions for sampling with autonomous models. We identify a ``Jensen Gap'' in noise-prediction parameterizations that acts as a high-gain amplifier for estimation errors, explaining the catastrophic failure observed in deterministic blind models. Conversely, we prove that velocity-based parameterizations are inherently stable because they satisfy a bounded-gain condition that absorbs posterior uncertainty into a smooth geometric drift.</description>

      <title>Landmark Detection for Medical Images using a General-purpose Segmentation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiographic images are a cornerstone of medical diagnostics in orthopaedics, with anatomical landmark detection serving as a crucial intermediate step for information extraction. General-purpose foundational segmentation models, such as SAM (Segment Anything Model), do not support landmark segmentation out of the box and require prompts to function. However, in medical imaging, the prompts for landmarks are highly specific. Since SAM has not been trained to recognize such landmarks, it cannot generate accurate landmark segmentations for diagnostic purposes. Even MedSAM, a medically adapted variant of SAM, has been trained to identify larger anatomical structures, such as organs and their parts, and lacks the fine-grained precision required for orthopaedic pelvic landmarks. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging another general-purpose, non-foundational model: YOLO. YOLO excels in object detection and can provide bounding boxes that serve as input prompts for SAM. While YOLO is efficient at detection, it is significantly outperformed by SAM in segmenting complex structures. In combination, these two models form a reliable pipeline capable of segmenting not only a small pilot set of eight anatomical landmarks but also an expanded set of 72 landmarks and 16 regions with complex outlines, such as the femoral cortical bone and the pelvic inlet. By using YOLO-generated bounding boxes to guide SAM, we trained the hybrid model to accurately segment orthopaedic pelvic radiographs. Our results show that the proposed combination of YOLO and SAM yields excellent performance in detecting anatomical landmarks and intricate outlines in orthopaedic pelvic radiographs.</description>

      <title>A Novel Method to Determine Total Oxidant Concentration Produced by Non-Thermal Plasma Based on Image Processing and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate determination of total oxidant concentration [Ox]tot in nonthermal plasma treated aqueous systems remains a critical challenge due to the transient nature of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and the subjectivity of conventional titration methods used for [Ox]tot determination. This study introduces a color based computer analysis method that integrates advanced image processing with machine learning to quantify colorimetric changes in potassium iodide solutions during oxidation. A custom built visual acquisition system recorded high resolution video of the color transitions occurring during plasma treatment while the change in oxidant concentration was simultaneously monitored using a standard titrimetric method. Extracted image frames were processed through a structured pipeline to obtain RGB, HSV, and Lab color features. Statistical analysis revealed strong linear relationships between selected color features and measured oxidant concentrations, particularly for HSV saturation, Lab a and b channels, and the blue component of RGB. These features were subsequently used to train and validate multiple machine learning models including linear regression, ridge regression, random forest, gradient boosting, and neural networks. Linear regression and gradient boosting demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy with R2 values exceeding 0.99. Dimensionality reduction from nine features to smaller feature subsets preserved predictive performance while improving computational efficiency. Comparison with experimental titration measurements showed that the proposed system predicts total oxidant concentration in potassium iodide solution with very high accuracy, achieving R2 values above 0.998 even under reduced feature conditions.</description>

Abstract: Non-invasive glucose monitoring outside controlled settings is dominated by low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR): hardware drift, environmental variation, and physiology suppress the glucose signature in NIR signals. We present a noise-stressed NIR simulator that injects 12-bit ADC quantisation, LED drift, photodiode dark noise, temperature/humidity variation, contact-pressure noise, Fitzpatrick I-VI melanin, and glucose variability to create a low-correlation regime (rho_glucose-NIR = 0.21). Using this platform, we benchmark six methods: Enhanced Beer-Lambert (physics-engineered ridge regression), Original PINN, Optimised PINN, RTE-inspired PINN, Selective RTE PINN, and a shallow DNN. The physics-engineered Beer Lambert model achieves the lowest error (13.6 mg/dL RMSE) with only 56 parameters and 0.01 ms inference, outperforming deeper PINNs and the SDNN baseline under low-SNR conditions. The study reframes the task as noise suppression under weak signal and shows that carefully engineered physics features can outperform higher-capacity models in this regime.</description>

Abstract: Smartphone-based iris recognition in the visible spectrum (VIS) remains difficult due to illumination variability, pigmentation differences, and the absence of standardized capture controls. This work presents a compact end-to-end pipeline that enforces ISO/IEC 29794-6 quality compliance at acquisition and demonstrates that accurate VIS iris recognition is feasible on commodity devices. Using a custom Android application performing real-time framing, sharpness evaluation, and feedback, we introduce the CUVIRIS dataset of 752 compliant images from 47 subjects. A lightweight MobileNetV3-based multi-task segmentation network (LightIrisNet) is developed for efficient on-device processing, and a transformer matcher (IrisFormer) is adapted to the VIS domain. Under a standardized protocol and comparative benchmarking against prior CNN baselines, OSIRIS attains a TAR of 97.9% at FAR=0.01 (EER=0.76%), while IrisFormer, trained only on UBIRIS.v2, achieves an EER of 0.057% on CUVIRIS. The acquisition app, trained models, and a public subset of the dataset are released to support reproducibility. These results confirm that standardized capture and VIS-adapted lightweight models enable accurate and practical iris recognition on smartphones.</description>

      <title>Incomplete Multi-view Clustering via Hierarchical Semantic Alignment and Cooperative Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13887</link>

Abstract: Incomplete multi-view data, where certain views are entirely missing for some samples, poses significant challenges for traditional multi-view clustering methods. Existing deep incomplete multi-view clustering approaches often rely on static fusion strategies or two-stage pipelines, leading to suboptimal fusion results and error propagation issues. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel incomplete multi-view clustering framework based on Hierarchical Semantic Alignment and Cooperative Completion (HSACC). HSACC achieves robust cross-view fusion through a dual-level semantic space design. In the low-level semantic space, consistency alignment is ensured by maximizing mutual information across views. In the high-level semantic space, adaptive view weights are dynamically assigned based on the distributional affinity between individual views and an initial fused representation, followed by weighted fusion to generate a unified global representation. Additionally, HSACC implicitly recovers missing views by projecting aligned latent representations into high-dimensional semantic spaces and jointly optimizes reconstruction and clustering objectives, enabling cooperative learning of completion and clustering. Experimental results demonstrate that HSACC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the hierarchical alignment and dynamic weighting mechanisms, while parameter analysis confirms the model's robustness to hyperparameter variations.

      <title>Context-Aware Asymmetric Ensembling for Interpretable Retinopathy of Prematurity Screening via Active Query and Vascular Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is among the major causes of preventable childhood blindness. Automated screening remains challenging, primarily due to limited data availability and the complex condition involving both structural staging and microvascular abnormalities. Current deep learning models depend heavily on large private datasets and passive multimodal fusion, which commonly fail to generalize on small, imbalanced public cohorts. We thus propose the Context-Aware Asymmetric Ensemble Model (CAA Ensemble) that simulates clinical reasoning through two specialized streams. First, the Multi-Scale Active Query Network (MS-AQNet) serves as a structure specialist, utilizing clinical contexts as dynamic query vectors to spatially control visual feature extraction for localization of the fibrovascular ridge. Secondly, VascuMIL encodes Vascular Topology Maps (VMAP) within a gated Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) network to precisely identify vascular tortuosity. A synergistic meta-learner ensembles these orthogonal signals to resolve diagnostic discordance across multiple objectives. Tested on a highly imbalanced cohort of 188 infants (6,004 images), the framework attained State-of-the-Art performance on two distinct clinical tasks: achieving a Macro F1-Score of 0.93 for Broad ROP staging and an AUC of 0.996 for Plus Disease detection. Crucially, the system features `Glass Box' transparency through counterfactual attention heatmaps and vascular threat maps, proving that clinical metadata dictates the model's visual search. Additionally, this study demonstrates that architectural inductive bias can serve as an effective bridge for the medical AI data gap.</description>
