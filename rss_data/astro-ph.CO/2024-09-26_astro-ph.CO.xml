      <title>Calibration Measurements of the BICEP3 and BICEP Array CMB Polarimeters from 2017 to 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BICEP3 and BICEP Array polarimeters are small-aperture refracting telescopes located at the South Pole designed to measure primordial gravitational wave signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization, predicted by inflation. Constraining the inflationary signal requires not only excellent sensitivity, but also careful control of instrumental systematics. Both instruments use antenna-coupled orthogonally polarized detector pairs, and the polarized sky signal is reconstructed by taking the difference in each detector pair. As a result, the differential response between detectors within a pair becomes an important systematic effect we must control. Additionally, mapping the intensity and polarization response in regions away from the main beam can inform how sidelobe levels affect CMB measurements. Extensive calibration measurements are taken in situ every austral summer for control of instrumental systematics and instrument characterisation. In this work, we detail the set of beam calibration measurements that we conduct on the BICEP receivers, from deep measurements of main beam response to polarized beam response and sidelobe mapping. We discuss the impact of these measurements for instrumental systematics studies and design choices for future CMB receivers.</description>

      <title>Relative distances and peculiar velicities of 140 groups and clusters of galaxies at low redshifts: the Hubble diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To determine the relative distances and peculiar velocities of 140 groups and clusters of galaxies at low redshifts ($z$ &lt; 0.12), we used the fundamental plane (FP) of early-type galaxies (from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data). We constructed the Hubble diagram for the relative distances of galaxy groups/clusters versus their radial velocities in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) reference frame in the flat $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model ($\Omega_m=0.3$, $H_0=70$~km~s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$). We have found that the standard logarithmic deviation for groups and clusters of galaxies on the Hubble diagram (minus peculiar velocities) is $\pm0.0173$ ($N$ = 140), which corresponds to a deviation of $70\pm2.8$~km~s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in the Hubble constant. For a sample of galaxy systems ($N$ = 63), the X-ray luminosity of which is in an interval of (0.151--4)~$\times 10^{44}$~erg/s, this quantity turned out to be $70\pm2.1$~km~s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. The root-mean-square deviations of peculiar velocities with quadratic accounting for errors are $&lt;V_{pec}^2&gt;^{1/2}$ = $714\pm7$~km/s and $600\pm7$~km/s, respectively. For five large superclusters of galaxies from the SDSS region, the average peculiar velocity relaive to the CMB reference frame is $+240\pm250$~km/s. We detected no outflow of galaxy systems from the void (Giant Void, $\alpha \approx 13^h, \delta \approx 40^\circ, z \approx 0.107$) formed by groups and clusters of galaxies.</description>

      <title>A gas rich cosmic web revealed by partitioning the missing baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximately half of the Universe's dark matter resides in collapsed halos; significantly less than half of the baryonic matter (protons and neutrons) remains confined to halos. A small fraction of baryons are in stars and the interstellar medium within galaxies. The lion's share are diffuse (less than $10^{-3}$ cm$^{-3}$) and ionized (neutral fraction less than $10^{-4}$), located in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and in the halos of galaxy clusters, groups, and galaxies. The quantity and spatial distribution of this diffuse ionized gas is notoriously difficult to measure, but has wide implications for galaxy formation, astrophysical feedback, and precision cosmology. Recently, the dispersion of extragalactic Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) has been used to measure the total content of cosmic baryons. However, past efforts had modest samples and methods that cannot discriminate between IGM and halo gas, which is critical for studying feedback and for observational cosmology. Here, we present a large cosmological sample of FRB sources localized to their host galaxies. We have robustly partitioned the missing baryons into the IGM, galaxy clusters, and galaxies, providing a late-Universe measurement of the total baryon density of $\Omega_b h_{70}$=0.049$\pm$0.003. Our results indicate efficient feedback processes that can expel gas from galaxy halos and into the intergalactic medium, agreeing with the enriched cosmic web scenario seen in cosmological simulations. The large diffuse baryon fraction that we have measured disfavours bottom-heavy stellar initial mass functions, which predict a large total stellar density, $\Omega_*$.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the shape: a multi-wavelength analysis of the galaxy clusters Abell 76 and Abell 1307</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the dynamical state of the galaxy clusters Abell 76 and Abell 1307 from the optical point of view, presenting a coherent scenario that responds to the X-ray emissions observed in these structures. Our study is based on 231 and 164 spectroscopic redshifts, for the clusters A76 and A1307, respectively. We find that A76 and A1307 are two galaxy clusters at $z=0.0390$ and 0.0815, respectively, with velocity dispersions of $650 \pm 56$ km s$^{-1}$ and $863 \pm 85$ km s$^{-1}$, and showing velocity distributions following, in practice, Gaussian profiles. From our dynamical analysis, X-ray studies and SZ-Planck emission, we obtain a mean total mass M$_{500} = 1.7 \pm 0.6 \cdot 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$ and $3.5 \pm 1.3 \cdot 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$ for A76 and A1307, respectively. We find that the spatial distribution of likely cluster members in the case of A76 is very anisotropic, while A1307 shows a compact distribution of galaxies, but double peaked and elongated in the south-north direction. we compare the XMM-Newton surface brightness maps with galaxy distributions and see that both distributions are correlated. We reconstruct the total mass profile and velocity anisotropy of both clusters by analysing the full projected phase space, through the MG-MAMPOSSt code. Our study reveals a slight indication of radial orbits for A76, while A1307 seems to prefer more isotropic orbits in the whole cluster range. Summarizing, A76 represent a typical young cluster, in an early stage of formation, with a very low X-ray surface brightness but high temperature showing a very anisotropic galaxy distribution. A1307 is however more consolidated and massive showing in-homogeneous galaxy distribution and an asymmetric X-ray emission, which suggest a scenario characterised by recent minor mergers.</description>

      <title>Matching current observational constraints with non-minimally coupled dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a universe with a non-minimally coupled scalar field can fit current measurements of the expansion rate of the Universe better than the standard $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter model or other minimally coupled dark energy models. While we find a clear improvement in the goodness of fit for this dark energy model with respect to others that have been considered in the recent literature, using various information theoretic criteria, we show that the evidence for it is still inconclusive.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy Beyond Planck? Constraints from multiple CMB probes, DESI BAO and Type-Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration, when combined with Planck satellite Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data and Type Ia Supernovae, suggest a preference for Dynamical Dark Energy (DDE) at a significance level ranging from $2.5\sigma$ to $3.9\sigma$. In this work, I test whether, and to what extent, this preference is supported by CMB experiments other than Planck. I analyze the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and South Pole Telescope (SPT) temperature, polarization, and lensing spectra at small scales, eventually combining them with Planck or WMAP 9-year observations at large angular scales. My analysis shows that ACT and WMAP data, when combined with DESI BAO and Pantheon-plus Supernovae, yield independent constraints with a precision comparable to Planck. Notably, in this case, the cosmological constant value is recovered within two standard deviations. A preference for DDE reappears when Pantheon-plus is replaced with distance moduli measurements from the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DESy5). However, it remains less pronounced compared to the Planck-based results. When considering SPT data, no clear preference for DDE is found, although the parameter uncertainties are significantly larger compared to both Planck- and ACT-based constraints. Overall, CMB experiments other than Planck generally weaken the evidence for DDE. I argue that the subsets of Planck data that strengthen the shift toward DDE are the temperature and E-mode polarization anisotropy measurements at large angular scales $\ell \lesssim 30$.</description>

      <title>An Analytically Tractable Marked Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing precision of cosmology data in the modern era is calling for methods to allow the extraction of non-Gaussian information using tools beyond two-point statistics. The marked power spectrum has the potential to extract beyond two-point information in a computationally efficient way while using much of the infrastructure already available for the power-spectrum. In this work we explore the marked power spectrum from an analytical perspective. In particular, we explore a low-order polynomial for the mark that allows us to better control the theoretical uncertainties and we show that with minimal new degrees of freedom the analytical results match measurements from N-body simulations for both the matter field and biased tracers in redshift space. Finally, we show that even within the limited forms of mark that we consider, there are degeneracies that can be broken by inclusion of the marked auto-spectrum or the cross-spectrum with the unmarked field. We discuss future theoretical developments that would enable us to apply this approach to survey data.</description>

      <title>Islands in Bianchi type-I Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the conditions for finding an island in an anisotropic universe - Bianchi Type-I filled with radiation. We verify that the existence of islands does not depend on their shape. We then find that islands may form at certain times, near the turnaround point - where the universe turns from contraction to expansion in one of the directions. This is in line with previous analyses regarding cosmological space-times where islands form if one has two energy scales in the problem, such as the typical temperature of the universe and, on top of that, CC, curvature, anisotropy, or some mass scale.</description>

      <title>Detecting dark objects with plasma microlensing by their gravitational wakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A moving mass makes a gravitational wake in the partially ionized interstellar medium, which acts as a lens for radio-frequency light. Consequently, plasma microlensing could complement gravitational microlensing in the search for invisible massive objects, such as stellar remnants or compact dark matter. This work explores the spatial structure of the plasma lens associated with a gravitational wake. Far away from the moving mass, the characteristic lensing signal is the steady demagnification or magnification of a radio source as the wake passes in front of it at the speed of sound. Sources can be plasma lensed at a much greater angular distance than they would be gravitationally lensed to the same degree by the same object. However, only the wakes of objects greatly exceeding stellar mass are expected to dominate over the random turbulence in the interstellar medium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aiming to uncover the CP properties of spin-0 particle Dark Matter (DM), we explore a two-component DM scenario within the framework of 3-Higgs Doublet Models (3HDMs), a well-motivated set-up previously studied due to the complementarity of its collider and astrophysical probes. We devise benchmark points in which the two components of DM have same CP in one case and opposite CP in another. We then show several cross section distributions of observables at collider experiments where the two cases are clearly distinguishable.</description>

      <title>Optimised neural network predictions of galaxy formation histories using semi-stochastic corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16548v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel methodology to improve neural network (NN) predictions of galaxy formation histories by incorporating semi-stochastic corrections to account for short-timescale variability. Our paper addresses limitations in existing models that capture broad trends in galaxy evolution, but fail to reproduce the bursty nature of star formation and chemical enrichment, resulting in inaccurate predictions of key observables such as stellar masses, optical spectra, and colour distributions. We introduce a simple technique to add stochastic components by utilizing the power spectra of galaxy formation histories. We justify our stochastic approach by studying the correlation between the phases of the halo mass assembly and star-formation histories in the IllustrisTNG simulation, and we find that they are correlated only on timescales longer than 6 Gyr, with a strong dependence on galaxy type. Building on NNs developed in Chittenden &amp; Tojeiro (2023), trained on hydrodynamical simulations from the IllustrisTNG project, which predict time-resolved star formation and stellar metallicity histories for central and satellite galaxies based solely on the properties and evolution of their dark matter halos and environments, this approach successfully recovers realistic variability in galaxy properties at short timescales. It significantly improves the accuracy of predicted stellar masses, metallicities, spectra, and colour distributions and provides a powerful framework for generating large, realistic mock galaxy catalogs, while also enhancing our understanding of the complex interplay between galaxy evolution and dark matter halo assembly.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part IVa. Classification of manifolds using machine learning: a case study with small toroidal universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-trivial spatial topology of the Universe may give rise to potentially measurable signatures in the cosmic microwave background. We explore different machine learning approaches to classify harmonic-space realizations of the microwave background in the test case of Euclidean $E_1$ topology (the 3-torus) with a cubic fundamental domain of a size scale significantly smaller than the diameter of the last scattering surface. This is the first step toward developing a machine learning approach to classification of cosmic topology and likelihood-free inference of topological parameters. Different machine learning approaches are capable of classifying the harmonic-space realizations with accuracy greater than 99% if the topology scale is half of the diameter of the last-scattering surface and orientation of the topology is known. For distinguishing random rotations of these sky realizations from realizations of the covering space, the extreme gradient boosting classifier algorithm performs best with an accuracy of 88%. Slightly lower accuracies of 83% to 87% are obtained with the random forest classifier along with one- and two-dimensional convolutional neural networks. The techniques presented here can also accurately classify non-rotated cubic $E_1$ topology realizations with a topology scale slightly larger than the diameter of the last-scattering surface, if enough training data are provided. While information compressing methods like most machine learning approaches cannot exceed the statistical power of a likelihood-based approach that captures all available information, they potentially offer a computationally cheaper alternative. A principle challenge appears to be accounting for arbitrary orientations of a given topology, although this is also a significant hurdle for likelihood-based approaches.</description>

Abstract: We probe the astrophysical gravitational-wave background resulting from compact binary coalescences, focusing on Population III binary black holes. We exploit results of state-of-the-art simulations on the evolution of Population I-II and III binaries, considering a variety of initial condition and star formation rate models for the latter. The contribution from Population III binary black holes is found to be very small, with no effect on the gravitational-wave spectrum. A network of third-generation detectors will detect easier individual Population III binaries, due to their significantly higher masses, hence decreasing even further their residual contribution.</description>

      <title>CMB-PAInT: An inpainting tool for the cosmic microwave background</title>

Abstract: The presence of astrophysical emissions in microwave observations forces us to perform component separation to extract the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) signal. However, even in the most optimistic cases, there are still strongly contaminated regions, such as the Galactic plane or those with emission from extragalactic point sources, which require the use of a mask. Since many CMB analyses, especially the ones working in harmonic space, need the whole sky map, it is crucial to develop a reliable inpainting algorithm that replaces the values of the excluded pixels by others statistically compatible with the rest of the sky. This is especially important when working with $Q$ and $U$ sky maps in order to obtain $E$- and $B$-mode maps which are free from $E$-to-$B$ leakage. In this work we study a method based on Gaussian Constrained Realizations (GCR), that can deal with both intensity and polarization. Several tests have been performed to asses the validation of the method, including the study of the one-dimensional probability distribution function (1-PDF), E- and B-mode map reconstruction, and power spectra estimation. We have considered two scenarios for the input simulation: one case with only CMB signal and a second one including also Planck PR4 semi-realistic noise. Even if we are limited to low resolution maps, $N_{\mathrm{side}} = $ 64 if $T$, $Q$ and $U$ are considered, we believe that this is a useful approach to be applied to future missions such as LiteBIRD, where the target are the largest scales.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Flow of Primordial Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00655v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlation functions of primordial density fluctuations provide an exciting probe of the physics governing the earliest moments of our Universe. However, the standard approach to compute them is technically challenging. Theoretical predictions are therefore available only in restricted classes of theories. In this Letter, we present a complete method to systematically compute tree-level inflationary correlators. This method is based on following the time evolution of equal-time correlators and it accurately captures all physical effects in any theory. These theories are conveniently formulated at the level of inflationary fluctuations, and can feature any number of degrees of freedom with arbitrary dispersion relations and masses, coupled through any type of time-dependent interactions. We demonstrate the power of this approach by exploring the properties of the cosmological collider signal, a discovery channel for new high-energy physics, in theories with strong mixing and in the presence of features. This work lays the foundation for a universal program to assist our theoretical understanding of inflationary physics and generate theoretical data for an unbiased interpretation of upcoming cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>First Constraints from DAMIC-M on Sub-GeV Dark-Matter Particles Interacting with Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report constraints on sub-GeV dark matter particles interacting with electrons from the first underground operation of DAMIC-M detectors. The search is performed with an integrated exposure of 85.23 g days, and exploits the subelectron charge resolution and low level of dark current of DAMIC-M charge-coupled devices (CCDs). Dark-matter-induced ionization signals above the detector dark current are searched for in CCD pixels with charge up to 7e$^-$. With this dataset we place limits on dark matter particles of mass between 0.53 and 1000 MeV/$c^2$, excluding unexplored regions of parameter space in the mass ranges [1.6,1000] MeV/$c^2$ and [1.5,15.1] MeV/$c^2$ for ultralight and heavy mediator interactions, respectively.</description>

      <title>Dark energy evolution from quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If an ultraviolet fixed point renders quantum gravity renormalizable, the effective potential for a singlet scalar field -- the cosmon -- can be computed according to the corresponding scaling solution of the renormalization group equations. We associate the largest intrinsic mass scale generated by the flow away from the fixed point with the scale of present dark energy density or even smaller. This results in a highly predictive scenario for the evolution of dynamical dark energy. It solves the cosmological constant problem dynamically, and may be called "quantum gravity quintessence". A first setting without quantum scale symmetry violation in the neutrino sector could explain the present amount of dark energy, but fails for the constraints on its time evolution. In contrast, a logarithmic scale symmetry violation in the beyond standard model sector responsible for the neutrino masses induces a non-vanishing cosmon-neutrino coupling in the Einstein frame. This yields a cosmology similar to growing neutrino quintessence, which could be compatible with present observations. The small number of unknown parameters turns the scaling solution for quantum gravity into a fundamental explanation of dynamical dark energy which can be falsified.</description>

      <title>Capability of Cosmic Gravitational Focusing on Identifying the Neutrino Mass Ordering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmic gravitational focusing (CGF) of relic neutrinos can provide an independent measurement of the absolute neutrino masses $m_i$ with fourth-power dependence ($m^4_i$). We demonstrate in this paper for the first time how this can help identifying the neutrino mass ordering (NMO). Upon incorporating the projected CGF sensitivity at DESI, the preference for the normal ordering (NO) with a prior $\sum m_\nu &gt; 0.059\,{\rm eV}$ would increase from the original 89.9\% of the current clustering method with both DESI BAO and CMB to 98.2\% while the inverted ordering (IO) is further disfavored from 10.1\% to 1.8\%. We also show how this can affect the prospects of the neutrinoless double beta decay and single beta decay measurements.</description>

      <title>SMILE: Discriminating milli-lens systems in a pilot project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark Matter (DM) remains poorly probed on critical, sub-galactic scales, where predictions from different models diverge in terms of abundance and density profiles of halos. Gravitational lens systems on milli-arcsecond scales (milli-lenses) are expected for a population of dense DM halos, or free-floating supermassive black holes (SMBHs), that might be comprised of primordial black holes (PBHs), in the mass range of $10^6$ to $10^9 M_\odot$. In this paper, we aim to look for milli-lens systems via a systematic search in a large sample of radio-loud AGN observed with very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI). We present the observational strategy to discriminate milli-lenses from contaminant objects mimicking a milli-lens morphology. In a pilot project, we have investigated VLBI images from 13,828 sources from the Astrogeo VLBI image database and reduced the number of candidates to 40 in a first step. We present here the images and analysis of sensitive follow-up observations with the EVN at 5 and 22 GHz, and streamline our analysis to reject milli-lens candidates. Using constraints such as the surface brightness ratio, conservation of spectral shape, stability of flux ratios over time, and changes in morphology, we can confidently discriminate between milli-lenses and their mimickers. Using the above constraints, we rule out 32 out of our initial 40 candidates as milli-lenses, demonstrating the power of our approach. Also, we find many new candidates for compact symmetric objects, that are thought to be short-lived, jetted radio sources. This serves as a pathfinder for the final sample used for the SMILE (Search for MIlli-LEnses) project, which will allow us to constrain DM models by comparing the results to theoretical predictions. This SMILE sample will consist of $\sim$5,000 sources based on the VLA CLASS survey, including many observations obtained for this project specifically.</description>
