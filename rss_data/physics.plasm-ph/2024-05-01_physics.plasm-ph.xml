      <title>Correlations between X-rays, Visible Light and Drive-Beam Energy Loss Observed in Plasma Wakefield Acceleration Experiments at FACET-II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study documents several correlations observed during the first run of the plasma wakefield acceleration experiment E300 conducted at FACET-II, using a single drive electron bunch. The established correlations include those between the measured maximum energy loss of the drive electron beam and the integrated betatron x-ray signal, the calculated total beam energy deposited in the plasma and the integrated x-ray signal, among three visible light emission measuring cameras, and between the visible plasma light and x-ray signal. The integrated x-ray signal correlates almost linearly with both the maximum energy loss of the drive beam and the energy deposited into the plasma, demonstrating its usability as a measure of energy transfer from the drive beam to the plasma. Visible plasma light is found to be a useful indicator of the presence of wake at three locations that overall are two meters apart. Despite the complex dynamics and vastly different timescales, the x-ray radiation from the drive bunch and visible light emission from the plasma may prove to be effective non-invasive diagnostics for monitoring the energy transfer from the beam to the plasma in future high-repetition-rate experiments.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional plasmoid-mediated reconnection and turbulence in Hall magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmoid instability accelerates reconnection in collisional plasmas by transforming a laminar reconnection layer into numerous plasmoids connected by secondary current sheets in two dimensions (2D) and by fostering self-generated turbulent reconnection in three dimensions (3D). In large-scale astrophysical and space systems, plasmoid instability likely initiates in the collisional regime but may transition into the collisionless regime as the fragmentation of the current sheet progresses toward kinetic scales. Hall MHD models are widely regarded as a simplified yet effective representation of the transition from collisional to collisionless reconnection. However, plasmoid instability in 2D Hall MHD simulations often leads to a single-X-line reconnection configuration, which significantly differs from fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulation results. This study shows that single-X-line reconnection is less likely to occur in 3D compared to 2D. Moreover, depending on the Lundquist number and the ratio between the system size and the kinetic scale, Hall MHD can also realize 3D self-generated turbulent reconnection. We analyze the features of the self-generated turbulent state, including the energy power spectra and the scale dependence of turbulent eddy anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Effect of detachment on Magnum-PSI ELM-like pulses: I. Direct observations and qualitative results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditions similar to those at the end of the divertor leg in a tokamak were replicated in the linear plasma machine Magnum-PSI. The neutral pressure in the target chamber is then increased to cause the target to transition from an attached to a detached state. Superimposed to this steady state regime, ELM-like pulses are reproduced, resulting in a sudden increase in plasma temperature and density, such that the heat flux increases transiently by half an order of magnitude. Visible light emission, target thermography, and Thomson scattering are used to demonstrate that the higher the neutral pressure the more energy is removed from the ELM-like pulse in the volume. If the neutral pressure is sufficiently high, the ELM-like pulse can be prevented from affecting the target and the plasma energy is fully dissipated in the volume instead (ID 4 in Table 1). The visible light images allow the division of the ELM-plasma interaction process of ELM energy dissipation into 3 "stages" ranging from no dissipation to full dissipation (the target plasma is detached). In the second publication related to this study, spectroscopic data is analysed with a Bayesian approach, to acquire insights into the significance of molecular processes in dissipating the plasma energy and particles.</description>

      <title>Unified Framework of Forced Magnetic Reconnection and Alfv\'en Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A unified linear theory that includes forced reconnection as a particular case of Alfv\'en resonance is presented. We consider a generalized Taylor problem in which a sheared magnetic field is subject to a time-dependent boundary perturbation oscillating at frequency $\omega_0$. By analyzing the asymptotic time response of the system, the theory demonstrates that the Alfv\'en resonance is due to the residues at the resonant poles, in the complex frequency plane, introduced by the boundary perturbation. Alfv\'en resonance transitions towards forced reconnection, described by the constant-psi regime for (normalized) times $t\gg S^{1/3}$, when the forcing frequency of the boundary perturbation is $\omega_0\ll S^{-1/3}$, allowing the coupling of the Alfv\'en resonances across the neutral line with the reconnecting mode, as originally suggested in [1]. Additionally, it is shown that even if forced reconnection develops for finite, albeit small, frequencies, the reconnection rate and reconnected flux are strongly reduced for frequencies $\omega_0\gg S^{-3/5}$.</description>

      <title>Thermal Fluid Closures and Pressure Anisotropies in Numerical Simulations of Plasma Wakefield Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of plasma-based acceleration processes with collisionless particle dynamics and non negligible thermal effects. We aim at assessing the applicability of fluid-like models, obtained by suitable closure assumptions applied to the relativistic kinetic equations, thus not suffering of statistical noise, even in presence of a finite temperature. The work here presented focuses on the characterization of pressure anisotropies, which crucially depend on the adopted closure scheme, and hence are useful to discern the appropriate thermal fluid model. To this aim, simulation results of spatially resolved fluid models with different thermal closure assumptions are compared with the results of particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations at changing temperature and amplitude of plasma oscillations.</description>

      <title>Neutral hydrogen filaments in interstellar media: Are they physical?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trending term "filament" is extensively used in the interstellar medium (ISM) and the star formation community, and is believed to be one of the most important objects that gauge molecular cloud and star formation. However, the physical definition of these ubiquitous, elongated, high contrast features is poorly defined and still actively debated. Despite the absence of a unified consensus, filaments are believed to be involved in many important physical processes from galaxy structure formation to the emergence of protostellar objects. Therefore, understanding how filaments form, what constrains their growth, and their general physical properties, are extremely important for theorists and observers who study the dynamics of the ISM and consequent star formations. This review serves as a collection of the community's views and develops the concept of "filaments" in the context of the ISM and star-forming clouds. Observationally, filaments are seen across the entire sky and often carry an aspect ratio of the order of hundreds. In the context of the ISM, filaments are believed to form by stretching and tearing from magnetized ISM turbulence. ISM filaments are subjected to heating and cooling phases, and are likely to be magnetically aligned. Cold clouds are formed inside ISM due to turbulence instability. This review updates the understanding of ISM filaments in the community.</description>

      <title>Tayler Instability Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tayler instability of toroidal magnetic fields $B_\phi$ is broadly invoked as a trigger for turbulence and angular momentum transport in stars. This paper presents a systematic revision of the linear stability analysis for a rotating, magnetized, and stably stratified star. For plausible configurations of $B_\phi$, instability requires diffusive processes: viscosity, magnetic diffusivity, or thermal/compositional diffusion. Our results reveal a new physical picture, demonstrating how different diffusive effects independently trigger instability of two types of waves in the rotating star: magnetostrophic waves and inertial waves. It develops via overstability of the waves, whose growth rate sharply peaks at some characteristic wavenumbers. We determine instability conditions for each wave branch and find the characteristic wavenumbers. The results are qualitatively different for stars with magnetic Prandtl number $Pm\ll 1$ (e.g. the Sun) and $Pm\gg 1$ (e.g. protoneutron stars). The parameter dependence of unstable modes suggests a non-universal scaling of the possible Tayler-Spruit dynamo.</description>

      <title>Low-energy Injection and Nonthermal Particle Acceleration in Relativistic Magnetic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic magnetic turbulence has been proposed as a process for producing nonthermal particles in high-energy astrophysics. The particle energization may be contributed by both magnetic reconnection and turbulent fluctuations, but their interplay is poorly understood. It has been suggested that during magnetic reconnection the parallel electric field dominates the particle acceleration up to the lower bound of the power-law particle spectrum, but recent studies show that electric fields perpendicular to the magnetic field can play an important, if not dominant role. In this study, we carry out fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of magnetically dominated decaying turbulence in a relativistic pair plasma. For a fixed magnetization parameter $\sigma_0 = 20$, we find that the injection energy~$\varepsilon_{\rm inj}$ converges with increasing domain size to~$\varepsilon_{\rm inj} \simeq 10 \, m_ec^2$. In contrast, the power-law index, the cut-off energy, and the power-law extent increase steadily with domain size. We trace a large number of particles and evaluate the contributions of the work done by the parallel ($W_\parallel$) and perpendicular ($W_\perp$) electric fields during both the injection phase and the post-injection phase. We find that during the injection phase, the $W_\perp$ contribution increases with domain size, suggesting that it may eventually dominate injection for a sufficiently large domain. In contrast, both components contribute equally during the post-injection phase, insensitive to the domain size. For high energy ($\varepsilon \gg \varepsilon_{\rm inj}$) particles, $W_\perp$ dominates the subsequent energization. These findings may improve our understanding of nonthermal particles and their emissions in astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Tunable Collective Excitations in Epitaxial Perovskite Nickelates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of plasmons through the collective excitation of charge density has generated intense discussions, offering insights to fundamental sciences and potential applications. While the underlying physical principles have been well-established, the effects of multibody interactions and orbital hybridization on plasmonic dynamics remain understudied. In this work, we present the observation of conventional metallic and correlated plasmons in epitaxial La1-xSrxNiO3 (LSNO) films with varying Sr doping concentrations (x = 0, 0.125, 0.25), unveiling their intriguing evolution. Unlike samples at other doping concentrations, the x = 0.125 intermediate doping sample does not exhibit the correlated plasmons despite showing high optical conductivity. Through experimental investigation using spectroscopic ellipsometry and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, that is further supported by theoretical calculations, the O2p-Ni3d orbital hybridization for x = 0.125 is found to be significantly enhanced, alongside a considerable weakening of its effective correlation U*. These factors account for the absence of correlated plasmons and the high optical conductivity observed in LSNO (0.125). Our findings highlight the significant impact of orbital hybridization on the electronic structures and the formation of quasiparticles in strongly correlated systems, thereby marking a notable advancement in plasmonics, emphasizing LSNO's compelling potential as a substitute material in optoelectronic devices.</description>

Abstract: The reactive collisions of the CH$^+$ molecular ion with electrons is studied in the framework of the multichannel quantum defect theory, taking into account the contribution of the core-excited Rydberg states. In addition to the $X^1\Sigma^+$ ground state of the ion, we also consider the contribution to the dynamics of the $a^3\Pi$ and $A^1\Pi$ excited states of CH$^+$. Our results - in the case of the dissociative recombination in good agreement with the storage ring measurements - rely on decisive improvements - complete account of the ionisation channels and accurate evaluation of the reaction matrix - of a previously used model.</description>

      <title>The finite-$T$ Lorentz number and the thermal conductivity. Aluminum and carbon conductivities from ambient to millions of degrees Kelvin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical prediction of the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ of metal-like electron-ion systems would be greatly simplified if a convenient generalization of the Lorentz number $L_N$ for arbitrary temperatures ($T$) and densities were available. Such calculations are needed in astrophysics, high-energy-density physics, semiconductor physics as well as in materials science. We present a finite-$T$ form of $L_N(T)$, expressed in terms of elementary Fermi integrals. It is a universal function of $t=T/E_F$, where $E_F$ is the Fermi energy of the electrons. A convenient four-parameter fit to $L_N(t)$ for $t=0-\infty$ further simplifies the applications. The effect of electron-electron interactions is also briefly discussed. Calculations for $L_N(t)$ and thermal conductivities $\kappa$ for Al and C are presented at several compressions and into the million-Kelvin range. Experimental isobaric conductivities for Al just above the meting point, and isochoric conductivities for Al and C from available density-functional theory simulations and average-atom calculations are used as comparisons.</description>

      <title>Quasi-single-stage optimization for permanent magnet stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advanced stellarators are typically optimized in two stages. The plasma equilibrium is optimized first, followed by the design of coils/permanent magnets. However, the coils/permanent magnets in the second stage may become too complex to achieve the desired equilibrium. To address this problem, a quasi-single-stage optimization method has been proposed. In this paper, we introduce this method for designing permanent magnet (PM) stellarators. The new approach combines straightforward PM metrics to penalize the maximum required PM thickness and the mismatch between the fixed-boundary equilibrium and the free-boundary one, along with typical physical targets. Since the degrees of freedom of the PMs are not included and directly used to minimize the objective function in this method, so we call it "quasi-single-stage" optimization. We apply this quasi-single-stage optimization method to find a new quasi-axisymmetric PM design. The new design starts from MUSE, which was initially designed using a two-stage optimization approach. The resulting design, MUSE++, exhibits an order of magnitude lower quasi-symmetric error and a one-order reduction in normal field error. We show that MUSE++ has approximately 30% fewer magnets compared to a proxy model "MUSE-0" that uses the same FAMUS optimization without the benefit of a single-stage equilibrium optimization. These results demonstrate that the new single-stage optimization method can concurrently improve plasma properties and simplify permanent magnet complexity.</description>

      <title>Generation of High-Brilliance Polarized $\gamma$-Rays via Vacuum Dichroism-assisted Vacuum Birefringence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We put forward a novel method to generate high-brilliance polarized $\gamma$-photon beams via vacuum dichroism (VD)-assisted vacuum birefringence (VB) effect. We split a linearly polarized (LP) laser pulse into two subpulses with the first one colliding with a dense unpolarized electron beam to generate LP $\gamma$ photons (via nonlinear Compton scattering), which then further collide with the second subpulse and are partially transformed into circularly polarized ones via the VB effect. We find that by manipulating the relative polarization of two subpulses, one can ``purify'' (i.e., enhance) the polarization of the $\gamma$-photon beam via the VD effect. Due to the VD assistance, the VB effect reaches optimal when the relative polarization is nearly $30^\circ$, not the widely used $45^\circ$ in the common VB detection methods. In addition, our method can be used to efficiently confirm the well-known VB effect itself, which has not been directly observed in experiments yet.</description>

      <title>Small-scale dynamo with nonzero correlation time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The small-scale dynamo is typically studied by assuming that the correlation time of the velocity field is zero. Some authors have used a smooth renovating flow model to study how the properties of the dynamo are affected by the correlation time being nonzero. Here, we assume the velocity is an incompressible Gaussian random field (which need not be smooth), and derive the lowest-order corrections to the evolution equation for the two-point correlation of the magnetic field in Fourier space. Using this, we obtain the evolution equation for the longitudinal correlation function of the magnetic field ($M_L$) in nonhelical turbulence, valid for arbitrary Prandtl number. The non-resistive terms of this equation do not contain spatial derivatives of $M_L$ of order greater than two. We further simplify this equation in the limit of high Prandtl number, and find that the growth rate of the magnetic energy is much smaller than previously reported. Nevertheless, the magnetic power spectrum still retains the Kazantsev form at high Prandtl number.</description>

Abstract: The partition of turbulent heating between ions and electrons in radiatively inefficient accretion flows plays a crucial role in determining the observational appearance of accreting black holes. Modeling this partition is, however, a challenging problem because of the large scale separation between the macroscopic scales at which energy is injected by turbulence and the microscopic ones at which it is dissipated into heat. Recent studies of particle heating from collisionless damping of turbulent energy have shown that the partition of energy between ions and electrons is dictated by the ratio of the energy injected into the slow and Alfv\'en wave cascades as well as the plasma $\beta$ parameter. In this paper, we study the mechanism of the injection of turbulent energy into slow- and Alfv\'en- wave cascades in magnetized shear flows. We show that this ratio depends on the particular ($r\phi$) components of the Maxwell and Reynolds stress tensors that cause the transport of angular momentum, the shearing rate, and the orientation of the mean magnetic field with respect to the shear. We then use numerical magnetohydrodynamic shearing-box simulations with background conditions relevant to black hole accretion disks to compute the magnitudes of the stress tensors for turbulence driven by the magneto-rotational instability and derive the injection power ratio between slow and Alfv\'en wave cascades. We use these results to formulate a local subgrid model for the ion-to-electron heating ratio that depends on the macroscopic characteristics of the accretion flow.</description>
