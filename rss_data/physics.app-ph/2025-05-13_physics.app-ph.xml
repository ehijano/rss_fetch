      <title>Measurement of Multilayer Coating Thickness on Interwoven Carbon-Fiber-Reinforced Polymers Using the Terahertz PHASR Scanner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coating thickness measurement and inspection of defects beneath optically opaque surfaces are among the most promising commercial applications of the terahertz (THz) imaging technology. However, there are two main sources of complexity in THz spectral measurements that have resulted in reduced accuracy and high uncertainty in the determination of coating thicknesses. These factors include: 1. The need for \textit{a priori} knowledge of the complex index of refraction of each coating layer, and 2. The complex and polarization-sensitive reflectivity of samples with carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) substrates. In this paper, we propose a combined hardware and software solution to address these two limitations. We employ the polarimetric version of our Portable HAndheld Spectral Reflection (PHASR) Scanner and use a novel training model on time-of-flight measurements obtained by sparse deconvolution of the THz time-domain pulses. Our method does not depend on separate measurement of the index of refraction of the coating layers; rather, it relies on a physics-based linear model, trained using a small subset of the sample data. We show that thickness measurements with mean square error of about 10 $\mu$m and accuracy of more than 92\% can be achieved when the useful bandwidth of the scanner is limited to about 1.5 THz using photoconductive antenna emitters and detectors. We show that the anisotropic response of the carbon fiber bundles and the weave pattern structure of the substrate can significantly influence the accuracy of the coating measurement, and therefore a polarimetric imaging approach should be used for inspection of similar samples.</description>

      <title>Damping and vibration properties of alginate-poloxamer hydrogels doped with sepiolite and cactus fibres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated a novel class of composite hydrogels composed of alginate, poloxamer, sepiolite, and cactus fibres for vibration damping applications. Using a Design of Experiments methodology, we systematically correlated manufacturing parameters with mechanical and damping properties, performance using Dynamic Mechanical Analysis and vibration testing. The hydrogels were characterised under controlled temperature, frequency, and humidity conditions, with results demonstrating that the storage modulus can reach up to twice that of pure hydrogel formulations, using diluted dispersions with total additive concentration below 2 wt%. Sepiolite additions below 0.3 wt% were found to stabilise the material response to temperature variations, while cactus fibres enhanced both stiffness and damping performance in a concentration-dependent manner. Optimal performance was achieved with a formulation containing 5 wt% alginate, 5 wt% poloxamer, 0.1 wt% sepiolite, and 2 wt% cactus fibres. This composition provided a favourable balance between quasi-static mechanical integrity and dynamic damping capability, with loss factors exceeding 0.4. These findings provide a foundation for developing advanced and sustainable hydrogel materials with tailorable vibration damping characteristics.</description>

      <title>Identification and minimization of losses in microscaled spin-wave transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnonics is a promising platform for integrated radio frequency (rf) devices, leveraging its inherent non-reciprocity and reconfigurability. However, the efficiency of spin-wave transducers driven by rf-currents remains a major challenge. In this study, we systematically investigate a spin-wave transducer composed of micron-sized rf antennas on yttrium iron garnet (YIG) films of different thickness - an ideal testbed for integrated magnonic devices. Using propagating spin-wave spectroscopy and numerical simulations, we analyze spin-wave transmission, identifying key loss mechanisms and improving device efficiency by reducing ohmic resistance. The resulting improvements enable high transmission efficiency while exploiting non-reciprocity to achieve significant isolation on the microscale.</description>

      <title>Graphene-based magnetoelastic biosensor for COVID-19 serodiagnosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents an innovative magnetoelastic (ME) biosensor using graphene functionalized with the SARS-CoV-2 N protein for antibody detection via magnetoelastic resonance. Graphene was chosen for its biocompatibility and high surface area, enabling efficient antigen adsorption, validated by techniques such as energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and micro-Raman spectroscopy. Changes in Raman bands (a $\sim 10~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ shift in the 2D band and an increase in the $I_D/I_G$ ratio from 0.03 to 0.60) confirmed non-covalent interactions and enhanced surface coverage with ~100 $\mu$g of N protein. Tests using human plasma (10 RT-PCR-positive and 10 negative samples) demonstrated a clear distinction between groups using graphene sensors functionalized with ~100 $\mu$g of N protein. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) validation corroborated the results. Optimization of protein concentration and biofunctionalization time highlighted the importance of homogeneous surface coverage for reproducibility of the graphene-based ME biosensor. The platform combines graphene's advantages with the wireless, real-time detection capabilities of ME sensors, offering low cost, high sensitivity, and potential for automation, with applications in point-of-care diagnostics.</description>

      <title>QUEST: QUantum-Enhanced Shared Transportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce ``Windbreaking-as-a-Service'' (WaaS) as an innovative approach to shared transportation in which larger ``windbreaker'' vehicles provide aerodynamic shelter for ``windsurfer'' vehicles, thereby reducing drag and fuel consumption. As a computational framework to solve the large-scale matching and assignment problems that arise in WaaS, we present \textbf{QUEST} (Quantum-Enhanced Shared Transportation). Specifically, we formulate the pairing of windbreakers and windsurfers -- subject to timing, speed, and vehicle-class constraints -- as a mixed-integer quadratic problem (MIQP). Focusing on a single-segment prototype, we verify the solution classically via the Hungarian Algorithm, a Gurobi-based solver, and brute-force enumeration of binary vectors. We then encode the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and map it to an Ising Hamiltonian, enabling the use of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and other quantum and classical annealing technologies. Our quantum implementation successfully recovers the optimal assignment identified by the classical methods, confirming the soundness of the QUEST pipeline for a controlled prototype. While QAOA and other quantum heuristics do not guarantee a resolution of the fundamental complexity barriers, this study illustrates how the WaaS problem can be systematically translated into a quantum-ready model. It also lays the groundwork for addressing multi-segment scenarios and potentially leveraging quantum advantage for large-scale shared-transportation instances.</description>

      <title>Modelling of time-dependent electrostatic effects and AFM-based surface conductivity characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) combined with electrical modes provides a powerful contactless approach to characterize material electrical properties at the nanoscale. However, conventional electrostatic models often overlook dynamic charge effects, which are particularly relevant for 2D materials deposited on insulating substrates. In this work, we introduce a theoretical framework that extends traditional electrostatic models by incorporating charge dynamics, analyzing two key cases: quasi-ideal conductors and quasi-ideal insulators. Our model establishes a characteristic timescale, $\tau$, which governs charge redistribution and measurement reliability. Experimental validation using Graphene Oxide, Reduced Graphene Oxide, and lightly reduced GO demonstrates strong dependence of frequency shift on surface conductivity, confirming our predictions. Temperature-dependent measurements further reveal conductivity variations consistent with disordered electronic materials. These findings provide critical insight into the impact of finite surface conductivity on AFM-based techniques and establish a novel method for evaluating charge dynamics in individual flakes of 2D materials and propose an alternative, contactless method for estimating surface conductivity.</description>

      <title>A Non-planar ReBCO Test Coil with 3D-printed Aluminum Support Structure for the EPOS Stellarator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the test of a small scale, non-planar coil using non-insulated ReBCO tape wound on a 3D-printed aluminum support structure. A 3D-scan of the winding frame which was printed out of AlSi10Mg using selective laser melting, showed peak manufacturing deviations of 0.3 mm. We tested the coil with 21 turns of 3 mm wide tape cooled both by liquid nitrogen and with a cryocooler. We achieved a central field strength of up to 21 mT which agrees with the prediction suggesting that we manufactured the coil without defects. The peak field was reached at a supply current of 120 A. The current leads showed a contact resistance of $\left(2.25\pm0.13\right)\mu\Omega$. The discharge time $L/R$ was found to be 0.63 s in liquid nitrogen and 2.92 s when cooled by the cryocooler. From this we estimate a winding pack temperature of 41 K.</description>

      <title>Strategy for Bayesian Optimized Beam Steering at TRIUMF-ISAC's MEBT and HEBT Beamlines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the preparation of the operation of multiple Rare Isotope Beams (RIBs) when the Advanced Rare Isotope Laboratory (ARIEL) becomes operational, TRIUMF embarked on a program of advanced beam tuning applications and machine learning tools. The strategy for the application of Bayesian Optimization for beam steering purposes is being developed. A previously reported Bayesian optimization algorithm is used to tune accelerated charged particle beams at TRIUMF's ISAC postaccelerator facility. We present findings and results from multiple machine development experiments conducted between October and November 2024, as part of a pivot toward semi-automated machine tuning methods. These findings were instrumental in shaping the tuning strategy for the medium and high energy beam transport (MEBT, HEBT) lines at ISAC, by sequentially optimizing sub-sections of the beamlines.</description>

      <title>Empirical Thermophotovoltaic Performance Predictions and Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in the field of thermophotovoltaics, with efficiency recently rising to over 40% due to improvements in cell design and material quality, higher emitter temperatures, and better spectral management. However, inconsistencies in trends for efficiency with semiconductor bandgap energy across various temperatures pose challenges in predicting optimal bandgaps or expected performance for different applications. To address these issues, here we present realistic performance predictions for various types of single-junction cells over a broad range of emitter temperatures using an empirical model based on past cell measurements. Our model is validated using data from different authors with various bandgaps and emitter temperatures, and an excellent agreement is seen between the model and the experimental data. Using our model, we show that in addition to spectral losses, it is important to consider practical electrical losses associated with series resistance and cell quality to avoid overestimation of system efficiency. We also show the effect of modifying various system parameters such as bandgap, above and below-bandgap reflectance, saturation current, and series resistance on the efficiency and power density of thermophotovoltaics at different temperatures. Finally, we predict the bandgap energies for best performance over a range of emitter temperatures for different cell material qualities.</description>

      <title>Broadband Visible Wavelength Microcomb Generation In Silicon Nitride Microrings Through Air-Clad Dispersion Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of broadband microresonator frequency combs at visible wavelengths is pivotal for the advancement of compact and fieldable optical atomic clocks and spectroscopy systems. Yet, their realization necessitates resonators with anomalous dispersion, an arduous task due to the prevailing normal dispersion regime of materials within the visible spectrum. In this work, we evince that silicon nitride microring resonators with air cladding on top and sides -- a deviation from the frequently employed silica-embedded resonators -- allows for the direct generation of broadband microcombs in the visible range. We experimentally demonstrate combs pumped at 1060~nm (283~THz) that reach wavelengths as short as 680~nm (440 THz), and combs pumped at 780~nm (384 THz) that reach wavelengths as short as 630 nm (475 THz). We further show through simulations that microcombs extending to wavelengths as low as 461 nm (650 THz) should be accessible in this platform.</description>

Abstract: Synchronization of oscillators is ubiquitous in nature. Often, the synchronized oscillators couple directly, yet in some cases synchronization can arise from their parametric interactions. Here, we theoretically predict and experimentally demonstrate the parametric synchronization of a dissipative Kerr soliton frequency comb. We specifically show that the parametric interaction between the soliton and two auxiliary lasers permits the entrainment of the frequency comb repetition rate. Besides representing the first prediction and demonstration of parametric synchronization of soliton frequency combs, our scheme offers significant flexibility for all-optical metrological-scale stabilization of the comb.</description>

      <title>Highly Transparent Lead-Free Piezoelectric Haptic Device</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Acoustic haptic technology adds touch sensations to human-machine interfaces by integrating piezoelectric actuators onto touchscreens. Traditional piezoelectric haptic technologies use opaque lead-containing ceramics that are both toxic and visible. We have developed a highly transparent lead-free piezoelectric haptic device using potassium sodium niobate (KNN) and transparent conductive oxide thin films. The KNN film, grown on glass, exhibits a pure perovskite phase and a dense microstructure. This device achieves up to 80% transmittance, surpassing lead zirconate titanate (PZT) thin films. It generates an acoustic resonance at 16.5 kHz and produces a peak-to-peak displacement of 1.0 um at 28 V unipolar, making it suitable for surface rendering applications. This demonstrates the potential of transparent lead-free piezoelectric actuators as an effective alternative to conventional PZT haptic actuators.</description>

      <title>Interleaved dual-species arrays of single atoms using a passive optical element and one trapping laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate trapping of individual rubidium (Rb) and cesium (Cs) atoms in an interleaved array of bright tweezers and dark bottle-beam traps, using a microfabricated optical element illuminated by a single laser beam and a 4F system with spatial filtering. Our approach exploits the opposite-sign dynamic polarizabilities of Rb and Cs, ensuring each species is exclusively trapped in either bright or dark sites. The passive optical mask creates optimal trap depths for both species using three transmittance levels while minimizing the optical phase difference, implemented using a variable-thickness absorbing layer of amorphous germanium. This trapping architecture achieves atom loading rates close to 50% while reducing system complexity compared to conventional methods using active optoelectronic components and/or multiple laser wavelengths.</description>
