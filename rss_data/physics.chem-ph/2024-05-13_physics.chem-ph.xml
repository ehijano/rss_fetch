      <title>Combination rule for Hammett $\sigma$ constants in computational catalyst discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hammett equation is popular for navigating chemical space by quantifying the effects of substituents on chemical properties and behavior. We study the applicability of the Hammett-inspired product (HIP) Ansatz to model relative substrate binding within homogenous organometallic catalysis, assigning $\sigma$ and $\rho$ to ligands and metals, respectively. Implementing an additive combination (c) rule for obtaining $\sigma$ constants for any ligand pair combination results in a cHIP model that can be leveraged (i) as a baseline for $\Delta$-machine learning (ML), and (ii) to identify novel catalyst candidates via volcano plots. After testing the combination rule on Hammett constants previously published in the literature, we have generated numerical evidence for the Suzuki-Miyaura (SM) C-C cross-coupling reaction using two synthetic datasets of metallic catalysts (including (10) and (11)-metals Ni, Pd, Pt, and Cu, Ag, Au as well as 96 ligands such as N-heterocyclic carbenes, phosphines, or pyridines). When used as a baseline, $\Delta$-ML prediction errors of relative binding decrease systematically with training set size and reach chemical accuracy ($\sim$1 kcal/mol) for 20k training instances. Employing the individual ligand constants obtained from cHIP, we report relative substrate binding for a novel dataset consisting of 720 catalysts (not part of training data), of which 145 fall into the most promising range on the volcano plot accounting for oxidative addition, transmetalation, and reductive elimination steps. Multiple Ni-based catalysts, e.g. Aphos-Ni-P($t$-Bu)$_3$, are included among these promising candidates, potentially offering dramatic cost savings in experimental applications.</description>

      <title>Deeper-band electron contributions to stopping power of silicon for low-energy ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study provides accurate results for the electronic stopping cross-sections of H, He, N, and Ne in silicon in low to intermediate energy ranges using various non-perturbative theoretical methods, including real-time time-dependent density functional theory, transport cross-section, and induced-density approach. Recent experimental findings [Ntemou \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 107}, 155145 (2023)] revealed discrepancies between the estimates of density functional theory and observed values. We show that these discrepancies vanish by considering the nonuniform electron density of the silicon deeper bands for ion velocities approaching zero ($v \to 0$). This indicates that mechanisms such as ``elevator'' and ``promotion,'' which can dynamically excite deeper-band electrons, are active, enabling a localized free electron gas to emulate ion energy loss, as pointed out by [Lim \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 116}, 043201 (2016)]. The observation and the description of a velocity-proportionality breakdown in electronic stopping cross-sections at very low velocities are considered to be a signature of the deeper-band electrons' contributions.</description>

      <title>ControlMol: Adding Substruture Control To Molecule Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing new molecules is an important task in the field of pharmaceuticals. Due to the vast design space of molecules, generating molecules conditioned on a specific sub-structure relevant to a particular function or therapeutic target is a crucial task in computer-aided drug design. In this paper, we present ControlMol, which adds sub-structure control to molecule generation with diffusion models. Unlike previous methods which view this task as inpainting or conditional generation, we adopt the idea of ControlNet into conditional molecule generation and make adaptive adjustments to a pre-trained diffusion model. We apply our method to both 2D and 3D molecule generation tasks. Conditioned on randomly partitioned sub-structure data, our method outperforms previous methods by generating more valid and diverse molecules. The method is easy to implement and can be quickly applied to a variety of pre-trained molecule generation models.</description>

      <title>Combining complex conjugation, time-reversal, and spin symmetry projection of coupled cluster wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex conjugation symmetry breaking and restoration generate two non-orthogonal configurations at the Hartree-Fock level that can capture static correlation naturally. In conjunction with broken spin-symmetry coupled cluster theory, the symmetry-projected wave function shows good agreement with full configuration interaction in beryllium hydride insertion, lithium fluoride dissociation, and symmetric stretching of tetrahedral H$_4$. By adding spin flip projection, we can also recover time reversal symmetry in the same coupled cluster framework.</description>

      <title>Mixed quantum-classical modeling of exciton-phonon scattering in solids: Application to optical linewidths of monolayer MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a mixed quantum-classical framework for the microscopic and non-Markovian modeling of exciton-phonon scattering in solid-state materials, and apply it to calculate the optical linewidths of monolayer MoS2. Within this framework, we combine reciprocal-space mixed quantum-classical dynamics with models for the quasiparticle band structure as well as the electron-hole and carrier-phonon interactions, parametrized against ab initio calculations, although noting that a direct interfacing with ab initio calculations is straightforward in principle. We introduce various parameters for truncating the Brillouin zone to select regions of interest. Variations of these parameters allow us to determine linewidths in the limit of asymptotic material sizes. Obtained asymptotic linewidths are found to agree favorably with experimental measurements across a range of temperatures. As such, our framework establishes itself as a promising route towards unraveling the non-Markovian and microscopic principles governing the nonadiabatic dynamics of solids.</description>

      <title>Non-unique Hamiltonians for Discrete Symplectic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An outstanding property of any Hamiltonian system is the symplecticity of its flow, namely, the continuous trajectory preserves volume in phase space. Given a symplectic but discrete trajectory generated by a transition matrix applied at a fixed time-increment ($\tau &gt; 0$), it was generally believed that there exists a unique Hamiltonian producing a continuous trajectory that coincides at all discrete times ($t = n\tau$ with $n$ integers) as long as $\tau$ is small enough. However, it is now exactly demonstrated that, for any given discrete symplectic dynamics of a harmonic oscillator, there exists an infinite number of real-valued Hamiltonians for any small value of $\tau$ and an infinite number of complex-valued Hamiltonians for any large value of $\tau$. In addition, when the transition matrix is similar to a Jordan normal form with the supradiagonal element of $1$ and the two identical diagonal elements of either $1$ or $-1$, only one solution to the Hamiltonian is found for the case with the diagonal elements of $1$, but no solution can be found for the other case.</description>

      <title>Super-concentrated alkali hydroxide electrolytes for rechargeable Zn batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rechargeable Zn batteries offer safe, inexpensive energy storage, but when deeply discharged to compete with lithium-ion batteries, they are plagued by parasitic reactions at the Zn anodes. We apply super-concentrated alkaline electrolytes to suppress two key parasitic reactions, hydrogen evolution and ZnO passivation. An electrolyte with 15 M KOH displays a broad electrochemical window (&gt;2.5 V on Au), a high ZnO solubility (&gt;1.5 M), and an exceptionally high ionic conductivity (&gt;0.27 S/cm at 25 C). Spectroscopies and ab-initio molecular dynamics simulation suggest K+-OH- pairs and a tightened water network to underpin the stability. The simulation further reveals unique triggered proton hopping that offsets the lack of water wires to sustain the conductivity. Low hydrogen evolution, confirmed via online mass spectroscopy, and slow passivation enable a NiOOH||Zn battery to deliver a cumulative capacity of 8.4 Ah cm-2 and a Zn-air battery to last for over 110 hours.</description>

      <title>On Hagedorn wavepackets associated with different Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hagedorn functions are carefully constructed generalizations of Hermite functions to the setting of many-dimensional squeezed and coupled harmonic systems. Wavepackets formed by superpositions of Hagedorn functions have been successfully used to solve the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation exactly in harmonic systems and variationally in anharmonic systems. For evaluating typical observables, such as position or kinetic energy, it is sufficient to consider orthonormal Hagedorn functions with a single Gaussian center. Here, we instead derive various relations between Hagedorn bases associated with different Gaussians, including their overlaps, which are necessary for evaluating quantities nonlocal in time, such as time correlation functions needed for computing spectra. First, we use the Bogoliubov transformation to obtain commutation relations between the ladder operators associated with different Gaussians. Then, instead of using numerical quadrature, we employ these commutation relations to derive exact recurrence relations for the overlap integrals between Hagedorn functions with different Gaussian centers. Finally, we present numerical experiments that demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our algebraic method as well as its suitability to treat problems in spectroscopy and chemical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum-like states on complex synchronized networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has exposed the idea that interesting quantum-like probability laws, including interference effects, can be manifest in classical systems. Here we propose a model for quantum-like (QL) states and QL bits. We suggest a way that huge, complex systems can host robust states that can process information in a QL fashion. Axioms that such states should satisfy are proposed. Specifically, it is shown that building blocks suited for QL states are networks, possibly very complex, that we defined based on $k$-regular random graphs. These networks can dynamically encode a lot of information that is distilled into the emergent states we can use for QL like processing. Although the emergent states are classical, they have properties analogous to quantum states. Concrete examples of how QL functions are possible are given. The possibility of a `QL advantage' for computing-type operations and the potential relevance for new kinds of function in the brain are discussed and left as open questions.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved Interparticle Coulombic Decay spectra including nuclear degrees of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.06040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of chemistry, where nuclear motion has traditionally been a focal point, we now explore the ultra-rapid electronic motion spanning attoseconds to femtoseconds, demonstrating that it is equally integral and relevant to the discipline. The advent of ultrashort attosecond pulse technology has revolutionized our ability to directly observe electronic rearrangements in atoms and molecules, offering a time-resolved insight into these swift processes. Prominent examples include Auger-Meitner decay and Interparticle Coulombic Decay (ICD). However, the real challenge lies in interpreting these observations, where theoretical models are indispensable.
  Building upon the analytical framework introduced in Phys. Rev. A 101, 043414 (2020), which analyzed the spectra of electrons emitted during electronic decay processes from a purely electronic perspective, our paper represents a significant advancement. We extend this theoretical base to include nuclear dynamics, utilizing the Born-Oppenheimer approximation to deepen our understanding of the intricate interaction between electronic and nuclear motion in these processes.
  We illustrate the impact of incorporating nuclear degrees of freedom in several theoretical cases characterized by different numbers of vibrational bound states in both the electronic resonance and the electronic final state. This approach not only clarifies complex spectral features and unusual peak shapes but also demonstrates a method for extracting the energy differences between multiple vibrational resonance states through their distinctive interference patterns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficiency of atomic simulations of materials and molecules can rapidly deteriorate when large free energy barriers exist between local minima. We propose smooth basin classification, a universal method to define reaction coordinates based on the internal feature representation of a graph neural network. We achieve high data efficiency by exploiting their built-in symmetry and adopting a transfer learning strategy. We benchmark our approach on challenging chemical and physical transformations, and show that it matches and even outperforms reaction coordinates defined based on human intuition.</description>

      <title>Towards comprehensive coverage of chemical space: Quantum mechanical properties of 836k constitutional and conformational closed shell neutral isomers consisting of HCNOFSiPSClBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Vector-QM24 (VQM24) dataset attempts to more comprehensively cover all possible neutral closed shell small organic and inorganic molecules and their conformers at state of the art level of theory. We have used density functional theory ($\omega$B97X-D3/cc-pVDZ) to optimize 577k conformational isomers corresponding to 258k constitutional isomers.Isomers included contain up to five heavy atoms (non-hydrogen) consisting of $p$-block elements C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br. Single point diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC@PBE0(ccECP/cc-pVQZ)) energies are reported for the sub-set of the lowest conformers of 10,793 molecules with up to 4 heavy atoms.This dataset has been systematically generated by considering all combinatorially possible stoichiometries, and graphs (according to Lewis rules as implemented in the {\tt SURGE} package), along with all stable conformers identified by GFN2-xTB. Apart from graphs, geometries, rotational constants, and vibrational normal modes, VQM24 includes internal, atomization, electron-electron repulsion, exchange correlation, dispersion, vibrational frequency, Gibbs free, enthalpy, ZPV, molecular orbital energies; as well as entropy, and heat capacities. Electronic properties include multipole moments (dipole, quadrupole, octupole, hexadecapole), electrostatic potentials at nuclei (alchemical potential), Mulliken charges, and molecular wavefunctions. VQM24 represents a highly accurate and unbiased dataset of molecules, ideal for testing and training transferable, scalable, and generative ML models of real quantum systems.</description>
