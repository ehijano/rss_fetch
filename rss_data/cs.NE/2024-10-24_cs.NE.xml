      <title>Multiple Global Peaks Big Bang-Big Crunch Algorithm for Multimodal Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main challenge of multimodal optimization problems is identifying multiple peaks with high accuracy in multidimensional search spaces with irregular landscapes. This work proposes the Multiple Global Peaks Big Bang-Big Crunch algorithm, which addresses the challenge of multimodal optimization problems by introducing a specialized mechanism for each operator. Inspired by the evolution of the universe, Multiple Global Peaks Big Bang-Big Crunch groups the best individuals of the population into cluster-based centers of mass and then expands them with a progressively lower disturbance to guarantee convergence. During this process, it (i) applies a distance-based filtering to remove unnecessary elites such that the ones on smaller peaks are not lost, (ii) promotes isolated individuals based on their niche count after clustering, and (iii) balances exploration and exploitation during offspring generation to target specific accuracy levels. Experimental results on twenty multimodal benchmark test functions show that Multiple Gloal Peaks Big Bang-Big Crunch generally performs better or competitively with respect to other state-of-the-art multimodal optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Spatial-Temporal Search for Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are considered as a potential candidate for the next generation of artificial intelligence with appealing characteristics such as sparse computation and inherent temporal dynamics. By adopting architectures of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), SNNs achieve competitive performances on benchmark tasks like image classification. However, successful architectures of ANNs are not optimal for SNNs. In this work, we apply Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to find suitable architectures for SNNs. Previous NAS methods for SNNs focus primarily on the spatial dimension, with a notable lack of consideration for the temporal dynamics that are of critical importance for SNNs. Drawing inspiration from the heterogeneity of biological neural networks, we propose a differentiable approach to optimize SNN on both spatial and temporal dimensions. At spatial level, we have developed a spike-based differentiable hierarchical search (SpikeDHS) framework, where spike-based operation is optimized on both the cell and the layer level under computational constraints. We further propose a differentiable surrogate gradient search (DGS) method to evolve local SG functions independently during training. At temporal level, we explore an optimal configuration of diverse temporal dynamics on different types of spiking neurons by evolving their time constants, based on which we further develop hybrid networks combining SNN and ANN, balancing both accuracy and efficiency. Our methods achieve comparable classification performance of CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet with accuracies of 96.43%, 78.96%, and 70.21%, respectively. On event-based deep stereo, our methods find optimal layer variation and surpass the accuracy of specially designed ANNs with 26$\times$ lower computational cost ($6.7\mathrm{mJ}$), demonstrating the potential of SNN in processing highly sparse and dynamic signals.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Indicators for Multiobjective Diversity Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indicator-based (multiobjective) diversity optimization aims at finding a set of near (Pareto-)optimal solutions that maximizes a diversity indicator, where diversity is typically interpreted as the number of essentially different solutions. Whereas, in the first diversity-oriented evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm, the NOAH algorithm by Ulrich and Thiele, the Solow Polasky Diversity (also related to Magnitude) served as a metric, other diversity indicators might be considered, such as the parameter-free Max-Min Diversity, and the Riesz s-Energy, which features uniformly distributed solution sets. In this paper, focusing on multiobjective diversity optimization, we discuss different diversity indicators from the perspective of indicator-based evolutionary algorithms (IBEA) with multiple objectives. We examine theoretical, computational, and practical properties of these indicators, such as monotonicity in species, twinning, monotonicity in distance, strict monotonicity in distance, uniformity of maximizing point sets, computational effort for a set of size~n, single-point contributions, subset selection, and submodularity. We present new theorems -- including a proof of the NP-hardness of the Riesz s-Energy Subset Selection Problem -- and consolidate existing results from the literature. In the second part, we apply these indicators in the NOAH algorithm and analyze search dynamics through an example. We examine how optimizing with one indicator affects the performance of others and propose NOAH adaptations specific to the Max-Min indicator.</description>

      <title>NexusIndex: Integrating Advanced Vector Indexing and Multi-Model Embeddings for Robust Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of fake news on digital platforms has underscored the need for robust and scalable detection mechanisms. Traditional methods often fall short in handling large and diverse datasets due to limitations in scalability and accuracy. In this paper, we propose NexusIndex, a novel framework and model that enhances fake news detection by integrating advanced language models, an innovative FAISSNexusIndex layer, and attention mechanisms. Our approach leverages multi-model embeddings to capture rich contextual and semantic nuances, significantly improving text interpretation and classification accuracy. By transforming articles into high-dimensional embeddings and indexing them efficiently, NexusIndex facilitates rapid similarity searches across extensive collections of news articles. The FAISSNexusIndex layer further optimizes this process, enabling real-time detection and enhancing the system's scalability and performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that NexusIndex outperforms state-of-the-art methods in efficiency and accuracy across diverse datasets.</description>

      <title>The Neuromorphic Analog Electronic Nose</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid detection of gas concentration is important in different domains like gas leakage monitoring, pollution control, and so on, for the prevention of health hazards. Out of different types of gas sensors, Metal oxide (MOx) sensors are extensively used in such applications because of their portability, low cost, and high sensitivity for specific gases. However, how to effectively sample the MOx data for the real-time detection of gas and its concentration level remains an open question. Here we introduce a simple analog front-end for one MOx sensor that encodes the gas concentration in the time difference between pulses of two separate pathways. This front-end design is inspired by the spiking output of a mammalian olfactory bulb. We show that for a gas pulse injected in a constant airflow, the time difference between pulses decreases with increasing gas concentration, similar to the spike time difference between the two principal output neurons in the olfactory bulb. The circuit design is further extended to a MOx sensor array and this sensor array front-end was tested in the same environment for gas identification and concentration estimation. Encoding of gas stimulus features in analog spikes at the sensor level itself may result in data and power-efficient real-time gas sensing systems in the future that can ultimately be used in uncontrolled and turbulent environments for longer periods without data explosion.</description>
