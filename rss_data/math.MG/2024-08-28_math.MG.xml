      <title>Efficiently Approximating Spread Dimension with High Confidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concepts of spread and spread dimension of a metric space were introduced by Willerton in the context of quantifying biodiversity of ecosystems. In previous work, we developed the theoretical basis for applications of spread dimension as an intrinsic dimension estimator. In this paper we introduce the pseudo spread dimension which is an efficient approximation of spread dimension, and we derive a formula for the standard error associated with this approximation.</description>

      <title>A generalization of Gr\"unbaum's inequality in RCD$(0,N)$-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize Gr\"unbaum's classical inequality in convex geometry to curved spaces with nonnegative Ricci curvature, precisely, to $\mathrm{RCD}(0,N)$-spaces with $N \in (1,\infty)$ as well as weighted Riemannian manifolds of $\mathrm{Ric}_N \ge 0$ for $N \in (-\infty,-1) \cup \{\infty\}$. Our formulation makes use of the isometric splitting theorem; given a convex set $\Omega$ and the Busemann function associated with any straight line, the volume of the intersection of $\Omega$ and any sublevel set of the Busemann function that contains a barycenter of $\Omega$ is bounded from below in terms of $N$. We also extend this inequality beyond uniform distributions on convex sets. Moreover, we establish some rigidity results by using the localization method, and the stability problem is also studied.</description>

      <title>Sobolev spaces via chains in metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the chain Sobolev space on a possibly non-complete metric measure space in terms of chain upper gradients. In this context, $\varepsilon$-chains are a finite collection of points with distance at most $\varepsilon$ between consecutive points. They play the role of discrete versions of curves. Chain upper gradients are defined accordingly and the chain Sobolev space is defined by letting the size parameter $\varepsilon$ going to zero. In the complete setting, we prove that the chain Sobolev space is equal to the classical notions of Sobolev spaces in terms of relaxation of upper gradients or of the local Lipschitz constant of Lipschitz functions. The proof of this fact is inspired by a recent technique developed by Eriksson-Bique. In the possible non-complete setting, we prove that the chain Sobolev space is equal to the one defined via relaxation of the local Lipschitz constant of Lipschitz functions, while in general they are different from the one defined via upper gradients along curves. We apply the theory developed in the paper to prove equivalent formulations of the Poincar\'{e} inequality in terms of pointwise estimates involving $\varepsilon$-upper gradients, lower bounds on modulus of chains connecting points and size of separating sets measured with the Minkowski content in the non-complete setting. Along the way, we discuss the notion of weak $\varepsilon$-upper gradients and asymmetric notions of integral along chains.</description>

      <title>Strong almost finiteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14554v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A countable, bounded degree graph is almost finite if it has a tiling with isomorphic copies of finitely many F\o lner sets, and we call it strongly almost finite, if the tiling can be randomized so that the probability that a vertex is on the boundary of a tile is uniformly small. We give various equivalents for strong almost finiteness. In particular, we prove that Property A together with the F\o lner property is equivalent to strong almost finiteness. Using these characterizations, we show that graphs of subexponential growth and Schreier graphs of amenable groups are always strongly almost finite, generalizing the celebrated result of Downarowicz, Huczek and Zhang about amenable Cayley graphs, based on graph theoretic rather than group theoretic principles. We give various equivalents to Property A for graphs, and show that if a sequence of graphs of Property A (in a uniform sense) converges to a graph $G$ in the neighborhood distance (a purely combinatorial analogue of the classical Benjamini-Schramm distance), then their Laplacian spectra converge to the Laplacian spectrum of $G$ in the Hausdorff distance. We apply the previous theory to construct a new and rich class of classifiable $C^{\star}$-algebras. Namely, we show that for any minimal strong almost finite graph $G$ there are naturally associated simple, nuclear, stably finite $C^{\star}$-algebras that are classifiable by their Elliott invariants.</description>

      <title>Beyond chromatic threshold via the $(p,q)$-theorem, and a sharp blow-up phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17910v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a novel connection between the well-known chromatic threshold problem in extremal combinatorics and the celebrated $(p,q)$-theorem in discrete geometry. In particular, for a graph $G$ with bounded clique number and a natural density condition, we prove a $(p,q)$-theorem for an abstract convexity space associated with $G$. Our result strengthens those of Thomassen and Nikiforov on the chromatic threshold of cliques. Our $(p,q)$-theorem can also be viewed as a $\chi$-boundedness result for (what we call) ultra maximal $K_r$-free graphs.
  We further show that the graphs under study are blow-ups of constant size graphs, improving a result of Oberkampf and Schacht on homomorphism threshold of cliques. Our result unravels the cause underpinning such a blow-up phenomenon, differentiating the chromatic and homomorphism threshold problems for cliques. It implies that for the homomorphism threshold problem, rather than the minimum degree condition usually considered in the literature, the decisive factor is a clique density condition on co-neighborhoods of vertices. More precisely, we show that if an $n$-vertex $K_{r}$-free graph $G$ satisfies that the common neighborhood of every pair of non-adjacent vertices induces a subgraph with $K_{r-2}$-density at least $\varepsilon&gt;0$, then $G$ must be a blow-up of some $K_r$-free graph $F$ on at most $2^{O(\frac{r}{\varepsilon}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})}$ vertices. Furthermore, this single exponential bound is optimal. We construct examples with no $K_r$-free homomorphic image of size smaller than $2^{\Omega_r(\frac{1}{\varepsilon})}$.</description>

      <title>How many sprays cover the space?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For all $d \geq 3$ we show that the cardinality of $ \mathbb{R} $ is at most $\aleph_n $ if and only if $ \mathbb{R}^d $ can be covered with $ ( n + 1 ) ( d - 1 ) + 1 $ sprays whose centers are in general position in a hyperplane. This extends previous results by Schmerl when $ d = 2 $.</description>

      <title>The connectivity of Vietoris-Rips complexes of spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We survey what is known and unknown about Vietoris-Rips complexes and thickenings of spheres. Afterwards, we show how to control the homotopy connectivity of Vietoris-Rips complexes of spheres in terms of coverings of spheres and projective spaces. Let $S^n$ be the $n$-sphere with the geodesic metric, and of diameter $\pi$, and let $\delta &gt; 0$. Suppose that the first nontrivial homotopy group of the Vietoris-Rips complex $\mathrm{VR}(S^n;\pi-\delta)$ of the $n$-sphere at scale $\pi-\delta$ occurs in dimension $k$, i.e., suppose that the connectivity is $k-1$. Then $\mathrm{cov}_{S^n}(2k+2) \le \delta &lt; 2\cdot \mathrm{cov}_{\mathbb{R}P^n}(k)$. In other words, there exist $2k+2$ balls of radius $\delta$ that cover $S^n$, and no set of $k$ balls of radius $\frac{\delta}{2}$ cover the projective space $\mathbb{R}P^n$. As a corollary, the homotopy type of $\mathrm{VR}(S^n;r)$ changes infinitely many times as the scale $r$ increases.</description>
