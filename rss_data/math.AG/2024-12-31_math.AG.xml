      <title>Deformations of pullback foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of pullback foliations under morphisms and rational maps via Grothendieck's Drapeaux scheme. In the local setting, a foliated version of Schlessinger's Theorem on rigidity of conical singularities was achieved. We apply these techniques to provide a criterion for the stability of algebraic leaves of a foliation.</description>

      <title>Explicit bounds on common projective torsion points of elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose E_1, E_2 are elliptic curves (over the complex numbers) together with standard double coverings of the projective line identifying a point and its inverse on E_i. Bogomolov, Fu and Tschinkel have asked if the number of common images of torsion points on the elliptic curves under these double coverings is uniformly bounded in the case when the branch loci of the double coverings do not coincide, and recently this was answered affirmatively by various authors, but realistic effective bounds are unknown. In this article we obtain such bounds for common projective torsion points on elliptic curves under some mild extra assumptions on the reduction type of the input data at given primes. The method is based on Raynaud's original groundbreaking work on the Manin-Mumford conjecture. In particular, we generalise several of his results to cases of bad reduction using techniques from logarithmic algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>Vanishing of Brauer groups of moduli stacks of stable curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the cohomological Brauer groups of the moduli stacks of stable genus $g$ curves over the integers and an algebraic closure of the rational numbers vanish for any $g\geq 2$. For the $n$ marked version, we show the same vanishing result in the range $(g,n)=(1,n)$ with $1\leq n \leq 6$ and all $(g,n)$ with $g\geq 4.$ We also discuss several finiteness results on cohomological Brauer groups of proper and smooth Deligne-Mumford stacks over the integers.</description>

      <title>Six-Functor Formalisms III: The construction and extension of 6FFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is the last of the series of articles where we reprove the foundational ideas of abstract six-functor formalisms developed by Liu-Zheng. We prove the theorem of partial adjoints, which is a simplicial technique of encoding various functors altogether by taking adjoints along specific directions. Combined with the $\infty$-categorical compactification theorem from the previous article, we can construct abstract six-functor formalisms in reasonable geometric setups of our interest. We also reprove the simplified versions of the DESCENT program due to Liu-Zheng, which allows us to extend such formalisms from smaller to larger geometric setups.</description>

      <title>Computing with D-Algebraic Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sequence is difference algebraic (or D-algebraic) if finitely many shifts of its general term satisfy a polynomial relationship; that is, they are the coordinates of a generic point on an affine hypersurface. The corresponding equations are called algebraic difference equations (ADE). We show that subsequences of D-algebraic sequences, indexed by arithmetic progressions, satisfy ADEs of the same orders as the original sequences. Additionally, we provide algorithms for operations with D-algebraic sequences and discuss the difference-algebraic nature of holonomic and $C^2$-finite sequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For smooth complex proper toric varieties, algebraic cycles with rational coefficients modulo numerical equivalence are isomorphic to singular cohomology. We generalize this to suitable pairs of smooth proper varieties and simple normal crossing divisors by introducing a tropical analog of Goresky-MacPherson's intersection homology.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of flag supervarieties and resolutions of determinantal ideals. II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the coherent cohomology of the structure sheaf of complex periplectic Grassmannians. In particular, we show that it can be decomposed as a tensor product of the singular cohomology ring of a Grassmannian for either the symplectic or orthogonal group together with a semisimple representation of the periplectic Lie supergroup. The restriction of the latter to its even subgroup has an explicit multiplicity-free description in terms of Schur functors and is closely related to syzygies of (skew-)symmetric determinantal ideals. We develop tools for studying splitting rings for Coxeter groups of types BC and D, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Nilpotent orbits and their secant varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple algebraic group and $\mathcal O$ a nilpotent orbit in $\mathfrak g$. Let ${\mathbf{CS}}(\mathcal O)$ denote the affine cone over the secant variety of $\overline{\mathbb P\mathcal O}\subset \mathbb P\mathfrak g$. Using the theory of doubled actions of $G$, we describe ${\mathbf{CS}}(\mathcal O)$ for all $\mathcal O$. We compute $\dim{\mathbf{CS}}(\mathcal O)$ using the complexity and rank of the $G$-variety $\mathcal O$ and show that there is an abelian subalgebra $\mathfrak t_{\mathcal O}\subset\mathfrak g$ such that ${\mathbf{CS}}(\mathcal O)$ is the closure of $G{\cdot}\mathfrak t_\mathcal O$. Another observation is that ${\mathbf{CS}}(\mathcal O)$ coincide with the closure of the image of the moment map associated with the cotangent bundle of $\mathcal O$. We also compute the complexity and rank for all nilpotent orbits.</description>

      <title>Positivity in Weighted Flag Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the torus-equivariant cohomology of weighted flag varieties, and prove a positivity property in the equivariant cohomology and Chow groups of weighted flag varieties, analogous to the non-weighted positivity proved in [Graham 2001]. Our result strengthens and generalizes the positivity proved for weighted Grassmannians by [Abe-Matsumura 2015]. The positivity property is expressed in terms of weighted roots, which are used to describe weights of torus equivariant curves in weighted flag varieties. This provides a geometric interpretation of the parameters used in [Abe-Matsumura 2015]. We approach weighted flag varieties from a uniform Lie-theoretic point of view, providing a more general definition than has appeared previously, and prove other general results about weighted flag varieties in this setting, including a Borel presentation of the equivariant cohomology. In addition, we generalize some results obtained for weighted Grassmannians or more generally type $A$ ([Abe-Matsumura 2015], [Azam-Nazir-Qureshi 2020]); in particular, we obtain a weighted Chevalley formula, descriptions of restrictions to fixed points, the GKM description of the cohomology, and a weighted Chevalley formula.</description>

      <title>Hypersurface Arrangements with Generic Hypersurfaces Added</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Euler characteristic of a very affine variety encodes the number of critical points of the likelihood equation on this variety. In this paper, we study the Euler characteristic of the complement of a hypersurface arrangement with generic hypersurfaces added. For hyperplane arrangements, it depends on the characteristic polynomial coefficients and generic hypersurface degrees. As a corollary, we show that adding a degree-two hypersurface to a real hyperplane arrangement enables efficient sampling of a single interior point from each region in the complement. We compare the method to existing alternatives and demonstrate its efficiency. For hypersurface arrangements, the Euler characteristic is expressed in terms of Milnor numbers and generic hypersurface degrees. This formulation further yields a novel upper bound on the number of regions in the complement of a hypersurface arrangement.</description>

      <title>Classification of del Pezzo surfaces of rank one. I. Height 1 and 2. II. Descendants with elliptic boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first article in a series aimed at classifying normal del Pezzo surfaces of Picard rank one over algebraically closed fields of arbitrary characteristic up to an isomorphism. Our guiding invariant is the height of a del Pezzo surface, defined as the minimal intersection number of the exceptional divisor of the minimal resolution and a fiber of some $\mathbb{P}^1$-fibration. The geometry of del Pezzo surfaces gets more constrained as the height grows; in characteristic $0$ no example of height bigger than $4$ is known.
  In this article, we classify del Pezzo surfaces of Picard rank one and height at most $2$; in particular we describe the non-log terminal ones. We also describe a natural class of del Pezzo surfaces which have descendants with elliptic boundary, i.e. whose minimal resolution has a birational morphism onto a canonical del Pezzo surface of rank one mapping the exceptional divisor to an anti-canonical curve.</description>

      <title>Topological Gauge Theories with Sixteen Supercharges: Higher $A_\infty$-categorification of Floer Homologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is a sequel to [arXiv:2410.18575], and a third and final installment of the program initiated in [arXiv:2311.18302]. We will show how, via a 3d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of certain topologically-twisted 5d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ and 8d $\mathcal{N} = 1$ gauge theories, one can derive novel Fueter type $A_{\infty}$-2-categories that 2-categorify the 3d-Haydys-Witten, Haydys-Witten, and holomorphic Donaldson-Thomas Floer homology of two, four, and five-manifolds, respectively. Via a 2d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the aforementioned twisted gauge theories, these Fueter type $A_{\infty}$-2-categories can be shown to be equivalent to corresponding Fukaya-Seidel type $A_{\infty}$-categories. Together with previous results from [arXiv:2410.18575] and [arXiv:2311.18302], we will furnish purely physical proofs and generalizations of the mathematical conjectures by Bousseau [3] and Doan-Rezchikov [4].</description>

      <title>Wall-chamber decompositions for generalized Monge-Amp\`ere equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized Monge-Amp\`ere equations form a large class of PDE including Donaldson's J-equation, inverse Hessian equations, some supercritical deformed Hermitian-Yang Mills equations, and some Z-critical equations. Solvability of these equations is characterized by numerical criteria involving intersection numbers over all subvarieties, and in this paper, we aim to characterize algebraically what happens when these nonlinear Nakai-Moishezon type criteria fail. As a main result, we show that under mild positivity assumptions, there is a finite number of subvarieties violating the Nakai type criterion, and such subvarieties are moreover rigid in a suitable sense. This gives first effective solvability criteria for these familes of PDE, thus improving on work of Gao Chen, Datar-Pingali, Song and Fang-Ma. As an application, we obtain first examples in higher dimension of polarized compact K\"ahler manifolds exhibiting a natural PDE analog of Bridgeland's locally finite wall-chamber decomposition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study combinatorial and asymptotic properties of some interesting rational numbers called the Br\'ezin--Gross--Witten (BGW) numbers, which can be represented as the intersection numbers of psi and Theta classes on the moduli space of stable algebraic curves. In particular, we discover and prove the uniform large genus asymptotics of certain normalized BGW numbers, and give a new proof of the polynomiality phenomenon for the large genus. We also propose several new conjectures including monotonicity and integrality on the BGW numbers. Applications to the Painlev\'e II hierarchy and to the BGW-kappa numbers are given.</description>

      <title>Chow groups of ind-schemes and extensions of Saito's filtration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.1661</link>
      <description>arXiv:1311.1661v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero and let $Sm/K$ be the category of smooth and separated schemes over $K$. For an ind-scheme $\mathcal X$ (and more generally for any presheaf of sets on $Sm/K$), we define its Chow groups $\{CH^p(\mathcal X)\}_{p\in \mathbb Z}$. We also introduce Chow groups $\{\mathcal{CH}^p(\mathcal G)\}_{p\in \mathbb Z}$ for a presheaf with transfers $\mathcal G$ on $Sm/K$. Then, we show that we have natural isomorphisms of Chow groups $$ CH^p(\mathcal X)\cong \mathcal{CH}^p(Cor(\mathcal X))\qquad\forall\textrm{ }p \in \mathbb Z$$ where $Cor(\mathcal X)$ is the presheaf with transfers that associates to any $Y\in Sm/K$ the collection of finite correspondences from $Y$ to $\mathcal X$. Additionally, when $K=\mathbb C$, we show that Saito's filtration on the Chow groups of a smooth projective scheme can be extended to the Chow groups $CH^p(\mathcal X)$ and more generally, to the Chow groups of an arbitrary presheaf of sets on $Sm/\mathbb C$. Similarly, there exists an extension of Saito's filtration to the Chow groups of a presheaf with transfers on $Sm/\mathbb C$. Finally, when the ind-scheme $\mathcal X$ is ind-proper, we show that the isomorphism $CH^p(\mathcal X)\cong \mathcal{CH}^p(Cor(\mathcal X))$ is actually a filtered isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Vojta's conjecture on weighted projective varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10300v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate Vojta's conjecture for smooth weighted projective varieties, weighted multiplier ideal sheaves, and weighted log pairs and prove that all three versions of the conjecture are equivalent. In the process, we introduce generalized weighted general common divisors and express them as heights of weighted projective spaces blown-up relative to an exceptional divisor. Furthermore, we prove that assuming Vojta's conjecture for weighted projective varieties one can bound the $\log {\rm h_{wgcd}}$ for any subvariety of codimension $\geq 2$ and a finite set of places $S$. An analogue result is proved for weighted homogeneous polynomials with integer coefficients.</description>

Abstract: We study the spaces of rational curves on Fano threefolds with Gorenstein terminal singularities. We generalize the results regarding Geometric Manin's Conjecture for smooth Fano threefolds, including the classification of subvarieties with higher a-invariants and Movable Bend-and-Break lemma. We also show Geometric Manin's Conjecture for some singular del Pezzo threefolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixed Tate motives are central objects in the study of cohomology groups of algebraic varieties and their arithmetic invariants. They also play a crucial role in a wide variety of questions related to multiple zeta values and polylogarithms, algebraic K-theory, hyperbolic geometry, and particle physics among others. This survey article is an introduction to mixed Tate motives and their many facets. It was written for the proceedings of the Summer School on Motives and Arithmetic Groups held in Strasbourg in June 2022.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04976v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $L$ be the language of rings. We provide an axiomatization of the $L$-theories of quaternions and octonions and we characterize the models of mentioned theories: they coincide, up to isomorphism, to quaternion and octonion algebras over a real closed field, respectively. We bi-interpret these theories in terms of real closed fields and we prove they are complete, model complete and they do not have quantifier elimination. Then, we focus on the class of ordered polynomials. Over $\mathbb{H}$ and $\mathbb{O}$ these polynomials are of special interest in hypercomplex analysis since they are slice regular. We deduce some fundamental properties of their zero loci from model completeness and we prove the failure of quantifier elimination for the fragment of ordered formulas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19518v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective integral variety over a finitely generated field $k$ of characteristic $p&gt;0$. We show that the finiteness of the exponent of the $p$-primary part of $\mathrm{Br}(X_{k^s})^{G_k}$ is equivalent to the Tate conjecture for divisors, generalizing D'Addezio's theorem for abelian varieties to arbitrary smooth projective varieties. In combination with the Leray spectral sequence for rigid cohomology derived from the Berthelot conjecture recently proved by Ertl-Vezzani, we show that the cokernel of $\mathrm{Br}_{\mathrm{nr}}(K(X)) \rightarrow \mathrm{Br}(X_{k^s})^{G_k}$ is of finite exponent. This completes the $p$-primary part of the generalization of Artin-Grothendieck's theorem on relations between Brauer groups and Tate-Shafarevich groups to higher relative dimensions.</description>

Abstract: For a hypersurface defined by a complex analytic function, we obtain a chain complex of free abelian groups, with ranks given in terms of relative polar multiplicities, which has cohomology isomorphic to the reduced cohomology of the real link. This leads to Morse-type inequalities between the Betti numbers of the real link of the hypersurface and the relative polar multiplicities of the function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, linear complementary pairs (LCP) of codes and linear complementary dual (LCD) codes have gained significant attention due to their applications in coding theory and cryptography. In this work, we construct explicit LCPs of codes and LCD codes from function fields of genus $g \geq 1$. To accomplish this, we present pairs of suitable divisors giving rise to non-special divisors of degree $g-1$ in the function field. The results are applied in constructing LCPs of algebraic geometry codes and LCD algebraic geometry (AG) codes in Kummer extensions, hyperelliptic function fields, and elliptic curves.</description>

We also review the results about uniqueness of enhancements of triangulated categories, with the aim of showing the fruitful interplay. In particular, we show how this leads to a vast generalization of a result by Rickard about derived invariance for schemes and rings.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of a polyptych lattice, which encodes a collection of lattices related by piecewise linear bijections. We initiate a study of the new theory of convex geometry and polytopes associated to polyptych lattices. In certain situations, such a polytope associated to a polyptych lattice encodes a compactification of an affine variety whose coordinate ring can be equipped with a valuation into a certain semialgebra associated to the polyptych lattice. We show that aspects of the geometry of the compactification can be understood combinatorially; for instance, under some hypotheses, the resulting compactifications are arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay, and have finitely generated class group and finitely generated Cox rings.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a class of real algebraic varieties characterised by a simple rationality condition, which exhibit strong properties regarding approximation of continuous and smooth mappings by regular ones. They form a natural counterpart to the classes of malleable and quasi-malleable varieties. The approximation property studied here is stronger than those considered before and allows us to deduce non-trivial facts about extensions of regular mappings between varieties.</description>

Abstract: We give a framework for constructing generically optimal homotopies for parametrized polynomial systems from tropical data. Here, generically optimal means that the number of paths tracked is equal to the generic number of solutions. We focus on two types of parametrized systems -- vertically parametrized and horizontally parametrized systems -- and discuss techniques for computing the tropical data efficiently. We end the paper with several case studies, where we analyze systems arising from chemical reaction networks, coupled oscillators, and rigid graphs.</description>

Abstract: There are two natural analogues of algebraic foliations in derived algebraic geometry, called partition Lie algebroids and infinitesimal derived foliations, and both make sense in general characteristics. We construct an equivalence between these two notions under some finiteness conditions. Our method is refining the PD Koszul duality in \cite{BM}\cite{BCN} using the (completed) Hodge filtration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our study concerns the Euclidean distance function in case of complex plane curves. We decompose the ED discriminant into 3 parts which are responsible for the 3 types of behavior of the Morse points, and we find the structure of each one. In particular we shed light on the ``atypical discriminant'' which is due to the loss of Morse points at infinity. We find formulas for the number of Morse singularities which abut to the corresponding 3 types of attractors when moving the centre of the distance function toward a point of the discriminant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09798v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate Oka-1 manifolds and Oka-1 maps, a class of complex manifolds and holomorphic maps recently introduced by Alarc\'on and Forstneri\v{c}. Oka-1 manifolds are characterised by the property that holomorphic maps from any open Riemann surface to the manifold satisfy the Runge approximation and Weierstrass interpolation conditions, while Oka-1 maps enjoy similar properties for liftings of maps from open Riemann surfaces in the absence of topological obstructions. We also formulate and study the algebraic version of the Oka-1 condition, called aOka-1. We show that it is a birational invariant for compact algebraic manifolds and holds for all uniformly rational projective manifolds. This gives a Runge approximation theorem for maps from compact Riemann surfaces to uniformly rational projective manifolds. Finally, we study a class of complex manifolds with an approximation property for holomorphic sprays of discs. This class lies between the smaller class of Oka manifolds and the bigger class of Oka-1 manifolds and has interesting functorial properties.</description>

Abstract: We explore the landscape of F-theory compactifications on Calabi--Yau fourfolds whose complex structure moduli space is the thrice-punctured sphere. As a first part, we enumerate all such Calabi--Yau fourfolds under the additional requirement that it has a large complex structure and conifold point at two of the punctures. We find 14 monodromy tuples by demanding the monodromy around infinity to be quasi-unipotent. As second part, we study the four different types of phases arising at infinity. For each we consider a working example where we determine the leading periods and other physical couplings. We also included a notebook that sets up the period vectors for any of these models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Verstraete, Dehaene, and De Moor (2003) showed that SLOCC invariants provide entanglement monotones. We observe that many highly entangled or useful four-qubit states that appear in prior literature are stationary points of such entanglement measures. This motivates the search for more stationary points. We use the notion of critical points (in the sense of the Kempf-Ness theorem) together with Vinberg theory to reduce the complexity of the problem significantly. We solve the corresponding systems utilizing modern numerical nonlinear algebra methods and reduce the solutions by natural symmetries. This method produces an extended list of four-qubit stationary points, which includes all the critical states in the survey by Enriquez et al (2016).</description>

Abstract: We consider families of smooth projective curves of genus 2 with a single point removed and study their integral points. We show that in many such families there is a dense set of fibres for which the integral points can be effectively determined. Our method is based on the construction of degree-3 \'etale covers of such curves of genus 2 and the study of the torsion values of sections of certain doubly elliptic abelian schemes.</description>

      <title>Ehrhart Functions of Weighted Lattice Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies three different ways to assign weights to the lattice points of a convex polytope and discusses the algebraic and combinatorial properties of the resulting weighted Ehrhart functions and their generating functions and associated rings. These will be called $q$-weighted, $r$-weighted, and $s$-weighted Ehrhart functions, respectively. The key questions we investigate are \emph{When are the weighted Ehrhart series rational functions and which classical Ehrhart theory properties are preserved? And, when are the abstract formal power series the Hilbert series of Ehrhart rings of some polytope?} We prove generalizations about weighted Ehrhart $h^*$-coefficients of $q$-weighted Ehrhart series, and show $q$- and $s$-weighted Ehrhart reciprocity theorems. Then, we show the $q$- and $r$-weighted Ehrhart rings are the (classical) Ehrhart rings of weight lifting polytopes.</description>
