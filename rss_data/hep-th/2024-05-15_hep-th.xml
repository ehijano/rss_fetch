      <title>Unearthing the intersections: positivity bounds, weak gravity conjecture, and asymptotic safety landscapes from photon-graviton flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the asymptotic safety landscape stemming from ultraviolet-complete photon-graviton flows in a field theoretic setup, and we confront it with the weak gravity conjecture and, for the first time, with positivity bounds. At fourth order in derivatives, we find two gravitational fixed points providing viable ultraviolet completions for the theory. One of them comes with a single relevant direction, which sets the scale of quantum gravity. The corresponding sub-landscape is a single point. The second fixed point yields a richer sub-landscape of effective theories, most of which is described by an approximately straight line in the space of dimensionless Wilson coefficients. We additionally discover that: (i) the two sub-landscapes are continuously connected via a small "candy cane" regime, and the whole asymptotic safety landscape falls onto a plane; this is consistent with earlier findings and could be a universal feature in Asymptotic Safety; (ii) in such a field-theoretic setup, the Euler coupling plays a special role, as it is unconstrained by quantum scale invariance, but can enter off-shell bounds such as entropy-based positivity constraints; (iii) Planck-scale-suppressed violations of both weak gravity and positivity bounds occur across the landscape. The latter result resonates with expectations grounded on effective field theory arguments.</description>

      <title>Application of positivity bounds in asymptotically safe gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positivity bounds are bounds on the Wilson coefficients of an effective field theory. They hold, if the ultraviolet completion satisfies unitarity, microcausality, locality and Lorentz symmetry; accordingly their violation signals a violation of at least one of these properties of the ultraviolet completion. We explore whether positivity bounds on four-photon-couplings hold, when the ultraviolet completion is an asymptotically safe gravity-photon theory. By working at sixth order in an expansion in the electromagnetic field strength, we discover indications that positivity bounds hold for effective field theories that are UV completed by the asymptotically safe Reuter fixed point. We also perform various tests of the robustness of our result. This amounts to a nontrivial and critical indication of the physical viability of asymptotically safe gravity.</description>

      <title>The DNA of Calabi-Yau Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement Genetic Algorithms for triangulations of four-dimensional reflexive polytopes which induce Calabi-Yau threefold hypersurfaces via Batryev's construction. We demonstrate that such algorithms efficiently optimize physical observables such as axion decay constants or axion-photon couplings in string theory compactifications. For our implementation, we choose a parameterization of triangulations that yields homotopy inequivalent Calabi-Yau threefolds by extending fine, regular triangulations of two-faces, thereby eliminating exponentially large redundancy factors in the map from polytope triangulations to Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces. In particular, we discuss how this encoding renders the entire Kreuzer-Skarke list amenable to a variety of optimization strategies, including but not limited to Genetic Algorithms. To achieve optimal performance, we tune the hyperparameters of our Genetic Algorithm using Bayesian optimization. We find that our implementation vastly outperforms other sampling and optimization strategies like Markov Chain Monte Carlo or Simulated Annealing. Finally, we showcase that our Genetic Algorithm efficiently performs optimization even for the maximal polytope with Hodge numbers $h^{1,1} = 491$, where we use it to maximize axion-photon couplings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linearised gravity has magnetic charges carried by (linearised) Kaluza-Klein monopoles. A gauge-invariant expression is found for these charges that is similar to Penrose's gauge-invariant expression for the ADM charges. A systematic search is made for other gauge-invariant charges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review recent discussions concerning the definition of a quantum field theory in a curved and noncommutative space, the Snyder--de Sitter space. For a quartic self-interacting scalar field in a spacetime of arbitrary dimension, we show how to perturbatively define the classical action in the small-deformation regime and give its explicit first-order expression. Afterwards, we compute the divergences of the one-loop effective action for the two- and four-dimensional cases. These are employed to calculate the beta functions of the couplings and to numerically analyze the corresponding renormalization group flow. Depending on the initial conditions of the couplings, in four dimensions it is possible to obtain an asymptotic-free theory or a flip in the sign of the cosmological constant as a consequence of the running.</description>

      <title>The secret structure of the gravitational vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that the vacuum of quantum gravity must contain a hierarchical structure of correlations spanning all length scales. These correlated domains (called `vecros') correspond to virtual fluctuations of black hole microstates. Larger fluctuations are suppressed by their larger action, but this suppression is offset by a correspondingly larger phase space of possible configurations. We give an explicit lattice model of these vecro fluctuations, noting how their distribution changes as the gravitational pull of a star becomes stronger. At the threshold of formation of a closed trapped surface, these virtual fluctuations transition into on-shell black hole microstates (fuzzballs). Fuzzballs radiate from their surface like normal bodies, resolving the information paradox. We also argue that any model without vecro-type extended vacuum correlations cannot resolve the paradox.</description>

      <title>Discrete Gauge Anomalies and Instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit anomalous phases related to large gauge transformations, such as the Witten anomaly. The latter, known to plague $d=4$ $Sp(k)$ theories, is well-understood in terms of $\pi_4(Sp(k))=\mathbb{Z}_2$, but it also has an oblique relation to the instantons, labeled by $\pi_3(G)=\mathbb{Z}$, via the fermion zero mode counting. We revisit this relation and point out how $SU(N)$ theories escape an anomalous sign of the latter type, only thanks to the perturbative anomaly cancelation condition that restricts the chiral fermion spectrum. This leads to the question of what happens if the latter, more mundane anomaly is canceled by an inflow instead. After raising an open question about fractional D3 probe theories, we explore the simplest bottom-up model of such a kind, due to Witten and Yonekura, from which we find the relevant chiral theories to be free of such a disease despite the unrestricted chiral spectra. We close with a simple but often-overlooked observation about how fermionic zero modes enter physics differently between Euclidean and Lorentzian descriptions and point out a related issue in $d=3$.</description>

      <title>On the analyticity of the lightest particle mass of Ising field theory in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the scaling functions associated with the lightest particle mass $M_1$ in 2d Ising field theory in external magnetic field. The scaling functions depend on the scaling parameter $\xi = h/|m|^{\frac{15}{8}}$, or related parameter $\eta = m / h^{\frac{8}{15}}$. Analytic properties of $M_1$ in the high-T domain were discussed in arXiv:2203.11262. In this work, we study analyticity of $M_1$ in the low-T domain. Important feature of this analytic structure is represented by the Fisher-Langer's branch cut. The discontinuity across this branch cut determines the behavior of $M_1$ at all complex $\xi$ via associated low-T dispersion relation. Also, we put forward the "extended analyticity" conjecture for $M_1$ in the complex $\eta$-plane, similar to the analyticity of the free energy density previously proposed in arXiv:hep-th/0112167. The extended analyticity implies the "extended dispersion relation", which we verify against the numerics from the Truncated Free Fermion Approach (TFFSA), giving strong support to the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Capacity of entanglement for scalar fields in squeezed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study various aspects of capacity of entanglement in the squeezed states of a scalar field theory. This quantity is a quantum informational counterpart of heat capacity and characterizes the width of the eigenvalue spectrum of the reduced density matrix. In particular, we carefully examine the dependence of capacity of entanglement and its universal terms on the squeezing parameter in the specific regimes of the parameter space. Remarkably, we find that the capacity of entanglement obeys a volume law in the large squeezing limit. We discuss how these results are consistent with the behavior of other entanglement measures including entanglement and Renyi entropies. We also comment on the existence of consistent holographic duals for a family of Gaussian states with generic squeezing parameter based on the ratio of entanglement entropy and the capacity of entanglement.</description>

      <title>On the effect of derivative interactions in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There exist several good reasons why one may wish to add a total derivative to an interaction in quantum field theory, e.g., in order to improve the perturbative construction. Unlike in classical field theory, adding derivatives in general changes the theory. The analysis whether and how this can be prevented, is presently limited to perturbative orders $g^n$ , $n \leq 3$. We drastically simplify it by an all-orders formula, which also allows to answer some salient structural questions. The method is part of a larger program to (re)derive interactions of particles by quantum consistency conditions, rather than a classical principle of gauge invariance.</description>

      <title>Noether's theorem and Ward-Takahashi identities from homotopy algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the new identity in homotopy algebras which directly corresponds to the Schwinger-Dyson equations in quantum field theory. As an application, we derive the Ward-Takahashi identities. We demonstrate that the Ward-Takahashi identities are reproduced in several examples. In general, our formula contains divergence. We mediate this problem by introducing stubs known in the context of string field theory. With the regularization, we can calculate the anomaly such as axial U(1) anomaly in vector-like U(1) gauge theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine explicit expressions for the continuous two-sided gravitational wavefunctions in supersymmetric versions of JT gravity, focusing mainly on $\mathcal{N}=2$ JT supergravity. Our approach is based on representation theory of the associated supergroup, for which we determine the relevant mixed parabolic matrix elements that implement asymptotic AdS boundary conditions at the quantum level. We match our expressions with those found by solving the energy-eigenvalue equation of arXiv:2207.00408. We discuss gravitational applications by computing several amplitudes of interest, and address how our framework can be generalized further.</description>

      <title>Vacuum energy in the effective field theory of general relativity with a scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A consistency condition of general relativity as an effective field theory in Minkowskian background uniquely fixes the value of the cosmological constant. In two-loop calculations, including the interaction of gravitons with matter fields, it has been shown that this value of the cosmological constant leads to vanishing vacuum energy, under the assumption that the energy-momentum tensor of the gravitational field is given by the pseudotensor of Landau-Lifshitz's classic textbook. Here, we demonstrate that this result also holds when the self-interaction of a scalar field is taken into account. That is, our two-loop-order calculation suggests that in an effective field theory of metric and scalar fields, one arrives at a consistent theory with massless gravitons if the cosmological constant is fixed from the condition of vanishing vacuum energy. Vice versa, imposing the consistency condition in Minkowskian background leads to a vanishing vacuum energy.</description>

      <title>Exponential Quintessence: curved, steep and stringy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that our universe's current accelerated expansion is explained by a quintessence model with an exponential scalar potential, $V =V_0\, e^{-\lambda\, \phi}$, keeping an eye towards $\lambda \geq \sqrt{2}$ and an open universe, favorable to a string theory realisation and with no cosmological horizon. We work out the full cosmology of the model, including matter, radiation, and optionally negative spatial curvature, for all $\lambda&gt;0$, performing an extensive analysis of the dynamical system and its phase space. The minimal physical requirements of a past epoch of radiation domination and an accelerated expansion today lead to an upper bound $\lambda \lesssim \sqrt{3}$, which is driven slightly up in the presence of observationally allowed spatial curvature. Cosmological solutions start universally in a kination epoch, go through radiation and matter dominated phases and enter an epoch of acceleration, which is only transient for $\lambda&gt;\sqrt{2}$. Field distances traversed between BBN and today are sub-Planckian. We discuss possible string theory origins and phenomenological challenges, such as time variation of fundamental constants. We provide theoretical predictions for the model parameters to be fitted to data, most notably the varying dark energy equation of state parameter, in light of recent results from DES-Y5 and DESI.</description>

      <title>On the Virasoro fusion and modular kernels at any irrational central charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a series representation for the Virasoro fusion and modular kernels at any irrational central charge. Two distinct, yet closely related formulas are needed for the cases $c\in \mathbb C \backslash (-\infty,1]$ and $c &lt;1$. We also conjecture that the formulas have a well-defined limit as the central charge approaches rational values. Our proposal for $c &lt;1$ agrees numerically with the fusion transformation of the four-point spherical conformal blocks, whereas our proposal for $c\in \mathbb C \backslash (-\infty,1]$ agrees numerically with Ponsot and Teschner's integral formula for the fusion kernel. The case of the modular kernel is studied as a special case of the fusion kernel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a semi-classical approximation to the dynamics of a point particle in a noncommutative space. In this approximation, the noncommutativity of space coordinates is described by a Poisson bracket. For linear Poisson brackets, the corresponding phase space is given by the cotangent bundle of a Lie group, with the Lie group playing the role of a curved momentum space. We show that the curvature of the momentum space may lead to rather unexpected physical phenomena such as an upper bound on the velocity of a free nonrelativistic particle, bounded motion for repulsive central force, and no-fall-into-the-centre for attractive Coulomb potential. We also present a superintegrable Hamiltonian for the Kepler problem in $3$-space with ${su}(2)$ noncommutativity.</description>

      <title>Quantum operations for Kramers-Wannier duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Kramers-Wannier duality for the transverse-field Ising lattice on a ring. A careful consideration of the ring boundary conditions shows that the duality has to be implemented with a proper treatment of different charge sectors of both the twisted and untwisted Ising and the dual-Ising Hilbert spaces. We construct a superoperator that explicitly maps the Ising operators to the dual-Ising operators. The superoperator naturally acts on the tensor product of the Ising and the dual-Ising Hilbert space. We then show that the relation between our superoperator and the Kramers-Wannier duality operator that maps the Ising Hilbert space to the dual-Ising Hilbert space is naturally provided by quantum operations and the duality can be understood as a quantum operation that we construct. We provide the operator-sum representation for the Kramers-Wannier quantum operations and reproduce the well-known fusion rules. In addition to providing the quantum information perspective on the Kramers-Wannier duality, our explicit protocol will also be useful in implementing the Kramers-Wannier duality on a quantum computer.</description>

Abstract: Successful applications of a conceptually novel setup of Quantum Field Theory, that accounts for all subtheories of the Standard Model (QED, Electroweak Interaction and Higgs, Yang-Mills and QCD) and beyond (Helicity 2), call for a perspective view in a broader conceptual context. The setting is "autonomous" in the sense of being intrinsically quantum. Its principles are: Hilbert space, Poincar\'e symmetry and causality. Its free quantum fields are obtained from Wigner's unitary representations of the Poincar\'e group, with only physical and observable degrees of freedom. A "quantization" of an "underlying" classical theory is not needed. It allows renormalizable perturbation theory with interactions whose detailed structure, and in some cases even the particle content, is predicted by internal consistency. The results confirm and extend observable predictions for the interactions of the SM without assuming a "principle" of gauge invariance.</description>

Abstract: It is shown how string-localized QFT predicts interactions of the Standard Model. Detailed computations are presented for various non-abelian models: Yang-Mills, QCD, Higgs-Kibble. They serve as backup for [11,12] and as "proof of concept" for the treatment of the full Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Some 1d (Supersymmetric) Quantum Field Theories Reduced from Chern-Simons Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study dimensional reduction by spherical symmetry in the context of Euclidean Chern-Simons gauge theories with gauge groups $SU(2)$ and $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ (de Sitter gravity). We start with pure Chern-Simons theories and show that the reduced theory obtained by employing a spherically symmetric ansatz on the gauge field is similar to a fermionic theory in 1d coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field with a 1-dimensional Chern-Simons kinetic term. Furthermore, we carry out a semiclassical computation that demonstrates that in the large $\kappa$ limit, the path integral of the 3d pure Chern-Simons theory is equivalent to the path integral of the dimensionally reduced theory, which is a 1d QFT. Moreover, we argue that the Wilson loop operators in the large $\kappa$ limit should reduce to some observables of the 1-dimensional theory. This agreement hints at the existence of a duality at the quantum level between the 3d Chern-Simons theory and the 1d reduced theory. We then study Chern-Simons Higgs theories in the Euclidean formalism. We again employ the spherically symmetric ansatz\"e on the fields, and show that at the clasical level, the action of the reduced theory is a theory with some scalar fields $\mathsf{X}_i$ coupled to fermionic fields $\Psi_i$. To get an appropriate reduced action, we define the original theory on a manifold $\mathcal{M}$ with the geometry of $\mathbb{R} \times S^2$. With a suitable choice of the potential of the Higgs field, we show that the reduced theory, which is the action that governs the spherically symmetric monopoles in the Chern-Simons Higgs theory, is equivalent to a supersymmetric quantum mechanical model. The flux of the Chern-Simons Higgs monopole is shown to be related to the fermionic number operator $F = \overline{\Psi} \Psi$, which in turn is related to the Witten index.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that a complex coordinate transformation maps the Taub-NUT instanton metric to a Kerr-Schild metric. This metric involves a semi-infinite line defect as a gravitational analog of the Dirac string, much like the original metric. Also, it corresponds to self-dual dyon in electromagnetism through three versions of classical double copy, one of them being a novel nonlocal operator form. The relevance to Newman-Janis algorithm is briefly noted.</description>

      <title>Five-dimensional spinor helicity for all masses and spins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a spinor helicity formalism for five-dimensional scattering amplitudes of any mass and spin configuration. While five-dimensional spinor helicity variables have been previously studied in the context of N=2,4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills scattering amplitudes with spin less than two arXiv:2202.08257, we propose an alternative viewpoint that stems from d-dimensional spinor helicity variables avoiding the use of the exceptional low-dimensional isomorphism $SO(4,1) \cong USp(2,2)$ and the decomposition of a massive momentum into the sum of two massless momenta. By enumerating all possible independent little group tensors, we systematically build the full space of five-dimensional three-point tree-level scattering amplitudes for any configuration of spins and masses. Furthermore, we provide a prescription for computing the high energy limit of scattering amplitudes written in our spinor helicity variables. We also expect that our formalism will be applicable to effective field theories with higher spin, in particular, the scattering of highly spinning black holes in five dimensions.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Dark Matter Less-complex Wormhole Structures in Extended Theories of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fuzzy dark matter wormhole solutions coupled with anisotropic matter distribution are explored in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet and $f(R)$ gravity, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar. We derive the shape function for fuzzy wormholes and explore their possible stability. We study the embedding diagrams of the active gravitational mass associated with fuzzy dark matter wormholes by taking a certain shape function. Aiming to highlight the role of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet and $f(R)$ gravity in the modeling of less complex fuzzy wormhole structures, we evaluate the complexity factor, the conservation equation, and null energy conditions. Our study reinforces more importance of uniformly distributed pressure effects throughout the less complex region than to the emergence of energy density homogeneity in the stability of fuzzy wormholes. It is shown that the active gravitational mass of the fuzzy wormhole structures varies inversely with the radial distance thereby suggesting the breaching of energy conditions at some arena of Einasto index. Furthermore, it is revealed that stable fuzzy dark matter wormhole structures exist in nature in the surroundings of cold dark matter halos and galactic bulges. The important physics understood from our analysis is that in both four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet and $f(R)$ gravity, feasible geometries of fuzzy dark matter wormholes exist naturally in the environments of different galactic haloes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce HepLean, an open-source project to digitalise definitions, theorems, proofs, and calculations in high energy physics using the interactive theorem prover Lean 4. HepLean has the potential to benefit the high energy physics community in four ways: making it easier to find existing results, allowing the creation of new results using artificial intelligence and automated methods, allowing easy review of papers for mathematical correctness, and providing new ways to teach high energy physics. We will discuss these in detail. We will also demonstrate the digitalisation of three areas of high energy physics in HepLean: Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrices in flavour physics, local anomaly cancellation, and Higgs physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational memory effects and the BMS freedoms exhibited at future null infinity have recently been resolved and utilized in numerical relativity simulations. With this, gravitational wave models and our understanding of the fundamental nature of general relativity have been vastly improved. In this paper, we review the history and intuition behind memory effects and BMS symmetries, how they manifest in gravitational waves, and how controlling the infinite number of BMS freedoms of numerical relativity simulations can crucially improve the waveform models that are used by gravitational wave detectors. We reiterate the fact that, with memory effects and BMS symmetries, not only can these next-generation numerical waveforms be used to observe never-before-seen physics, but they can also be used to test GR and learn new astrophysical information about our universe.</description>

      <title>A power spectrum approach to search for Axion-like Particles from resolved galaxy clusters using CMB as a backlight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions or ALPs are hypothetical particles predicted by BSM theories, which make one of the dark matter candidates. These particles can convert into photons and vice-versa in the presence of magnetic field, with a probability decided by its coupling strength $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma}}$. One of the ways to detect these particles is using the CMB as a backlight. As the CMB photons pass through a galaxy cluster, they can get converted into ALPs in the mass range $10^{-15}$ eV to $10^{-11}$ eV through resonant conversion in the presence of cluster magnetic fields. This leads to a polarized spectral distortion ($\alpha$-distortion) in the CMB as the photon polarization parallel to the magnetic field in the galaxy cluster is involved in the conversion. The fluctuations in the magnetic field and electron density in a galaxy cluster lead to spatially varying $\alpha$-distortion around the cluster, with a power spectrum that is different from the lensed CMB polarization power spectrum for the standard model of cosmology. By measuring the difference in the polarization power spectrum around a galaxy cluster from the all-sky signal, one can find new $\alpha$-distortion in the sky. For galaxy clusters resolvable in multiple EM bands, one can measure the coupling strength $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma}}$ from the ALP power spectrum. Using multi-frequency techniques like ILC to clean the foregrounds, we show that the new power spectrum-based approach of the resolved galaxy clusters from upcoming CMB experiments such as Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 can detect (or put constraints) on the ALP-photon coupling strength of $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma} &lt; 5.24 \times 10^{-12} \, GeV^{-1}}$ and $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma} &lt; 3.61 \times 10^{-12} \, GeV^{-1}}$ at 95\% C.I. respectively for ALPs of masses $10^{-13}$ eV or for smaller $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma}}$ for lighter ALP masses (Abridged).</description>

      <title>A Diffused Background from Axion-like Particles in the Microwave Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter is an unsolved cosmological problem and axions are one of the weakly interacting cold dark matter candidates. Axions or ALPs (Axion-like particles) are pseudo-scalar bosons predicted by beyond-standard model theories. The weak coupling of ALPs with photons leads to the conversion of CMB photons to ALPs in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. If they have the same mass as the effective mass of a photon in a plasma, the resonant conversion would cause a polarized spectral distortion leading to temperature fluctuations with the distortion spectrum. The probability of resonant conversion depends on the properties of the cluster such as the magnetic field, electron density, and its redshift. We show that this kind of conversion can happen in numerous unresolved galaxy clusters up to high redshifts, which will lead to a diffused polarised anisotropy signal in the microwave sky. The spectrum of the signal and its shape in the angular scale will be different from the lensed CMB polarization signal. This new polarised distortion spectrum will be correlated with the distribution of clusters in the universe and hence, with the large-scale structure. The spectrum can then be probed using its spectral and spatial variation with respect to the CMB and various foregrounds. An SNR of $\sim$ 4.36 and $\sim$ 93.87 are possible in the CMB-S4 145 GHz band and CMB-HD 150 GHz band respectively for a photon-ALPs coupling strength of $\mathrm{g_{a \gamma} = 10^{-12} \, GeV^{-1}}$ using galaxy clusters beyond redshift z $= 1$. The same signal would lead to additional RMS fluctuations of $\sim \mathrm{7.5 \times 10^{-2} \, \mu K}$ at 145 GHz. In the absence of any signal, future CMB experiments such as Simons Observatory (SO), CMB-S4, and CMB-HD can put constraints on coupling strength better than current bounds from particle physics experiment CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST).</description>

      <title>Time Evolution in Canonical Quantum Gravity is Trivial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wheeler-DeWitt equation does not describe any explicit time evolution of the wave function, and somehow related to this issue, there is no natural way of defining an invariant inner product that provides a viable probability interpretation. We show that both of these difficulties are solved in a covariant canonical formulation of general relativity where the configuration space is extended by introducing the embedding coordinates as dynamical variables. The formalism describes the evolution of the wave function from one spacelike slice to another, but as in the case of spatial diffeomorphisms this is simply implemented by a coordinate change in the wave function. We demonstrate how the time equation disappears after gauge fixing that removes the embedding coordinates. These findings indicate that the time evolution is trivial in a background independent formulation of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Modular Invariant Hilltop Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that it is possible to achieve successful hilltop inflation in which the inflaton is identified as the modulus field in a modular invariant theory. The dilaton plays a crucial role in shaping the potential. Modular invariant gaugino condensation provides the mechanism for the modulus stabilisation after inflation. The inflationary trajectory lies on the lower boundary of the fundamental domain of the modulus field $\tau$. Inflation starts near the fixed point $\tau ={\rm i}$, and ends at a point near $\tau = \omega$, which is the global de Sitter vacuum. We investigate the allowed parameter space for successful modular invariant hilltop inflation.</description>

      <title>Construction of special Lagrangian submanifolds of the Taub-NUT manifold and the Atiyah-Hitchin manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct special Lagrangian submanifolds of the Taub-NUT manifold and the Atiyah-Hitchin manifold by combining the generalized Legendre transform approach and the moment map technique. The generalized Legendre transform approach provides a formulation to construct hyperk\"ahler manifolds and can make their Calabi-Yau structures manifest. In this approach, the K\"ahler $2$-forms and the holomorphic volume forms can be written in terms of holomorphic coordinates, which are convenient to employ the moment map technique. This technique derives the condition that a submanifold in the Calabi-Yau manifold is special Lagrangian. For the Taub-NUT manifold and the Atiyah-Hitchin manifold, by the moment map technique, special Lagrangian submanifolds are obtained as a one-parameter family of the orbits corresponding to Hamiltonian action with respect to their K\"ahler 2-forms. The resultant special Lagrangian submanifolds have cohomogeneity-one symmetry. To demonstrate that our method is useful, we recover the conditions for the special Lagrangian submanifold of the Taub-NUT manifold which is invariant under the tri-holomorphic $U(1)$ symmetry. As new applications of our method, we construct special Lagrangian submanifolds of the Taub-NUT manifold and the Atiyah-Hitchin manifold which are invariant under the action of a Lie subgroup of $SO(3)$. In these constructions, our conditions for being special Lagrangian are expressed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with respect to the one-parameters. We numerically give solution curves for the ODEs which specify the special Lagrangian submanifolds for the above cases.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and kinetics of state switching for the asymptotically flat black hole in a cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that the thermodynamics and the kinetics of state switching for the asymptotically flat black hole enclosed by a cavity can be studied in terms of the free energy landscape formalism. The generalized free energy for the black hole enclosed by a cavity in the canonical ensemble is derived by using the York's approach, where the temperature on the cavity and the charges inside the cavity are kept as the fixed parameters. By quantifying the corresponding free energy landscape, we obtain the phase diagrams for the black hole in cavity, which reveal a Hawking-Page type transition for the uncharged black hole and a Van der Waals type transition for the charged black hole. We further assume that the dynamics of black hole state switching is mutually determined by the gradient force and the stochastic force arising from the free energy landscape and the thermal noises respectively. We then derive a recurrence relation for the $n$-momentum of the first passage time distribution function, which enables the calculation of the kinetic times characterized by the mean first passage time and its relative fluctuation. Our analysis illustrates that the kinetics of black hole state switching is determined by the ensemble temperature and the barrier height on the free energy landscape.</description>

Abstract: We propose a general form of the UV-completed Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin (FLS) model. As can be seen from the mechanical interpretation, UV-completion allows thin-wall approximation for non-topological solitons. The 1-loop renormalized effective potential for the UV-completed FLS model is constructed under the assumption of mass hierarchy. By special choice of parameters, we studied how the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism induces a new mass scale $\omega_{-}$ in the classical FLS model. It can be expounded in terms of a stable condensate. As a consequence, the asymptotic of a non-topological soliton's energy at large charge is changed from $\sim Q^{3/4}$ to the linear law.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Collapse in Higher-Dimensional Rastall Gravity with and without Cosmological Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a spherically symmetric homogeneous perfect fluid undergoing a gravitational collapse to singularity in the framework of higher-dimensional Rastall gravity in the cases of vanishing and nonvanishing cosmological constants. The possible final states of the collapse in any finite dimension are black hole and naked singularity, hence violating the cosmic censorship conjecture, but the naked singularity formation becomes less favored when the dimension is increased, such that the conjecture is fully restored in the limit of very high dimensions. We find that there are two physically distinct solutions for the collapse evolution in the case of nonzero cosmological constant: trigonometric and exponential solutions. The effective energy density of the fluid is decreasing (increasing) in the former (latter) when the magnitude of the cosmological constant is increased, which implies that the former undergoes a slower collapse than the latter. Furthermore, we find that a temporary trapped surface is possible to emerge in the case of trigonometric solution in the naked singularity region only. Therefore, faraway observers with observational time shorter than the collapse duration may conclude that a black hole is formed, although the collapse will eventually lead to a naked singularity formation.</description>

Abstract: Cluster states are crucial resources for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). It exhibits symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, thus also playing a crucial role in studying topological phases. We present the construction of cluster states based on Hopf algebras. By generalizing the finite group valued qudit to a Hopf algebra valued qudit and introducing the generalized Pauli-X operator based on the regular action of the Hopf algebra, as well as the generalized Pauli-Z operator based on the irreducible representation action on the Hopf algebra, we develop a comprehensive theory of Hopf qudits. We demonstrate that non-invertible symmetry naturally emerges for Hopf qudits. Subsequently, for a bipartite graph termed the cluster graph, we assign the identity state and trivial representation state to even and odd vertices, respectively. Introducing the edge entangler as controlled regular action, we provide a general construction of Hopf cluster states. To ensure the commutativity of the edge entangler, we propose a method to construct a cluster lattice for any triangulable manifold. We use the 1d cluster state as an example to illustrate our construction. As this serves as a promising candidate for SPT phases, we construct the gapped Hamiltonian for this scenario and delve into a detailed discussion of its non-invertible symmetries. We also show that the 1d cluster state model is equivalent to the quasi-1d Hopf quantum double model. We also introduce the Hopf tensor network representation of Hopf cluster states by integrating the tensor representation of structure constants with the string diagrams of the Hopf algebra.</description>

      <title>Strain effects on the electronic properties of a graphene wormhole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the strain and curvature effects on the electronic properties of a curved graphene structure, called the graphene wormhole. The electron dynamics is described by a massless Dirac fermion containing position--dependent Fermi velocity. In addition, the strain produces a pseudo--magnetic vector potential to the geometric coupling. For an isotropic strain tensor, the decoupled components of the spinor field exhibit a supersymmetric (SUSY) potential, depending on the centrifugal term and the external magnetic field only. In the absence of a external magnetic field, the strain yields to an exponential damped amplitude, whereas the curvature leads to a power--law damping of the wave function. The spin--curvature coupling breaks the chiral symmetry between the upper and the lower spinor component, which leads to the increasing of the wave function on either upper or lower region of the wormhole, i.e., depending on the spin number. By adding an uniform magnetic field, the effective potential exhibits an asymptotic quadratic profile and a spin--curvature barrier near the throat. As a result, the bound states (Landau levels) are confined around the wormhole throat showing an asymmetric and spin--dependent profile.</description>

      <title>Spin-spin Interactions in General Relativity versus Linearized Massive Gravity: $N$-body Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulated spin-spin interactions of $N$-bodies in linearized General Relativity (GR) and linearized Massive Gravity of the Fierz-Pauli type (mGR). It was noted earlier that there is a discrete difference between the spin-spin interaction potential in GR and mGR for a $2$-body system, akin to the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity in the static Newton's potential. Specifically, at large distances, GR favors anti-parallel spin orientation with total spin pointing along the interaction axis, while mGR favors parallel spin orientation with total spin perpendicular to the axis between the sources. For an $N$-body system, a simulation in mGR hitherto has not been done and one would like to know the total spin of the system in both theories. Here we remedy this. In the simulations of GR, we observed that the total spin tends to decrease from a random initial configuration, while for mGR with a large distance, the total spin increases.</description>

Abstract: New one parameter family of exact solutions in General Relativity with a scalar field is found. The metric is of Liouville type which admits complete separation of variables in the geodesic Hamilton--Jacobi equation. This solution exists for the exponential potential for a scalar field and is invariant with respect to global Lorentz transformations. It describes, in particular, a black hole formation as well as a naked singularity. Solutions corresponding to the naked singularity describe accelerating expansion of the homogeneous and isotropic Universe, and can be smoothly continued along geodesics to infinite past without Big Bang.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electric potential and the electromagnetic field for a linearly accelerated Born-Infeld charged particle are obtained in an inertial frame by a method that can, in principle, be applied to any electromagnetic theory. The method is based on (i) the fact that the metric near the horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole is equivalent to that of Rindler spacetime, and (ii) a theorem that guarantees that the electrostatic potential for a given nonlinear theory in a static, spherically symmetric spacetime is entirely specified by the Maxwellian electrostatic potential in the same background. Using analytical and numerical methods, the features of the radiation field and the radiation-reaction for such an accelerated particle are discussed in detail.</description>

Abstract: The quantum dynamics of charged scalar bosons in a Bonnor-Melvin-$\Lambda$ universe is considered. In this study, the behavior of charged scalar bosons is explored within the framework of the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau (DKP) formalism. Adopting a conical approximation ($\Lambda\ll 1$), we are considered two scenarios for the vector potential: a linear and quadratic vector potentials. In particular, the effects of this background in the equation of motion, phase shift, $S$-matrix, energy spectrum and DKP spinor are analyzed and discussed.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic properties of a relativistic Bose gas under rigid rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic properties of a rigidly rotating relativistic Bose gas. First, we derive the solution of the equation of motion corresponding to a free rotating complex Klein-Gordon field and determine the free propagator of this model utilizing the Fock-Schwinger proper-time method. Using this propagator, we then obtain the thermodynamic potential of this model in the zeroth and first perturbative level. In addition, we compute the nonperturbative ring contribution to this potential. Our focus is on the dependence of these expressions on the angular velocity, which effectively acts as a chemical potential. Using this thermodynamic potential, we calculate several quantities, including the pressure, angular momentum and entropy densities, heat capacity, speed of sound, and moment of inertia of this rigidly rotating Bose gas as functions of temperature ($T$), angular velocity ($\Omega$), and the coupling constant ($\alpha$). We show that certain thermodynamic instabilities appear at high temperatures and large couplings. They are manifested as zero and negative values of the above quantities, particularly the moment of inertia and heat capacity. Zero moment of inertia leads to the phenomenon of supervorticity at certain $T$ or $\alpha$. Supervortical temperatures (couplings) decrease with increasing coupling (temperature). We also observe superluminal sound velocities at high $T$ and for large $\alpha$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the chiral magnetic effect (CME): the generation of an electric current due to a homogeneous background magnetic field and a homogeneous chiral imbalance in QCD. We demonstrate that the leading coefficient describing the CME vanishes in equilibrium, both for free fermions as well as in full QCD. Our full QCD results are based on continuum extrapolated lattice simulations using dynamical staggered quarks with physical masses as well as quenched Wilson quarks. We show that it is crucial that a gauge invariant ultraviolet regularization is used to compute the CME and elaborate on why some of the existing in-equilibrium calculations of this effect gave a nonzero result. We stress that our findings imply the absence of a time-independent CME current flowing in equilibrium QCD, but do not concern the CME as an out-of-equilibrium, time-dependent effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We start from the assumption that the theory of gravity can be formulated in terms of 4-dimensional action, and there are only 2 graviton polarization states, as in general relativity. It can be a non-perturbative effective action discussed in the asymptotic safety program or the result of some other UV modification of the general relativity making it a complete theory. From these general grounds, we study the properties of the graviton two-point function on top of cosmological de-Sitter space. We find that the no-ghost requirement formulated for the flat background does not necessarily hold for the de-Sitter space where the graviton two-point function can have an infinite number of complex-conjugate poles. We show that under certain stability conditions, their appearance doesn't contradict any fundamental principle. We discuss their observational consequences for the tensor power spectrum from inflation and for the stochastic gravitational wave background.</description>

Abstract: In the two-dimensional Liouville conformal field theory, correlation functions involving a degenerate field satisfy partial differential equations due to the decoupling of the null descendant field. On the other hand, the instanton partition function of a four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric theory in the $\Omega$-background at a special point of the parameter space also satisfies a partial differential equation resulting from the constraints of the gauge field configurations. This partial differential equation can be proved using the non-perturbative Dyson-Schwinger equations. We show for the next-to-simplest case that the partial differential equations obtained from two different perspectives can be identified, thereby confirming an assertion of the BPS/CFT correspondence.</description>

Abstract: In AdS/CFT, partition functions of decoupled CFTs living on separate asymptotic boundaries factorize. However, the presence of bulk wormholes connecting different boundaries tends to spoil the factorization of the bulk partition function, which leads to a disagreement between the two sides. In this paper, we present two examples where wormhole contributions cancel each other in bulk partition function calculations, thus the bulk factorization can be realized. The first example is in 2-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity, where the proposed way of realizing the cancellation resides in the extra complex phases associated with different wormholes. The phases arise due to the degenerate vacua structure. In the example of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, the cancellation can be achieved due to the distribution of the wormhole saddles on a complex plane. The two examples demonstrate a way of realizing bulk partition function factorization by extending the Hilbert space and dressing wormhole saddles with extra phases.</description>

Abstract: We study classical radiation fields at next-to-leading order using the methods of scattering amplitudes. The fields of interest to us are sourced when two massive, point-like objects scatter inelastically, and can be computed from one-loop amplitudes. We show that the real and imaginary parts of the amplitudes both play important but physically distinct roles in the radiation field. The amplitude's imaginary part directly computes the portion of radiation emitted under the influence of a body's self-field, i.e., through radiation reaction. This aspect of radiation reaction is directly linked to one-loop Compton amplitudes in electrodynamics, Yang-Mills theory and gravity. We also discuss the fascinating interplay between renormalisation, radiation reaction and classical field theory from this perspective.</description>

Abstract: Unitarity of time evolution is one of the basic principles constraining physical processes. Its consequences in the perturbative Bunch-Davies wavefunction in cosmology have been formulated in terms of the cosmological optical theorem. In this paper, we re-analyse perturbative unitarity for the Bunch-Davies wavefunction, focusing on: 1) the role of the $i\epsilon$-prescription and its compatibility with the requirement of unitarity; 2) the origin of the different "cutting rules"; 3) the emergence of the flat-space optical theorem from the cosmological one. We take the combinatorial point of view of the cosmological polytopes, which provide a first-principle description for a large class of scalar graphs contributing to the wavefunctional. The requirement of the positivity of the geometry together with the preservation of its orientation determine the $i\epsilon$-prescription. In kinematic space it translates into giving a small negative imaginary part to all the energies, making the wavefunction coefficients well-defined for any value of their real part along the real axis. Unitarity is instead encoded into a non-convex part of the cosmological polytope, which we name optical polytope. The cosmological optical theorem emerges as the equivalence between a specific polytope subdivision of the optical polytope and its triangulations, each of which provides different cutting rules. The flat-space optical theorem instead emerges from the non-convexity of the optical polytope. On the more mathematical side, we provide two definitions of this non-convex geometry, none of them based on the idea of the non-convex geometry as a union of convex ones.</description>

Abstract: Equilibrium finite temperature observables of a CFT can be described by a local effective action for background fields -- a "thermal effective action." This effective action determines the asymptotic density of states of a CFT as a detailed function of dimension and spin. We discuss subleading perturbative and nonperturbative corrections to the density, comparing with free and holographic examples. We furthermore show how to use the thermal effective action on more complicated geometries at special locations called "hot spots." The hot spot idea makes a prediction for a CFT partition function on a higher-dimensional version of a genus-2 Riemann surface, in a particular high temperature limit. By decomposing the partition function into a novel higher-dimensional version of genus-2 conformal blocks (which we compute at large scaling dimension), we extract the asymptotic density of heavy-heavy-heavy OPE coefficients in a higher-dimensional CFT. We also compute asymptotics of thermal 1-point functions using the same techniques.</description>

Abstract: Dynamical quantum field theories (QFTs), such as those in which spacetimes are equipped with a metric and/or a field in the form of a smooth map to a target manifold, can be formulated axiomatically using the language of $\infty$-categories. According to a geometric version of the cobordism hypothesis, such QFTs collectively assemble themselves into objects in an $\infty$-topos of smooth spaces. We show how this allows one to define and study generalized global symmetries of such QFTs. The symmetries are themselves smooth, so the `higher-form' symmetry groups can be endowed with, e.g., a Lie group structure.
  Among the more surprising general implications for physics are, firstly, that QFTs in spacetime dimension $d$, considered collectively, can have $d$-form symmetries, going beyond the known $(d-1)$-form symmetries of individual QFTs and, secondly, that a global symmetry of a QFT can be anomalous even before we try to gauge it, due to a failure to respect either smoothness (in that a symmetry of an individual QFT does not smoothly extend to QFTs collectively) or locality (in that a symmetry of an unextended QFT does not extend to an extended one).
  Smoothness anomalies are shown to occur even in 2-state systems in quantum mechanics (here formulated axiomatically by equipping $d=1$ spacetimes with a metric, an orientation, and perhaps some unitarity structure). Locality anomalies are shown to occur even for invertible QFTs defined on $d=1$ spacetimes equipped with an orientation and a smooth map to a target manifold. These correspond in physics to topological actions for a particle moving on the target and the relation to an earlier classification of such actions using invariant differential cohomology is elucidated.</description>

Abstract: In this letter we discuss the operator product expansion of scalar operators in five-dimensional field theories with an $SU(1,3)\times U(1)$ spacetime symmetry. Such theories arise by a novel conformal null reduction of six-dimensional Lorentzian conformal field theories. Unlike Lorentzian conformal field theories, three-point functions of generic operators in such theories are not completely fixed by $SU(1,3)\times U(1)$ symmetry. However, we show that in a special case the functional form of the OPE coefficients can be fully determined, and we use them to fix the form of the three-point function. The result is shown to agree with correlation functions obtained by reduction of six-dimensional conformal field theories.</description>

Abstract: We compute the 5PM order contributions to the scattering angle and impulse of classical black hole scattering in the conservative sector at first self-force order (1SF) using the worldline quantum field theory formalism. This challenging four-loop computation required the use of advanced integration-by-parts and differential equation technology implemented on high-performance computing systems. Use of partial fraction identities allowed us to render the complete integrand in a fully planar form. The resulting function space is simpler than expected: in the scattering angle we see only multiple polylogarithms up to weight three, and a total absence of the elliptic integrals that appeared at 4PM order. All checks on our result, both internal - cancellation of dimensional regularization poles, preservation of the on-shell condition - and external - matching the slow-velocity limit with the post-Newtonian (PN) literature up to 5PN order and matching the tail terms to the 4PM loss of energy - are passed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In these notes we review the calculation of Jones polynomials using a matrix representation of the braid group and Temperley-Lieb algebra. The pseudounitary representation that we consider allows constructing ``states'' from the group/algebra matrices and compute the knot invariants as matrix elements, rather than traces. In comparison with a more standard way of computing the invariants through traces, the matrix element method is more interesting and complete from the point of view of applications. As a byproduct of the discussion we prove a general formula for pretzel knots.</description>

      <title>On the Geometry of N=2 Minkowski Vacua of Gauged N=2 Supergravity Theories in Four Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gauging isometries of four-dimensional N=2 supergravity theories yields an N=2 supersymmetric theory with a scalar potential. In this note, we study the well-known constraints for four-dimensional N=2 Minkowski vacua of such theories. We propose that classically a projective special K\"ahler submanifold of the projective K\"ahler target space of the ungauged theory describes the moduli space of the complex scalar fields of massless vector multiplets for N=2 Minkowski vacua configurations, which then receives quantum corrections from integrating out massive fields. Subloci of projective special K\"ahler manifolds appear as supersymmetric flux vacua in the context of type IIB Calabi-Yau threefold compactifications with background fluxes as well. While these flux vacua equations arise from the critical locus of an N=1 superpotential, we show that these equations can also be obtained from the N=2 supersymmetric Minkowski vacuum equations of gauged N=2 supergravity theories upon gauging suitable isometries in the semi-classical universal hypermultiplet sector of type IIB string Calabi-Yau threefold compactifications. Thus, we give an intrinsic N=2 supersymmetric interpretation to the flux vacua equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the class of $\text{AdS}_3\times \mathbb{CP}^3$ solutions to massive Type IIA supergravity with $\mathfrak{osp}(6|2)$ superconformal algebra recently constructed in arXiv:2304.12207 [hep-th]. These solutions are foliations over an interval preserving $\mathcal{N}=(0,6)$ supersymmetry in two dimensions, that in the massless limit can be mapped to the $\text{AdS}_4\times \mathbb{CP}^3$ solution of ABJM/ABJ. We show that in the massive case extra NS5-D8 branes, that we interpret as $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS surface defect branes within the ABJ theory, backreact in the geometry and turn one of the 3d field theory directions onto an energy scale, generating a flow towards a 2d CFT. We construct explicit quiver field theories that we propose flow in the IR to the $(0,6)$ SCFTs dual to the solutions. Finally, we show that the $\text{AdS}_3$ solutions realise geometrically, in terms of large gauge transformations, an extension to the massive case of Seiberg duality in ABJ theories proposed in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploring the inverse problem tied to the Page curve phenomenon and island paradigm, we investigate the geometric conditions underpinning black hole evaporation where information is preserved and islands manifest, giving rise to the characteristic Page curve. Focusing on a broad class of static black hole metrics in asymptotically Minkowski or (anti-)de Sitter spacetimes, we derive a pivotal constraint on the blacken factor $f(r)$ for which the island exists and reproduce the Page curve. Specifically, we reveal that a sufficient yet not universally necessary criterion -- manifested in the negativity of the second derivative of $f(r)$, i.e. $f^{\prime \prime} (r)&lt;0$, in proximity to the event horizon where $r \sim r_h+ {\cal O} (G_N)$, ensures the emergence of Page curves in a manner transcending specific theoretical models. This pivotal finding, supported by the tenets of the quantum focusing conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We adopt the Reall-Santos method to obtain the quadratic curvature corrections to the thermodynamics of Myers-Perry rotating black holes in diverse dimensions. We consider the corrections in canonical and grand canonical ensembles, and also for fixed mass and angular momenta. We find that there exist inevitable divergences for generic rotation parameters so that the perturbative approach breaks down. We present a simple and universal formula to determine where these divergences could arise, and argue, using an explicit example, that these divergences are artefact of perturbation and may not exist in the full nonlinear theory.</description>

      <title>Fusion rule in conformal field theories and topological orders: A unified view of correspondence and (fractional) supersymmetry and their relation to topological holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized symmetry, including non-invertible and categorical symmetry, plays a central role in contemporary studies on topological orders (TOs) and the corresponding conformal field theories (CFTs). The generators of such symmetries have a close connection to non-abelian anyonic objects in a bulk CFT or chiral CFT (CCFT), but it has been known that the construction of a CCFT contains theoretical difficulties in general. In this work, we revisit the structure of the fusion rule in $Z_{N}$ symmetric chiral and bulk conformal field theories and the corresponding TOs. We propose a nontrivial expression of subalgebra structure in the fusion rule of a bulk CFT. We name this subalgebra ``bulk semion" which corresponds to the fusion rule of the CCFTs and categorical symmetry of the TOs. This is a bulk-edge correspondence based on the symmetry analysis and can be interpreted as a version of topological holography in the recent literature. The topological holography has been expected to be applicable to the systems in general space-time dimensions. Moreover, we give a concise way of unifying duality (or fractional supersymmetry), generalized or categorical symmetry, and Lagrangian subalgebra. Our method is potentially useful to formulate and study general TOs, fundamentally only from the data of bulk CFTs or vice versa, and gives a clue in understanding CCFT (or ancillary CFT more generally).</description>

Abstract: We identify a set of Hertz potentials for solutions to the vector wave equation on black hole spacetimes. The Hertz potentials yield Lorenz gauge electromagnetic vector potentials that represent physical solutions to the Maxwell equations, satisfy the Teukolsky equation, and are related to the Maxwell scalars by straightforward and separable inversion relations. Our construction, based on the GHP formalism, avoids the need for a mode ansatz and leads to potentials that represent both static and non-static solutions. As an explicit example, we specialise the procedure to mode-decomposed perturbations of Kerr spacetime and in the process make connections with previous results.</description>

Abstract: We study transverse equivariant Hilbert schemes of affine hypertoric varieties equipped with a symplectic action of a Weyl group. In particular, we show that the Coulomb branches of Braverman, Finkelberg, and Nakajima can be obtained either as such Hilbert schemes or Hamiltonian reductions thereof. Furthermore, we propose that the Coulomb branches for representations of non-cotangent type are also obtained in this way. We also investigate the putative complete hyperk\"ahler metrics on these objects. We describe their twistor spaces and, in the case when the symplectic quotient construction of the hypertoric variety is $W$-equivariant (which includes Coulomb branches of cotangent type), we show that the hyperk\"ahler metric can be described as the natural $L^2$-metric on a moduli space of solutions to modified Nahm's equations on an interval with poles at both ends and a discontinuity in the middle, with the latter described by a new object: a hyperspherical variety canonically associated to a hypertoric variety.</description>

      <title>Dark Universe Phenomenology from Yukawa Potential?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that the effect of cold dark matter in the cosmological setup can be explained by the coupling between the baryonic matter particles in terms of the long-range force having a graviton mass $m_g$ via the Yukawa gravitational potential. Such a quantum-corrected Yukawa-like gravitational potential is characterized by the coupling parameter $\alpha$, the wavelength parameter $\lambda$, which is related to the graviton mass via $m_g=\hbar/(\lambda c)$, that determines the range of the force and, finally, a Planck length quantity $l_0$ that makes the potential regular at the centre. The corrected Friedmann equations are obtained using Verlinde's entropic force interpretation of gravity based on the holographic scenario and the equipartition law of energy. The parameter $\alpha$ modifies Newton's constant as $G_{\rm eff}\rightarrow G(1+\alpha)$. We argue that dark matter is an apparent effect as no dark matter particle exists in this picture. Furthermore, the dark energy is also related to graviton mass and $\alpha$; in particular, we point out that the cosmological constant can be viewed as a self-interaction effect between gravitons. We further show that there exists a precise correspondence with Verlinde's emergent gravity theory, and due to the long-range force, the theory can be viewed as a non-local gravity theory. To this end, we performed the phase space analyses and estimated $\lambda\simeq 10^3 $[Mpc] and $\alpha \in (0.0385,0.0450)$, respectively. Finally, from these values, for the graviton mass, we get $m_g\simeq 10^{-68}$ kg, and cosmological constant $\Lambda \simeq 10^{-52}\rm m^{-2}$. Further, we argue how this theory reproduces the MOND phenomenology on galactic scales via the acceleration of Milgrom $a_0 \simeq 10^{-10}\rm m/s^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an inflation model with a flat scalar potential supported by observations and find that slow-roll inflation can emerge after a quasi-cyclic phase of the Universe, where it undergoes repeated expansions and contractions for a finite time period. The initial conditions and the positive spatial curvature required for such nontrivial dynamics align with the quantum creation of the Universe. The key ingredients that trigger inflation are dissipative interactions of the inflaton, which are necessary to reheat the Universe after inflation and thus give us an observational handle on pre-inflationary physics. Our discovery implies that inflation occurs more robustly after the creation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inflationary models, especially those with plateau-type potentials, are consistent with the cosmological data, but inflation itself does not resolve the initial singularity. This singularity is resolved, for example, by the idea of the quantum creation of the Universe from nothing such as the tunneling and no-boundary proposals. The simplest one predicts a closed Universe. Motivated by these facts, we investigate the classical dynamics of a closed universe with a plateau-type potential. Depending on the initial inflaton field value, the universe can undergo a variety of events: an immediate big crunch, a bounce or cyclic phase, and inflation. Although the non-inflationary solutions may appear irrelevant to our Universe, they can be turned into single or multiple bounces followed by inflation, taking into account the interactions necessary for the reheating of the Universe after inflation. Thus, the dissipative mechanism in our setup explains both the graceful entry to and exit from inflation and gives us an indirect observational handle on the Universe just after creation. We also comment on the implications of these solutions for probabilistic interpretations of the wave function of the Universe.</description>

Abstract: By assuming simultaneously the unitarity of the Hawking evaporation and the universality of Bekenstein entropy bound as well as the validity of cosmic censorship conjecture, we find that the black hole evaporation rate could evolve from the usual inverse square law in black hole mass into a constant evaporation rate near the end of the Hawking evaporation before quantum gravity could come into play, inferring a slightly longer lifetime for lighter black holes.</description>

      <title>The instability of the inner horizon of the quantum-corrected black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the stability of the inner horizon of the quantum-corrected black hole which is proposed in loop quantum gravity as the exterior of the quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder and Swiss Cheese models. It is shown that the flux and energy density of a test scalar field measured by free-falling observers are both divergent near the Cauchy horizon. By considering the generalized Dray-'t Hooft-Redmond relation which is independent of the field equation, we find that the mass inflation always happens and the scalar curvature and Kretschmann scalar are also divergent on the inner horizon. These suggest that the inner horizon is unstable and will probably turn into a null singularity. The results support the strong cosmic censorship hypothesis. However, this also implies that the quantum corrected model may not be the definitive endpoint as a regular black hole. Besides, it further proposes that it may be challenging to observe the astronomical phenomenon which depends on the existence of the inner horizon of the black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bethe ansatz represents an analytical method enabling the exact solution of numerous models in condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics. When a global symmetry is present, the trial wavefunctions of the Bethe ansatz consist of plane wave superpositions. Previously, it has been shown that the Bethe ansatz can be recast as a deterministic quantum circuit. An analytical derivation of the quantum gates that form the circuit was lacking however. Here we present a comprehensive study of the transformation that brings the Bethe ansatz into a quantum circuit, which leads us to determine the analytical expression of the circuit gates. As a crucial step of the derivation, we present a simple set of diagrammatic rules that define a novel Matrix Product State network building Bethe wavefunctions. Remarkably, this provides a new perspective on the equivalence between the coordinate and algebraic versions of the Bethe ansatz.</description>

      <title>Sampling reduced density matrix to extract fine levels of entanglement spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-lying entanglement spectrum provides the quintessential fingerprint to identify the highly entangled quantum matter with topological and conformal field-theoretical properties. However, when the entangling region acquires long boundary with the environment, such as that between long coupled chains or in two or higher dimensions, there unfortunately exists no universal yet practical method to compute the entanglement spectra with affordable computational cost. Here we propose a new scheme to overcome such difficulty and successfully extract the low-lying fine entanglement spectrum (ES). We trace out the environment via quantum Monte Carlo simulation and diagonalize the reduced density matrix to gain the ES. We demonstrate the strength and reliability of our method through long coupled spin chains and answer its long-standing controversy. Our simulation results, with unprecedentedly large system sizes, establish the practical computation scheme of the entanglement spectrum with a huge freedom degree of environment.</description>

      <title>Quark-lepton mass relations from modular flavor symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09255v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The so-called Golden Mass Relation provides a testable correlation between charged-lepton and down-type quark masses, that arises in certain flavor models that do not rely on Grand Unification. Such models typically involve broken family symmetries. In this work, we demonstrate that realistic fermion mass relations can emerge naturally in modular invariant models, without relying on ad hoc flavon alignments. We provide a model-independent derivation of a class of mass relations that are experimentally testable. These relations are determined by both the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of the specific finite modular group and the expansion coefficients of its modular forms, thus offering potential probes of modular invariant models. As a detailed example, we present a set of viable mass relations based on the $\Gamma_4\cong S_4$ symmetry, which have calculable deviations from the usual Golden Mass Relation.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic gravity and its regularization of Locally Signed Coordinate Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We expect the final theory of gravity to have more symmetries than we suspect and our research points in this direction, to start with, standard general coordinate invariance can be extended to complex holomorphic general coordinate transformations This is possible by introducing a non Riemannian Measure of integration (NRMI) and where we avoid the non holomorphic standard $\sqrt{-g}$. measure of integration. Second, although globally signed transformations produce a change of boundary conditions and like global parity and global time reversal are not symmetries of nature, locally signed coordinate transformations where the jacobian changes sign locally but the jacobian approaches one asymptotically should be symmetries of nature, The holomorphic extension can regularize the regions of space time where the jacobian changes sign. Consequences for Quantum Gravity are discussed</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Renormalization of quantum loop effects generated from large fluctuations is a hugely debatable topic of research these days which rules out the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) formation within the framework of single-field inflation. In this article, we briefly discuss that the correct implementation of regularization, renormalization, and resummation techniques in a setup described by an ultra-slow-roll phase sandwiched between two slow-roll phases in the presence of smooth or sharp transitions can lead to a stringent constraint on the PBH mass (i.e. ${\cal O}(10^{2}{\rm gm}$)), which we advertise as a new No-go theorem. Finally, we will give some of the possible way-outs using which one can evade this proposed No-go theorem and produce solar/sub-solar mass PBHs.</description>

      <title>Analysis of anomalous contribution to galactic rotation curves due to stochastic spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13037v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the model put forth by Ref. [1], in which it is claimed that "post-quantum classical gravity" (PQCG), a stochastic theory of gravity, leads to modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) behavior on galactic scales that reproduces galactic rotation curves. We show that this analysis has three basic problems: (i) the equations of PQCG do not lead to a new large scale force of the form claimed in the paper, (ii) the form claimed is not of the MONDian form anyhow and so does not correspond to observed galactic dynamics, and (iii) the spectrum of fluctuations is very different from observations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic amplification in premerger neutron stars through resonance-induced magnetorotational instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tidal resonances in the final seconds of a binary neutron-star inspiral can excite oscillation modes in one or both of the constituents to large amplitudes. Under favorable circumstances, resonant pulsations can overstrain the stellar crust and unleash a torrent of magnetoelastic energy that manifests as a gamma-ray ``precursor flare.'' We show that for realistic, stratified stars rotating with a spin frequency of $\gtrsim30\,$Hz, the fundamental $g$ or its first overtone can also execute a differential rotation in the crust such that a magnetic field of strength $\gtrsim10^{13}\,$G is generated via magnetorotational instabilities. This may help to explain observed precursor rates and their luminosities. Premerger magnetic growth would also provide seed magnetic energy for the postmerger remnant.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing of a Schwarzschild-like black hole in Kalb-Ramond gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the gravitational lensing effect for the Schwarzschild-like black hole spacetime in the background of a Kalb-Ramond (KR) field proposed in [K. Yang et. al., Phys. Rev. D 108 (2023) 124004]. The solution is characterized by a single extra parameter $l$, which is associated to the Lorentz symmetry breaking induced by the KR field. First, we calculate the exact deflection angle of massive and massless particles for finite distances using elliptic integrals. Then we study this effect in the weak and strong field regimes, discussing the correction of the KR parameter on the coefficients of the expansions in both limits. We also find that increasing $l$ decreases the deflection angle. Furthermore, we use the available data from the Sagittarius $A^{\star}$ object, which is believed to be a supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy, to calculate relevant observables, such as, the image position, luminosity, and delay time. The values found could be potentially measured in the weak field regime, though for strong fields one would have to wait for the next generation of interferometers.</description>
