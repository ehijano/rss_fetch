      <title>Reduced-order modeling of Hamiltonian dynamics based on symplectic neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel data-driven symplectic induced-order modeling (ROM) framework for high-dimensional Hamiltonian systems that unifies latent-space discovery and dynamics learning within a single, end-to-end neural architecture. The encoder-decoder is built from Henon neural networks (HenonNets) and may be augmented with linear SGS-reflector layers. This yields an exact symplectic map between full and latent phase spaces. Latent dynamics are advanced by a symplectic flow map implemented as a HenonNet. This unified neural architecture ensures exact preservation of the underlying symplectic structure at the reduced-order level, significantly enhancing the fidelity and long-term stability of the resulting ROM. We validate our method through comprehensive numerical experiments on canonical Hamiltonian systems. The results demonstrate the method's capability for accurate trajectory reconstruction, robust predictive performance beyond the training horizon, and accurate Hamiltonian preservation. These promising outcomes underscore the effectiveness and potential applicability of our symplectic ROM framework for complex dynamical systems across a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines.</description>

      <title>Implicit-Explicit Scheme with Multiscale Vanka Two-Grid Solver for Heterogeneous Unsaturated Poroelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a coupled nonlinear system of equations that describe unsaturated flow in heterogeneous poroelastic media. For the numerical solution, we use a finite element approximation in space and present an efficient multiscale two-grid solver for solving the coupled system of equations. The proposed two-grid solver contains two main parts: (i) accurate coarse grid approximation based on local spectral spaces and (ii) coupled smoothing iterations based on an overlapping multiscale Vanka method. A Vanka smoother and local spectral coarse grids come with significant computational cost in the setup phase. To avoid constructing a new solver for each time step and/or nonlinear iteration, we utilize an implicit-explicit integration scheme in time, where we partition the nonlinear operator as a sum of linear and nonlinear parts. In particular, we construct an implicit linear approximation of the stiff components that remains fixed across all time, while treating the remaining nonlinear residual explicitly. This allows us to construct a robust two-grid solver offline and utilize it for fast and efficient online time integration. A linear stability analysis of the proposed novel coupled scheme is presented based on the representation of the system as a two-step scheme. We show that the careful decomposition of linear and nonlinear parts guarantees a linearly stable scheme. A numerical study is presented for a two-dimensional nonlinear coupled test problem of unsaturated flow in heterogeneous poroelastic media. We demonstrate the robustness of the two-grid solver, particularly the efficacy of block smoothing compared with simple pointwise smoothing, and illustrate the accuracy and stability of implicit-explicit time integration.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving parametric finite element methods for two-phase Stokes flow based on Lagrange multiplier approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel formulation for parametric finite element methods to approximate two-phase Stokes flow. The new formulation is based on the classical Stokes equation in the bulk and a novel choice of interface conditions with additional Lagrange multipliers. This new Lagrange multiplier approach ensures that the numerical methods exactly preserve two physical structures of two-phase Stokes flow at the fully discrete level: (i) the energy-decaying and (ii) the volume-preserving properties. Moreover, different types of higher-order time discretization methods are employed, including the Crank--Nicolson method and the second-order backward differentiation formula approach. The resulting schemes are nonlinear and can be efficiently solved by using the Newton method with a decoupling technique. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve the desired temporal accuracy while preserving the two physical structures of the two-phase Stokes system.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of Left-Right splitting surface scattering method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the convergence of the Left-Right splitting method (equivalent in key respects to the Method of Multiple Ordered Interactions and Forward-Backward method) for wave scattering by rough surfaces. This is an operator series method primarily designed for low grazing incidence and found in many cases to converge rapidly, often within one or two terms even for large incident angles. However, convergence is not guaranteed and semi-convergence may be observed.
  Our aims are two-fold: (1) To obtain theoretical and physical insight into the regimes in which rapid convergence occurs and the mechanisms by which it fails, by examining and modifying eigenvalues of the operator; (2) provide a strategy for increasing the speed of convergence or more crucially for overcoming divergence, and providing a stopping criterion. The first is addressed by subtracting successive dominant eigenvectors from the incident field, to examine the impact on divergence and on the incident spectrum. For the second, we apply a generalisation of Shanks' transformation to the operator series; this effectively improves convergence and (unlike eigenvalue subtraction) readily generalises to 3D and composite problems. These results also explain why the method converges so rapidly for much larger incident angles. Finally we ask and give an analytical solution to a key question: For a divergent eigenvector of the iterating operator, what is the exact solution and can it be deduced from the divergent series? We show that the exact solution is well-behaved and can be found from the series in a way which is related to the Shanks transformation.</description>

      <title>Anderson Acceleration For Perturbed Newton Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a convergence theory For Anderson acceleration (AA) applied to perturbed Newton methods (pNMs) For computing roots of nonlinear problems. Two important special cases are the classical Newton method and the Levenberg-Marquardt method. We prove that if a problem is 2-regular, then Anderson accelerated pNMs coupled with a safeguarding scheme, known as $\gamma$-safeguarding, converge locally linearly in a starlike domain of convergence, but with an improved rate of convergence compared to standard perturbed Newton methods. Since Levenberg-Marquardt methods are a special case of pNMs, we obtain a novel acceleration and local convergence result For Anderson accelerated Levenberg-Marquardt. We further show that the safeguarding technique can detect if the underlying perturbed Newton method is converging superlinearly, and respond by tuning the Anderson step down. We demonstrate the methods on several benchmark problems in the literature.</description>

      <title>Comparison of three random field sampling methods for high-resolution Bayesian inversion with application to a plane stress problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian inversion aims to provide uncertainty quantification of posterior estimates conditional on observations. When the inferred parameter is a continuous spatial function, one common strategy is to model it as a random field. Several random field sampling strategies exist. In this article, we investigate three different approaches in terms of numerical efficiency and influence on the posterior distribution. These approaches are based on (i) Karhunen-Loeve and (ii) wavelet expansions, and (iii) local average subdivision. We use the multilevel Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to construct posterior estimates with all approaches. This enables a focus on high-dimensional problems discretised on high-resolution finite element grids. As an application, we consider the reconstruction of material parameters in a 2D plane stress model, conditional on static displacement observations. Through these numerical experiments, we deduce that the methods provide comparable posterior estimates and that the local average subdivision method attains slightly better numerical efficiency than the other two approaches.</description>

      <title>$\boldsymbol{H}(\textbf{curl})$-reconstruction of piecewise polynomial fields with application to $hp$-a posteriori nonconforming error analysis for Maxwell's equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We devise and analyse a novel $\boldsymbol{H}(\textbf{curl})$-reconstruction operator for piecewise polynomial fields on shape-regular simplicial meshes. The (non-polynomial) reconstruction is devised over the mesh vertex patches using the partition of unity induced by hat basis functions in combination with local Helmholtz decompositions. Our main focus is on homogeneous tangential boundary conditions. We prove that the difference between the reconstructed $\boldsymbol{H}_0(\textbf{curl})$-field and the original, piecewise polynomial field, measured in the broken curl norm and in the $\boldsymbol{L}^2$-norm, can be bounded in terms of suitable jump norms of the original field. The bounds are always $h$-optimal, and $p$-suboptimal by $\frac12$-order for the broken curl norm and by $\frac32$-order for the $\boldsymbol{L}^2$-norm. An auxiliary result of independent interest is a novel broken-curl, divergence-preserving Poincar\'{e} inequality on vertex patches. Moreover, the $\boldsymbol{L}^2$-norm estimate can be improved to $\frac12$-order suboptimality under a (reasonable) assumption on the uniform elliptic regularity pickup for a Poisson problem with Neumann conditions over the vertex patches. We also discuss extensions of the $\boldsymbol{H}_0(\textbf{curl})$-reconstruction operator to the prescription of mixed boundary conditions, to agglomerated polytopal meshes, and to convex domains. Finally, we showcase an important application of the $\boldsymbol{H}(\textbf{curl})$-reconstruction operator to the $hp$-a posteriori nonconforming error analysis of Maxwell's equations. We focus on the (symmetric) interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (dG) approximation of some simplified forms of Maxwell's equations.</description>

      <title>Basis construction for polynomial spline spaces over arbitrary T-meshe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first method for constructing bases for polynomial spline spaces over an arbitrary T-meshes (PT-splines for short). We construct spline basis functions for an arbitrary T-mesh by first converting the T-mesh into a diagonalizable one via edge extension, ensuring a stable dimension of the spline space. Basis functions over the diagoalizable T-mesh are constructed according to the three components in the dimension formula corresponding to cross-cuts, rays, and T $l$-edges in the diagonalizable T-mesh, and each component is assigned some local tensor product B-splines as the basis functions. We prove this set of functions constitutes a basis for the diagonalizable T-mesh. To remove redundant edges from extension, we introduce a technique, termed Extended Edge Elimination (EEE) to construct a basis for an arbitrary T-mesh while reducing structural constraints and unnecessary refinements. The resulting PT-spline basis ensures linear independence and completeness, supported by a dedicated construction algorithm. A comparison with LR B-splines, which may lack linear independence and are limited to LR-meshes, highlights the PT-spline's versatility across any T-mesh. Examples are also provided to demonstrate that dimensional instability in spline spaces is related with basis function degradation and that PT-splines are advantageous over HB-splines for certain hierarchical T-meshes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a parameter-robust preconditioner for a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) discretization of a four-field formulation of Biot's consolidation model. We first determine a parameter-robust preconditioner for the full discretization. HDG methods, however, allow for static condensation. We therefore apply the framework presented in our previous work [arXiv:2503.05918, 2025] to show that a reduced form of the preconditioner is also parameter-robust for the reduced HDG discretization. We verify the parameter-robustness of the preconditioner through numerical examples in both two and three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Some semi-decoupled algorithms with optimal convergence for a four-field linear thermo-poroelastic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose three semi-decoupled algorithms for efficiently solving a four-field thermo-poroelastic model. The first two algorithms adopt a sequential strategy: at the initial time step, all variables are computed simultaneously using a monolithic solver; thereafter, the system is split into a mixed linear elasticity subproblem and a coupled pressure-temperature reaction-diffusion subproblem. The two variants differ in the order in which these subproblems are solved. To further improve computational efficiency, we introduce a parallel semi-decoupled algorithm. In this approach, the four-field system is solved monolithically only at the first time step, and the two subproblems are then solved in parallel at subsequent time levels. All three algorithms are free from stabilization techniques and do not require iterative procedures at each time step. Rigorous analysis confirms their unconditional stability, optimal convergence rates, and robustness under a wide range of physical parameter settings. These theoretical results are further validated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A time-adaptive optimization approach for reconstructing immune response in a mathematical model of acute HIV infection using clinical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper proposes a time-adaptive optimization approach for determining the time-dependent immune response function in a mathematical model of acute HIV infection, using clinical data from four untreated patients. We formulate the problem as a parameter identification problem for an immune response system of ODE which includes novel component integrated into the third equation of the classical three-equation HIV model.
  Tikhonov's regularization method, Lagrangian approach, from which we derive the optimality conditions, and a numerical scheme to solve the forward
  and adjoint problems, as well as parameter identification problem, are presented.
  Three different a posteriori error estimates are derived and based on these estimates, a time adaptive optimization algorithm is formulated. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive method in reconstructing the immune response function during the acute phase of HIV infection, using patient-specific clinical data. Computational results show improvement of
  reconstruction of immune response function using the local
  time-adaptive mesh refinement method compared to the standard conjugate gradient method applied on a uniform time mesh.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Modeling of Filtration with Sieving in Graded Pore Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model filtration of a feed solution, containing both small and large foulant particles, by a membrane filter. The membrane interior is modeled as a network of pores, allowing for the simultaneous adsorption of small particles and sieving of large particles, two fouling mechanisms typically observed during the early stages of commercial filtration applications. In our model, first-principles continuum partial differential equations model transport of the small particles and adsorptive fouling in each pore, while sieving particles are assumed to follow a discrete Poisson arrival process with a biased random walk through the pore network. Our goals are to understand the relative influences of each fouling mode and highlight the effect of their coupling on the performance of filters with a pore-size gradient (specifically, we consider a banded filter with different pore sizes in each band). Our results suggest that, due to the discrete nature of pore blockage, sieving alters qualitatively the rate of the flux decline. Moreover, the difference between sieving particle sizes and the initial pore size (radius) in each band plays a crucial role in indicating the onset and disappearance of sieving-adsorption competition. Lastly, we demonstrate a phase transition in the filter lifetime as the arrival frequency of sieving particles increases.</description>

      <title>On computing and the complexity of computing higher-order $U$-statistics, exactly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order $U$-statistics abound in fields such as statistics, machine learning, and computer science, but are known to be highly time-consuming to compute in practice. Despite their widespread appearance, a comprehensive study of their computational complexity is surprisingly lacking. This paper aims to fill that gap by presenting several results related to the computational aspect of $U$-statistics. First, we derive a useful decomposition from an $m$-th order $U$-statistic to a linear combination of $V$-statistics with orders not exceeding $m$, which are generally more feasible to compute. Second, we explore the connection between exactly computing $V$-statistics and Einstein summation, a tool often used in computational mathematics, quantum computing, and quantum information sciences for accelerating tensor computations. Third, we provide an optimistic estimate of the time complexity for exactly computing $U$-statistics, based on the treewidth of a particular graph associated with the $U$-statistic kernel. The above ingredients lead to a new, much more runtime-efficient algorithm of exactly computing general higher-order $U$-statistics. We also wrap our new algorithm into an open-source Python package called $\texttt{u-stats}$. We demonstrate via three statistical applications that $\texttt{u-stats}$ achieves impressive runtime performance compared to existing benchmarks. This paper aspires to achieve two goals: (1) to capture the interest of researchers in both statistics and other related areas further to advance the algorithmic development of $U$-statistics, and (2) to offer the package $\texttt{u-stats}$ as a valuable tool for practitioners, making the implementation of methods based on higher-order $U$-statistics a more delightful experience.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-scaled strong convergence of stochastic theta method for stochastic differential equations driven by time-changed L\'evy noise beyond Lipschitz continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops an $\alpha$-parametrized framework for analyzing the strong convergence of the stochastic theta (ST) method for stochastic differential equations driven by time-changed L\'evy noise (TCSDEwLNs) with time-space-dependent coefficients satisfying local Lipschitz conditions. Properties of the inverse subordinator are investigated and explicit moment bounds for the exact solution are derived with jump rate incorporated. The analysis demonstrates that the ST method converges strongly with order of $min\{\eta_{F},\eta_{G},\eta_{H},\alpha/2\}$, establishing a precise relationship between numerical accuracy and the time-change mechanism. This theoretical advancement extends existing results and would facilitate applications in finance and biology where time-changed L\'evy models are prevalent.</description>

      <title>Waveform inversion with a data driven estimate of the internal wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.11051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an inverse problem for the wave equation, concerned with estimating the wave speed, aka velocity, from data gathered by an array of sources and receivers that emit probing signals and measure the resulting waves. The typical mathematical formulation of velocity estimation is a nonlinear least squares minimization of the data misfit, over a search velocity space. There are two main impediments to this approach, which manifest as multiple local minima of the objective function: The nonlinearity of the mapping from the velocity to the data, which accounts for multiple scattering effects, and poor knowledge of the kinematics (smooth part of the wave speed) which causes cycle-skipping. We show that the nonlinearity can be mitigated using a data driven estimate of the internal wave field. This leads to improved performance of the inversion for a reasonable initial guess of the kinematics.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Block Preconditioning for Incompressible Resistive Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work develops an all-at-once space-time preconditioning approach for resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). We consider parallel-in-time due to the long time domains required to capture the physics of interest, as well as the complexity of the underlying system and thereby computational cost of long-time integration. To ameliorate this cost by using many processors, we thus develop a novel approach to solving the whole space-time system that is parallelizable in both space and time. We develop a space-time block preconditioning for resistive MHD, following the space-time block preconditioning concept first introduced by Danieli et al. in 2022 for incompressible flow, where an effective preconditioner for classic sequential time-stepping is extended to the space-time setting. The starting point for our derivation is the continuous Schur complement preconditioner by Cyr et al. in 2021, which we proceed to generalise in order to produce, to our knowledge, the first space-time block preconditioning approach for the challenging equations governing incompressible resistive MHD. The numerical results are promising for the model problems of island coalescence and tearing mode, which we investigate numerically in a mixed regime, where advective and diffusive forces are both present. The overhead computational cost associated with space-time preconditioning versus sequential time-stepping is modest and primarily in the range of 2x-5x, which is low for parallel-in-time schemes in general. Additionally, the scaling results for inner (linear) and outer (nonlinear) iterations are flat in the case of fixed time-step size and only grow very slowly in the case of time-step refinement.</description>

      <title>Mixed-dimensional modeling of vascular tissues with reduced Lagrange multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a numerical method for the simulation of multiscale materials composed of an elastic matrix and slender active inclusions. The setting is motivated by the modeling of vascularized tissues and by problems arising in the context of medical imaging techniques, where the estimation of effective (i.e., macroscale) material properties is affected by the presence of microscale structures and microscale dynamics, such as fluid flow in the vasculature. We propose a method where the background solid material and the active slender inclusions are discretized independently, imposing the required interface conditions via non-matching Lagrange multipliers. The intrinsic geometrical complexity of the resulting computational model is simplified by relying on a reduced Lagrange multiplier framework, where the functional space of the Lagrange multiplier is replaced by the tensor product between an infinite dimensional Sobolev space defined on a lower-dimensional characteristic set of co-dimension two, and a finite dimensional space defined on the cross-sections of the inclusions. In view of the coupling with one-dimensional blood flow models, we derive a non-standard boundary condition that enforces a local deformation on the solid-fluid boundary, and we present the details of its stability analysis in the continuous elasticity setting. The method is validated with different numerical examples in two and three dimensions, assessing its convergence properties and its potential for the in silico characterization of tissues samples.</description>

      <title>A direct finite element method for elliptic interface problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a direct finite element method is proposed for solving interface problems on unfitted meshes. This new method treats the two interface conditions as an $H^{\frac12}(\Gamma)\times H^{-\frac12}(\Gamma)$ pair for the mutual interaction across the interface, rather than the jumps of variables. A simple and straightforward finite element method is proposed based on this approach. This method solves the interface problem using conforming finite elements in one subdomain and conforming mixed finite elements in the other, with a natural integral term accounting for mutual interaction. Under reasonable assumptions, this direct finite element method is proved to be well-posed with an optimal a priori error analysis. Moreover, a simple lowest-order direct finite element method, using the linear element and the lowest-order Raviart-Thomas element, is analyzed to achieve the optimal a priori error estimate by verifying the aforementioned assumptions. Numerical tests are provided to confirm the theoretical results and the effectiveness of the direct finite element method.</description>

      <title>High order well-balanced Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian ADER discontinuous Galerkin schemes on general polygonal moving meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel family of high order accurate numerical schemes for the solution of hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) which combines several geometrical and physical structure preserving properties. First, we settle our methods in the Lagrangian framework, where each element of the mesh evolves following as close as possible the local fluid flow, so to reduce the numerical dissipation at contact waves and moving interfaces and to satisfy the Galilean and rotational invariance properties of the studied PDEs system. In particular, we choose the direct Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) approach which, in order to always guarantee the high quality of the moving mesh, allows to combine the Lagrangian motion with mesh optimization techniques. The employed polygonal tessellation is thus regenerated at each time step, the previous one is connected with the new one by space-time control volumes, including hole-like sliver elements in correspondence of topology changes, over which we integrate a space-time divergence form of the original PDEs through a high order accurate ADER discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme. Mass conservation and adherence to the GCL condition are guaranteed by construction thanks to the integration over closed control volumes, and robustness over shock discontinuities is ensured by the use of an a posteriori subcell finite volume (FV) limiting technique.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the semiclassical Schr\"odinger equation with random parameters and develop several robust multi-fidelity methods. We employ the time-splitting Fourier pseudospectral (TSFP) method for the high-fidelity solver, and consider different low-fidelity solvers including the meshless method like frozen Gaussian approximation (FGA) and the level set (LS) method for the semiclassical limit of the Schr\"odinger equation. With a careful choice of the low-fidelity model, we obtain an error estimate for the bi-fidelity method. We conduct numerous numerical experiments and validate the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed multi-fidelity methods, by comparing the performance of a class of bi-fidelity and tri-fidelity approximations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09389v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is about an improved error analysis of CholeskyQR with the randomized model for the tall-skinny $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$. Due to the structure of CholeskyQR, we utilize the randomized model in the first step of CholeskyQR with a weak assumption. We receive a better sufficient condition of $\kappa_{2}(X)$ and a tighter upper bound of residual for CholeskyQR2, together with a probabilistic shifted item $s$ for Shifted CholeskyQR3 based on $\norm{X}_{F}$ after improved error analysis. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our new theoretical results. The probabilistic $s$ for Shifted CholeskyQR3 can enhance the applicability of Shifted CholeskyQR3 while maintaining numerical stability. It is also robust enough after numerous experiments.</description>

      <title>An adaptive two-grid preconditioner and linearly implicit scheme for shale gas transport in fractured porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a nonlinear mixed-dimensional model for simulating gas transport in shale formation. The mathematical model consists of a coupled system of nonlinear equations, where flow within fractures is represented using a lower-dimensional representation. For the numerical solution of the coupled transport problem, we construct an unstructured mesh that resolves lower dimensional fractures on the grid level and use the finite element approximation to build a discrete system. To construct an efficient scheme for the resulting nonlinear problem, we use an explicit-implicit method for time integration, where we carefully choose an additive partition of the nonlinear operators to separate the stiff linear component and integrate it implicitly to ensure the stability of the time integration. Next, we invert the linear partition of the operator by constructing an efficient two-grid preconditioner for shale gas transport in fractured porous media. We use a local pointwise smoother on the fine grid and carefully design an adaptive multiscale space for coarse grid approximation based on local generalized eigenvalue problems. We utilize an adaptive thresholding to automatically identify local dominant modes which correspond to the very small eigenvalues in local domains. We remark that such spatial features are automatically captured through our local spectral problems, and connect these to fracture information in the global formulation of the problem. Approximation properties of the local spectral space with convergence of the proposed two-grid algorithm are given. Numerical results are presented for two fracture distributions with 30 and 160 fractures, demonstrating iterative convergence independent of the contrast of fracture and porous matrix permeability.</description>

      <title>A BDDC method with an adaptive coarse space for three-dimensional advection-diffusion problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The solution of nonsymmetric but positive definite (NSPD) systems arising from advection-diffusion problems is an important research topic in science and engineering. Balancing domain decomposition by constraints with an adaptive coarse space(adaptive BDDC) constitute a significant class of nonoverlapping domain decomposition methods, commonly used for symmetric positive definite problems. In this paper, we propose an adaptive BDDC method that incorporates a class of edge generalized eigenvalue problems based on prior selected primal constraints to solve NSPD systems from advection-diffusion problems. Compared with the conventional adaptive BDDC method for such systems, the proposed approach further reduces the number of primal unknowns. Numerical experiments show that although the iteration count increases slightly, the overall computational time is significantly reduced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03742v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a rounding error analysis of a mixed-precision preconditioned Jacobi algorithm, which uses low precision to compute the preconditioner, applies it at high precision (amounting to two matrix-matrix multiplications) and solves the eigenproblem using the Jacobi algorithm at working precision. Our analysis yields meaningfully smaller relative forward error bounds for the computed eigenvalues compared with those of the Jacobi algorithm. We further prove that, after preconditioning, if the off-diagonal entries of the preconditioned matrix are sufficiently small relative to its smallest diagonal entry, the relative forward error bound is independent of the condition number of the original matrix. We present two constructions for the preconditioner that exploit low precision, along with their error analyses. Our numerical experiments confirm our theoretical results and compare the relative forward error of the proposed algorithm with the Jacobi algorithm, a preconditioned Jacobi algorithm, and MATLAB's $\texttt{eig}$ function. Timings using Julia suggest that the dominant cost of obtaining this level of accuracy comes from the high precision matrix-matrix multiplies; if support in software or hardware for this were improved, then this would become a negligible cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the exterior Helmholtz problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions is always well-posed, the associated standard boundary integral equations are not if the squared wavenumber agrees with an eigenvalue of the interior Dirichlet problem. Combined field integral equations are not affected by this spurious resonances but are essentially restricted to sufficiently smooth boundaries. For general Lipschitz domains, the latter integral equations are applicable through suitable regularization. Under fairly general assumptions on the regularizing operator, we propose {\sl a posteriori} computable error estimators for corresponding Galerkin boundary element methods of arbitrary polynomial degree. We show that adaptive mesh-refining algorithms steered by these local estimators converge at optimal algebraic rate with respect to the number of underlying boundary mesh elements. In particular, we consider mixed formulations involving the inverse Laplace--Beltrami as regularizing operator. Numerical examples highlight that in the vicinity of spurious resonances the proposed adaptive algorithm is significantly more performant when applied to the regularized combined field equation rather than the standard one.</description>

Abstract: Optimal transportation of raw material from suppliers to customers is an issue arising in logistics that is addressed here with a continuous model relying on optimal transport theory. A physics informed neuralnetwork method is advocated here for the solution of the corresponding generalized Monge-Amp`ere equation. Convex neural networks are advocated to enforce the convexity of the solution to the Monge-Amp\`ere equation and obtain a suitable approximation of the optimal transport map. A particular focus is set on the enforcement of transport boundary conditions in the loss function. Numerical experiments illustrate the solution to the optimal transport problem in several configurations, and sensitivity analyses are performed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04767v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A symmetric boundary integral formulation for the transient scattering of acoustic waves off homogeneous and isotropic elastic obstacles is analyzed. Both the acoustic scattered field and the elastodynamic excited field are represented through a direct integral representation, resulting in a coupled system of interior/exterior integral equations that is symmetrized through the introduction of an auxiliary mortar variable. The analysis of each system and of its Galerkin discretization is done through the passage to the Laplace domain, which allows for the use of convolution quadrature for time discretization. Since the operators of the acustic and elastic Calder\'on calculus appear independently of each other, the formulation is well suited for non-intrusive numerical impementations (i.e. existing codes for acoustic and elastic problems can be used without any modification).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The article focuses on error estimates as well as stability analysis of deep learning methods for stationary and non-stationary viscous Burgers equation in two and three dimensions. The local well-posedness of homogeneous boundary value problem for non-stationary viscous Burgers equation is established by using semigroup techniques and fixed point arguments. By considering a suitable approximate problem and deriving appropriate energy estimates, we prove the existence of a unique strong solution. Additionally, we extend our analysis to the global well-posedness of the non-homogeneous problem. For both the stationary and non-stationary cases, we derive explicit error estimates in suitable Lebesgue and Sobolev norms by optimizing a loss function in a Deep Neural Network approximation of the solution with fixed complexity. Finally, numerical results on prototype systems are presented to illustrate the derived error estimates.</description>

      <title>A novel semi-analytical multiple invariants-preserving integrator for conservative PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many conservative partial differential equations such as the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, and the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations, the Klein-Gordon equation have more than one invariant functionals. In this paper, we propose the definition of the discrete variational derivative, based on which, a novel semi-analytical multiple invariants-preserving integrator for the conservative partial differential equations is constructed by projection technique. The proposed integrators are shown to have the same order of accuracy as the underlying integrators. For applications, some concrete mass-momentum-energy-preserving integrators are derived for the KdV equation.</description>

      <title>An energy-stable minimal deformation rate scheme for mean curvature flow and surface diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new parametric finite element method, referred to as the BGN-MDR method, for simulating both mean curvature flow and surface diffusion for closed hypersurfaces, as well as open hypersurfaces with moving contact lines in three dimensions. The method is also applicable to closed and open curves with moving contact points in two dimensions. The proposed scheme inherits the energy stability from the BGN scheme proposed by Barrett, Garcke, and N\"urnberg in 2008, and offers improved mesh quality similar to the minimal deformation rate (MDR) method proposed by Hu and Li in 2022, especially for small time step sizes where the BGN scheme may become unstable and result in deteriorated meshes.</description>

      <title>ShyLU node: On-node Scalable Solvers and Preconditioners Recent Progresses and Current Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ShyLU-node is an open-source software package that implements linear solvers and preconditioners on shared-memory multicore CPUs or on a GPU. It is part of the Trilinos software framework and designed to provide a robust and efficient solution of large-scale linear systems from real-world applications on the current and emerging computers. In this paper, we discuss two sparse direct solvers, Basker and Tacho, and an algebraic preconditioner, FastILU, in ShyLU-node package. These ShyLU solvers and preconditioner can be used as a stand-alone global problem solver, as a local subdomain solver for domain decomposition (DD) preconditioner, or as the coarse-problem solver in algebraic multi-grid preconditioner. We present performance results with the sparse direct solvers for real application problems, namely, Basker for Xyce Circuit Simulations and Tacho for Albany Land-Ice Simulation of Antarctica. FastILU has been also used in real-world applications, but in this paper, we illustrate its performance using 3D model problems.</description>

      <title>PML method for the stochastic acoustic scattering problem driven by an additive Gaussian noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the time-domain stochastic acoustic scattering problem driven by a spatially white additive Gaussian noise. The main contributions of the work are twofold. First, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the pathwise solution to the scattering problem by applying an abstract Laplace transform inversion theorem. The analysis employs the black box scattering theory to investigate the meromorphic continuation of the Helmholtz resolvent defined on rough fields. Second, based on the piecewise constant approximation of the white noise, we construct an approximate wave solution and establish the error estimate. As a consequence, we develop a PML method and establish the convergence analysis with explicit dependence on the PML layer's thickness and medium properties, as well as the piecewise constant approximation of the white noise.</description>

      <title>A Fully Discrete Truly Multidimensional Active Flux Method For The Two-Dimensional Euler Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Active Flux method is a finite volume method for hyperbolic conservation laws that uses both cell averages and point values as degrees of freedom. Several versions of such methods are currently under development. We focus on third order accurate, fully discrete Active Flux methods with compact stencil in space and time. These methods require exact or approximate evolution operators for the update of the point value degrees of freedom which are provided by the method of bicharacteristics. Here we propose new limiting strategies that guarantee positivity of pressure and density and furthermore discuss the implementation of reflecting boundary conditions. Numerical results show that the method leads to accurate approximates on coarse grids.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of online algorithms for vector-valued kernel regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07779v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of approximating the regression function $f_\mu:\, \Omega \to Y$ from noisy $\mu$-distributed vector-valued data $(\omega_m,y_m)\in\Omega\times Y$ by an online learning algorithm using a reproducing kernel Hilbert space $H$ (RKHS) as prior. In an online algorithm, i.i.d. samples become available one by one via a random process and are successively processed to build approximations to the regression function. Assuming that the regression function essentially belongs to $H$ (soft learning scenario), we provide estimates for the expected squared error in the RKHS norm of the approximations $f^{(m)}\in H$ obtained by a standard regularized online approximation algorithm. In particular, we show an order-optimal estimate $$ \mathbb{E}(\|\epsilon^{(m)}\|_H^2)\le C (m+1)^{-s/(2+s)},\qquad m=1,2,\ldots, $$ where $\epsilon^{(m)}$ denotes the error term after $m$ processed data, the parameter $0&lt;s\leq 1$ expresses an additional smoothness assumption on the regression function, and the constant $C$ depends on the variance of the input noise, the smoothness of the regression function, and other parameters of the algorithm. The proof, which is inspired by results on Schwarz iterative methods in the noiseless case, uses only elementary Hilbert space techniques and minimal assumptions on the noise, the feature map that defines $H$ and the associated covariance operator.</description>

      <title>A kernel-based method for Schr\"odinger bridges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14522v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the Schr\"odinger bridge problems by a family of Mckean-Vlasov stochastic control problems with no terminal time distribution constraint. In doing so, we use the theory of Hilbert space embeddings of probability measures and then describe the constraint as penalty terms defined by the maximum mean discrepancy in the control problems. A sequence of the probability laws of the state processes resulting from $\epsilon$-optimal controls converges to a unique solution of the Schr\"odinger's problem under mild conditions on given initial and terminal time distributions and an underlying diffusion process. We propose a neural SDE based deep learning algorithm for the Mckean-Vlasov stochastic control problems. Several numerical experiments validate our methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Cover universal portfolio (UP from now on) has many interesting theoretical and numerical properties and was investigated for a long time. Building on it, we explore what happens when we add this UP to the market as a new synthetic asset and construct by recurrence higher order UPs. We investigate some important theoretical properties of the high order UPs and show in particular that they are indeed different from the Cover UP and are capable to break the time permutation invariance. We show that under some perturbation regime the second high order UP has better Sharp ratio than the standard UP and briefly investigate arbitrage opportunities thus created. Numerical experiences on a benchmark from the literature confirm that high order UPs improve Cover's UP performances.</description>

      <title>Regime-Aware Time Weighting for Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method to handle the time dimension when Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are used to solve time-dependent differential equations; our proposal focuses on how time sampling and weighting strategies affect solution quality. While previous methods proposed heuristic time-weighting schemes, our approach is grounded in theoretical insights derived from the Lyapunov exponents, which quantify the sensitivity of solutions to perturbations over time. This principled methodology automatically adjusts weights based on the stability regime of the system -- whether chaotic, periodic, or stable. Numerical experiments on challenging benchmarks, including the chaotic Lorenz system and the Burgers' equation, demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. Compared to existing techniques, our approach offers improved convergence and accuracy without requiring additional hyperparameter tuning. The findings underline the importance of incorporating causality and dynamical system behavior into PINN training strategies, providing a robust framework for solving time-dependent problems with enhanced reliability.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Filtering, Estimation and Classification using Neural Jump ODEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Jump ODEs model the conditional expectation between observations by neural ODEs and jump at arrival of new observations. They have demonstrated effectiveness for fully data-driven online forecasting in settings with irregular and partial observations, operating under weak regularity assumptions. This work extends the framework to input-output systems, enabling direct applications in online filtering and classification. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees for this approach, providing a robust solution to $L^2$-optimal filtering. Empirical experiments highlight the model's superior performance over classical parametric methods, particularly in scenarios with complex underlying distributions. These results emphasise the approach's potential in time-sensitive domains such as finance and health monitoring, where real-time accuracy is crucial.</description>

      <title>Sub-Sequential Physics-Informed Learning with State Space Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a kind of deep-learning-based numerical solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs). Existing PINNs often suffer from failure modes of being unable to propagate patterns of initial conditions. We discover that these failure modes are caused by the simplicity bias of neural networks and the mismatch between PDE's continuity and PINN's discrete sampling. We reveal that the State Space Model (SSM) can be a continuous-discrete articulation allowing initial condition propagation, and that simplicity bias can be eliminated by aligning a sequence of moderate granularity. Accordingly, we propose PINNMamba, a novel framework that introduces sub-sequence modeling with SSM. Experimental results show that PINNMamba can reduce errors by up to 86.3\% compared with state-of-the-art architecture. Our code is available at https://github.com/miniHuiHui/PINNMamba.</description>

      <title>Ensemble optimal control for managing drug resistance in cancer therapies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the application of ensemble optimal control to derive enhanced strategies for pharmacological cancer treatment. In particular, we focus on moving beyond the classical clinical approach of giving the patient the maximal tolerated drug dose (MTD), which does not properly exploit the fight among sensitive and resistant cells for the available resources. Here, we employ a Lotka-Volterra model to describe the two competing subpopulations, and we enclose this system within the ensemble control framework. In the first part, we establish general results suitable for application to various solid cancers. Then, we carry out numerical simulations in the setting of prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation therapy, yielding a computed policy that is reminiscent of the medical 'active surveillance' paradigm. Finally, inspired by the numerical evidence, we propose a variant of the celebrated adaptive therapy (AT), which we call 'Off-On' AT.</description>
