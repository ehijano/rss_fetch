      <title>On Compact Quasi-Einstein Metrics of Constant Scalar Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that all compact quasi-Einstein metrics of constant scalar curvature in dimension three are locally homogeneous. We accomplish this by using the equivalence of constant scalar curvature quasi-Einstein metrics $(M,g,X)$ and quasi-Einstein metrics with $X$ Killing in the compact case to make a connection to Sasakian geometry in dimension three. In higher dimensions, there are examples which are non-locally homogeneous with constant scalar curvature. Such examples were constructed by Kunduri-Lucietti as circle bundles over a compact K\"ahler-Einstein base. We then ask when compact quasi-Einstein metrics of constant scalar curvature can be constructed as circle bundles over Einstein metrics, and prove that the base must in fact be K\"ahler-Einstein, assuming a conjecture due to Goldberg. These spaces, in fact, admit one parameter families of quasi-Einstein metrics by considering the canonical variation, which we study further.</description>

      <title>Stability of Minkowski inequality for nearly spherical sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stability of Minkowski inequality for nearly spherical domains that are $C^1$ close to the ball. We show the stability inequalities between the positive part of the $\sigma_k$ curvature integrals for $C^1$ perturbations of a ball; we also establish the stability inequalities for axially symmetric $C^1$ perturbations of a ball. Finally, we construct a counterexample, illustrating that the inequalities become invalid if we do not compensate the integral with the negative part of the curvature. Our work generalizes Glaudo's results on the mean curvature integral to the fully nonlinear cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we classify $n$-dimensional ($n\geq 5$) quasi-Einstein manifolds with harmonic Weyl curvature, thus extending the work of Shin \cite{Shin} in dimension four for quasi-Einstein manifolds and refining the work of He-Petersen-Wylie \cite{HPW}. As a consequence, we provide new examples of quasi-Einstein manifolds which are neither locally conformally flat nor D-flat in the sense of \cite{CC12}.</description>

      <title>Inradius collapsed manifolds with a lower Ricci curvature bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a family of $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifolds with boundary having lower bounds on the Ricci curvatures of interior and boundary and on the second fundamental form of boundary. A sequence of manifolds in this family is said to be inradius collapsed if their inradii tend to zero. We prove that the limit space $C_0$ of boundaries of inradius collapsed manifolds admits an isometric involution $f$, and that the limit of the manifolds themselves is isometric to the quotient space $C_0/f$. As an application, we show that the number of boundary components of inradius collapsed manifolds is at most two. Moreover, we prove that the limit space has a lower Ricci curvature bound and an upper dimension bound in a synthetic sense if in addition their boundaries are non-collapsed.</description>

      <title>Heat coefficients of surfaces with curved conic singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a two-dimensional Riemannian manifold of finite diameter with a conical singularity. Under the assumption that the metric near the cone point $C$ is rotationally invariant, but not necessarily flat, we give an explicit formula for the coefficient $b_{1/2}(C)$ in the heat trace expansion $\operatorname{tr}(\operatorname{exp}(-t\Delta_g))\sim_{t\searrow0} (4\pi t)^{-1}\sum_{j=0}^\infty a_j(M) t^j+\sum_{j=0}^\infty b_{j/2}(C)t^{j/2}+\sum_{j=0}^\infty c_{j/2}(C) t^{j/2} \log t$. In the case that the Gaussian curvature $K$ of $(M,g)$ satisfies $|K(p)|\to\infty$ as $p\to C$, we show that $b_{1/2}(C)$ varies irrationally under constant rescalings of the distance circles near the cone point. This is a sharp contrast to the behavior of $b_0(C)$ and of those coefficients $b_j(C)$ which appear in certain known formulas in the case of orbifold cone points or corners of geodesic polygons.</description>

      <title>Oriented Grassmannian Bundle, Normal Curvature Reduction, and Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a smooth closed orientable submanifold $M \subset \mathbb{R}^D$ with narrow cycles. We embed $M$ into a scaled oriented Grassmannian bundle via the Gauss map in order to enlarge the scale of these cycles. Under mild assumptions, we show that this embedding reduces the normal curvature of the embedded submanifold in directions where the original normal curvature is large. For smooth closed hypersurfaces, we further show that this construction increases the distance between antipodal points of narrow cycles for fixed volume.
  We then obtain an explicit range of radii for which the ambient \v{C}ech complex on this Grassmannian bundle is homotopy equivalent to the embedded manifold, yielding lower bounds on the scales at which the \v{C}ech filtration recovers the homology of $M$. Since the distance induced by the embedding depends on both positions and oriented tangent spaces, we work with Whitney $C^1$ convergence of embeddings and prove that the associated \v{C}ech persistent homology is stable with respect to the interleaving distance. Finally, we describe a procedure for computing a distance matrix for a finite subset with respect to this embedding and illustrate the construction on several examples, including an approximate quasi-halo orbit in the Saturn--Enceladus system.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of the torsion-curvature pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On smooth manifolds of dimension $n \ge 4$, we prove that the torsion and curvature are, up to a scalar factor, the only pair of a vector-valued 2-form and an endomorphism-valued 2-form naturally associated with a linear connection that satisfy both the linear and differential Bianchi identities.
  This result extends to arbitrary linear connections a recent characterisation of the curvature tensor of a symmetric linear connection obtained in the paper "On the uniqueness of the torsion and curvature operators", Rev. R. Acad. Cienc. Exactas Fis. Nat. Ser. A Mat. RACSAM, 114, 2020.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the notion of $\text{Poisson-algebra}$ distributions on $\text{F-manifolds}$ and establishes a corresponding splitting theorem for these structures. We then specialize to the case of $\text{F-Lie}$ groups. In this specialized setting, we construct a canonical connection induced by the underlying $\text{F}_\text{man}-\text{algebra}$ structure and proceed to study the associated holonomy Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity of Perelman $\mathcal{W}$-Entropy of Mean Curvature Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Perelman' s $ \mathcal{W}$ entropy for mean curvature flow in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Analogously to Perelman's $\mathcal{W}$-entropy defined for Ricci flow, K. Ecker in \cite{Ecker07} defined a functional $\mathcal{W}$ for the mean curvature flow in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ and the region it encloses, and made the conjecture that this functional is monotonically increasing in time. We modify K. Ecker's definition and, using Hamilton's Harnack inequality for mean curvature flow, prove that our redefined $\mathcal{W}$-entropy is monotonically decreasing in time. Additionally, we provide a rigidity theorem for this $\mathcal{W}$-entropy.</description>

      <title>The characteristic group of Lie LCP manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The (reduced) characteristic group of a locally conformally product manifold is obtained by restricting the action of its fundamental group to the non-flat factor of the universal cover, and taking the connected component of the identity in the closure of this restriction. It was shown by Kourganoff that this group is abelian, but it is currently unknown whether it is simply connected, or might have compact (toric) factors. This question is crucial for a better understanding of LCP structure, as shown recently by B. Flamencourt. In this paper we consider Lie LCP structures (which are defined on quotients of simply connected Lie groups by lattices) and show that the reduced characteristic group of any Lie LCP manifold $\Gamma\backslash G$ is contained in the radical of $G$, so in particular is simply connected.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalise the notions of scalar-valued holomorphic $p$-contact and $s$-symplectic structures introduced recently on compact complex manifolds by the second-named author jointly with H. Kasuya and L. Ugarte to their analogues with values in a holomorphic line bundle. We then study the resulting holomorphic $p$-contact and $s$-symplectic manifolds which, unlike their scalar counterparts that are never K\"ahler, can even be projective. In particular, we investigate the (lack of) positivity properties of the canonical bundle of these manifolds when it is given a possibly singular Hermitian fibre metric. One of the tools used is a very recent regularisation result for $m$-psh functions obtained jointly by S. Dinew and the second-named author.</description>

      <title>Ricci-DeTurck flow of almost continuous $L^2$-metrics, and metrics with distributional scalar curvature bounded from below</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Riemannian manifolds $(M^n,g_0)$, $(M^n,h)$, where $(M^n,h)$ is smooth, complete, with curvature bounded in absolute value by $K_0 &lt; \infty$, and $(1-\varepsilon_0(n)) h \leq g_0 \leq (1+\varepsilon_0(n)) h$ for some small $\varepsilon_0(n)&gt;0$. It was shown by Simon (2002) that a Ricci-DeTurck flow solution $g(t)_{t \in (0,T)}$ related to $g_0$ exists for some $T=T(n,K_0)&gt;0$. If $g_0 \in L^2_{\mathrm{loc}}$ or $g_0 \in W^{1,2+2\sigma}_{\mathrm{loc}}$, $\sigma \in (0,\frac{1}{4})$, respectively, we show that $g(t) \to g_0$ in the $L^2_{\mathrm{loc}}$- or $W^{1,2+\sigma}_{\mathrm{loc}}$-sense, respectively. If $M$ is closed, $g_0 \in W^{1,2+\sigma}(M)$ for some $\sigma&gt;0$, and the distributional scalar curvature of Lee-LeFloch (2015) is not less than $b \in \mathbb{R}$, then we show that $g(t)$ has scalar curvature not less than $b$ in the smooth sense for all $t&gt;0$.</description>

Abstract: This paper addresses the fundamental question of constructing exponential families from statistical manifolds. We show that every compact statistical manifold admits a singular foliation whose leaves are Hessian manifolds. Moreover, any non-flat, compact, orientable 3-dimensional leaf appears as a quotient of an exponential family and has only odd Betti.</description>

      <title>Lindblad Quantum Dynamics as Euler-Poincar\'e Reduction on Adjoint-Coupled Semidirect Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a geometric and variational derivation of the Gorini--Kossakowski--Sudarshan--Lindblad equation from Euler--Poincar'e reduction on an adjoint--coupled semidirect product (ACSP). In this construction a Lie group $G$ acts on $V=\mathfrak{g}^{\oplus m}$ by the adjoint representation together with a second, adjointly compatible action whose failure to commute defines an adjoint torsion $K(\xi,v)$. This torsion generates a canonical quadratic curvature operator on $\mathfrak{g}^*$ that survives reduction and yields a metric double--bracket term. For $G=SU(n)$ the reduced Euler--Poincar'e equation reproduces exactly the GKSL generator: the Hamiltonian part arises from the coadjoint action, while the dissipator $-\tfrac{\gamma}{2}[L,[L,\rho]]$ appears as the torsion--induced metric component of an ACSP bracket. We prove a characterization theorem showing that any quadratic $SU(n)$--equivariant operator generated by torsion factorizes into a Lindblad double commutator; a uniqueness theorem establishing that, under natural structural assumptions, the only admissible dissipator is the Lindblad form; and an orbit--contraction theorem showing strict contraction toward the commutant of the Lindblad operators. For $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ the ACSP geometry yields explicit Bloch equations for representative dissipative channels. We also show that the ACSP bracket fits into a metriplectic and contact--geometric framework in which the Lindblad term is the metric component and the Reeb part of a contact Hamiltonian flow. In this picture, decoherence is a curvature--induced contraction generated by Euler--Poincar'e reduction rather than a phenomenological input.</description>

      <title>Shortest k-Geodesics on Hyperbolic Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between the lengths of closed geodesics on hyperbolic surfaces and their topological complexity, measured by the self-intersection number. In particular, we provide explicit upper bounds for the length $s_k(X)$ of a shortest closed geodesic with exactly $k$ self-intersections in terms of the length $L_\textswab{8}(X)$ of a shortest figure eight curve, improving Basmajian's estimate. We analyze the geometry of a shortest figure eight curve and explicitly build families of words in $\pi_1(X)$ whose geodesic representatives realize prescribed self-intersection numbers. As a consequence, we improve existing estimates on the maximal self-intersection number $I_k(X)$ of shortest geodesics with at least $k$ self-intersections, reducing the asymptotic upper bound from 512 to 128. This provides a sharper quantitative connection between the geometry and combinatorial complexity of non-simple closed geodesics on hyperbolic surfaces.</description>

Abstract: We prove that if a geodesic flow on a closed orientable $C^\infty$ surface is transitive and has positive topological entropy, then it has a unique measure of maximal entropy. This covers all previous results of the literature on the uniqueness of the measure of maximal entropy in this context, as well as it applies to new examples such as the ones constructed by Donnay and Burns-Donnay. We also prove that, in the above context, there is at most one SRB measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a Tannaka duality statement for geometric stacks in the setting of analytic stacks modelled on globally finitely presented Stein spaces. The key ingredient is the theory of liquid vector spaces and liquid quasicoherent sheaves of Clausen-Scholze. As an application, we reconstruct the topological fundamental group of any complex algebraic variety from its category of liquid local systems. We also reconstruct a series of "twisted fundamental groupoids" whose representations correspond to meromorphic flat connections on the complex affine line with logarithmic or irregular singularities at the origin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the superalgebra of derivations generated by the fundamental forms on manifolds with reduced structure group. In particular, we point out a relation between the algebra of derivations of heterotic geometries that admit Killing spinors and the commutator algebra of holonomy symmetries in sigma models. We use this to propose a Lie bracket on the space of fundamental forms of all heterotic geometries with a non-compact holonomy group and present the associated derivation algebras. We also explore the extension of these results to heterotic geometries with compact holonomy groups and, more generally, to manifolds with reduced structure group. A brief review of the classification of heterotic geometries that admit Killing spinors and an extension of this classification to some heterotic inspired geometries are also included.</description>

      <title>Duals of Higher Vector Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of ``$n$-dual'' to a simplicial vector space for $n\ge 0$. Coming with it, there is a canonical pairing, which we show to be non-degenerate up to homotopy for homotopy $n$-types. As a result this notion of duality is reflexive up to homotopy for $n$-types. In particular the same properties hold for $n$-groupoid objects in vector spaces, whose $n$-duals are again such $n$-groupoid objects. We study this construction in the context of the Dold-Kan correspondence and we reformulate the Eilenberg-Zilber theorem, which classically controls monoidality of the Dold-Kan functors, in terms of internal homs. We compute explicitly the 1-dual of a groupoid object and the 2-dual of a 2-groupoid object in the category of vector spaces. As the 1-dual of a groupoid object, we recover its dual as a $\mathsf{VB}$ groupoid over a point.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-timelike loops in signature changing semi-Riemannian manifolds with a transverse radical</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02403v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1983, Hartle and Hawking proposed the no-boundary proposal, suggesting that the universe has no beginning in the sense of a spacetime singularity or boundary. Nevertheless, there is an origin of time. Mathematically, this involves signature-type changing manifolds in which a Riemannian region smoothly transitions to a Lorentzian region across the hypersurface $\mathcal{H}$ where time begins.
  We develop a coherent framework for signature changing manifolds with a degenerate yet smooth metric. Established Lorentzian tools and results are then adapted to this setting, and new definitions are introduced that carry unforeseen causal implications. A noteworthy consequence is the presence of locally time-reversing loops through every point on the hypersurface. Imposing global hyperbolicity on the Lorentzian region, we prove that for every point $p \in M$ there exists a pseudo-timelike loop self-intersecting at $p$. Equivalently, $M$ always admits a closed pseudo-timelike path around which the time direction reverses, preventing any consistent distinction between future- and past-directed vectors. To an observer near $\mathcal{H}$, such loops may appear as the creation of a particle-antiparticle pair at two distinct points.</description>

Abstract: In this article we show that generally almost regular flows, introduced by Bamler and Kleiner, in closed 3-manifolds will either go extinct in finite time or flow to a collection of smooth embedded minimal surfaces, possibly with multiplicity. Using a perturbative argument then we construct piecewise almost regular flows which either go extinct in finite time or flow to a stable minimal surface, possibly with multiplicity. We apply these results to construct minimal surfaces in 3-manifolds in a variety of circumstances, mainly novel from the point of the view that the arguments are via parabolic methods.</description>

      <title>Foliations by critical surfaces of the Hawking energy in asymptotically flat initial data sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Area-constrained critical surfaces for the Hawking quasi-local energy ("Hawking surfaces") provide a natural setting for that energy: they enjoy positivity and rigidity properties. We construct large-scale foliations at infinity by Hawking surfaces in asymptotically Schwarzschild initial data sets. Using a Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction within a Willmore-foliation framework, we prove existence and uniqueness of the foliation and study its coordinate center. Under the dominant energy condition, we show that along the leaves of the foliation, the Hawking energy is positive and converges to the ADM energy in the large-sphere limit; moreover, subject to an explicit integral constraint, it is monotone along the foliation. Under weaker assumptions we construct an on-center family of Hawking surfaces that, while not necessarily a foliation, still enjoys positivity and the large-sphere limit. Finally, we obtain a rigidity statement and verify that our hypotheses hold in a broad class of data, initial data sets with harmonic or York asymptotics, thereby demonstrating the robustness of Hawking surfaces as a quasi-local energy tool in dynamical spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that all Riemannian manifolds $(M, g, H)$ that admit a connection $\hat\nabla$ with torsion a 3-form $H$, which is both closed $d H=0$ and $\hat\nabla$-covariantly constant, are locally isometric to a product $N\times G$, where $G$ is a semisimple group and $N$ is a Riemannian manifold with $\iota_V H=0$ for all tangent vectors $V \in T_pN\subset T_pM$, $p\in M$. If $M$ is simply connected and complete, then by the de Rham theorem $M=N\times G$ globally. We use this to simplify the proof of similar results for strong KT, CYT and HKT manifolds that obey the above hypotheses and extend them to strong $G_2$ and $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$ manifolds with torsion. As an application, we describe the geometry of all complete and simply connected $G_2$ and $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$ manifolds whose torsion satisfies the above conditions.
  We also demonstrate that all compact 8-dimensional manifolds with strong HKT structure are locally isometric to one of the following: 8-dimensional hyper-K\"ahler; $SU(3)$ equipped with the bi-invariant metric and 3-form; or the product $(U(1)\times SU(2))\times B^4$, where $B^4$ is either a hyper-K\"ahler manifold or $U(1)\times SU(2)$ equipped with an HKT structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.15838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new, physical-space-based method for deriving the precise leading-order late-time behaviour of solutions to geometric wave equations on asymptotically flat spacetime backgrounds and apply it to the setting of wave equations with asymptotically inverse-square potentials on Schwarzschild black holes. This provides a useful toy model setting for introducing methods that are applicable to more general linear and nonlinear geometric wave equations, such as wave equations for electromagnetically charged scalar fields, wave equations on extremal Kerr black holes and geometric wave equations in even space dimensions, where existing proofs for deriving precise late-time asymptotics might not apply. The method we introduce relies on exploiting the spatial decay properties of time integrals of solutions to derive the existence and precise genericity properties of asymptotic late-time tails and obtain sharp, uniform decay estimates in time.</description>

Abstract: Gushel-Mukai manifolds are specific families of $n$-dimensional Fano manifolds of Picard rank $1$ and index $n-2$ where $3\leq n \leq 6$. A Gushel-Mukai $n$-fold is either ordinary, i.e. a hyperquadric section of a quintic Del Pezzo $(n+1)$-fold, or special, i.e. it admits a double cover over the quintic Del Pezzo $n$-fold branched along an ordinary Gushel-Mukai $(n-1)$-fold. In this paper, we prove that a general special Gushel-Mukai $n$-fold is K-stable for every $3\leq n\leq 6$. Furthermore, we give a description of the first and last walls of the K-moduli of the pair $(M,cQ)$, where $M$ is the quintic Del Pezzo fourfold (or fivefold) and $Q$ is an ordinary Gushel-Mukai threefold (or fourfold). Besides, we compute $\delta$-invariants of quintic Del Pezzo fourfolds and fivefolds which were shown to be K-unstable by K. Fujita, and show that they admit K\"ahler-Ricci solitons.</description>

Abstract: Inequalities between Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues of the Laplacian and of other differential operators have been intensively studied in the past decades. The aim of this paper is to introduce differential forms and the de Rham complex in the study of such inequalities. We show how differential forms lie hidden at the heart of the work of Rohleder on inequalities between Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues for the Laplacian on planar domains. Moreover, we extend the ideas of Rohleder to a new proof of Friedlander's inequality for any bounded Lipschitz domain.</description>

Abstract: Given a conformal action of a discrete group on a Riemann surface, we study the maximization of Laplace and Steklov eigenvalues within a conformal class, considering metrics invariant under the group action. We establish natural conditions for the existence and regularity of maximizers. Our method simplifies previously known techniques for proving existence and regularity results in conformal class optimization. Finally, we provide a complete solution to the equivariant maximization problem for Laplace eigenvalues on the sphere and Steklov eigenvalues on the disk, resolving open questions posed by Arias-Marco et al. (2024) regarding the sharpness of the Hersch-Payne-Schiffer inequality and the maximization of Steklov eigenvalues by the standard disk among planar simply connected domains with $n\text{-rotational}$ symmetry.</description>

Abstract: This paper develops a theory of $C^\infty$-superrings and their associated $C^\infty$-superschemes. We prove a key equivalence between the category of fair affine $C^\infty$-superschemes and the category of fair $C^\infty$-superrings. We place special emphasis on split $C^\infty$-superrings, which generalize the function algebras of supermanifolds and serve as building blocks for more complex, non-split structures.</description>

      <title>Atoms meet symbols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for constructing invariants in $G$-equivariant birational geometry by unifying two recent approaches: the \emph{theory of atoms} recently developed by Katzarkov, Kontsevich, Pantev, and Yu, and the theory of \emph{modular symbols} due to Kontsevich, Tschinkel, and Pestun.
  We initiate the theory of Chen-Ruan atoms. Assuming the blowup formula for the quantum Chen-Ruan cohomology, we outline how to extend the theory of atoms to global quotient orbifolds and present some striking applications.
  In addition, we develop a separate class of purely geometric invariants for $\mathbb{Z}/2$- and $\mathbb{Z}/3$-actions on surfaces and threefolds.
  We provide many examples of non-$G$-linearizable $G$-actions on projective varieties treated with these new techniques.</description>

      <title>Localization of valuations and Alesker's irreducibility theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a new proof of Alesker's Irreducibility Theorem. We first introduce a new localization technique for polynomial valuations on convex bodies, which we use to independently prove that smooth and translation invariant valuations are representable by integration with respect to the normal cycle. This allows us to reduce the statement to a corresponding result for the representation of $\mathfrak{sl}(n)$ on the space of these differential forms.</description>
