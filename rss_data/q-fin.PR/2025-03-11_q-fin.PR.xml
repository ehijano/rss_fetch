      <title>No Fear of Discounting How to Manage the Transition from EONIA to ESTR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important step in the Financial Benchmarks Reform was taken on 13th September 2018, when the ECB Working Group on Euro Risk-Free Rates recommended the Euro Short-Term Rate ESTR as the new benchmark rate for the euro area, to replace the Euro OverNight Index Average (EONIA) which will be discontinued at the end of 2021. This transition has a number of important consequences on financial instruments, OTC derivatives in particular.
  In this paper we show in detail how the switch from EONIA to ESTR affects the pricing of OIS, IRS and XVAs. We conclude that the adoption of the "clean discounting" approach recommended by the the ECB, based on ESTR only, is theoretically sound and leads to very limited impacts on financial valuations.
  This finding ensures the possibility, for the financial industry, to switch all EUR OTC derivatives, either cleared with Central Counterparties, or subject to bilateral collateral agreements, or non-collateralised, in a safe and consistent manner. The transition to such EONIA-free pricing framework is essential for the complete elimination of EONIA before its discontinuation scheduled on 31st December 2021.</description>

      <title>Option Pricing with Time-Varying Volatility Risk Aversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.06943v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a pricing kernel with time-varying volatility risk aversion to explain observed time variations in the shape of the pricing kernel. When combined with the Heston-Nandi GARCH model, this framework yields a tractable option pricing model in which the variance risk ratio (VRR) emerges as a key variable. We show that the VRR is closely linked to economic fundamentals, as well as sentiment and uncertainty measures. A novel approximation method provides analytical option pricing formulas, and we demonstrate substantial reductions in pricing errors through an empirical application to the S&amp;P 500 index, the CBOE VIX, and option prices.</description>

      <title>On short-time behavior of implied volatility in a market model with indexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16509v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates short-term behaviors of implied volatility of derivatives written on indexes in equity markets when the index processes are constructed by using a ranking procedure. Even in simple market settings where stock prices follow geometric Brownian motion dynamics, the ranking mechanism can produce the observed term structure of at-the-money (ATM) implied volatility skew for equity indexes. Our proposed models showcase the ability to reconcile two seemingly contradictory features found in empirical data from equity markets: the long memory of volatilities and the power law of ATM skews. Furthermore, the models allow for the capture of a new phenomenon termed the quasi-blow-up phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Risk-Neutral Pricing Model of Uniswap Liquidity Providing Position: A Stopping Time Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12375v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel pricing model for Uniswap V3, built upon stochastic processes and the Martingale Stopping Theorem. This model innovatively frames the valuation of positions within Uniswap V3. We further conduct a numerical analysis and examine the sensitivities through Greek risk measures to elucidate the model's implications. The results underscore the model's significant academic contribution and its practical applicability for Uniswap liquidity providers, particularly in assessing risk exposure and guiding hedging strategies.</description>
