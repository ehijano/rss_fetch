      <title>Complex Analytic Structure of Stationary Flows of an Ideal Incompressible Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we introduce the structure of an analytic Banach manifold in the set of stationary flows without stagnation points of the ideal incompressible fluid in a periodic 2-d channel bounded by the curves $y=f(x)$ and $y=g(x)$ where $f, g$ are periodic analytic functions. The work is based on the recent discovery (Serfati, Shnirelman, Frisch, and others) that for the stationary flows the level lines of the stream function (and hence the flow lines) are real-analytic curves. The set of such functions is not a linear subspace of any reasonable function space. However, we are able to introduce in this set a structure of a real-analytic Banach manifold if we regard its elements as collections of level lines parametrized by the function value. If $\psi(x,y)$ is the stream function, then the flow line has equation $y=a(x,\psi)$ where $a(\cdot,\cdot)$ is a "partially analytic" function. This means that this function is analytic in the first argument while it has a finite regularity in the second one. We define the spaces of analytic functions on the line, analogous to the Hardy space, and the spaces of partially analytic functions. The equation $\Delta\psi=F(\psi)$ is transformed into a quasilinear equation $\Phi(a)=F$ for the function $a(x,\psi)$. Using the Analytic Implicit Function Theorem in the complex Banach space, we are able to prove that for the functions $f(x), g(x)$ close to constant the solution $a(x,\psi; F, f, g)$ exists and depends analytically on parameters $F, f, g$.</description>

      <title>Mass-Conserving Self-Similar Solutions to Collision-Induced Breakage Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existence of mass-conserving self-similar solutions to collision-induced breakage equation is shown for a specific class of homogeneous collision kernels and breakage functions. The proof mainly relies on a dynamical approach and compactness method to constructing mass-conserving stationary solutions for an evolution problem, which induces mass-conserving self-similar solutions to collision-induced breakage equation. Furthermore, we also determine lower and upper bound of the scaling profile.</description>

      <title>A nonlocal diffusion single population model in advective environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to a nonlocal reaction-diffusion-advection model that describes the spatial dynamics of freshwater organisms in a river with a directional motion. Our goal is to investigate how the advection rate affects the dynamic behaviors of species. We first establish the well-posedness of global solutions, where the regularized problem containing a viscosity term and the re-established maximum principle play an important role. And we then show the existence/nonexistence, uniqueness, and stability of nontrivial stationary solutions by analyzing the principal eigenvalue of integro-differential operator (especially studying the monotonicity of the principal eigenvalue with respect to the advection rate), which enables us to understand the longtime behaviors of solutions and obtain the sharp criteria for persistence or extinction. Furthermore, we study the limiting behaviors of solutions with respect to the advection rate and find that the sufficiently large directional motion will cause species extinction in all situations. Lastly, the numerical simulations verify our theoretical proofs.</description>

      <title>The second order Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg identities and inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on optimal constants and optimizers of the second order Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequalities. Firstly, we aim to study optimal constants and optimizers for the following second order Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality in radial space: let $N\ge1$, $t\ge p&gt;1$, \begin{equation}\label{0.1} \left(\int_{\mathbb{R}^N} \frac{|\Delta u|^p}{|x|^{p\alpha}} \mathrm{d}x\right)^{\frac{1}{p}} \left[\int_{\mathbb{R}^N} \frac{\left|\nabla u\right|^{\frac{p(t-1)}{p-1}}} {|x|^{\frac{p(t-1)}{p-1}\beta}} \mathrm{d}x\right]^{\frac{p-1}{p}} \ge C(N,p,t,\alpha,\beta) \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} \frac{\left|\nabla u\right|^t}{|x|^{t\gamma}} \mathrm{d}x. \end{equation} Secondly, we establish second order $L^p$-Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg identities, and obtain optimal constants and optimizers of the second order $L^p$-Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequalities (i.e., $p=t$ in \eqref{0.1}) in general space. Lastly, under some more general assumptions, we consider the optimal weighted second order Heisenberg Uncertainty Principles, which complements the recent work [``The sharp second order Caffareli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality and stability estimates for the sharp second order uncertainty principle'', 2022, arXiv:2102.01425].
  This paper's main novelty lies in the fact that we research the optimal versions of the second order Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequalities \eqref{0.1} in radial space or in general space, and also establish the second order $L^p$-Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg identities.</description>

      <title>Stability estimate for the discrete Calderon problem from partial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the analysis of discrete versions of the Calderon problem with partial boundary data in dimension d &gt;= 3. In particular, we establish logarithmic stability estimates for the discrete Calderon problem on an arbitrarily small portion of the boundary under suitable a priori bounds. For this end, we will use CGO solutions and derive a new discrete Carleman estimate and a key unique continuation estimate. Unlike the continuous case, we use a new strategy inspired by [32] to prove the key discrete unique continuation estimate by utilizing the new Carleman estimate with boundary observations for a discrete Laplace operator.</description>

      <title>Payne nodal set conjecture for the fractional $p$-Laplacian in Steiner symmetric domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $u$ be either a second eigenfunction of the fractional $p$-Laplacian or a least energy nodal solution of the equation $(-\Delta)^s_p \, u = f(u)$ with superhomogeneous and subcritical nonlinearity $f$, in a bounded open set $\Omega$ and under the nonlocal zero Dirichlet conditions. Assuming only that $\Omega$ is Steiner symmetric, we show that the supports of positive and negative parts of $u$ touch $\partial\Omega$. As a consequence, the nodal set of $u$ has the same property whenever $\Omega$ is connected. The proof is based on the analysis of equality cases in certain polarization inequalities involving positive and negative parts of $u$, and on alternative characterizations of second eigenfunctions and least energy nodal solutions.</description>

      <title>Uniform regularity estimates for nonlinear diffusion-advection equations in the hard-congestion limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present regularity results for nonlinear drift-diffusion equations of porous medium type (together with their incompressible limit). We relax the assumptions imposed on the drift term with respect to previous results and additionally study the effect of linear diffusion on our regularity result (a scenario of particular interest in the incompressible case, for it represents the motion of particles driven by a Brownian motion subject to a density constraint). Specifically, this work concerns the $L^4$-summability of the pressure gradient in porous medium flows with drifts that is stable with respect to the exponent of the nonlinearity, and $L^2$-estimates on the pressure Hessian (in particular, in the incompressible case with linear diffusion we prove that the pressure is the positive part of an $H^2$-function).</description>

      <title>An overdetermined Neumann boundary with a nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence of a family of non trivial compact subdomains $\O$ in the manifold $\mathcal{M}=\R^N\times \R/2\pi\Z$ for which the overdetermined Neumann boundary value problem
  \begin{align}\label{Neumann1}
  \left \{
  \begin{aligned}
  -\D w&amp;=\mu |w|^{p-2}w &amp;&amp; \qquad \text{in $ \Omega$,}
  \frac{\partial w}{\partial\eta} &amp;=0 &amp;&amp;\qquad \text{on $\partial \Omega,$}
  w&amp;=c\ne 0 &amp;&amp;\qquad \text{on $\partial \Omega$,}
  \end{aligned}
  \right. \end{align}
  admits solutions for some $\mu &gt; 0$ and $2&lt;p&lt;2^{*}=\frac{2N}{N-2}$ if $N\geq 3$ or $p&gt;2$ if $N=2$. The domains we construct have nonconstant principal curvature, and therefore are not isoparametric nor homogeneous. By this, we establish a non-linear analogue of a recent result obtained by Fall, Weth and the first named author in \cite{Fall-MinlendI-Weth4}, where the overdetermined Neumann eigenvalue problem for the Laplacian was considered.</description>

      <title>On uniqueness of KP soliton structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili II (KP) model placed in $\mathbb R_t \times \mathbb R_{x,y}^2$, in the case of smooth data that are not necessarily in a Sobolev space. In this paper, the subclass of smooth solutions we study is of ``soliton type'', characterized by a phase $\Theta=\Theta(t,x,y)$ and a unidimensional profile $F$. In particular, every classical KP soliton and multi-soliton falls into this category with suitable $\Theta$ and $F$. We establish concrete characterizations of KP solitons by means of a natural set of nonlinear differential equations and inclusions of functionals of Wronskian, Airy and Heat types, among others. These functional equations only depend on the new variables $\Theta$ and $F$. A distinct characteristic of this set of functionals is its special and rigid structure tailored to the considered soliton. By analyzing $\Theta$ and $F$, we establish the uniqueness of line-solitons, multi-solitons, and other degenerate solutions among a large class of KP solutions. Our results are also valid for other 2D dispersive models such as the quadratic and cubic Zakharov-Kuznetsov equations.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic profiles for Choquard equations with general critical nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study asymptotic behavior of positive ground state solutions for the nonlinear Choquard equation: \begin{equation}\label{0.1} -\Delta u+\varepsilon u=\big(I_{\alpha}\ast F(u)\big)F'(u),\quad u\in H^1(\mathbb R^N), \end{equation} where $F(u)=|u|^{\frac{N+\alpha}{N-2}}+G(u)$, $N\geq3$ is an integer, $I_{\alpha}$ is the Riesz potential of order $\alpha\in(0,N)$, and $\varepsilon&gt;0$ is a parameter. Under some mild subcritical growth assumptions on $G(u)$, we show that as $\varepsilon \to \infty$, the ground state solutions of \eqref{0.1}, after a suitable rescaling, converge to a particular solution of the critical Choquard equation $-\Delta u=\frac{N+\alpha}{N-2}(I_{\alpha}*|u|^{\frac{N+\alpha}{N-2}})|u|^{\frac{N+\alpha}{N-2}-2}u$. We establish a novel sharp asymptotic characterisation of such a rescaling, which depends in a non-trivial way on the asymptotic behavior of $G(u)$ at infinity and the space dimension $N=3$, $N=4$ or $N\geq5$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior for the fast diffusion equation with absorption and singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the weak solution for the fast diffusion equation with absorption and singularity in the form of $u_t=\triangle u^m -u^p$. We first prove the existence and decay estimate of weak solution when the fast diffusion index satisfies $0&lt;m&lt;1$ and the absorption index is $p&gt;1$. Then we show the asymptotic convergence of weak solution to the corresponding Barenblatt solution for $\frac{n-1}{n}&lt;m&lt;1$ and $p&gt;m+\frac{2}{n}$ via the entropy dissipation method combining the generalized Shannon's inequality and Csisz$\mathrm{\acute{a}}$r-Kullback inequality. The singularity of spatial diffusion causes us the technical challenges for the asymptotic behavior of weak solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the regularity for viscosity solutions of locally uniformly elliptic equations and obtain a series of interior pointwise $C^{k,\alpha}$ ($k\geq 1$, $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$) regularity with smallness assumptions on the solution and the right-hand term. As applications, we obtain various interior pointwise regularity for several classical elliptic equations, i.e., the prescribed mean curvature equation, the Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation, the $k$-Hessian equations, the $k$-Hessian quotient equations and the Lagrangian mean curvature equation. Moreover, the smallness assumptions are necessary in most cases (Remark 2.6, Remark 3.5, Remark 4.7, Remark 5.4 and Remark 6.5).</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we obtain the interior pointwise $C^{k,\alpha}$ ($k\geq 0$, $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$) regularity for weak solutions of elliptic and parabolic equations in divergence form. The compactness method and perturbation technique are employed. The pointwise regularity is proved in a very simple way and the results are optimal. In addition, these pointwise regularity can be used to characterize the structure of the nodal sets of solutions.</description>

      <title>Improved convergence rates for the Hele-Shaw limit in the presence of confining potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays a vast literature is available on the Hele-Shaw or incompressible limit for nonlinear degenerate diffusion equations. This problem has attracted a lot of attention due to its applications to tissue growth and crowd motion modelling as it constitutes a way to link soft congestion (or compressible) models to hard congestion (or incompressible) descriptions. In this paper, we address the question of estimating the rate of this asymptotics in the presence of external drifts. In particular, we provide improved results in the 2-Wasserstein distance which are global in time thanks to the contractivity property that holds for strictly convex potentials.</description>

Abstract: We derive explicit solutions for time-fractional anomalous diffusion equations with diffusivity coefficients that depend on both space and time variables. These solutions are expressed in Fox-H and generalized Wright functions, which are commonly used in anomalous diffusion equations. Our study represents a significant advancement in our understanding of anomalous diffusion with potential applications in a wide range of fields.</description>

      <title>A Sharp condition on global wellposedness of Chern-Simon-Shr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we derive a sharp condition on the mass of the initial data for the global existence of the Chern-Simon-Shr\"odinger equation. As a corollary, we prove that if the strength of interaction is less than the Bogomolny bound, then, for a large enough mass of initial data, there exists a globally defined solution. On the other hand, for the interactions which are above the Bogomolny bound, the critical mass condition on the initial data for the global existence depends on the strength of the self-interacting field. Then, we show that the states with the initial critical mass and zero energy are standing wave solutions and globally well-posed. Moreover, they are static if the self-interacting field is large enough and non-static for small self-interacting field.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Navier-Stokes-Fourier-Poisson system driven by an inhomogeneous temperature distribution on the boundary of an exterior fluid domain. We impose the finite mass constraint, positive far field condition for the temperature as well as the no--slip boundary conditions for the velocity. The existence of global--in--time weak solutions and the weak-strong principle are proved.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a system of heterogeneously interacting quantum particles subject to indirect continuous measurement. The interaction is assumed to be of the mean-field type. We derive a new limiting quantum graphon system, prove the well-posedness of this system, and establish a stability result.</description>

      <title>Existence of stationary vortex patches for the gSQG in bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show the existence of time-periodic vortex patches for the generalized surface quasi-geostrophic equation within a bounded domain. This construction is carried out for values of $\gamma$ in the range of $(1,2)$. The resulting vortex patches possess a fixed vorticity and total flux, and they are located in the neighborhood of critical points that are non-degenerate for the Kirchhoff--Routh equation. The proof is accomplished through a combination of analyzing the linearization of the contour dynamics equation and employing the implicit function theorem as well as carefully selected function spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortices produce locally concentrated field configurations and are solutions to the nonlinear partial differential equations systems of complicated structures. In this paper, we establish the existence and uniqueness for solutions of the gauged non-Abelian vortices in a coupled 4D-2D quantum field theory by researching the nonlinear elliptic equations systems with exponential terms in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ using the calculus of variations. In addition, we obtain the asymptotic behavior of the solutions at infinity and the quantized integrals in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$.</description>

      <title>The obstacle problem for linear scalar conservation laws with constant velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, we present a novel approach for solving the obstacle problem for (linear) conservation laws. Usually, given a conservation law with an initial datum, the solution is uniquely determined. How to incorporate obstacles, i.e., inequality constraints on the solution so that the resulting solution is still "physically reasonable" and obeys the obstacle, is unclear. The proposed approach involves scaling down the velocity of the conservation law when the solution approaches the obstacle. We demonstrate that this leads to a reasonable solution and show that, when scaling down is performed in a discontinuous fashion, we still obtain a suitable velocity - and the solution satisfying a discontinuous conservation law. We illustrate the developed solution concept using numerical approximations.</description>

Among other properties we prove the sequential weak closure of this space under local area control, finite topology control and conformal class control.

      <description>arXiv:2405.07616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work considers the inverse dynamic source problem arising from the time-domain fluorescence diffuse optical tomography (FDOT). We recover the dynamic distributions of fluorophores in biological tissue by the one single boundary measurement in finite time domain. We build the uniqueness theorem of this inverse problem. After that, we introduce a weighted norm and establish the conditional stability of Lipschitz type for the inverse problem by this weighted norm. The numerical inversions are considered under the framework of the deep neural networks (DNNs). We establish the generalization error estimates rigorously derived from Lipschitz conditional stability of inverse problem. Finally, we propose the reconstruction algorithms and give several numerical examples illustrating the performance of the proposed inversion schemes.</description>

      <title>Riesz transforms and Sobolev spaces associated to the partial harmonic oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.10461v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, our goal is to establish the Sobolev space associated to the partial harmonic oscillator. Based on its heat kernel estimate, we firstly give the definition of the fractional powers of the partial harmonic oscillator $$\AH=-\partial_{\rho}^2-\Delta_x+|x|^2,$$ and show that its negative powers are well defined on $L^p(\mathbb R^{d+1})$ for $p\in [1,\infty]$. We then define associated Riesz transforms and show that they are bounded on classical Sobolev spaces by the calculus of symbols.
  Secondly, by a factorization of the operator $\AH$, we define two families of Sobolev spaces with positive integer indices, and show the equivalence between them by the boundedness of Riesz transforms. Moreover, the adapted symbolic calculus also implies the boundedness of Riesz type transforms on the Sobolev spaces associated to the partial harmonic oscillator $\AH$.
  Lastly, as applications of our results, we obtain the revised Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality, the Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequality, and Hardy's inequality in the potential space $L_{\AH}^{\alpha, p}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Goldreich-Weber solutions constitute a finite-parameter of expanding and collapsing solutions to the mass-critical Euler-Poisson system. Two subclasses of this family correspond to compactly supported density profiles suitably modulated by the dynamic radius of the star that expands at the self-similar rate $\lambda(t)_{t\to\infty}\sim t^{\frac23}$ and linear rate $\lambda(t)_{t\to\infty}\sim t$ respectively. We prove two results: any linearly expanding Goldreich-Weber star is nonlinearly stable, while any given self-similarly expanding Goldreich-Weber star is codimension-4 nonlinearly stable against irrotational perturbations.
  The codimension-4 condition in the latter result is optimal and reflects the presence of 4 unstable directions in the linearised dynamics in self-similar coordinates, which are induced by the conservation of the energy and the momentum. This result can be viewed as a codimension-1 nonlinear stability of the moduli space of self-similarly expanding Goldreich-Weber stars against irrotational perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10442v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Dirichlet problem for the energy-critical heat equation \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} u_t=\Delta u+u^5,~&amp;\mbox{ in } \Omega \times \mathbb{R}^+,\\ u(x,t)=0,~&amp;\mbox{ on } \partial \Omega \times \mathbb{R}^+,\\ u(x,0)=u_0(x),~&amp;\mbox{ in } \Omega, \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $\Omega$ is a bounded smooth domain in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Let $H_\gamma(x,y)$ be the regular part of the Green function of $-\Delta-\gamma$ in $\Omega$, where $\gamma \in (0,\lambda_1)$ and $\lambda_1$ is the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of $-\Delta$. Then, given a point $q\in \Omega$ such that $3\gamma(q)&lt;\lambda_1$, where $$ \gamma(q)=\sup\{ \gamma&gt;0: H_\gamma(q,q)&gt;0 \}, $$ we prove the existence of a non-radial global positive and smooth solution $u(x,t)$ which blows up in infinite time with spike in $q$. The solution has the asymptotic profile $$ u(x,t)\sim 3^{\frac{1}{4}} \bigg(\frac{\mu(t)}{\mu(t)^2+|x-\xi(t)|^2}\bigg)^{\frac{1}{2}} \quad \text{as}\quad t \to \infty, $$ where $$
  -\ln \mu(t)= 2\gamma(q) t(1+o(1)),\quad \xi(t)=q+O\big(\mu(t)\big) \quad \text{as}\quad t \to \infty. $$</description>

      <title>The Schiffer problem on the cylinder and on the $2$-sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the existence of a family of compact subdomains $\Omega$ of the flat cylinder
  $\mathbb{R}^N\times \mathbb{R}/2\pi\mathbb{Z}$ for which the Neumann eigenvalue problem for the Laplacian on $\Omega$ admits eigenfunctions with constant Dirichlet values on $\partial \Omega$. These domains $\Omega$ have the property that their boundaries $\partial \Omega$ have nonconstant principal curvatures. In the context of ambient Riemannian manifolds, our construction provides the first examples of such domains whose boundaries are neither homogeneous nor isoparametric hypersurfaces. The functional analytic approach we develop in this paper overcomes an inherent loss of regularity of the problem in standard function spaces. With the help of this approach, we also construct a related family of subdomains of the $2$-sphere $S^2$. By this we disprove a conjecture in \cite{Souam}.</description>

      <title>Semi-local behaviour of non-local hypoelliptic equations: divergence form</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the Strong Harnack inequality for a class of hypoelliptic integro-differential equations in divergence form. The proof is based on a priori estimates, and as such extends the first non-stochastic approach of the non-local parabolic Strong Harnack inequality by Kassmann-Weidner [arXiv:2303.05975] to hypoelliptic equations; however, in contrast to the parabolic case, we only obtain a semi-local result, in the sense that we require the equation to hold globally in velocity, which in particular does not contradict the counterexample constructed in [arXiv:2405.05223]. In a first step, we derive a local bound on the non-local tail on upper level sets by exploiting the coercivity of the cross terms. In a second step, we perform a De Giorgi argument in $L^1$, since we control the tail term only in $L^1$. This yields a linear $L^1$ to $L^\infty$ bound. Consequentially, we prove polynomial upper and exponential lower bounds on the fundamental solution by adapting Aronson's method to non-local hypoelliptic equations.</description>

      <title>Sharp quantitative stability of the Yamabe problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a smooth closed Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ of dimension $N \ge 3$, we derive sharp quantitative stability estimates for nonnegative functions near the solution set of the Yamabe problem on $(M,g)$. The seminal work of Struwe (1984) \cite{S} states that if $\Gamma(u) := \|\Delta_g u - \frac{N-2}{4(N-1)} R_g u + u^{\frac{N+2}{N-2}}\|_{H^{-1}(M)} \to 0$, then $\|u-(u_0+\sum_{i=1}^{\nu} \mathcal{V}_i)\|_{H^1(M)} \to 0$ where $u_0$ is a solution to the Yamabe problem on $(M,g)$, $\nu \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}$, and $\mathcal{V}_i$ is a bubble-like function. If $M$ is the round sphere $\mathbb{S}^N$, then $u_0 \equiv 0$ and a natural candidate of $\mathcal{V}_i$ is a bubble itself. If $M$ is not conformally equivalent to $\mathbb{S}^N$, then either $u_0 &gt; 0$ or $u_0 \equiv 0$, there is no canonical choice of $\mathcal{V}_i$, and so a careful selection of $\mathcal{V}_i$ must be made to attain optimal estimates.
  For $3 \le N \le 5$, we construct suitable $\mathcal{V}_i$'s and then establish the inequality $\|u-(u_0+\sum_{i=1}^{\nu} \mathcal{V}_i)\|_{H^1(M)}$ $ \le C\zeta(\Gamma(u))$ where $C &gt; 0$ and $\zeta(t) = t$, consistent with the result of Figalli and Glaudo (2020) \cite{FG} on $\mathbb{S}^N$. In the case of $N \ge 6$, we investigate the single-bubbling phenomenon $(\nu = 1)$ on generic Riemannian manifolds $(M,g)$, proving that $\zeta(t)$ is determined by $N$, $u_0$, and $g$, and can be much larger than $t$. This exhibits a striking difference from the result of Ciraolo, Figalli, and Maggi (2018) \cite{CFM} on $\mathbb{S}^N$. All of the estimates presented herein are optimal.</description>

      <title>Local convergence rates for Wasserstein gradient flows and McKean-Vlasov equations with multiple stationary solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-linear versions of log-Sobolev inequalities, that link a free energy to its dissipation along the corresponding Wasserstein gradient flow (i.e. corresponds to Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequalities in this context), are known to provide global exponential long-time convergence to the free energy minimizers, and have been shown to hold in various contexts. However they cannot hold when the free energy admits critical points which are not global minimizers, which is for instance the case of the granular media equation in a double-well potential with quadratic attractive interaction at low temperature. This work addresses such cases, extending the general arguments when a log-Sobolev inequality only holds locally and, as an example, establishing such local inequalities for the granular media equation with quadratic interaction either in the one-dimensional symmetric double-well case or in higher dimension in the low temperature regime. The method provides quantitative convergence rates for initial conditions in a Wasserstein ball around the stationary solutions. The same analysis is carried out for the kinetic counterpart of the gradient flow, i.e. the corresponding Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. The local exponential convergence to stationary solutions for the mean-field equations, both elliptic and kinetic, is shown to induce for the corresponding particle systems a fast (i.e. uniform in the number or particles) decay of the particle system free energy toward the level of the non-linear limit.</description>

      <title>Bayesian sampling using interacting particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian sampling is an important task in statistics and machine learning. Over the past decade, many ensemble-type sampling methods have been proposed. In contrast to the classical Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, these new methods deploy a large number of interactive samples, and the communication between these samples is crucial in speeding up the convergence. To justify the validity of these sampling strategies, the concept of interacting particles naturally calls for the mean-field theory. The theory establishes a correspondence between particle interactions encoded in a set of coupled ODEs/SDEs and a PDE that characterizes the evolution of the underlying distribution. This bridges numerical algorithms with the PDE theory used to show convergence in time. Many mathematical machineries are developed to provide the mean-field analysis, and we showcase two such examples: The coupling method and the compactness argument built upon the martingale strategy. The former has been deployed to show the convergence of ensemble Kalman sampler and ensemble Kalman inversion, and the latter will be shown to be immensely powerful in proving the validity of the Vlasov-Boltzmann simulator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variable-exponent fractional models attract increasing attentions in various applications, while the rigorous analysis is far from well developed. This work provides general tools to address these models. Specifically, we first develop a convolution method to study the well-posedness, regularity, an inverse problem and numerical approximation for the sundiffusion of variable exponent. For models such as the variable-exponent two-sided space-fractional boundary value problem (including the variable-exponent fractional Laplacian equation as a special case) and the distributed variable-exponent model, for which the convolution method does not apply, we develop a perturbation method to prove their well-posedness. The relation between the convolution method and the perturbation method is discussed, and we further apply the latter to prove the well-posedness of the variable-exponent Abel integral equation and discuss the constraint on the data under different initial values of variable exponent.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a particle-based optimization method designed for addressing minimization problems with equality constraints, particularly in cases where the loss function exhibits non-differentiability or non-convexity. The proposed method combines components from consensus-based optimization algorithm with a newly introduced forcing term directed at the constraint set. A rigorous mean-field limit of the particle system is derived, and the convergence of the mean-field limit to the constrained minimizer is established. Additionally, we introduce a stable discretized algorithm and conduct various numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.</description>
