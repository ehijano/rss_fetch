      <title>Advancing Mathematical Epidemic Modeling via synergies with Chemical Reaction Network Theory and Lagrange-Hamilton Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This essay reviews some key concepts in mathematical epidemiology and examines the intersection of this field with related scientific disciplines, such as chemical reaction network theory and Lagrange-Hamilton geometry. Through a synthesis of theoretical insights and practical perspectives, we underscore the significance of essentially non-negative kinetic systems in the development and implementation of robust epidemiological models. Our purpose is to make the case that currently mathematical modeling of epidemiology is focusing too much on simple particular cases, and maybe not enough on more complex models, whose challenges would require cooperation with scientific computing experts and with researchers in the "sister disciplines" involving essentially nonnegative kinetic systems (like virology, ecology, chemical reaction networks, population dynamics, etc).</description>

      <title>Dynamic properties of a class of van der Pol-Duffing oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence of bifurcation of a van der Pol-Duffing oscillator with quintic terms and its quasi-periodic solutions by means of qualitative and bifurcation theories. Firstly, we analyze the autonomous system and find that it has two kinds of local bifurcations and a global bifurcation: pitchfork bifurcation, Hopf bifurcation, homoclinic bifurcation. It is worth noting that the disappearance of the homoclinic orbit is synchronized with the emergence of a large limit cycle. Then, by discussing the stability of equilibria at infinity and the orientation of the trajectory, the existence and stability of limit circles of the autonomous system are analyzed by combining the Poincar\'{e}-Bendixson theorem and the index theory. The global phase portrait and the numerical simulation of the autonomous system in different parameter values are given. Finally, the existence of periodic and quasi-periodic solutions to periodic forced system is proved by a KAM theorem.</description>

      <title>Quantized vortex dynamics of the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation on torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive rigorously the reduced dynamical laws for quantized vortex dynamics of the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation on torus when the core size of vortex $\varepsilon\to 0$. The reduced dynamical laws of the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation are governed by a mixed flow of gradient flow and Hamiltonian flow which are both driven by a renormalized energy on torus. Finally, some first integrals and analytic solutions of the reduced dynamical laws are discussed.</description>

      <title>Leveraging KANs For Enhanced Deep Koopman Operator Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-layer perceptrons (MLP's) have been extensively utilized in discovering Deep Koopman operators for linearizing nonlinear dynamics. With the emergence of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as a more efficient and accurate alternative to the MLP Neural Network, we propose a comparison of the performance of each network type in the context of learning Koopman operators with control.In this work, we propose a KANs-based deep Koopman framework with applications to an orbital Two-Body Problem (2BP) and the pendulum for data-driven discovery of linear system dynamics. KANs were found to be superior in nearly all aspects of training; learning 31 times faster, being 15 times more parameter efficiency, and predicting 1.25 times more accurately as compared to the MLP Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in the case of the 2BP. Thus, KANs shows potential for being an efficient tool in the development of Deep Koopman Theory.</description>

      <title>Recurrent neural chemical reaction networks that approximate arbitrary dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many important phenomena in chemistry and biology are realized via dynamical features such as multi-stability, oscillations, and chaos. Construction of novel chemical systems with such finely-tuned dynamics is a challenging problem central to the growing field of synthetic biology. In this paper, we address this problem by putting forward a molecular version of a recurrent artificial neural network, which we call a recurrent neural chemical reaction network (RNCRN). We prove that the RNCRN, with sufficiently many auxiliary chemical species and suitable fast reactions, can be systematically trained to achieve any dynamics. This approximation ability is shown to hold independent of the initial conditions for the auxiliary species, making the RNCRN more experimentally feasible. To demonstrate the results, we present a number of relatively simple RNCRNs trained to display a variety of biologically-important dynamical features.</description>

      <title>Mapping dynamical systems into chemical reactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical systems with polynomials on the right-hand side can model a wide range of physical processes. A subset of such dynamical systems that can model chemical reactions under mass-action kinetics are called chemical systems. A central problem in synthetic biology is to map general polynomial dynamical systems into dynamically similar chemical ones. In this paper, we present a novel map, called the quasi-chemical map, that can systematically solve this problem. The quasi-chemical map introduces suitable state-dependent perturbations into any given polynomial dynamical system which then becomes chemical under suitably large translation of variables. We prove that this map preserves robust dynamical features, such as generic equilibria and limit cycles, as well as temporal properties, such as periods of oscillations. Furthermore, the resulting chemical systems are of only at most one degree higher than the original dynamical systems. We demonstrate the quasi-chemical map by designing relatively simple chemical systems with exotic dynamics and pre-defined bifurcation structures.</description>

      <title>Finding lower bounds on the growth and entropy of subshifts over countable groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.00394v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a lower bound on the growth of a subshift based on a simple condition on the set of forbidden patterns defining that subshift. Aubrun et Al. showed a similar result based on the Lov\'asz Local Lemma for subshift over any countable group and Bernshteyn extended their approach to deduce, amongst other things, some lower bound on the exponential growth of the subshift. However, our result has a simpler proof, is easier to use for applications, and provides better bounds on the applications from their articles (although it is not clear that our result is stronger in general).
  In the particular case of subshift over $\mathbb{Z}$ a similar but weaker condition given by Miller was known to imply nonemptiness of the associated shift. Pavlov used the same approach to provide a condition that implied exponential growth. We provide a version of our result for this particular setting and it is provably strictly stronger than the result of Pavlov and the result of Miller (and, in practice, leads to considerable improvement in the applications).
  We also apply our two results to a few different problems including strongly aperiodic subshifts, nonrepetitive subshifts, and Kolmogorov complexity of subshifts.</description>

      <title>Sensing with shallow recurrent decoder networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sensing is a universal task in science and engineering. Downstream tasks from sensing include inferring full state estimates of a system (system identification), control decisions, and forecasting. These tasks are exceptionally challenging to achieve with limited sensors, noisy measurements, and corrupt or missing data. We propose a SHallow REcurrent Decoder (SHRED) neural network structure for sensing which incorporates (i) a recurrent neural network (LSTM) to learn a latent representation of the temporal dynamics of the sensors, and (ii) a shallow decoder that learns a mapping between this latent representation and the high-dimensional state space. By explicitly accounting for the time-history, or trajectory, of the sensor measurements, SHRED enables accurate reconstructions with far fewer sensors, outperforms existing techniques when more measurements are available, and is agnostic towards sensor placement. In addition, a compressed representation of the high-dimensional state is directly obtained from sensor measurements, which provides an on-the-fly compression for modeling physical and engineering systems. Forecasting is also achieved from the sensor time-series data alone, producing an efficient paradigm for predicting temporal evolution with an exceptionally limited number of sensors. In the example cases explored, including turbulent flows, complex spatio-temporal dynamics can be characterized with exceedingly limited sensors that can be randomly placed with minimal loss of performance.</description>

      <title>Integral representation formula for linear non-autonomous difference-delay equations</title>

Abstract: This note states and proves an integral representation formula of the ``variation-of-constant'' type for continuous solutions of linear non-autonomous difference delay systems, in terms of a Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral involving a fundamental solution and the initial data of the system. This gives a precise and correct version of several formulations appearing in the literature, and extends them to the time-varying case. This is of importance for further stability studies of various kinds of delay systems.</description>

      <title>Mass action systems: two criteria for Hopf bifurcation without Hurwitz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We state two sufficient criteria for periodic oscillations in mass action systems. Neither criterion requires a computation of the Hurwitz determinants. Instead, both criteria exploit the linear algebra concepts of $D$-stability and $P$-matrices. The criteria are complementary: the first is based on a stable matrix that is not a $P^-$ matrix, while the second is based on a $P^-$ matrix that is not stable. In analogy, a qualitatively different interpretation follows: the first criterion relates to positive feedback in the network, while the second concerns negative feedback. We present examples that showcase the applicability of both criteria. As a final independent remark, we prove that for the special case of fully-open networks, the capacity for Hopf bifurcation is just equivalent to the capacity for a steady-state with a complex pair of eigenvalues with positive-real part.</description>

      <title>Drift estimation in stochastic flows using kernel integral operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10698v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A stochastic differential equation (SDE) describes a motion in which a particle is governed simultaneously by the direction provided by a vector field / drift, and the scattering effects of white noise. The resulting motion can only be described as a random process instead of a solution curve. Due to the non-deterministic nature of this motion, the task of determining the drift from data is quite challenging, since the data does not directly represent the directional information of the flow. This paper describes an interpretation of vector field as a conditional expectation, which makes its estimation feasible via kernel-integral methods. It presents a numerical procedure based on kernel integral operators, that computes this expectation. In addition, some techniques are presented which can overcome the challenge of dimensionality if the SDE's carry some structure enabling sparsity.</description>

      <title>The Riemann hypothesis and dynamics of Backtracking New Q-Newton's method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05834v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new variant of Newton's method - named Backtracking New Q-Newton's method (BNQN) - was recently introduced by the second author. This method has good global convergence guarantees, specially concerning finding roots of meromorphic functions. This paper explores using BNQN for the Riemann xi function. We show in particular that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to that all attractors of BNQN lie on the critical line. We also explain how an apparent relation between the basins of attraction of BNQN and Voronoi's diagram can be helpful for verifying the Riemann hypothesis or finding a counterexample to it. Some illustrating experimental results are included, which convey some interesting phenomena. The experiments show that BNQN works very stably with highly transcendental functions like the Riemann xi function and its derivatives. Based on insights from the experiments, we discuss some concrete steps on using BNQN towards the Riemann hypothesis, by combining with de Bruijn -Newman's constant. Ideas and results from this paper can be extended to other zeta functions.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem governed by the gradient ODE $x'=\nabla F(x)$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ on which we assume that it has a finite number of hyperbolic equilibria whose stable and unstable manifolds intersect transversally. This problem is perturbed by the memory term $x'(t)=\nabla F(x(t))+\varepsilon\int_{-\infty}^t M(t-s)x(s)\, ds$ where $\varepsilon&gt;0$ is a small constant. The key result is that the structure of connections between the equlibria of the unperturbed problem is exactly preserved for a small $\varepsilon&gt;0$.</description>

Abstract: We present an extension of several results on pairs and varieties to foliated surface pairs. We prove the boundedness of local complements, the local index theorem, and the uniform boundedness of minimal log discrepancies (mlds), as well as establishing the existence of uniform rational lc polytopes. Furthermore, we address two questions posed by P. Cascini and C. Spicer on foliations, providing negative responses. We also demonstrate that the Grauert-Riemenschneider type vanishing theorem generally fails for lc foliations on surfaces. In addition, we determine the set of minimal log discrepancies for foliated surface pairs with specific coefficients, which leads to the recovery of Y.-A. Chen's proof on the ascending chain condition conjecture for mlds for foliated surfaces.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies a mathematical model of city formation by migration of firms and workers. The Core-Periphery model in the new economic geography, which considers migration of workers driven by real wage inequality among regions, is extended to incorporate migration of firms driven by real profit inequality among regions. Spatially homogeneous distributions of firms and workers become destabilized and eventually forms several cities in which both the firms and workers agglomerate, and the number of the cities decreases as transport costs become lower.</description>

      <title>StableSSM: Alleviating the Curse of Memory in State-space Models through Stable Reparameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14495v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the long-term memory learning capabilities of state-space models (SSMs) from the perspective of parameterization. We prove that state-space models without any reparameterization exhibit a memory limitation similar to that of traditional RNNs: the target relationships that can be stably approximated by state-space models must have an exponential decaying memory. Our analysis identifies this "curse of memory" as a result of the recurrent weights converging to a stability boundary, suggesting that a reparameterization technique can be effective. To this end, we introduce a class of reparameterization techniques for SSMs that effectively lift its memory limitations. Besides improving approximation capabilities, we further illustrate that a principled choice of reparameterization scheme can also enhance optimization stability. We validate our findings using synthetic datasets, language models and image classifications.</description>
