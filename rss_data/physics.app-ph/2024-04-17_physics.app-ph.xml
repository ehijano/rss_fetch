      <title>Design and experimental validation of a finite-size labyrinthine metamaterial for vibro-acoustics: enabling upscaling towards large-scale structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the design and experimental validation of a labyrinthine metamaterial for vibro-acoustic applications. Based on a 2D unit cell, different designs of finite-size metamaterial specimens in a sandwich configuration including two plates are proposed. The design phase includes an optimisation based on Bloch-Floquet analysis with the aims of maximising the band gap and extruding the specimens in the third dimension while keeping the absorption properties almost unaffected. By manufacturing and experimentally testing finite-sized specimens, we assess their capacity to mitigate vibrations in vibro-impact tests. The experiments confirm a band gap in the low- to mid-frequency range. Numerical models are employed to validate the experiments and to examine additional vibro-acoustic load cases. The metamaterial's performances are compared to benchmark solutions, usually employed for noise and vibration mitigation, showing a comparable efficacy in the band gap region. To eventually improve the metamaterial's performance, we optimise its interaction with the air and test different types of connections between the metamaterial and the homogeneous plates. This finally leads to metamaterial samples largely exceeding the benchmark performances in the band gap region and reveal the potential of interfaces for performance optimisation of composed structures.</description>

      <title>A broadband vortex beam generation by reflective meta-surface based on metal double-slit resonant ring</title>

Abstract: Recently, meta-surface(MS) has emerged as a promising alternative method for generating vortex waves. At the same time, MS also face the problem of narrow bandwidth, in order to obtain a board bandwidth, the MS unit cells structure become more and more complex, which will deduce many inconveniences to the preparation process of MS device. Therefore, we want to design a simple MS unit cell with a multi-frequency selection. In this paper, based on the principle of geometric phase, we design a simple reflective MS unit cell based on metal double-slit resonant ring. We elaborate on the resonance mechanism of the MS unit cell. Under the normal incidence of circularly polarized (CP) waves, the reflection coefficient of the same polarization was greater than 85%. By rotating the orientation angle of the resonator on the MS unit cell, the continuous 2pi phase coverage was satisfied in the frequency range of 0.52THz-1.1THz, and the relative bandwidth becomes 71.6%. Based on this, we construct a vortex generator by using a 15*15 MS unit array. The right-handed circularly polarized waves (RCP) and left-handed circularly polarized waves (LCP) are separately incident on MS with topological charges of l=1,2,3 under multiple resonant frequencies. The generated RCP vortex wave with topological charges of l=-1,-2,-3 and the generated LCP vortex wave with topological charges of l=1,2,3. The numerical simulation results exhibit our designed MS with multiple resonance outcomes can achieve a multi-broadband operation and generate a wide-band vortex beam. In addition, we also calculate the pattern purity. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, we prove that our designed MS can generate a broadband vortex wave.</description>

      <title>Spin Hall Nano-Oscillator Empirical Electrical Model for Optimal On-chip Detector Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As nascent nonlinear oscillators, nano-constriction spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs) represent a promising potential for integration into more complicated systems such as neural networks, magnetic field sensors, and radio frequency (RF) signal classification, their tunable high-frequency operating regime, easy synchronization, and CMOS compatibility can streamline the process. To implement SHNOs in any of these networks, the electrical features of a single device are needed before designing the signal detection CMOS circuitry. This study centers on presenting an empirical electrical model of the SHNO based on a comprehensive characterization of the output impedance of a single SHNO, and its available output power in the range of 2-10 GHz at various bias currents.</description>

      <title>Electronic Properties of Electroactive Ferrocenyl-Functionalized MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The attachment of redox active molecules to transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as MoS2, constitutes a promising approach for designing electrochemically switchable devices through the control of the material charge/spin transport properties by the redox state of the grafted molecule and thus the applied electrical potential. In this work, defective plasma treated MoS2 is functionalized by a ferrocene derivative and thoroughly investigated by various characterization techniques, such as Raman, photoluminescence, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electrochemistry. Furthermore, in-plane and out-of-plane conductive-AFM measurements (I-V and first derivative dI/dV-V curves) are measured to investigate the effect of the chemical functionalization of MoS2 on the electron transport properties. While the conduction and valence bands are determined at +0.7 and -1.2 eV with respect of the electrode Fermi energy for pristineMoS2, additional states in an energy range of ca. 0.45 eV below the MoS2 conduction band are measured after plasma treatment, attributed to S-vacancies. For ferrocene functionalized MoS2, the S-vacancy states are no longer observed resulting from the defect healing. However, two bumps at lower voltages in the dI/dV-V indicate a contribution to the electron transport through ferrocene HOMO, which is located in the MoS2 band gap at ca. 0.4-0.6 eV below the Fermi energy. These results are in good agreement with theoretical density functional theory (DFT) calculations and UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements.</description>

      <title>Arsenic diffusion in MOVPE-Grown GaAs/Ge epitaxial structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Germanium is reemerging as a prominent material in the semiconductor field, particularly for electronic applications, photonics, photovoltaics and thermophotovoltaics. Its combination with III-V compound semiconductors through epitaxial growth by metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) is instrumental and thus, the comprehension of the sequential stages in such epitaxial processes is of great importance. During the deposition of GaAs on p-type Ge, the formation of n/p junctions occurs when As diffuses into Ge. It is found that this formation begins in the so-called AsH3 preexposure where Ge substrate is firstly exposed to AsH3. Also important is the fact that both free carrier profiles and As profiles indicate that prolonged AsH3 preexposure times lead to deeper diffusion depths for the same process time. This effect is concomitant with the degradation of the Ge surface morphology, characterized by higher roughness as the AsH3 preexposure duration is extended. Contrary to ion-implanted As in germanium, which shows quadratic dependent diffusivity, our MOVPE investigation using AsH3 indicates a linear relationship, consistent with Takenaka et al.'s MOVPE study using TBAs. Analyzing As profiles alongside simulations, with and without subsequent GaAs epitaxy, suggests the generation of Ge vacancies during the process, contributing to deeper As diffusion.</description>

      <title>Towards scalable cryogenic quantum dot biasing using memristor-based DC sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryogenic memristor-based DC sources offer a promising avenue for in situ biasing of quantum dot arrays. In this study, we present experimental results and discuss the scaling potential for such DC sources. We first demonstrate the operation of a commercial discrete operational amplifier down to 1.2K which is used on the DC source prototype. Then, the tunability of the memristor-based DC source is validated by performing several 250mV-DC sweeps with a resolution of 10mV at room temperature and at 1.2K. Additionally, the DC source prototype exhibits a limited output drift of $\approx1\mathrm{\mu Vs^{-1}}$ at 1.2K. This showcases the potential of memristor-based DC sources for quantum dot biasing. Limitations in power consumption and voltage resolution using discrete components highlight the need for a fully integrated and scalable complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor-based (CMOS-based) approach. To address this, we propose to monolithically co-integrate emerging non-volatile memories (eNVMs) and 65nm CMOS circuitry. Simulations reveal a reduction in power consumption, down to $\mathrm{10\mu W}$ per DC source and in footprint. This allows for the integration of up to one million eNVM-based DC sources at the 4.2K stage of a dilution fridge, paving the way for near term large-scale quantum computing applications.</description>

      <title>Low-power, agile electro-optic frequency comb spectrometer for integrated sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sensing platforms based upon photonic integrated circuits have shown considerable promise; however, they require corresponding advancements in integrated optical readout technologies. Here, we present an on-chip spectrometer that leverages an integrated thin-film lithium niobate modulator to produce a frequency-agile electro-optic frequency comb for interrogating chip-scale temperature and acceleration sensors. The chirped comb process allows for ultralow radiofrequency drive voltages, which are as much as seven orders of magnitude less than the lowest found in the literature and are generated using a chip-scale, microcontroller-driven direct digital synthesizer. The on-chip comb spectrometer is able to simultaneously interrogate both an on-chip temperature sensor and an off-chip, microfabricated optomechanical accelerometer with cutting-edge sensitivities of $\approx 5\ {\mu} \mathrm{K} \cdot \mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ and $\approx 130\ \mu \mathrm{m} \cdot \mathrm{s}^{-2} \cdot \mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$, respectively. This platform is compatible with a broad range of existing photonic integrated circuit technologies, where its combination of frequency agility and ultralow radiofrequency power requirements are expected to have applications in fields such as quantum science and optical computing.</description>

      <title>Area Selective Chemical Vapor Deposition of Gold by Electron Beam Seeding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chemical vapour deposition (CVD) is an established method for producing high-purity thin films, but it typically necessitates the pre- and post-processing of a mask to produce structures. This paper presents a novel maskless patterning technique that enables area selective CVD of gold. A focused electron beam is used to decompose the metal-organic precursor Au(acac)Me$_2$ locally, thereby creating an autocatalytically active seed layer for subsequent CVD with the same precursor. The procedure can be included in the same CVD cycle without the need for clean room lithographic processing. Moreover, it operates at low temperatures of 80 {\deg}C, over 200 K lower than standard CVD temperatures for this precursor, reducing thermal load on the specimen. Given that electron beam seeding operates on any even moderately conductive surface, the process does not constrain device design. This is demonstrated by the example of vertical nanostructures with high aspect ratios of around 40:1 and more. Written using a focused electron beam and the same precursor, these nanopillars exhibit catalytically active nuclei on their surface. Furthermore, they allow for the first time the precise determination of the local temperature increase caused by the writing of nanostructures with an electron beam.</description>

      <title>LatticeML: A data-driven application for predicting the effective Young Modulus of high temperature graph based architected materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Architected materials with their unique topology and geometry offer the potential to modify physical and mechanical properties. Machine learning can accelerate the design and optimization of these materials by identifying optimal designs and forecasting performance. This work presents LatticeML, a data-driven application for predicting the effective Young's Modulus of high-temperature graph-based architected materials. The study considers eleven graph-based lattice structures with two high-temperature alloys, Ti-6Al-4V and Inconel 625. Finite element simulations were used to compute the effective Young's Modulus of the 2x2x2 unit cell configurations. A machine learning framework was developed to predict Young's Modulus, involving data collection, preprocessing, implementation of regression models, and deployment of the best-performing model. Five supervised learning algorithms were evaluated, with the XGBoost Regressor achieving the highest accuracy (MSE = 2.7993, MAE = 1.1521, R-squared = 0.9875). The application uses the Streamlit framework to create an interactive web interface, allowing users to input material and geometric parameters and obtain predicted Young's Modulus values.</description>
