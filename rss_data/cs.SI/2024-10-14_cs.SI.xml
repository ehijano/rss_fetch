      <title>NetDiff: Deep Graph Denoising Diffusion for Ad Hoc Network Topology Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces NetDiff, an expressive graph denoising diffusion probabilistic architecture that generates wireless ad hoc network link topologies. Such networks, with directional antennas, can achieve unmatched performance when the communication links are designed to provide good geometric properties, notably by reducing interference between these links while respecting diverse physical constraints. How to craft such a link assignment algorithm is yet a real problem. Deep graph generation offers multiple advantages compared to traditional approaches: it allows to relieve the network nodes of the communication burden caused by the search of viable links and to avoid resorting to heavy combinatorial methods to find a good link topology. Denoising diffusion also provides a built-in method to update the network over time. Given that graph neural networks sometimes tend to struggle with global, structural properties, we augment the popular graph transformer with cross-attentive modulation tokens in order to improve global control over the predicted topology. We also incorporate simple node and edge features, as well as additional loss terms, to facilitate the compliance with the network topology physical constraints. A network evolution algorithm based on partial diffusion is also proposed to maintain a stable network topology over time when the nodes move. Our results show that the generated links are realistic, present structural properties similar to the dataset graphs', and require only minor corrections and verification steps to be operational.</description>

      <title>A Framework to Audit Email Address Privacy and Analyze Email Marketing Practices of Online Services and Apps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the widespread perception that personal data, such as email addresses, may be shared or sold without informed user consent, investigating whether these concerns are reflected in actual practices of popular online services and apps. Over the course of a year, we collected and analyzed the source, volume, frequency, and content of emails received by users after signing up for the 150 most popular online services and apps across various sectors. By examining patterns in email communications, we aim to identify consistent strategies used across industries, including potential signs of third-party data sharing. This analysis provides a critical evaluation of how email marketing tactics may intersect with data-sharing practices, with important implications for consumer privacy and regulatory oversight. Our study findings, conducted post-CCPA and GDPR, indicate that while no third-party spam email was detected, internal email marketing practices were pervasive, with companies frequently sending promotional and CRM emails despite opt-out preferences. The framework established in this work is designed to be scalable, allowing for continuous monitoring, and can be extended to include a more diverse set of apps and services for broader analysis, ultimately contributing to improved user perception of data privacy practices.</description>

      <title>Decoding Segregation: Navigating a century of segregation research across disciplines and introducing a bottom-up ontology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segregation is a widely recognised phenomenon with profound implications for societies worldwide. From political science and gender studies to anthropology and urban studies, it has garnered considerable attention across numerous scientific fields due to its multifaceted nature. However, what makes segregation such a far-reaching phenomenon? In fact, how many forms of segregation exist? Have different disciplines engaged in segregation research uncovered all its facets? This article systematically explores the landscape of segregation research spanning over a century. We analyzed 10,754 documents from the Scopus database to unveil the dynamics of the discovery of segregation forms through several findings. We identify (1) the exponential growth and increasing diversification of segregation forms, driven by combinatorial and exploratory work and increasing transdisciplinarity and intersectionality in research; (2) the evolution and structure of the field in hierarchies and clusters of segregation forms, revealing trends, persistence, and shifts over time; (3) the timing and geographical distribution of first publications on segregation forms, along with contextual variations across world regions and countries; (4) path dependencies in the historical and geographical shaping of segregation research; and (5) the structure of knowledge production. Aiming to contribute semantic organization to an increasingly complex field, we explore these findings to introduce a bottom-up ontology of segregation, marking the first comprehensive effort of its kind.</description>

      <title>Interdependency and cascading failures in co-patenting and shareholding interfirm networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work analyses the interdependent link creation of patent and shareholding links in interfirm networks, and how this dynamics affects the resilience of such networks in the face of cascading failures. Using the Orbis dataset, we construct very large co-patenting and shareholding networks, globally as well as in terms of individual countries. Besides, we construct smaller overlap networks from those firm pairs which have both types of links between them, for nine years between 2008-2016. We use information theoretic measures, such as mutual information, active information storage, and transfer entropy, to characterise the topological similarities and shared topological information between the relevant co-patenting and shareholding networks. We then construct a cascading failure model, and use it to analyse the resilience of interdependent interfirm networks in terms of multiple failure characteristics. We find that there is relatively high level of mutual information between co-patenting networks and the shareholding networks from later years, suggesting that the formation of shareholding links is influenced by the existence of patent links in previous years. We also show that this influence becomes most apparent after a delay of four years between the formation of co-patenting links and shareholding links. Analysing the resilience of shareholding networks against cascading failures, we show that in terms of both mean downtime, and failure proportion of firms, certain countries have less resilient shareholding networks compared to other countries with significant economies. Based on our results, we postulate that an interfirm network model which considers multiple types of relationships together could be a to highlight important features of economic systems around the world.</description>

      <title>More than Memes: A Multimodal Topic Modeling Approach to Conspiracy Theories on Telegram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on conspiracy theories and related content online has traditionally focused on textual data. To address the increasing prevalence of (audio-)visual data on social media, and to capture the evolving and dynamic nature of this communication, researchers have begun to explore the potential of unsupervised approaches for analyzing multimodal online content. Our research contributes to this field by exploring the potential of multimodal topic modeling for analyzing conspiracy theories in German-language Telegram channels. Our work uses the BERTopic topic modeling approach in combination with CLIP for the analysis of textual and visual data. We analyze a corpus of ~40, 000 Telegram messages posted in October 2023 in 571 German-language Telegram channels known for disseminating conspiracy theories and other deceptive content. We explore the potentials and challenges of this approach for studying a medium-sized corpus of user-generated, text-image online content. We offer insights into the dominant topics across modalities, different text and image genres discovered during the analysis, quantitative inter-modal topic analyses, and a qualitative case study of textual, visual, and multimodal narrative strategies in the communication of conspiracy theories.</description>

      <title>Compressing regularised dynamics improves link prediction in sparse networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting future interactions or novel links in networks is an indispensable tool across diverse domains, including genetic research, online social networks, and recommendation systems. Among the numerous techniques developed for link prediction, those leveraging the networks' community structure have proven highly effective. For example, the recently proposed MapSim predicts links based on a similarity measure derived from the code structure of the map equation, a community-detection objective function that operates on network flows. However, the standard map equation assumes complete observations and typically identifies many small modules in networks where the nodes connect through only a few links. This aspect can degrade MapSim's performance on sparse networks. To overcome this limitation, we incorporate a global regularisation method based on a Bayesian estimate of the transition rates along with three local regularisation methods. The regularised versions of the map equation compensate for incomplete observations and decrease the number of identified communities in sparse networks. The regularised methods outperform standard MapSim and several state-of-the-art embedding methods in highly sparse networks. This performance holds across multiple real-world networks with randomly removed links, simulating incomplete observations. Among the proposed regularisation methods, the global regularisation method provides the most reliable community detection and the highest link prediction performance across different network densities.</description>

      <title>Revealing COVID-19's Social Dynamics: Diachronic Semantic Analysis of Vaccine and Symptom Discourse on Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media is recognized as an important source for deriving insights into public opinion dynamics and social impacts due to the vast textual data generated daily and the 'unconstrained' behavior of people interacting on these platforms. However, such analyses prove challenging due to the semantic shift phenomenon, where word meanings evolve over time. This paper proposes an unsupervised dynamic word embedding method to capture longitudinal semantic shifts in social media data without predefined anchor words. The method leverages word co-occurrence statistics and dynamic updating to adapt embeddings over time, addressing the challenges of data sparseness, imbalanced distributions, and synergistic semantic effects. Evaluated on a large COVID-19 Twitter dataset, the method reveals semantic evolution patterns of vaccine- and symptom-related entities across different pandemic stages, and their potential correlations with real-world statistics. Our key contributions include the dynamic embedding technique, empirical analysis of COVID-19 semantic shifts, and discussions on enhancing semantic shift modeling for computational social science research. This study enables capturing longitudinal semantic dynamics on social media to understand public discourse and collective phenomena.</description>

      <title>Explorative pedestrian mobility GPS data from a citizen science experiment in a neighbourhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pedestrian GPS data are key to a better understanding of micro-mobility and micro-behaviour within a neighbourhood. These data can bring new insights into walkability and livability in the context of urban sustainability. However, pedestrian open data are scarce and often lack a context for their transformation into actionable knowledge in a neighbourhood. Citizen science and public involvement practices are powerful instruments for obtaining these data and take a community-centred placemaking approach. The study shares some 3000 GPS recordings corresponding to 19 unique trajectories made and recorded by groups of participants from three distinct communities in a relatively small neighbourhood. The groups explored the neighbourhood through a number of tasks and chose different places to stop and perform various social and festive activities. The study shares not only raw data but also processed records with specific filtering and processing to facilitate and accelerate data usage. Citizen science practices and the data-collection protocols involved are reported in order to offer a complete perspective of the research undertaken jointly with an assessment of how community-centred placemaking and operative mapping are incorporated into local urban transformation actions.</description>

      <title>Who should fight the spread of fake news?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates who should bear the responsibility of combating the spread of misinformation in social networks. Should that be the online platforms or their users? Should that be done by debunking the "fake news" already in circulation or by investing in preemptive efforts to prevent their diffusion altogether? We seek to answer such questions in a stylized opinion dynamics framework, where agents in a network aggregate the information they receive from peers and/or from influential external sources, with the aim of learning a ground truth among a set of competing hypotheses. In most cases, we find centralized sources to be more effective at combating misinformation than distributed ones, suggesting that online platforms should play an active role in the fight against fake news. In line with literature on the "backfire effect", we find that debunking in certain circumstances can be a counterproductive strategy, whereas some targeted strategies (akin to "deplatforming") and/or preemptive campaigns turn out to be quite effective. Despite its simplicity, our model provides useful guidelines that could inform the ongoing debate on online disinformation and the best ways to limit its damaging effects.</description>

      <title>Online design of dynamic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing a network (e.g., a telecommunication or transport network) is mainly done offline, in a planning phase, prior to the operation of the network. On the other hand, a massive effort has been devoted to characterizing dynamic networks, i.e., those that evolve over time. The novelty of this paper is that we introduce a method for the online design of dynamic networks. The need to do so emerges when a network needs to operate in a dynamic and stochastic environment. In this case, one may wish to build a network over time, on the fly, in order to react to the changes of the environment and to keep certain performance targets. We tackle this online design problem with a rolling horizon optimization based on Monte Carlo Tree Search. The potential of online network design is showcased for the design of a futuristic dynamic public transport network, where bus lines are constructed on the fly to better adapt to a stochastic user demand. In such a scenario, we compare our results with state-of-the-art dynamic vehicle routing problem (VRP) resolution methods, simulating requests from a New York City taxi dataset. Differently from classic VRP methods, that extend vehicle trajectories in isolation, our method enables us to build a structured network of line buses, where complex user journeys are possible, thus increasing system performance.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of Elite and Mass Polarization in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the political arena of social platforms, opposing factions of varying sizes show asymmetrical patterns, and elites and masses within these groups have divergent motivations and influence,challenging simplistic views of polarization. Yet, existing methods for quantifying polarization reduce division to a single value, assuming uniform distribution of polarization online. While this approach can confirm the observed increase in political polarization in many societies, it overlooks complexities that could explain this phenomenon. Notably, opposing groups can have unequal impacts on polarization, and the literature shows division between elites and the masses is a critical factor to consider.
  We propose a method to decompose existing polarization measures in order to quantify the role of groups, determined by these distinct hierarchies, in the total polarization value. We applied this method to polarized topics in the Finnish Twittersphere surrounding the 2019 and 2023parliamentary elections. Our analysis reveals two key insights: 1) The impact of opposing groups on observed polarization is rarely balanced, and 2) while elites strongly contribute to structural polarization and consistently display greater alignment across various topics, the masses have also recently experienced a surge in issue alignment, a stronger form of polarization.
  Our findings suggest that the masses may not be as immune to an increasingly polarized environment as previously thought. This research provides a more nuanced understanding of polarization dynamics, offering potential insights into its underlying mechanisms and evolution</description>

      <title>Exploring agent interaction patterns in the comment sections of fake and real news</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: User comments on social media have been recognized as a crucial factor in distinguishing between fake and real news, with many studies focusing on the textual content of user reactions. However, the interactions among agents in the comment sections for fake and real news have not been fully explored. In this study, we analyze a dataset comprising both fake and real news from Reddit to investigate agent interaction patterns, considering both the network structure and the sentiment of the nodes. Our findings reveal that (i) comments on fake news are more likely to form groups, (ii) compared to fake news, where users generate more negative sentiment, real news tend to elicit more neutral and positive sentiments. Additionally, nodes with similar sentiments cluster together more tightly than anticipated. From a dynamic perspective, we found that the sentiment distribution among nodes stabilizes early and remains stable over time. These findings have both theoretical and practical implications, particularly for the early detection of real and fake news within social networks.</description>

      <title>An egonet-based approach to effective weighted network comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the impressive growth of network models in practically every scientific and technological area, we are often faced with the need to compare graphs, i.e., to quantify their (dis)similarity using appropriate metrics. This is necessary, for example, to identify networks with comparable characteristics or to spot anomalous instants in a time sequence of graphs. While a large number of metrics are available for binary networks, the set of comparison methods capable of handling weighted graphs is much smaller. Yet, the strength of connections is often a key ingredient of the model, and ignoring this information could lead to misleading results. In this paper we introduce a family of dissimilarity measures to compare undirected weighted networks. They fall into the class of alignment-free metrics: as such, they do not require the correspondence of the nodes between the two graphs and can also compare networks of different sizes. In short, they are based on the distributions, on the graph, of a few egonet features which are easily defined and computed: the distance between two graphs is then the distance between the corresponding distributions. On a properly defined testbed with a pool of weighted network models with diversified characteristics, the proposed metrics are shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance in the model classification task. The effectiveness and applicability of the proposed metrics are then demonstrated on two examples. In the first, some "filtering" schemes -- designed to eliminate non-significant links while maintaining most of the total weight -- are evaluated in their ability to produce as output a graph faithful to the original, in terms of the local structure around nodes. In the second example, analyzing a timeline of stock market correlation graphs highlights anomalies associated with periods of financial instability.</description>

      <title>Richelieu: Self-Evolving LLM-Based Agents for AI Diplomacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06813v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diplomacy is one of the most sophisticated activities in human society, involving complex interactions among multiple parties that require skills in social reasoning, negotiation, and long-term strategic planning. Previous AI agents have demonstrated their ability to handle multi-step games and large action spaces in multi-agent tasks. However, diplomacy involves a staggering magnitude of decision spaces, especially considering the negotiation stage required. While recent agents based on large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in various applications, they still struggle with extended planning periods in complex multi-agent settings. Leveraging recent technologies for LLM-based agents, we aim to explore AI's potential to create a human-like agent capable of executing comprehensive multi-agent missions by integrating three fundamental capabilities: 1) strategic planning with memory and reflection; 2) goal-oriented negotiation with social reasoning; and 3) augmenting memory through self-play games for self-evolution without human in the loop.</description>

      <title>LLMs hallucinate graphs too: a structural perspective</title>

Abstract: It is known that LLMs do hallucinate, that is, they return incorrect information as facts. In this paper, we introduce the possibility to study these hallucinations under a structured form: graphs. Hallucinations in this context are incorrect outputs when prompted for well known graphs from the literature (e.g. Karate club, Les Mis\'erables, graph atlas). These hallucinated graphs have the advantage of being much richer than the factual accuracy -- or not -- of a statement; this paper thus argues that such rich hallucinations can be used to characterize the outputs of LLMs. Our first contribution observes the diversity of topological hallucinations from major modern LLMs. Our second contribution is the proposal of a metric for the amplitude of such hallucinations: the Graph Atlas Distance, that is the average graph edit distance from several graphs in the graph atlas set. We compare this metric to the Hallucination Leaderboard, a hallucination rank that leverages 10,000 times more prompts to obtain its ranking.</description>

      <title>Mpox Narrative on Instagram: A Labeled Multilingual Dataset of Instagram Posts on Mpox for Sentiment, Hate Speech, and Anxiety Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05292v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The world is currently experiencing an outbreak of mpox, which has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by WHO. No prior work related to social media mining has focused on the development of a dataset of Instagram posts about the mpox outbreak. The work presented in this paper aims to address this research gap and makes two scientific contributions to this field. First, it presents a multilingual dataset of 60,127 Instagram posts about mpox, published between July 23, 2022, and September 5, 2024. The dataset, available at https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/7fvc-y093, contains Instagram posts about mpox in 52 languages. For each of these posts, the Post ID, Post Description, Date of publication, language, and translated version of the post (translation to English was performed using the Google Translate API) are presented as separate attributes in the dataset. After developing this dataset, sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, and anxiety or stress detection were performed. This process included classifying each post into (i) one of the sentiment classes, i.e., fear, surprise, joy, sadness, anger, disgust, or neutral, (ii) hate or not hate, and (iii) anxiety/stress detected or no anxiety/stress detected. These results are presented as separate attributes in the dataset. Second, this paper presents the results of performing sentiment analysis, hate speech analysis, and anxiety or stress analysis. The variation of the sentiment classes - fear, surprise, joy, sadness, anger, disgust, and neutral were observed to be 27.95%, 2.57%, 8.69%, 5.94%, 2.69%, 1.53%, and 50.64%, respectively. In terms of hate speech detection, 95.75% of the posts did not contain hate and the remaining 4.25% of the posts contained hate. Finally, 72.05% of the posts did not indicate any anxiety/stress, and the remaining 27.95% of the posts represented some form of anxiety/stress.</description>
