      <title>Carbon burning at stellar energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fusion reactions with light nuclei play an essential role in understanding the energy production, the nucleosynthesis of chemical elements and the evolution of massive stars. The measurement of key fusion reactions at stellar energies is thus of interest, but highly challenging since the associated cross sections are extremely small, of the sub-nanobarn range. Among these reactions, the fusion of carbon nuclei, which drives the stellar carbon burning phase, is deeply connected with essential microscopic features such as the impact of symmetries, the access to quantum states, emerging of resonances or Pauli repulsion effects. These may manifest themselves in exceptional behaviour of the S-factor of this particular system and the precision of extrapolations to deep sub-barrier energies is limited. The present contribution discusses recent experimental results of the nuclear astrophysics community on the measurement of the carbon + carbon fusion reaction down to the astrophysics region. The interplay between nuclear structure, nucleosynthesis and stellar evolution is addressed.</description>

      <title>Spectrometry of Captured Highly Charged Ions Produced Following Antiproton Annihilations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first capture and time-of-flight spectrometry of highly charged ions produced following antiproton annihilations in a Penning-Malmberg trap. At the AEgIS experiment, we employed a multi-step nested-trap technique to isolate ions from antiproton annihilations with ultra-low-density helium and argon gas. The capture and identification of highly-charged argon ions in charge-states up to $Ar^{5+}$ demonstrates a new method for in-trap synthesis. This work establishes a clear path towards the direct capture and mass spectrometry of cold nuclear annihilation fragments, which will enable a complementary tool for exploring the neutron to proton density ratio at the extreme nuclear periphery.</description>

      <title>Angular Geometry of Atomic Multipole Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simple way to calculate Rabi frequencies is outlined for interactions of atomic or nuclear multipole moments with laser fields that focuses on their relative geometry. The resulting expression takes the form of a dot product between the laser polarization and a vector spherical harmonic, thereby naturally connecting to the multipole's far-field spontaneous-emission pattern and providing a way to visualize the interaction. Since the vector spherical harmonics are not yet a standard tool in quantum science, their relevant properties are reviewed. This approach is illustrated in the calculation of a variety of beam effects, yielding both perturbative corrections and some nontrivial cases with non-vanishing coupling.</description>

      <title>In-pixel integration of signal processing and AI/ML based data filtering for particle tracking detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first physical realization of in-pixel signal processing with integrated AI-based data filtering for particle tracking detectors. Building on prior work that demonstrated a physics-motivated edge-AI algorithm suitable for ASIC implementation, this work marks a significant milestone toward intelligent silicon trackers. Our prototype readout chip performs real-time data reduction at the sensor level while meeting stringent requirements on power, area, and latency. The chip is taped-out in 28nm TSMC CMOS bulk process, which has been shown to have sufficient radiation hardness for particle experiments. This development represents a key step toward enabling fully on-detector edge AI, with broad implications for data throughput and discovery potential in high-rate, high-radiation environments such as the High-Luminosity LHC.</description>

      <title>Probing the Neutron Skin with Extreme Collision Geometries in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how protons and neutrons are located differently in an atomic nucleus can provide fundamental information on nuclear structure and have far-reaching implications for astrophysics. A precise determination of this important difference, often quantified by the so-called neutron skin thickness, is challenging both theoretically and experimentally. Here we show how one can use a new category of observables in heavy ion collisions to probe the neutron skin thickness of nuclei like $^{208}$Pb and $^{48}$Ca, by utilizing the asymmetry between neutrons and protons of spectator nucleons in super-central collisions as well as that of participant nucleons in peripheral collisions. Using quantitative simulations, we demonstrate their sensitivity and great potential in constraining neutron skin thickness for both $^{208}$Pb and $^{48}$Ca nuclei in these extreme event geometries. Furthermore, we propose the asymmetric collisions between $^{48}$Ca and $^{40}$Ca nuclei as a unique and powerful way to nail down the neutron skin thickness.</description>

      <title>Collectivity and isomers in the Pb isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work, we aim to study collectivity in the Pb isotopes in the framework of nuclear shell model. We have performed shell-model calculations using KHH7B effective interaction. The model space of KHH7B interaction consists of 14 orbitals. We have reported results for even-even $^{196-206}$Pb isotopes for spectra and electromagnetic properties. The shell model results for isomeric states are also reported. Our results will be useful to compare upcoming experimental data.</description>

      <title>Determining the \Xi-Nucleus Potential from the Measured Binding Energies of ^15_\Xi^C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent observation of the deeply bound \Xi - hypernucleus ^15_\Xi^-C through the IRRAWADDY and KINKA events provided a crucial benchmark for determining the \Xi-nucleus interaction. This work aims to constrain the depth of this potential by calculating the binding energy B_\Xi of the ^15_\Xi C system, which forms a \Xi^- -^14 N bound state. We achieve this by numerically solving the Schroedinger equation for a \Xi hyperon within a phenomenological Woods-Saxon potential, using the stable Numerov method, incorporating the Coulomb interaction. For a potential well depth V_0 = 12 MeV, our calculations yield a 0^+_1 state binding energy of 6.35 MeV and a 1^-_1 state energy of 0.87 MeV. These results are in excellent agreement with the IRRAWADDY event (B_\Xi = 6.27 \pm 0.27 MeV) and the shallower 1^-_1 states (KISO/IBUKI events, B_\Xi \approx 1 MeV), respectively. Assuming \Xi^0 instead of \Xi^-, we predict the ground state 0^+ of _{\Xi^0}^{15}N with (B_{\Xi^0} = 2.636 MeV) by omitting the Coulomb interaction as a first approximation.</description>

      <title>On fluctuation properties of MACS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Maxwellian Average Cross Section (MACS) is usually calculated with help of the statistical codes that do not take into account fluctuations of individual resonance parameters. The actual MACS can substantially deviate from its expectation value. This work focuses on description of various sources and aspects of these fluctuations. Simulated resonance sequences considering all the fluctuations involved in the statistical model are used for this purpose. Contribution of various sources of the fluctuations and neutrons with different orbital momenta are thoroughly investigated and described. Impact of available cross section data at low neutron energies is also checked. Based on this analysis simple empirical formulae for estimating relative fluctuations of MACS using solely $s$-wave resonance spacing $D_0$ and the temperature of the stellar environment are derived. It is shown that real nuclei follow the proposed formula well. The expected MACS fluctuations increase with $D_0$ and can be significant. While for isotopes with $D_0$ in eV range the possible deviation from calculated values are small, for nuclei with $D_0$ in the keV range the full-width half-maximum of the expected distribution is larger than about 25\% and 10\% for astrophysically relevant temperatures of $kT=8$ and 30 keV. At least for these nuclei the predictions from statistical codes must be taken with caution.</description>

      <title>$\beta$-delayed spectroscopy of $^{80}$Ge$_{48}$ and competition between Gamow-Teller and first-forbidden transitions in $^{80g+m}$Ga$_{49}$ $\beta$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\beta$-delayed spectroscopy of $^{80}$Ge has been studied using sources of ground and low-lying isomeric states of $^{80}$Ga. A hybrid $\gamma$-ray spectrometer was used, composed of high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors for low-energy $\gamma$-ray detection, phoswich detectors from the PARIS array for high-energy $\gamma$ rays and a plastic detector for $\beta$ tagging. The new decay level schemes are presented, with 13 and 14 states $\beta$ populated by $^{80g}$Ga and $^{80m}$Ga, respectively, being reported for the first time. We quantitatively compare summed intensities of first-forbidden and previously reported Gamow-Teller $\beta$ transitions [R. Li et al., \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevC.111.034303}{Phys. Rev. C 111, 034303 (2025)}]. The upper-limit fractions of first-forbidden transitions contributing to the decays of $^{80g}$Ga and $^{80m}$Ga are (48.0 $\pm$ 2.7)$\%$ and (47.9 $\pm$ 3.3)$\%$ of the observed total $\beta$ transition intensities of (78.2 $\pm$ 2.5)$\%$ and (82.2 $\pm$ 3.7)$\%$, respectively. Notably, the half-lives decrease in accordance with the upper limits of (48.0 $\pm$ 6.0)$\%$ [3.67(20) s $\rightarrow$ 1.91(3) s] and (47.9 $\pm$ 7.2)$\%$ [3.01(19) s $\rightarrow$ 1.57(1) s] for $^{80g}$Ga and $^{80m}$Ga, respectively, when including first-forbidden transitions, in contrast to those by Gamow-Teller transitions only.</description>

Abstract: Lifetimes for the ${4}_1^+$ and ${6}_1^+$ states have been directly measured using $\gamma-\gamma$ fast timing technique for low lying states of $^{130}Xe$, populated from $\beta ^-$ decay of the parent $^{130}I$ produced through $^{nat}U(\alpha,f)$ reaction at $E_{\alpha}~=~40~MeV$. VENTURE array comprising of eight fast CeBr$_3$ detectors is used for lifetime measurement. The reduced transition probabilities deduced from the measured lifetimes have been compared with theoretical values obtained from the large basis shell model calculation and the interacting boson approximation (IBM) calculation.</description>

      <title>Effect of transverse momentum conservation and flow on symmetric cumulants $sc_{2,3} \left \{ 4 \right \}$ and $sc_{2,3,4} \left \{ 6 \right \}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetric cumulants can improve our understanding of the joint probability distribution function $ P\left ( v_{m},v_{n},v_{k}, \dots,\Psi _{m},\Psi _{n},\Psi _{k},\dots \right )$, potentially offering new insights into the nature of the fluctuations of the quark-gluon plasma produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In this work, the four-particle symmetric cumulants $sc_{2,3} \left \{ 4 \right \}$, six-particle symmetric cumulants $sc_{2,3,4} \left \{ 6 \right \}$, and the normalized cumulants $nsc_{2,3} \left \{ 4 \right \}$ and $nsc_{2,3,4} \left \{ 6 \right \}$ originating from transverse momentum conservation, collective flow, and the interplay between the two effects are calculated. Our results on $sc_{2,3} \left \{ 4 \right \}$ are consistent with the ATLAS data using the subevent cumulant method, facilitating a more profound understanding of the origins of the symmetric cumulant in small systems. Our results on $sc_{2,3,4} \left \{ 6 \right \}$ serve as theoretical predictions for future experimental measurements in small systems.</description>

      <title>Global analysis of fragmentation functions to light neutral hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fragmentation functions (FFs) are crucial non-perturbative components in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), playing a vital role in predictions and understanding of the hadronization process. In this paper, we present the FFs for $K_S^0$, $\eta$, $\pi^0$ mesons, and $\Lambda$ baryons in the context of global QCD analysis. The data included in the fit are from single inclusive $e^+ e^-$ annihilation (SIA), semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) and proton-proton collisions, with kinematic cuts carefully applied to ensure validity of collinear factorization and perturbative QCD expansion. For the first time, data from SIDIS and hadron-in-jet production in SIA have been incorporated into the extraction of FFs for light-flavor neutral hadrons. Our analysis reveals that these data play a critical role in constraining the gluon distribution, and in distinguishing between different quark flavors. Pulls from different datasets are also studied by performing alternative fits with systematically subtracting groups of data from the nominal fit. For the quality of the fit, good $\chi^2$ values are achieved for most of the datasets, and FFs are generally well constrained within the momentum fraction region $\pqty{0.1, 0.5}$. The extracted $K_S^0$ fragmentation functions, together with the $K_S^0$ FFs constructed from $K^{\pm}$ FFs via isospin symmetry, are used to test isospin symmetry in kaon fragmentation. Although a definitive conclusion cannot be reached yet, these studies have identified several potential measurements that can be performed at existing facilities, which may ultimately help us to arrive at a conclusive answer. With the comprehensive species of FFs extracted within the NPC framework, we are able to perform a test on the momentum sum rule with the light-flavor charged and neutral hadrons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study addresses a challenge of parametrizing a resolution function of the neutron beam from the neutron time of flight facility n_TOF at CERN. A difficulty stems from a fact that a resolution function exhibits rather strong variations in shape, over approximately 10 orders of magnitude in neutron energy. In order to avoid a need for a manual identification of the appropriate analytical forms - hindering past attempts at its parametrization - we take advantage of the versatile machine learning techniques. In particular, we parametrize it by training a multilayer feedforward neural network, relying on a key idea that such networks act as the universal approximators. The proof of concept is presented for a resolution function for the first experimental area of the n_TOF facility, from the third phase of its operation. We propose an optimal network structure for a resolution function in question, which is also expected to be optimal or near-optimal for other experimental areas and for different phases of n_TOF operation. In order to reconstruct several resolution function forms in common use from a single parametrized form, we provide a practical tool in the form of a specialized C++ class encapsulating the computationally efficient procedures suited to the task. Specifically, the class allows an application of a user-specified temporal spread of a primary proton beam (from a neutron production process at n_TOF) to a desired resolution function form.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the threshold $T$ matrices of the meson and baryon processes that have no annihilation diagrams: $\pi^{+}\Sigma^{+}$, $\pi^{+}\Xi^0$, $K^+p$, $K^+n$, and $\bar{K}^0\Xi^0$ to the fourth order in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory. By performing least squares and Bayesian fits to the non-physical lattice QCD data, we determine the low-energy constants through both perturbative and non-perturbative iterative methods. By using these low-energy constants, we obtain the physical scattering lengths in these fits. The convergence behavior is not good across all channels in the perturbative method. The scattering lengths for the five channels, obtained by taking the median values from four different fitting approaches, are $a_{\pi^+\Sigma^+}=-0.16\pm 0.07\,\text{fm}$, $a_{\pi^+\Xi^0}=-0.04\pm0.04\,\text{fm}$, $a_{K^+p}=-0.41\pm 0.11\,\text{fm}$, $a_{K^+n}=-0.19\pm 0.10\,\text{fm}$, and $a_{\bar{K}^0\Xi^0}=-0.30\pm 0.07\,\text{fm}$, where the uncertainties are conservatively estimated by taking the maximum deviation between the median and extreme values of the statistical errors.</description>

      <title>Extended momentum-dependent interaction for transport models and neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The momentum-dependent interaction (MDI) model, which has been widely used in microscopic transport models for heavy-ion collisions (HICs), is extended to include three different momentum-dependent terms and three zero-range density-dependent terms, dubbed as MDI3Y model. Compared to the MDI model, the single-nucleon potential in the MDI3Y model exhibits more flexible momentum-dependent behaviors. Furthermore, the inclusion of three zero-range density-dependent interactions follows the idea of Fermi momentum expansion, allowing more flexible variation for the largely uncertain high-density behaviors of nuclear matter equation of state (EOS), especially the symmetry energy. Moreover, we also obtain the corresponding Skyrme-like energy density functional through density matrix expansion of the finite-range exchange interactions. Based on the MDI3Y model, we construct four interactions with the same symmetry energy slope parameter $L=35$ MeV but different momentum dependence of $U_{\mathrm{sym}}$, by fitting the empirical nucleon optical potential, the empirical properties of symmetric nuclear matter, the microscopic calculations of pure neutron matter EOS and the astrophysical constraints on neutron stars. In addition, two interactions with $L=55$ and $75$ MeV are also constructed for comparison. Using these MDI3Y interactions, we study the properties of nuclear matter and neutron stars. These MDI3Y interactions, especially those with non-monotonic momentum dependence of $U_{\mathrm{sym}}$, will be potentially useful in transport model analyses of HICs data to extract nuclear matter EOS and the isospin splitting of nucleon effective masses.</description>
