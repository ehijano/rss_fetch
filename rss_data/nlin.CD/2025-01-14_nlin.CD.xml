      <title>Construction of approximate invariants for non-integrable Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to construct high-order polynomial approximate invariants (AI) for non-integrable Hamiltonian dynamical systems, and apply it to modern ring-based particle accelerators. Taking advantage of a special property of one-turn transformation maps in the form of a square matrix, AIs can be constructed order-by-order iteratively. Evaluating AI with simulation data, we observe that AI's fluctuation is actually a measure of chaos. Through minimizing the fluctuations with control knobs in accelerators, the stable region of long-term motions could be enlarged.</description>

      <title>Vibrational resonance in the FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron model under state-dependent time delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a nonlinear one-dimensional FitzHugh--Nagumo neuronal model with an asymmetric potential driven by both a high-frequency and a low-frequency signal. Our numerical analysis focuses on the influence of a state-dependent time delay on vibrational resonance and delay-induced resonance phenomena. The response amplitude at the low-frequency is explored to characterize the vibrational resonance and delay-induced resonance. By this effort, we realize that for smaller values of the amplitude of the state-dependent time-delay velocity component, vibrational resonance and multi-resonance occur in the neuronal model. For large values of the high-frequency excitation amplitude, vibrational resonance appears with one peak. We observe a decrease in the response when the amplitude of the state-dependent time-delay velocity component increases. Also, we analyze how the state-dependent time-delay position and velocity components can give birth to delay-induced resonance for separate and together. The main results of this work are that the state-dependent time-delay velocity component can play a major role in both phenomena. In fact the parameter of the delay can control the triggering of the two resonances.</description>

      <title>Excitation and inhibition imbalance affects dynamical complexity through symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.11738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From the perfect radial symmetries of radiolarian mineral skeletons to the broken symmetry of homochirality, the logic of Nature's regularities has fascinated scientists for centuries. Some of Nature's symmetries are clearly visible in morphology and physical structure, whereas others are hidden in the network of interactions among system components. Just as visible symmetries and asymmetries contribute to the system's beauty, might hidden symmetries contribute to the system's functional harmony? And if so, how? Here we demonstrate that the interaction networks of biological systems from cell signaling to cancer display a form of dynamical reflection symmetry that serves to expand their dynamical complexity. The expansion proceeds according to precise rules regarding the lengths of dynamical cycles, made possible by a peculiar imbalance between excitation and inhibition. To probe the conditions under which this reflection symmetry evolves, we use a multi-objective genetic algorithm to produce networks with long dynamical cycles. We find that local structural motifs that break the reflection symmetry are deleted in the evolutionary process, providing evidence for symmetry's causal role in dynamical complexity. Finally, we identify symmetries in real continuous-valued scRNA-seq data of gene expression in drug-resistant cancer cells. Broadly, our work reveals a class of hidden symmetries in biology, present in the network of interactions among system components, and it underscores their functional importance. Mathematically simple and computational inexpensive, our approach is applicable to the types of biological data commonly acquired in modern experiments.</description>

      <title>Mean field coupled dynamical systems: Bifurcations and phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11076v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a bifurcation theory for infinite dimensional systems satisfying abstract hypotheses that are tailored for applications to mean field coupled chaotic maps. Our abstract theory can be applied to many cases, from globally coupled expanding maps to globally coupled Axiom A diffeomorphisms. To illustrate the range of applicability, we analyze an explicit example consisting of globally coupled Anosov diffeomorphisms. For such an example, we classify all the invariant measures as the coupling strength varies; we show which invariant measures are physical, and we prove that the existence of multiple invariant physical measures is a purely infinite dimensional phenomenon, i.e., the model exhibits phase transitions in the sense of statistical mechanics.</description>
