      <title>Scale-free behavior of weight distributions of connectomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To determine the precise link between form and function, brain studies primarily concentrate on the anatomical wiring of the brain and its topological properties. In this work, we investigate the weighted degree and connection length distributions of the KKI-113 and KKI-18 human connectomes, the fruit fly, and of the mouse retina. We found that the node strength (weighted degree) distribution behavior differs depending on the considered scale. On the global scale, the distributions are found to follow a power-law behavior, with a roughly universal exponent close to 3. However, this behavior breaks at the local scale as the node strength distributions of the KKI-18 follow a stretched exponential, and the fly and mouse retina follow the log-normal distribution, respectively which are indicative of underlying random multiplicative processes and underpins non-locality of learning in a brain close to the critical state. However, for the case of the KKI-113 and the H01 human (1mm$^3$) datasets, the local weighted degree distributions follow an exponentially truncated power-law, which may hint at the fact that the critical learning mechanism may have manifested at the node level too.</description>

      <title>Fading ergodicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) represents a breakthrough in many-body physics since it allows to link thermalization of physical observables with the applicability of random matrix theory (RMT). Recent years were also extremely fruitful in exploring possible counterexamples to thermalization, ranging, among others, from integrability, single-particle chaos, many-body localization, many-body scars, to Hilbert-space fragmentation. In all these cases the conventional ETH is violated. However, it remains elusive how the conventional ETH breaks down when one approaches the boundaries of ergodicity, and whether the range of validity of the conventional ETH coincides with the validity of RMT-like spectral statistics. Here we bridge this gap and we introduce a scenario of the ETH breakdown in many-body quantum systems, which establishes a link between the conventional ETH and non-ergodic behavior. We conjecture this scenario to be relevant for the description of finite many-body systems at the boundaries of ergodicity, and we provide numerical and analytical arguments for its validity in the quantum sun model of ergodicity breaking phase transition. For the latter, we provide evidence that the breakdown of the conventional ETH is not associated with the breakdown of the RMT-like spectral statistics.</description>

      <title>Dissipation induced ergodic-nonergodic transitions in finite-height mosaic Wannier-Stark lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has observed the occurrence of pseudo-mobility edge (ME) within a modulated mosaic model incorporating the Wannier-Stark potential. This pseudo-ME, which signifies the critical energy that distinguishes between ergodic and weakly ergodic, or weakly ergodic and nonergodic states, is a crucial concept in comprehending the transport and localization phenomena in Wannier-Stark systems. Here we investigate the influence of dissipation on a finite-height mosaic Wannier-Stark lattice that features such pseudo-MEs by computing the steady state density matrix. Our findings indicate that particular dissipation can steer the system into specific states, regardless of its initial state, predominantly characterized by either ergodic or nonergodic states. This suggests that dissipation can be harnessed as a novel method for inducing transitions between these states and manipulating particle localization behaviors in disorder-free systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties of diluted hexaferrites</title>

Abstract: We revisit the magnetic properties of the hexagonal ferrite PbFe$_{12-x}$Ga$_x$O$_{19}$. Recent experiments have reported puzzling dependencies of the ordering temperature and the saturation magnetization on the Ga concentration $x$. To explain these observations, we perform large-scale Monte Carlo simulations, focusing on the effects of an unequal distribution of the Ga impurities over the five distinct Fe sublattices. Ab-initio density-functional calculations predict that the Ga ions preferably occupy the $12k$ sublattice and (to a lesser extent) the $2a$ sublattice. We incorporate this insight into a nonuniform model of the Ga distribution. Monte Carlo simulations using this model lead to an excellent agreement between the theoretical and experimental values of the ordering temperature and saturation magnetization, indicating that the unequal distribution of the Ga impurities is the main reason for the unusual magnetic properties of PbFe$_{12-x}$Ga$_x$O$_{19}$. We also compute the temperature and concentration dependencies of the sublattice magnetizations, and we study the character of the zero-temperature transition that takes place when the ordering temperature is tuned to zero.</description>

      <title>Conditioning the complexity of random landscapes on marginal optima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Marginal optima are minima or maxima of a function with many nearly flat directions. In settings with many competing optima, marginal ones tend to attract algorithms and physical dynamics. Often, the important family of marginal attractors are a vanishing minority compared with nonmarginal optima and other unstable stationary points. We introduce a generic technique for conditioning the statistics of stationary points in random landscapes on their marginality, and apply it in three isotropic settings with qualitatively different structure: in the spherical spin-glasses, where the energy is Gaussian and its Hessian is GOE; in multispherical spin glasses, which are Gaussian but non-GOE; and in sums of squared spherical random functions, which are non-Gaussian. In these problems we are able to fully characterize the distribution of marginal optima in the landscape, including when they are in the minority.</description>

      <title>Algorithm-independent bounds on complex optimization through the statistics of marginal optima</title>

Abstract: Optimization seeks extremal points in a function. When there are superextensively many optima, optimization algorithms are liable to get stuck. Under these conditions, generic algorithms tend to find marginal optima, which have many nearly flat directions. In a companion paper, we introduce a technique to count marginal optima in random landscapes. Here, we use the statistics of marginal optima calculated using this technique to produce generic bounds on optimization, based on the simple principle that algorithms will overwhelmingly tend to get stuck only where marginal optima are found. We demonstrate the idea on a simple non-Gaussian problem of maximizing the sum of squared random functions on a compact space. Numeric experiments using both gradient descent and generalized approximate message passing algorithms fall inside the expected bounds.</description>

      <title>Experimentally validated and empirically compared machine learning approach for predicting yield strength of additively manufactured multi-principal element alloys from Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditionally, yield strength prediction relies on detailed and resource-intensive microstructural characterization combined with empirical equations. However, quantifying microstructural feature length scales for novel processes like additive manufacturing, which involves inhomogeneous hierarchical features, poses a challenge. The lack of accurate material constants for broader composition ranges further limits empirical predictions. This study proposes an alternative machine learning (ML) approach for predicting the yield strength of additively manufactured (AM) multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) from the Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni system by correlating composition, printing parameters, and testing conditions. The best-performing ML model achieved an R2 of 0.84, comparable to that achieved using microstructural detail-driven empirical strengthening contributions. The validity of the ML approach was further confirmed by printing and testing two compositions (one novel and one from the dataset). This data-driven approach directly relates yield strength to initial printing parameters, highlighting their significance and individual effects, such as scan velocity's direct impact and laser power's inverse impact on yield strength. This demonstrates ML's potential to guide AM processes, reducing the need for iterative experiments and enabling rapid exploration of compositional and printing spaces to achieve desired properties.</description>
