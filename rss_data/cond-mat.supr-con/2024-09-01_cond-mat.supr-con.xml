      <title>Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers with Plasma oscillation phase-matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High gain and large bandwidth of traveling-wave parametric amplifier exploiting the nonlinearity of Josephson Junctions can be achieved by fulfilling the so-called phase-matching condition. This condition is usually addressed by placing resonant structures along the waveguide or by periodic modulations of its parameters, creating gaps in the waveguide's dispersion. Here, we propose to employ the Josephson junctions, which constitute the centerline of the amplifier, as resonant elements for phase matching. By numerical simulations in JoSIM (and WRspice) software, we show that Josephson plasma oscillations can be utilized to create wavevector mismatch sufficient for phase matching as well as to prevent the conversion of the pump energy to higher harmonics. The proposed TWPA design has a gain of 15 dB and a 3.5 GHz bandwidth, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art TWPAs.</description>

      <title>Structural Evolution from Hyper-Honeycomb to Honeycomb Networks and Superconductivity in LaPt$_x$Si$_{2-x}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the crystal structures and superconductivity (SC) of LaPt$_{x}$Si$_{2-x}$ ($0.5 \leq x \leq 1.0$) that are solid solutions of LaSi$_{2}$ and LaPtSi with centrosymmetric tetragonal ($I4_{1}/amd$, $D_{4h}^{19}$, \#141) and non-centrosymmetric tetragonal ($I4_{1}md$, $C_{4v}^{11}$, \#109) structures, respectively. It was found that at $0.86 \leq x \leq 1.00$, the non-centrosymmetric tetragonal symmetry is preserved, while partial disorder appears in alternating Pt and Si of the hyper-honeycomb network. The superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ was drastically reduced from 3.9 K to 1.5 K as $x$ varies from 1.0 to 0.86. Additionally, a hexagonal phase with an AlB$_{2}$-type structure ($P6/mmm$, $D_{6h}^{1}$, \#191) has been discovered at $0.50 \leq x \leq 0.71$ with a honeycomb network of statistically distributed Pt and Si atoms. The hexagonal phase exhibited SC at $T_{\rm c} = 0.38$ K. This system provides an opportunity to investigate the relationship between topological electronic states, SC, and disorders</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium regimes for quasiparticles in superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qubits with gap asymmetry larger than their transition energy are less susceptible to quasiparticle decoherence as the quasiparticles are mostly trapped in the low-gap side of the junction. Because of this trapping, the gap asymmetry can contribute to maintaining the quasiparticles out of equilibrium. Here we address the temperature evolution of the quasiparticle densities in the two sides of the junction. We show that four qualitatively different regimes are possible with increasing temperature: i) nonequilibrium, ii) local quasiequilibrium, iii) global quasiequilibrium, and iv) full equilibrium. We identify shortcomings in assuming global quasiequilibrium when interpreting experimental data, highlighting how measurements in the presence of magnetic field can aid the accurate determination of the junction parameters, and hence the identification of the nonequilibrium regimes.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Superconducting Niobium Nitride Thin Films via High-Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a systematic comparison of niobium nitride thin films deposited on oxidized silicon substrates by reactive DC magnetron sputtering and reactive high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS). After determining the nitrogen gas concentration that produces the highest superconducting critical temperature for each process, we characterize the dependence of the critical temperature on film thickness. The optimal nitrogen concentration is higher for HiPIMS than for DC sputtering, and HiPIMS produces higher critical temperatures for all thicknesses studied. We attribute this to the HiPIMS process enabling the films to get closer to optimal stoichiometry before beginning to form a hexagonal crystal phase that reduces the critical temperature, along with the extra kinetic energy in the HiPIMS process enabling greater adatom mobility and improving crystallinity. We also study the effects of an aluminum nitride buffer layer and substrate heating on the critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in pressurized Re$_{0.10}$Mo$_{0.90}$B$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent surprising discovery of superconductivity with critical temperature $T_c$ = 32 K in MoB$_2$ above 70 GPa has led to the search for related materials that may superconduct at similarly high $T_c$ values and lower pressures. We have studied the superconducting and structural properties of Re$_{0.10}$Mo$_{0.90}$B$_2$ to 170 GPa. A structural phase transition from R3m to P6/mmm commences at 48 GPa, with the first signatures of superconductivity appearing above 44 GPa. The critical temperature is observed to increase with pressure. A complete resistive transition is observed only above 150 GPa, where the highest onset $T_c$ of 30 K is also achieved. Upon releasing pressure, the high pressure superconducting phase is found to be metastable. During unloading, a complete resistive superconducting transition is observed all the way down to 20 GPa (with onset $T_c \sim 20$ K). Our results suggest that the P6/mmm structure is responsible for the observed superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian multiterminal phase-biased Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study non-Hermitian Josephson junctions formed by multiple superconductors and discover the emergence of exceptional points entirely determined by the interplay of the distinct superconducting phases and non-Hermiticity due to normal reservoirs. In particular, in Josephson junctions with three and four superconductors, we find stable lines and surfaces of exceptional points protected by non-Hermitian topology and highly tuneable by the superconducting phases. We also discover that, in Josephson junctions formed by laterally coupled superconductors, exceptional points can result from hybridized Andreev bound states and lead to the enhancement of supercurrents controlled by dissipation. Our work unveils the potential of multi-terminal Josephson junctions for realizing higher dimensional topological non-Hermitian superconducting phenomena.</description>

      <title>A Large-$N$ Approach to Magnetic Impurities in Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin impurities coupled to superconductors are under intense investigation for their relevance to fundamental research as well as the prospects to engineer novel quantum phases of matter. Here we develop a large-$N$ mean-field theory of a strongly coupled spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ quantum impurity in a conventional $s$-wave superconductor. The approach is benchmarked against Wilson's numerical renormalization group (NRG). While the large-$N$ method is not applicable in the weak-coupling regime where the Kondo temperature $T_K$ is smaller than the superconducting gap $\Delta$, it performs very well in the strong coupling regime where $T_K \gtrsim \Delta$, thus allowing to obtain a reasonably accurate description of experimentally relevant quantities. The latter includes the energy of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov subgap states, their spectral weight, as well as the local density of continuum states. The method provides a reliable analytical tool that complements other perturbative and non-perturbative methods, and can be extended to more complex impurity models for which NRG may be not easily applicable.</description>

      <title>Increasing superconducting $T_c$ by layering in the attractive Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The attractive Hubbard model has become a model readily realizable with ultracold atoms on optical lattices. However, the superconducting (superfluid) critical temperatures, $T_c$'s, are still somewhat smaller than the lowest temperatures achieved in experiments. Here we consider two possible routes, generically called layering, to increase $T_c$: a bilayer and a simple cubic lattice, both with tunable hopping, $t_z$, between attractive Hubbard planes. We have performed minus-sign--free determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations to calculate response functions such as pairing correlation functions, uniform spin susceptibility, and double occupancy, through which we map out some physical properties. We have found that by a judicious choice of fillings and intensity of on-site attraction, a bilayer can exhibit $T_c$'s between 1.5 and 1.7 times those of the single layer; for the simple-cubic lattice the enhancement can be 30\% larger than the maximum for the single layer. We also check the accuracy of both a BCS-like estimate for $T_c$ in the attractive Hubbard model, as well as of an upper bound for $T_c$ based on the superfluid density.</description>

      <title>Quenched pair breaking by interlayer correlations as a key to superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17465v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with $T_\mathrm{c} \simeq 80~\mathrm{K}$ under high pressure opens up a new route to high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductivity. This material realizes a bilayer square lattice model featuring a strong interlayer hybridization unlike many unconventional superconductors. A key question in this regard concerns how electronic correlations driven by the interlayer hybridization affect the low-energy electronic structure and the concomitant superconductivity. Here, we demonstrate using a cluster dynamical mean-field theory that the interlayer electronic correlations (IECs) induce a Lifshitz transition resulting in a change of Fermi surface topology. By solving an appropriate gap equation, we further show that the leading pairing instability, $s \pm$-wave, is enhanced by the IECs. The underlying mechanism is the quenching of a strong ferromagnetic channel, resulting from the Lifshitz transition driven by the IECs. Based on this picture, we provide a possible reason of why superconductivity emerges only under high pressure.</description>

      <title>Debye temperature, electron-phonon coupling constant, and three-dome shape of crystalline strain as a function of pressure in highly compressed La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00804v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Besides ongoing studies of phase structural transitions, pairing mechanism, and physical properties of recently discovered highly compressed high-temperature superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$, here we explored a possibility for the electron-phonon pairing mechanism as an origin of the superconducting state and determined the microcrystalline strain, $\epsilon(P)$, in high pressure $Fmmm$-phase, and low-pressure $Ammm$-phase of this nickelate. To do this, we analyzed temperature dependent resistance and extracted pressure dependent Debye temperature, $\Theta_D(P)$, in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ with an approximate value of $\Theta_D(P = 25 GPa) = 550$ $K$. From this we established that the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ is strong-coupled superconductor with the electron-phonon coupling constant $\lambda_{e-ph}(P=22.4 GPa) = 1.75$. This value is close to $\lambda_{e-ph} = 1.70$ of ambient pressure superconductors $Nb_3R (R = Sn, Al)$. To address ongoing discussion that the lattice strain can be the origin for the emergence of high-temperature superconductivity in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$, we determined the microcrystalline strain, $0.011 &lt; \epsilon(P)$, in the high-pressure $Fmmm$-phase, and $\epsilon(P) &lt; 0.011$ of low-pressure $Fmmm$-phase. Our analysis showed that $\epsilon(P)$ has three-dome shape in the pressure range of $1.6 GPa &lt; P &lt; 41.2 GPa$. One of these two $\epsilon(P)$ deeps at $P \approx 15 GPa$ coincides with the pressure at which the $Ammm$-phase into the $Fmmm$-phase phase transition occurs. Based on our analysis, we proposed probable condition to observe the zero-resistance state in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Significant research has recently been conducted into the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states in kagome superconductors through theoretical modeling and experimental investigations. However, additional efforts are still needed to further understand the local superconductivity near magnetic impurities in the kagome lattice and clarify how relevant quantities depend on the interaction strength $J$ between such impurities and electrons. In this study, we explore a self-consistent numerical solution of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations for an $s$-wave superconducting kagome model with a single classical magnetic impurity. Our study reveals that with increasing $J$, the local pair potential is systematically depressed in the vicinity of the impurity, similar to previous results obtained for the square and triangular lattices. Moreover, when further increasing $J$, the system undergoes a first-order phase transition with the appearance of stable and metastable states, reflecting the presence of the hysteresis loop in the pertinent quantities. As a consequence of this transition, the minimal energy of the stable YSR state is nonzero at any $J$, contrary to the expectations based on the assumption of a constant pair potential. A distinctive feature of the kagome lattice is that characteristics of the first-order transition are very sensitive to the position of the chemical potential within the kagome energy spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14764v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting resonators play a crucial role in developing forthcoming quantum technologies such as quantum computing or high performance detectors. Yet, one of their main limitations regarding to noise and sensitivity is the interaction with two-level systems present in oxide layers in the device. Focused on mitigating this problem, we study a superconducting device combining a niobium circuit with a 10 nm gold capping layer. Our investigation covers a wide range of temperatures and driving powers, revealing that adding the Au layer reduces the density of two-level system defects while maintaining a very high quality factor. Moreover, an increase in the non-linearity response is also observed. Our findings suggest the potential of Nb/Au lumped element resonators as versatile and promising tools for advancing superconducting quantum technologies. Among others, the presence of gold allows anchoring alkyl thiol groups to form self-assembled monolayers, improving the integration with molecular spin qubits for the development of hybrid quantum processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03073v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting transition-edge sensors (TESs) are a type of quantum sensor known for its high single-photon detection efficiency and low background. This makes them ideal for particle physics experiments searching for rare events. In this work, we present a comprehensive characterization of the background in optical TESs, distinguishing three types of events: electrical-noise, high-energy, and photonlike events. We introduce computational methods to automate the classification of events. For the first time, we experimentally verify and simulate the source of the high-energy events. We also isolate the photonlike events, the expected signal in dielectric haloscopes searching for dark matter dark photons, and achieve a record-low photonlike dark-count rate of $3.6 \times 10^{-4}$ Hz in the 0.8-3.2 eV energy range.</description>

Abstract: Quantum error correction enables the preservation of logical qubits with a lower logical error rate than the physical error rate, with performance depending on the decoding method. Traditional error decoding approaches, relying on the binarization (`hardening') of readout data, often ignore valuable information embedded in the analog (`soft') readout signal. We present experimental results showcasing the advantages of incorporating soft information into the decoding process of a distance-three ($d=3$) bit-flip surface code with transmons. To this end, we use the $3\times3$ data-qubit array to encode each of the $16$ computational states that make up the logical state $\ket{0_{\mathrm{L}}}$, and protect them against bit-flip errors by performing repeated $Z$-basis stabilizer measurements. To infer the logical fidelity for the $\ket{0_{\mathrm{L}}}$ state, we average across the $16$ computational states and employ two decoding strategies: minimum weight perfect matching and a recurrent neural network. Our results show a reduction of up to $6.8\%$ in the extracted logical error rate with the use of soft information. Decoding with soft information is widely applicable, independent of the physical qubit platform, and could reduce the readout duration, further minimizing logical error rates.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors are widely used for detecting individual photons across various wavelengths from ultraviolet to near-infrared range. Recently, there has been increasing interest in enhancing their sensitivity to single photons in the mid-infrared spectrum, driven by applications in quantum communication, spectroscopy and astrophysics. Here, we present our efforts to expand the spectral detection capabilities of U-shaped NbTiN-based superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, fabricated in a 2-wire configuration on a silicon-on-insulator substrate, into the mid-infrared range. We demonstrate saturated internal detection efficiency extending up to a wavelength of 3.5 {\mu}m for a 5 nm thick and 50 nm wide NbTiN nanowire with a dark count rate less than 10 counts per second at 0.9 K and a rapid recovery time of 4.3 ns. The detectors are engineered for integration on waveguides in a silicon-on-insulator platform for compact, multi-channel device applications.</description>
