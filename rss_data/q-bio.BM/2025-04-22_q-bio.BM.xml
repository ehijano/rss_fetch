      <title>GenShin:geometry-enhanced structural graph embodies binding pose can better predicting compound-protein interaction affinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-powered drug discovery typically relies on the successful prediction of compound-protein interactions, which are pivotal for the evaluation of designed compound molecules in structure-based drug design and represent a core challenge in the field.
  However, accurately predicting compound-protein affinity via regression models usually requires adequate-binding pose, which are derived from costly and complex experimental methods or time-consuming simulations with docking software. In response, we have introduced the GenShin model, which constructs a geometry-enhanced structural graph module that separately extracts additional features from proteins and compounds. Consequently, it attains an accuracy on par with mainstream models in predicting compound-protein affinities, while eliminating the need for adequate-binding pose as input. Our experimental findings demonstrate that the GenShin model vastly outperforms other models that rely on non-input docking conformations, achieving, or in some cases even exceeding, the performance of those requiring adequate-binding pose. Further experiments indicate that our GenShin model is more robust to inadequate-binding pose, affirming its higher suitability for real-world drug discovery scenarios. We hope our work will inspire more endeavors to bridge the gap between AI models and practical drug discovery challenges.</description>

      <title>From sequence to protein structure and conformational dynamics with AI/ML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded in part for protein structure prediction using AlphaFold2, an artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) model trained on vast amounts of sequence and 3D structure data. AlphaFold2 and related models, including RoseTTAFold and ESMFold, employ specialized neural network architectures driven by attention mechanisms to infer relationships between sequence and structure. At a fundamental level, these AI/ML models operate on the long-standing hypothesis that the structure of a protein is determined by its amino acid sequence. More recently, AlphaFold2 has been adapted for the prediction of multiple protein conformations by subsampling multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). The deterministic relationship between sequence and structure was hypothesized over half a century ago with profound implications for the biological sciences ever since. Based on this relationship, we hypothesize that protein conformational dynamics are also determined, at least in part, by amino acid sequence and that this relationship may be leveraged for construction of AI/ML models dedicated to predicting ensembles of protein structures (i.e., distinct conformations). Accordingly, we conceptualized an AI/ML model architecture which may be trained on sequence data in combination with conformationally-sensitive structure data, coming primarily from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Sequence-informed prediction of protein structural dynamics has the potential to emerge as a transformative capability across the biological sciences, and its implementation could very well be on the horizon.</description>

      <title>Beyond Sequence: Impact of Geometric Context for RNA Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of RNA properties, such as stability and interactions, is crucial for advancing our understanding of biological processes and developing RNA-based therapeutics. RNA structures can be represented as 1D sequences, 2D topological graphs, or 3D all-atom models, each offering different insights into its function. Existing works predominantly focus on 1D sequence-based models, which overlook the geometric context provided by 2D and 3D geometries. This study presents the first systematic evaluation of incorporating explicit 2D and 3D geometric information into RNA property prediction, considering not only performance but also real-world challenges such as limited data availability, partial labeling, sequencing noise, and computational efficiency. To this end, we introduce a newly curated set of RNA datasets with enhanced 2D and 3D structural annotations, providing a resource for model evaluation on RNA data. Our findings reveal that models with explicit geometry encoding generally outperform sequence-based models, with an average prediction RMSE reduction of around 12% across all various RNA tasks and excelling in low-data and partial labeling regimes, underscoring the value of explicitly incorporating geometric context. On the other hand, geometry-unaware sequence-based models are more robust under sequencing noise but often require around $2-5\times$ training data to match the performance of geometry-aware models. Our study offers further insights into the trade-offs between different RNA representations in practical applications and addresses a significant gap in evaluating deep learning models for RNA tasks.</description>
