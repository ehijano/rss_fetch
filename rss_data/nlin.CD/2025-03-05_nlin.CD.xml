      <title>Enhanced quantum frequency estimation by nonlinear scrambling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01959</link>

Abstract: Frequency estimation, a cornerstone of basic and applied sciences, has been significantly enhanced by quantum sensing strategies. Despite breakthroughs in quantum-enhanced frequency estimation, key challenges remain: static probes limit flexibility, and the interplay between resource efficiency, sensing precision, and potential enhancements from nonlinear probes remains not fully understood. In this work, we show that dynamically encoding an unknown frequency in a nonlinear quantum electromagnetic field can significantly improve frequency estimation. To provide a fair comparison of resources, we define the energy cost as the figure of merit for our sensing strategy. We further show that specific higher-order nonlinear processes lead to nonlinear-enhanced frequency estimation. This enhancement results from quantum scrambling, where local quantum information spreads across a larger portion of the Hilbert space. We quantify this effect using the Wigner-Yanase skew information, which measures the degree of noncommutativity in the Hamiltonian structure. Our work sheds light on the connection between Wigner-Yanase skew information and quantum sensing, providing a direct method to optimize nonlinear quantum probes.</description>

      <title>Streams, Graphs and Global Attractors of Dynamical Systems on Locally Compact Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent article, we introduced the concept of streams and graphs of a semiflow. An important related concept is the one of semiflow with {\em compact dynamics}, which we defined as a semiflow $F$ with a {\em compact global trapping region}. In this follow-up, we restrict to the important case where the phase space $X$ is locally compact and we move the focus on the concept of {\em global attractor}, a maximal compact set that attracts every compact subset of $X$. A semiflow $F$ can have many global trapping regions but, if it has a global attractor, this is unique. We modify here our original definition and we say that $F$ has compact dynamics if it has a global attractor $G$. We show that most of the qualitative properties of $F$ are inherited by the restriction $F_G$ of $F$ to $G$ and that, in case of Conley's chains stream of $F$, the qualitative behavior of $F$ and $F_G$ coincide. Moreover, if $F$ is a continuous-time semiflow, then its graph is identical to the graph of its time-1 map. Our main result is that, for each semiflow $F$ with compact dynamics over a locally compact space, the graphs of the prolongational relation of $F$ and of every stream of $F$ are connected if the global attractor is connected.</description>

      <title>Further results for a family of continuous piecewise linear planar maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the family of piecewise linear maps $F(x,y)=\left(|x| - y + a, x - |y| + b\right),$ where $(a,b)\in \mathbb{R}^2$. In our previous work [10], we presented a comprehensive study of this family. In this paper, we give three new results that complement the ones presented in that reference. All them refer to the most interesting and complicated case, $a&lt;0$. For this case, the dynamics of each map is concentrated in a one-dimensional invariant graph that depend on $b$. In [10], we studied the dynamics of the family on these graphs. In particular, we described whether the topological entropy associated with the map on the graph is positive or zero in terms of the parameter $c=-b/a$. Among the results obtained, we found that there are points of discontinuity of the entropy in the transitions from positive to zero entropy. In this paper, as a first result, we present a detailed explicit analysis of the entropy behavior for the case $4&lt;c&lt;8$, which shows the continuity of this transition from positive to zero entropy. As a second result, we prove that for certain values of the parameter $c$, each invariant graph contains a subset of full Lebesgue measure where there are at most three distinct $\omega$-limit sets, which are periodic orbits when $c \in \mathbb{Q}$. Within the framework of the third result, we provide an explicit methodology to obtain accurate rational lower and upper bounds for the values of the parameter $c$ at which the transition from zero to positive entropy occurs.</description>

      <title>Deviations from spectral Dirac comb due to semiperiodic pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.15904v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the frequency power spectral density, periodic oscillations appear as a Dirac comb at integer multiples of the frequency of the period. In weakly nonlinear systems or systems close to the primary instability threshold, the periodicity may be perturbed, resulting in deviations from the Dirac comb. We present a stochastic model of such semiperiodic fluctuations, describing them as a superposition of pulses with a fixed shape. Closed form expressions are derived for the frequency power spectral density in the case of periodic pulse arrivals and a random distribution of pulse amplitudes and durations. In general, the spectrum is a Dirac comb located at multiples of the inverse periodicity time and modulated by the pulse spectrum. Deviations from strict periodicity in the arrivals are considered in two ways: either as a random offset to each periodic arrival (jitter) or as independently distributed waiting times between arrivals (renewal). Both ways remove the Dirac comb with remarkable efficiency, leaving mainly the spectrum of the pulse function. Where the jitter process modulates the mass of the higher harmonics, the renewal process leads to spectral broadening. We demonstrate the applicability of normally distributed waiting times to modelling. Contrary to the previous literature, we argue that negative waiting times do not pose problems for the theory, broadening the applicability of the normal approximation. Randomness in the pulse arrival times is investigated by numerical realizations of the process, and the model is used to describe time series of kinetic energy of fluctuating motions in two-dimensional thermal convection.</description>
