      <title>Regimes of rotating convection in an experimental model of the Earth's tangent cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth's fast rotation imposes the Taylor-Proudman Constraint that opposes fluid motion across an imaginary cylindrical surface called the Tangent Cylinder (TC) obtained by extruding the equatorial perimeter of the solid inner core along the rotation direction, and up to the core-mantle boundary (CMB). To date however, the influence of this boundary is unknown and this impedes our understanding of the flow in the polar regions of the core. We reproduce the TC geometry experimentally, where the CMB is modelled as a cold, cylindrical vessel, with a hot cylinder inside it acting as the inner solid core. The vessel is filled with water so as to optically map the velocity field in regimes of criticality and rotational constraint consistent with those of the Earth. We find that the main new mechanism arises out of the baroclinicity near the cold lateral boundary of the vessel, which drives inertia at the outer boundary of the TC, as convection in the equatorial regions of the Earth's core does. The baroclinicity just outside the TC suppresses the classical wall modes found in solid cylinder and the inertia there causes an early breakup of the TPC at the TC boundary. The flow remains dominated by the Coriolis force even up to criticality $\Rt=191$, but because of inertia near the TC boundary, geostrophic turbulence appears at much lower criticality than in other settings. The heat flux escapes increasingly through the TC boundary as the TPC becomes weaker. Hence inertia driven by baroclinicity outside the TC provides a convenient shortcut to geostrophic turbulence, which is otherwise difficult to reach in experiments. These results also highlight a process whereby the convection outside the TC may control turbulence inside it and bypass the axial heat transfer. We finally discuss how Earth's conditions, especially its magnetic field may change how this process acts within the Earth's core.</description>

      <title>Scaling of the geomagnetic secular variation time scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ratio of the Lowes spectrum and the secular variation spectrum measured at the Earth's surface provides a time scale $\tau_{\rm sv}(l)$ as a function of spherical harmonic degree $l$. $\tau_{\rm sv}$ is often assumed to be representative of time scales related to the dynamo inside the outer core and its scaling with $l$ is debated. To assess the validity of this surmise and to study the time variation of the geomagnetic field $\boldsymbol{\dot B}$ inside the outer core, we introduce a magnetic time-scale spectrum $\tau(l,r)$ that is valid for all radius $r$ above the inner core and reduces to the usual $\tau_{\rm sv}$ at and above the core-mantle boundary (CMB). We study $\tau$ in a numerical geodynamo model. Focusing on the large scales, we find that $\tau \sim l^{-1}$ at the CMB. Just below the CMB, $\tau$ undergo a sharp transition such that the scaling becomes shallower than $l^{-1}$. This transition stems from the magnetic boundary condition at the CMB that ties all three components of $\boldsymbol{\dot B}$ together. In the interior of the outer core, the time variation of the horizontal magnetic field, which dominates $\boldsymbol{\dot B}$, has no such constraint. The upshot is $\tau_{\rm sv}$ becomes unreliable in estimating time scales inside the outer core. Another question concerning $\tau$ is whether a scaling argument based on the frozen-flux hypothesis can be used to explain its scaling. To investigate this, we analyse the induction equation in the spectral space. We find that away from both boundaries, the magnetic diffusion term is negligible in the power spectrum of $\boldsymbol{\dot B}$. However, $\boldsymbol{\dot B}$ is controlled by the radial derivative in the induction term, thus invalidating the frozen-flux argument. Near the CMB, magnetic diffusion starts to affect $\boldsymbol{\dot B}$ rendering the frozen-flux hypothesis inapplicable.</description>
