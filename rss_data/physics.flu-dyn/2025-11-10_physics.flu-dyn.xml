      <title>Stresses and fluid flow in lamina cribrosa through anisotropic poroelasticty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To explore the possible mechanical correlations between intraocular pressure (IOP) variations and glaucoma, this study presents a transversely isotropic poroelastic model of the Lamina Cribrosa (LC) based on Reissner Mindlin plate theory, ultimately highlighting the interplay between solid matrix deformation and blood flow behavior under pathological conditions. Starting from poroelasticity theory, the equilibrium equations governing the LC were formulated and analytically solved by applying appropriate mechanical and hydraulic boundary conditions. The results indicate that both strain and stress measures (in the form of shear strain and von Mises stress) peak in the peripheral region of the LC, which is currently suspected to be the initial site of glaucomatous damage. These quantities increase with IOP, suggesting a pressure-dependent mechanical insult to the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons. In parallel, the model predicts a monotonic reduction in fluid content as IOP rises, which may contribute to ischemic phenomena and disc haemorrhages. The influence of material anisotropy was also examined, revealing that isotropic assumptions tend to underestimate the fluid content while overestimating shear strain. Given the current experimental challenges in measuring blood flow within the LC, the proposed model provides a valuable framework for exploring the coupled mechanical hemodynamic behavior of the tissue and for inverse estimation of its mechanical parameters, such as the stiffness of the opening for the central retinal vessels.</description>

      <title>Train yourself: self-compressing reduced-order models of turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) of turbulent flows based on Galerkin projection often require many degrees of freedom to resolve the dynamics of the turbulence, or simulation data to obtain an optimal modal basis. However, obtaining simulation data is computationally expensive, and the amount of data required to obtain a converged modal basis can increase this cost. Using the linearized Navier-Stokes equations, one can achieve spatial modes through the controllability and observability Gramians, which can yield a ROM without prior simulation data. In this work, we propose a self-compression of a ROM based on controllability modes, where the time series of the modal coefficients are leveraged to reduce the dimension of the ROM. In the self-compressed ROM (SCROM), we can maintain accurate first- and second-order statistics with respect to the DNS simulation, but in a further reduced dimension. The self-reduced ROM recovers spatial structures equivalent to proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) without relying on any simulation data, recombining spatial modes from linearized equations. This method leads to a novel ROM that can represent turbulence statistics in a data-free approach in a further reduced state space.</description>

      <title>Unstable drainage dynamics during multiphase flow across capillary heterogeneities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use novel, fast 4D Synchrotron X-ray imaging with large field-of-view to reveal pore- and macro-scale drainage dynamics during gas-brine flow through a layered sandstone rock sample. We show that a single centimetre-scale layer, similar in pore size distribution to the surrounding rock but with reduced connectivity, temporarily inhibits and redirects gas flow, acting as a capillary barrier. Subtle variations in gas invasion upstream of the barrier lead to different downstream migration pathways over repeated experiments, resulting in unstable and unpredictable drainage behaviour, with breakthrough times varying by up to a factor of four. The results show that heterogeneity in pore-scale connectivity can amplify variability in macroscopic flow, challenging deterministic assumptions in existing continuum models. By linking structural heterogeneity to flow instability, this work underscores the need for probabilistic modelling approaches in multiphase flow and highlights broader implications for managing fluid transport in natural and engineered porous systems.</description>

      <title>Rate dependency of capillary heterogeneity trapping for CO2 storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we experimentally quantify and analytically model rate dependent capillary heterogeneity trapping. Capillary heterogeneity trapping enhances non-wetting fluid trapping beyond pore-scale residual trapping through the isolation of non-wetting phase upstream of heterogeneities in the continuum capillary pressure characteristics. Whilst residual trapping is largely insensitive to the range of flow regimes prevalent in engineered reservoir settings, continuum theory anticipates that capillary heterogeneity trapping will be more sensitive to the balance of viscous and capillary forces that occur.
  We perform steady-state drainage and imbibition multiphase flow experiments at varying flow rate on a layered Bentheimer sample with in-situ medical X-ray CT scanning to quantify saturation. Saturation discontinuities are observed upstream of capillary pressure barriers as a result of capillary pressure discontinuities, trapping the non-wetting phase at a saturation greater than pore-scale residual trapping alone. We confirm the flow rate dependence predicted by theory whereby the relationship between the initial and residual saturations approach a 1:1 dependence as flow rate is decreased. We develop a one-dimensional analytical model to quantify the proportion of capillary heterogeneity trapping in the system and the dimensionless trapping length scale, which agrees with the experimental data and allows for rapid estimates of trapping up to the field-scale.</description>

      <title>Neural Network for Subgrid Turbulence Modeling for Large Eddy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When simulating multiscale systems, where some fields cannot be fully prescribed despite their effects on the simulation's accuracy, closure models are needed. This behavior is observed in turbulent fluid dynamics, where Large Eddy Simulations (LES) depict global behavior while turbulence modeling introduces dissipation correspondent to smaller sub-grid scales. Recently, scientific machine learning techniques have emerged to address this problem by integrating traditional (physics-based) equations with data-driven (machine-learned) models, typically coupling numerical solvers with neural networks. This work presents a comprehensive workflow, encompassing high-fidelity data generation, a priori learning, and a posteriori learning, where data-driven models enhance differential equations. The study underscores the critical role of post-processing and effective filtering of fine-resolution fields and the implications numerical methods selection, such as the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) or Finite Volume Method.</description>

      <title>Settling dynamics of an oloid: experiments and simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a combined experimental and computational investigation of an oloid shaped particle settling in a quiescent fluid. The oloid, a unique convex shape with anisotropic geometry, provides a distinctive model for exploring how a particle's shape and orientation affect its settling dynamics. The settling oloids are tracked experimentally for Galileo numbers $48 \leq \text{Ga} \leq 5.4 \cdot 10^3$, using two particle sizes ($D_{\text{eq}}$ = 21.6 mm, and $D_{\text{eq}}$ = 10.8 mm). The density ratio between the particle and fluid $\Gamma$ = $\frac{\rho_p}{\rho_f}$ ranges from $1.11 \leq \Gamma \leq 1.30$ in the experiments. Computationally, the Galileo numbers $10 \leq \text{Ga} \leq 100$ are simulated, with $\Gamma = 2$. The experimental findings and numerical results are in good agreement, and give a consistent idea of the oloid settling dynamics. Our results indicate two distinct falling modes for the oloid, separated by Galileo number. The stable mode is characterised by a preferential orientation, with a rotation around the vertical axis, whereas the tumbling mode has randomly distributed orientation and rotation statistics. We characterise the falling velocity, orientation, and rotation dynamics of the oloids over a range of Galileo numbers. Additionally, the influence of the initial orientation is revealed to determine the rotation dynamics at low Galileo numbers.</description>

      <title>A multiple-scales framework for branched channel filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fibres shed from our clothes during a washing machine cycle constitute around 35% of the primary microplastics in our oceans. Current conventional dead-end washing machine filters clog relatively quickly and require frequent cleaning. We consider a new concept, ricochet separation, inspired by the feeding process of manta rays, to reduce the cleaning frequency. In such a device, some fluid is diverted through branched channels whilst particles ricochet off the wall structure, forcing them back into the main flow and then into the dead-end filter.
  In this paper, we consider a simple branched-channel filter structure beneath a high-Reynolds-number laminar flow, in the case where the branch separation is much larger than the thickness of the viscous boundary layer. We use multiple-scales techniques to derive an effective leakage boundary condition, which smooths out localised effects in the flow velocity and pressure that arise due to the discrete branched channels, and then use this boundary condition to explicitly determine the flow away from the boundary. We find that our explicit solution compares well with an analogous numerical solution containing a discrete set of branched channels.
  We further consider the behaviour of individual spherical particles in the device, with their trajectories determined via a simple force balance model with a wall-bounce condition. We explore the dependence of the fraction of particles that flow into the branched channels on the particle's Stokes number. The resulting combined model is able to predict the relationship between the efficiency of a ricochet filter device and the design and operating parameters, avoiding the need to conduct extensive numerically challenging simulations.</description>

      <title>When is a sloshing vortex an analogue black hole bomb?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Draining vortices provide a powerful platform for simulating black hole phenomena in tabletop experiments. In realistic fluid systems confined within a finite container, low-frequency waves amplified by the vortex are reflected at the walls, rendering the system unstable. This process, known in the gravitational context as the black hole bomb, manifests as a sloshing motion of the free surface. The analogy, however, becomes more nuanced when a realistic vortex core with a non-singular vorticity distribution is considered. We investigate this by analysing a non-draining Rankine vortex in the shallow-water and inviscid limits. At low circulation, the sloshing corresponds to an instability of the vorticity field, whereas at high circulation where fluid is expelled from the vortex core, the destabilising mechanism coincides with that of the black hole bomb. Our variational framework distinguishes the energetic contributions of vorticity and irrotational perturbations, offering new insight into the rotating-polygons instability reported by, e.g. Jansson et al. (2006). From the analogue-gravity perspective, we identify hollow core vortices as an optimal regime for exploring black-hole-like instabilities in fluids.</description>

      <title>Interscale energy transfer in turbulent channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the energy cascade in wall-bounded turbulence by analysing the interscale transfer between streamwise and spanwise length scales in periodic channels. This transfer originates from the nonlinear interactions in the advective term of the Navier-Stokes equations, which satisfy the classical triadic compatibility relations. Each triadic interaction is examined individually, and its corresponding nonlinear momentum and energy transfer are mapped to assess its relative importance in sustaining turbulence. Motivated by the anisotropy of the flow, we interpret each contribution $\partial_i(u_i u_j)$ to the advection term as carrying distinct physical information, and therefore analyse them separately. Time-averaged maps of the energy transfer across all length scales and wall-normal positions for a channel flow at $Re_\tau \approx 180$ are used to explore the mechanisms underlying the cascade process. As a proof of concept, reduced-order simulations are performed by retaining only the interactions identified as responsible for significant energy transfer based on our framework. Turbulent dynamics are successfully reproduced when 30% or more of the total interactions are included, while noticeable deviations emerge in the near-wall region when this proportion is further reduced.</description>

      <title>Rediscovering shallow water equations from experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New data-driven methods have advanced the discovery of governing equations from observations, enabling parsimonious models for complex systems. Here, we 'rediscover' a shallow-water equation closely related to Korteweg--de Vries (KdV) using only video recordings of solitons in a simple flume. Two fundamentally different approaches -- weak-form sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (WSINDy) and a novel Fourier-multiplier method -- recover the same PDE, demonstrating that the equation is inherent in the data and robust to the choice of method. Both identify the same terms with comparable magnitudes and errors. To validate the models, we solve the discovered equations forward in time and compare them with additional experimental cases that were not used in the discovery. Based on the results, we discuss absolute and cumulative errors, as well as the strengths and limitations of the two discovery approaches. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of equation discovery from everyday experiments ('GoPro physics') and highlight shallow-water waves as an ideal test bed for developing and benchmarking new methods.</description>

      <title>Airfoil optimization using Design-by-Morphing with minimized design-space dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16020v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective airfoil geometry optimization requires exploring a diverse range of designs using as few design variables as possible. This study introduces AirDbM, a Design-by-Morphing (DbM) approach specialized for airfoil optimization that systematically reduces design-space dimensionality. AirDbM selects an optimal set of 12 baseline airfoils from the UIUC airfoil database, which contains over 1,600 shapes, by sequentially adding the baseline that most increases the design capacity. With these baselines, AirDbM reconstructs 99 % of the database with a mean absolute error below 0.005, which matches the performance of a previous DbM approach that used more baselines. In multi-objective aerodynamic optimization, AirDbM demonstrates rapid convergence and achieves a Pareto front with a greater hypervolume than that of the previous larger-baseline study, where new Pareto-optimal solutions are discovered with enhanced lift-to-drag ratios at moderate stall tolerances. Furthermore, AirDbM demonstrates outstanding adaptability for reinforcement learning (RL) agents in generating airfoil geometry when compared to conventional airfoil parameterization methods, implying the broader potential of DbM in machine learning-driven design.</description>

      <title>Influence of carbon nanocone structure on ultra-efficient water flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation, the water flow in carbon nanocones is studied using the TIP4P/2005 rigid water model. The results demonstrate a nonuniform dependence of the flow on the cone apex angle and the diameter of the opening where the flow is established, leading to a significant increase in the flow in some cases. The effects of cone diameter and pressure gradient are investigated to explain flow behavior with different system structures. We observed that some cones can optimize the water flow precisely. Nanocones with a larger opening facilitate the sliding of water, significantly increasing the flow, thus being promising membranes for technological use in water impurity separation processes. Nanocones with narrower opening angles limited water mobility due to excessive confinement. This phenomenon is linked to the ability of water to form a larger hydrogen-bond network in typical systems with diameters of this size, obtaining a single-layer water structure. Nanocones act as selective nanofilters capable of allowing water molecules to pass through while blocking salts and impurities. The conical shape of their structures creates a directed flow that improves separation efficiency. Membranes based on carbon nanocones are becoming promising for clean, smart, and efficient technologies. The combination of transport speed, selectivity, and structural control put them ahead of other nanostructures for various purposes.</description>

      <title>Secondary small-scale dynamics of a Rayleigh-Taylor unstable solar prominence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quiescent solar prominences show distinct small-scale dynamics in observations. Their internal density contrasts with the surrounding corona make them susceptible to Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instabilities, leading to vertically structured prominence morphologies when observed at the solar limb. As a result, prominences develop bubbles and plumes, along with secondary Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) roll-ups along their edges. Recent observations also suggest magnetic reconnection events within the RT-driven turbulent flows. We perform high-resolution 2.5D resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations using the open-source MPI-AMRVAC code, reaching a spatial resolution of $\sim 11.7$ km in a 2D domain of size 30 Mm$\times$30 Mm and evolving the system for approximately 10 minutes of solar time. A dense, magnetic pressure supported prominence serves as the initial state, which becomes unstable at the prominence-corona interface. The resulting interaction between RT and KH instabilities leads to the formation of current sheets and localized reconnection events. The reconnection-driven outflows form energetic jets that enhance energy transport and dissipation across the prominence. We analyze our high-resolution prominence simulation using synthetic images of the broadband SDO/AIA 094, 171, and 193 \r{A} and narrowband H$\alpha$ filters, to compare the developing fine-scale structures with their observational counterparts. Most secondary instabilities emerge in the hotter coronal regions surrounding the cooler prominence core. While our simulated features match observed scales, speeds, and duration, the simulated activity remains concentrated in hot, surrounding coronal plasma rather then the cool prominence material, implying that key physical ingredients may be missing. Future 3D studies in more realistic magnetic configurations are required to address these limitations.</description>

Abstract: Recent high-resolution, high-Reynolds-number simulations have shown that the initial total circulation, quantified by the vorticity packing fraction (VPF), strongly influences the late-time Eulerian statistical equilibria of decaying incom- pressible two-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulence (Biswas et al., 2022, Physics of Fluids 34, 065101), revealing a transition from point-vortex--dominated to finite-size (patch-vortex) equilibria with increasing vortex packing, and emphasizing the role of of the classical exclusion principle (i.e., incompressibility) and total circulation in determining the final statistical states. The present study examines how the associated Lagrangian tracer transport evolves with VPF across the early (linear-nonlinear turbulence onset), intermediate (turbulence development), and late (coherent dipole evolution) stages, and how it correlates with the corresponding Eulerian states. Turbulence, triggered by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and sustained by inverse energy cascades, forms large-scale coherent vortices that govern long-time transport. Tracer dynamics, analyzed via mean-square displacement and position-velocity probability distri- bution functions (PDFs), reveal that increasing VPF accelerates turbulence onset, drives a transition from sub- to super- diffusive transport with decreasing anisotropy in the intermediate stage, and determines late-time behavior dominated by either orbital coherent vortex trapping (sub-diffusive) or linear translational dipole motion (super-diffusive). These dis- tinct long-time transport characteristics, evolving from sub- to super-diffusive behavior with increasing vorticity pack- ing, demonstrate a strong correspondence between the transition from point-vortex- to finite-size-vortex-dominated Eulerian equilibria and the underlying Lagrangian transport in decaying incompressible 2D Navier-Stokes turbulence.</description>

      <title>Holey sheets: Double-Threshold Rupture of Draining Liquid Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12789</link>

Abstract: Classical rupture is attributed to molecular (van der Waals) forces acting at nanometric thicknesses. Nonetheless, micron-thick liquid sheets routinely perforate far above the scale where these molecular forces act, yet the mechanism that selects opening versus healing has remained unclear. Using direct numerical simulations of a draining sheet with an entrained air bubble (cavity), we show that irreversible rupture occurs only when a deterministic double-threshold is crossed: (i) the outward driving (from airflow or inertia) is strong enough and (ii) the cavity is distorted enough. If either condition falls short, surface tension heals the cavity and the sheet reseals. The time for this process is set by the balance between inertia and viscosity -- fast for inertia-dominated sheets and slower for viscous ones. This double-threshold mechanism explains why micrometer-thick films perforate and offers practical control options -- driving strength and defect geometry -- for predicting and controlling breakup in spray formation processes, wave breaking, and respiratory films.</description>

      <title>Spectral quantum algorithm for passive scalar transport in shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mixing of scalar substances in fluid flows by stirring and diffusion is ubiquitous in natural flows, chemical engineering, and microfluidic drug delivery. Here, we present a spectral quantum algorithm for scalar mixing by solving the advection-diffusion equation in a quantum computational fluid dynamics framework. The exact gate decompositions of the advection and diffusion operators in spectral space are derived. For all but the simplest one-dimensional flows, these operators do not commute. Therefore, we use operator splitting to construct quantum circuits capable of simulating arbitrary polynomial velocity profiles in multiple dimensions, such as the Blasius profile of a laminar boundary layer. Periodic, Neumann, and Dirichlet boundary conditions can be imposed with the appropriate quantum spectral transform. We evaluate the approach in statevector simulations of a Couette flow, plane Poiseuille flow, and a polynomial Blasius profile approximation. For an advection-diffusion problem in one dimension, we compare the time evolution of an ideal quantum simulation with those of real quantum computers with superconducting and trapped-ion qubits. The required number of two-qubit gates grows with the logarithm of the number of grid points raised to one higher power than the order of the polynomial velocity profile.</description>

      <title>Classical Euler flows generate the strong Guderley imploding shock wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that Guderley's self-similar imploding shock solution for the compressible Euler equations with ideal--gas law ($\gamma&gt;1$) arises from classical, radially symmetric, shock--free data. For such data prescribed at initial time $\mathrm{T_{in}} &lt; 0$, we prove that the flow remains smooth up to a first singular time $t=\mathrm{T}_* \in (\mathrm{T_{in}}, 0)$, where a preshock forms with a $C^{1/3}$ cusp in the fast acoustic variable. From this preshock a unique, initially weak, regular shock is born, whose strength can be made arbitrarily large on a controlled time interval; the front then deforms onto the Guderley shock and implodes at the origin at the collapse time $t=0$. There exists a matching time $t=\mathrm{T_{fin}} \in (\mathrm{T}_*,0)$ such that on $[\mathrm{T_{fin}},0)$ the solution coincides exactly with the classical Guderley self--similar profile, and at $t=\mathrm{T_{fin}}$ the shock trajectory matches the self--similar front to all orders. As $t \to 0^-$, the Euler solution implodes at the center, and continues for $t&gt;0$ as a reflected blast wave, providing a global-in-time unique Euler solution which evolves from regular initial conditions.</description>
