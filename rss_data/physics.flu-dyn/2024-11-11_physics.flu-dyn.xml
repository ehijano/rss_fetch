      <title>Rarefied neutral flow in orificed hollow cathodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A parametric study is conducted to quantify the effect of the keeper electrode geometry on the neutral flow quantities within orificed hollow cathodes, prior to cathode ignition. The keeper impinges directly on the flow out of the cathode orifice and its geometry strongly influences the product between the pressure in the orifice-keeper region and the distance between cathode and keeper, $P_{ko}\cdot D_{ko}$, a key parameter for successful cathode ignition. A representative cathode equipped with a keeper is simulated using the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method. The numerical model is first validated with computational results from the literature, and a parametric study is then conducted. Parameters include the cathode pressure-diameter in the range of 1-5 Torr-cm and the following geometric ratios: cathode orifice-to-cathode inner radii in the range of 0.1-0.7, keeper orifice-to-cathode orifice radii in the range of 1-5, and keeper distance-to-cathode-orifice diameter, in the range of 0.5-10. If both keeper and cathode have identical orifice radii, the flow remains subsonic in the cathode orifice-to-keeper region. In most cases, however, the flow becomes underexpanded and supersonic, and the static pressure within the cathode orifice-keeper region is, on average, 4% that of the upstream pressure value. The orifice-keeper region pressure increases with either a decrease in the keeper orifice diameter or an increase in the distance between the cathode orifice plate and the keeper plate, in agreement with literature data. Trends are explained through control-volume-based conservation laws. The ratio of ignition-to-nominal mass flow rates is found to be in the range of 9-120, with a most probable value of 40, in agreement with literature data. This suggests that heater-less cathode ignition at a minimum DC voltage may be achieved by increasing the input mass flow rate by a factor of 40.</description>

      <title>Particle Levitation Velocimetry for boundary layer measurements in high Reynolds number liquid helium turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding boundary layer flows in high Reynolds number (Re) turbulence is crucial for advancing fluid dynamics in a wide range of applications, from improving aerodynamic efficiency in aviation to optimizing energy systems in industrial processes. However, generating such flows requires complex, power-intensive large-scale facilities. Furthermore, the use of local probes, such as hot wires and pressure sensors, often introduces disturbances due to the necessary support structures, compromising measurement accuracy. In this paper, we present a solution that leverages the vanishingly small viscosity of liquid helium to produce high Re flows, combined with an innovative Particle Levitation Velocimetry (PLV) system for precise flow-field measurements. This PLV system uses magnetically levitated superconducting micro-particles to measure the near-wall velocity field in liquid helium. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the PLV system enables quantitative measurements of the velocity boundary layer over a wall unit range of $44\le y^{+}\le 4400$, with a spatial resolution that, depending on the particle size, can reach down to about 10~$\mu$m. This development opens new avenues for exploring turbulence structures and correlations within the thin boundary layer that would be otherwise difficult to achieve.</description>

      <title>Reducing data resolution for better super-resolution: Reconstructing turbulent flows from noisy observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A super-resolution (SR) method for the reconstruction of Navier-Stokes (NS) flows from noisy observations is presented. In the SR method, first the observation data is averaged over a coarse grid to reduce the noise at the expense of losing resolution and, then, a dynamic observer is employed to reconstruct the flow field by reversing back the lost information. We provide a theoretical analysis, which indicates a chaos synchronization of the SR observer with the reference NS flow. It is shown that, even with noisy observations, the SR observer converges toward the reference NS flow exponentially fast, and the deviation of the observer from the reference system is bounded. Counter-intuitively, our theoretical analysis shows that the deviation can be reduced by increasing the lengthscale of the spatial average, i.e., making the resolution coarser. The theoretical analysis is confirmed by numerical experiments of two-dimensional NS flows. The numerical experiments suggest that there is a critical lengthscale for the spatial average, below which making the resolution coarser improves the reconstruction.</description>

      <title>A High-Order Analytical Extension of the Corrected Smagorinsky Model for Non-Equilibrium Turbulent Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an extension of the corrected Smagorinsky model, incorporating advanced techniques for error estimation and regularity analysis of far-from-equilibrium turbulent flows. A new formulation that increases the model's ability to explain complex dissipative processes in turbulence is presented, using higher-order Sobolev spaces to address incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations. Specifically, a refined energy dissipation mechanism that provides a more accurate representation of turbulence is introduced, particularly in the context of multifractal flow regimes. Furthermore, we derive new theoretical results on energy regularization in multifractal turbulence, contributing to the understanding of anomalous dissipation and vortex stretching in turbulent flows. The work also explores the numerical implementation of the model in the presence of challenging boundary conditions, particularly in dynamically evolving domains, where traditional methods struggle to maintain accuracy and stability. Theoretical demonstrations and analytical results are provided to validate the proposed framework, with implications for theoretical advances and practical applications in computational fluid dynamics. This approach provides a basis for more accurate simulations of turbulence, with potential applications ranging from atmospheric modeling to industrial fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Implementation of spectral methods on Ising machines: toward flow simulations on quantum annealer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility and current limitations of flow computations using quantum annealers by solving a fundamental flow problem on Ising machines. As a fundamental problem, we consider the one-dimensional advection-diffusion equation. We formulate it in a form suited to Ising machines (i.e., both classical and quantum annealers), perform extensive numerical tests on a classical annealer, and finally test it on an actual quantum annealer. To make it possible to process with an Ising machine, the problem is formulated as a minimization problem of the residual of the governing equation discretized using either the spectral method or the finite difference method. The resulting system equation is then converted to the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) form though quantization of variables. It is found in the numerical tests using a classical annealer that the spectral method requiring smaller number of variables has a particular merit over the finite difference method because the accuracy deteriorates with the increase of the number of variables. We also found that the computational error varies depending on the condition number of the coefficient matrix. In addition, we extended it to a two-dimensional problem and confirmed its fundamental applicability. From the numerical test using a quantum annealer, however, it turns out that the computation using a quantum annealer is still challenging due largely to the structural difference from the classical annealer, which leaves a number of issues toward its practical use.</description>

      <title>Air entrainment by turbulent plunging jets: effect of jet roughness revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The amount of air entrained by vertical water jets impacting a large pool is revisited. To test available phenomenological models, new data on the jet deformation at impact and on the entrained air flow rate were collected both on a small-scale (height of fall H about 1 m, jet diameter D0 = 7.6 mm) and a large-scale (H up to 9 m, D0 up to 213 mm) facilities. Conditions for which jet break-up occurred were not considered. For short heights of fall (H less than a few D0), the jet deformation remains smaller than 0.1 jet diameter, and the entrained air flow rate happens to grow as Ui^3/2, where Ui is the jet velocity at impact. This scaling agrees with the air film model proposed by Sene, 1988. At larger fall heights, even though conditions leading to jet break-up were avoided, the jets exhibited complex topologies, including strong deformations and/or interface stripping and/or jet aeration. Further, the roughness model initiated by Henderson, McCarthy and Molloy, 1970 which stipulates that the entrained air flow rate corresponds to the air trapped within jet corrugations, was found valid for these conditions. More precisely, for corrugated jets, the effective roughness amounts to the maximum jet deformation (as measured from the 90% detection probability on the diameter pdf) or equivalently to about two times the total deformation of one side of the jet (where the total deformation of one side of the jet is experimentally evaluated as the standard deviation of the position of one jet edge). However, for jets experiencing strong stripping or aeration (the latter being identified by a threshold on the growth of the jet diameter with the falling distance), the effective roughness amounts to about 0.8 times the maximum jet deformation or equivalently to 1.1 times the total deformation of one side of the jet. Compared with corrugated jets, the effective roughness is thus diminished by half.</description>

      <title>Exact Non-Local Hydrodynamics Predict Rarefaction Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine the theory of slow spectral closure for linearized Boltzmann equations with Maxwell's kinetic boundary conditions to derive non-local hydrodynamics with arbitrary accommodation. Focusing on shear-mode dynamics, we obtain explicit steady state solutions in terms of Fourier integrals and closed-form expressions for the mean flow and the stress. We demonstrate that the exact non-local fluid model correctly predicts several rarefaction effects with accommodation, including the Couette flow and thermal creep in a plane channel.</description>

      <title>On nonlinear transitions, minimal seeds and exact solutions for the geodynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearly fifty years ago, Roberts (1978) postulated that Earth's magnetic field, which is generated by turbulent motions of liquid metal in its outer core, likely results from a subcritical dynamo instability characterised by a dominant balance between Coriolis, pressure and Lorentz forces. Here we numerically explore the generation of subcritical geomagnetic fields using techniques from optimal control and dynamical systems theory to uncover the nonlinear dynamical landscape underlying dynamo action. Through nonlinear optimisation, via direct-adjoint looping, we identify the minimal seed - the smallest magnetic field that attracts to a nonlinear dynamo solution. Additionally, using the Newton-hookstep algorithm, we converge stable and unstable travelling wave solutions to the governing equations. By combining these two techniques, complex nonlinear pathways between attracting states are revealed, providing insight into a potential subcritical origin of the geodynamo. This paper showcases these methods on the widely studied benchmark of Christensen et al. (2001), laying the foundations for future studies in more extreme and realistic parameter regimes. We show that the minimal seed reaches a nonlinear dynamo solution by first attracting to an unstable travelling wave solution, which acts as an edge state separating a hydrodynamic solution from a magnetohydrodynamic one. Furthermore, by carefully examining the choice of cost functional, we establish a robust optimisation procedure that can systematically locate dynamo solutions on short time horizons with no prior knowledge of its structure.</description>

      <title>Surface-acoustic-wave driven silicon microfluidic chips for acoustic tweezing of motile cells and viscoelastic microbeads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic tweezers comprising a surface acoustic wave chip and a disposable silicon microfluidic chip are potentially advantageous to stable and cost-ffective acoustofluidic experiments while avoiding the cross-contamination by reusing the surface acoustic wave chip and disposing of the microfluidic chip. For such a device, it is important to optimize the chip-to-chip bonding and the size and shape of the microfluidic chip to enhance the available acoustic pressure. In this work, aiming at studying samples with the size of a few tens of microns, we explore the device structure and assembly method of acoustic tweezers. By using a polymer bonding layer and shaping the silicon microfluidic chip via deep reactive ion etching, we were able to attain the acoustic pressure up to 2 MPa with a corresponding acoustic radiation pressure of 0.2 kPa for 50 MHz ultrasound, comparable to reported values at lower ultrasound frequencies. We utilized the fabricated acoustic tweezers for non-contact viscoelastic deformation experiments of soft matter and trapping of highly motile cells. These results suggests that the feasibility of the hybrid chip approach to attaining the high acoustic force required to conduct acoustomechanical testing of small soft matters and cells.</description>

      <title>Dynamic equilibrium of electrochemical bubbles growing on micro-electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In gas evolving electrolysis, bubbles grow at electrodes due to a diffusive influx from oversaturation generated locally in the electrolyte by the electrode reaction. When considering electrodes of micrometer-size resembling catalytic islands, bubbles are found to approach dynamic equilibrium states at which they neither grow nor shrink. Such equilibrium states are found at low oversaturation for both, pinning and expanding wetting regimes of the bubbles and are based on the balance of local influx near the bubble foot and global outflux. Unlike the stability of pinned nano-bubbles studied earlier, the Laplace pressure plays a minor role only. We extend the analytical solution of Zhang &amp; Lohse (2023) by taking into account the non-uniform distribution of dissolved gas around the bubble obtained from direct numerical simulation. This allows us to identify the parameter regions of bubble growth, dissolution and dynamic equilibrium as well as to analyze the stability of the equilibrium states. Finally, we draw conclusions on how to possibly enhance the efficiency of electrolysis.</description>

      <title>Turbulent Boundary Layer in a 3-Element High-LiftWing: Coherent Structures Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wall-resolved large-eddy simulation (LES) of the fluid flow around a 30P30N airfoil is conducted at a Reynolds number of Rec=750,000 and an angle of attack (AoA) of 9 degrees. The simulation results are validated against experimental data from previous studies and further analyzed, focusing on the suction side of the wing main element. The boundary layer development is investigated, showing characteristics typical of a zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer (ZPG TBL). In particular, the boundary layer exhibits limited growth, and the outer peak of the streamwise Reynolds stresses is virtually absent, distinguishing it from an adverse-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer (APG TBL). A proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) analysis is performed on a portion of the turbulent boundary layer, revealing a significant energy spread across higher-order modes. Despite this, TBL streaks are identified, and the locations of the most energetic structures correspond to the peaks in the Reynolds stresses.</description>

      <title>Identifying spatially-localized instability mechanisms using sparse optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent investigations have established the physical relevance of spatially-localized instability mechanisms in fluid dynamics and their potential for technological innovations in flow control. In this letter, we show that the mathematical problem of identifying spatially-localized optimal perturbations that maximize perturbation-energy amplification can be cast as a sparse (cardinality-constrained) optimization problem. Unfortunately, cardinality constrained optimization problems are non-convex and combinatorially hard to solve in general. To make the analysis viable within the context of fluid dynamics problems, we propose an efficient iterative method for computing sub-optimal spatially-localized perturbations. Our approach is based on a generalized Rayleigh quotient iteration algorithm followed by a variational renormalization procedure that reduces the optimality gap in the resulting solution. The approach is demonstrated on a sub-critical plane Poiseuille flow at Re = 4000, which has been a benchmark problem studied in prior investigations on identifying spatially-localized flow structures. Remarkably, we find that a subset of the perturbations identified by our method yield a comparable degree of energy amplification as their global counterparts. We anticipate our proposed analysis tools will facilitate further investigations into spatially-localized flow instabilities, including within the resolvent and input-output analysis frameworks.</description>

      <title>Physics-constrained coupled neural differential equations for one dimensional blood flow modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational cardiovascular flow modeling plays a crucial role in understanding blood flow dynamics. While 3D models provide acute details, they are computationally expensive, especially with fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations. 1D models offer a computationally efficient alternative, by simplifying the 3D Navier-Stokes equations through axisymmetric flow assumption and cross-sectional averaging. However, traditional 1D models based on finite element methods (FEM) often lack accuracy compared to 3D averaged solutions. This study introduces a novel physics-constrained machine learning technique that enhances the accuracy of 1D blood flow models while maintaining computational efficiency. Our approach, utilizing a physics-constrained coupled neural differential equation (PCNDE) framework, demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional FEM-based 1D models across a wide range of inlet boundary condition waveforms and stenosis blockage ratios. A key innovation lies in the spatial formulation of the momentum conservation equation, departing from the traditional temporal approach and capitalizing on the inherent temporal periodicity of blood flow. This spatial neural differential equation formulation switches space and time and overcomes issues related to coupling stability and smoothness, while simplifying boundary condition implementation. The model accurately captures flow rate, area, and pressure variations for unseen waveforms and geometries. We evaluate the model's robustness to input noise and explore the loss landscapes associated with the inclusion of different physics terms. This advanced 1D modeling technique offers promising potential for rapid cardiovascular simulations, achieving computational efficiency and accuracy. By combining the strengths of physics-based and data-driven modeling, this approach enables fast and accurate cardiovascular simulations.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Dissipation in the Smagorinsky Model for Turbulence in Boundary-Driven Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper enhances the classic Smagorinsky model by introducing an innovative, adaptive dissipation term that adjusts dynamically with distance from boundary regions. This modification addresses a known limitation of the standard model over dissipation near boundaries thereby improving accuracy in turbulent flow simulations in confined or wall-adjacent areas. We present a rigorous theoretical framework for this adaptive model, including two foundational theorems. The first theorem guarantees existence and uniqueness of solutions, ensuring that the model is mathematically well-posed within the adaptive context. The second theorem provides a precise bound on the energy dissipation rate, demonstrating that dissipation remains controlled and realistic even as boundary effects vary spatially. By allowing the dissipation coefficient to decrease near boundary layers, this approach preserves the finer turbulent structures without excessive smoothing, yielding a more physically accurate representation of the flow. Future work will focus on implementing this adaptive model in computational simulations to empirically verify the theoretical predictions and assess performance in scenarios with complex boundary geometries.</description>

      <title>Stratification governs the Existence of Surface-Intensified Eastward Jets in Turbulent Gyres without Bottom Friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the role of stratification in the formation and persistence of eastward jets (like the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio currents). Using a wind-driven, two-layer quasi-geostrophic model in a double-gyre configuration, we construct a phase diagram to classify flow regimes. The parameter space is defined by a criticality parameter $\xi$, which controls the emergence of baroclinic instability, and the ratio of layer depths $\delta$, which describes the surface intensification of stratification. Eastward jets detaching from the western boundary are observed when $\delta \ll 1$ and $\xi \sim 1$, representing a regime transition from a vortex-dominated western boundary current to a zonostrophic regime characterized by multiple eastward jets. Remarkably, these surface-intensified patterns emerge without considering bottom friction. The emergence of the coherent eastward jet is further addressed with complementary 1.5-layer simulations and explained through both linear stability analysis and turbulence phenomenology. In particular, we show that coherent eastward jets emerge when the western boundary layer is stable, and find that the asymmetry in the baroclinic instability of eastward and westward flows plays a central role in the persistence of eastward jets, while contributing to the disintegration of westward jets.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Study on the Slat Noise of 30P30N High-Lift Airfoil Basd on High-Order Wall-Resolved Large-Eddy Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents wall-resolved large-eddy simulations (WRLES) of a high-lift airfoil, based on high-order flux reconstruction (FR) commercial software Dimaxer, which runs on consumer level GPUs. A series of independence tests are conducted, including various Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings sampling surfaces, different mesh densities, simulations at 4th and 5th order accuracies, and varying spanwise lengths, to establish best practice for predicting slat noise through high-order WRLES. The results show excellent agreement with experimental data while requiring significantly fewer computational resources than traditional second-order methods. An investigation on the effects of Reynolds number (Re) is performed by scaling the airfoil size, with Reynolds numbers ranging from 8.55e5 to a real aircraft level of 1.71e7. By applying simple scaling through Strouhal number (St), spanwise correction, and distance from the receiver, the far-field noise spectra for different Reynolds numbers can be coincided. Additionally, simulations are performed at four angles of attack: 3{\deg}, 5.5{\deg}, 9.5{\deg}, and 14{\deg}. The results indicate that higher angles of attack lead to a less intense feedback loop, resulting in lower tonal noise frequencies and reduced noise amplitude. The maximum noise reduction observed is over 14dB when comparing 14{\deg} to 3{\deg}. Furthermore, an improved formula is proposed to enhance the prediction of slat noise tonal frequencies and to better elucidate the mechanism behind tonal noise generation.</description>

      <title>Advantages of the adoption of a generalized flame displacement velocity as a central element of flamelet theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In combustion theory, flames are usually described in terms of the dynamics of iso-surfaces of a specific scalar. The flame displacement speed is then introduced as a local variable quantifying the progression of these iso-surfaces relative to the flow field. While formally defined as a scalar, the physical meaning of this quantity allows relating it with a vector pointing along the normal direction of the scalar iso-surface. In this work, this one-dimensional concept is extended by the introduction of a generalized flame displacement velocity vector, which is associated with the dynamics of iso-surfaces of two generic scalars, $\alpha$ and $\beta$. It is then shown how a new flamelet paradigm can be built around this velocity vector, which leads to a very compact and generic set of two-dimensional flamelet equations for thermochemical quantities and the conditioning scalar gradients, $g_{\alpha} = \lvert \nabla \alpha \rvert$ and $g_{\beta} = \lvert \nabla \beta \rvert$. The most important features of the developed framework are discussed in the context of partially-premixed flames, which provides significant insights into several aspects of the theory, including the nature of the different contributions to the flamelet equations for the conditioning scalar gradients and the fact that different flamelet coordinate systems (orthogonal and non-orthogonal) can be characterized by the same flame displacement velocity vector. This approach opens an entire spectrum of possibilities for the definition of new two-dimensional composition spaces, which represents a very promising basis for the development of new variants of flamelet theory.</description>

      <title>On the Threshold of Drop Fragmentation under Impulsive Acceleration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.12017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Secondary fragmentation of an impulsively accelerated drop depends on fluid properties and velocity of the ambient. The critical Weber number $(\mathit{We}_\mathit{cr})$, the minimum Weber number at which a drop undergoes non-vibrational breakup, depends on fluid density ratio $(\rho)$, the drop $(\mathit{Oh}_d)$, and the ambient $(\mathit{Oh}_o)$ Ohnesorge numbers. The current study uses VoF based interface-tracking multiphase flow simulations to quantify the effect of different non-dimensional groups on the threshold at which secondary fragmentation occur. For $\mathit{Oh}_d \leq 0.1$, a decrease in $\mathit{Oh}_d$ significantly influences the breakup morphology, plume formation, and the resulting $\mathit{We}_\mathit{cr}$. $\rho$ and $\mathit{Oh}_o$, were found to influence the balance between the pressure differences between the poles and the periphery, and the shear stresses on the upstream surface. These external forces induce flow inside the initially spherical drop, resulting in deformation into pancakes and eventually the breakup morphology of forward/backward bag. The evolution pathways of the drop morphology based on their non-dimensional groups have been charted. With the inclusion of the new observations, the traditional $\mathit{We}_\mathit{cr}-\mathit{Oh}_d$ plot, used for illustrating the dependence of critical Weber number on $\mathit{Oh}_d$, was found to be inadequate in predicting the minimum initial $\mathit{We}$ required to undergo fragmentation. A new non-dimensional parameter $C_{breakup}$ is derived based on the competition between forces driving drop deformation and the forces resisting drop deformation. Tested on the available experimental data and current simulations, $C_{breakup}$ is found to be a robust predictor for the threshold of drop fragmentation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An exact closure for hydrodynamic variables is rigorously derived from the linear Boltzmann kinetic equation. Our approach, based on spectral theory, structural properties of eigenvectors and the theory of slow manifolds, allows us to define a unique, optimal reduction in phase space close to equilibrium. The hydrodynamically constrained system induces a modification of entropy that ensures pure viscous dissipation on the hydrodynamic manifold, which is interpreted as a non-local variant of Korteweg's theory of viscosity-capillarity balance. The rigorous hydrodynamic equations are exemplified on the Knudsen minimum paradox in a channel flow.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of an oscillatory boundary layer over a sediment bed</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of an oscillatory boundary layer developing over a bed of collisional and freely evolving sediment grains. We perform Euler-Lagrange simulations at Reynolds numbers $\mathrm{Re}_\delta= 200$, 400, and 800, density ratio $\rho_p/\rho_f = 2.65$, Galileo number $\mathrm{Ga} = 51.9$, maximum Shields numbers from $2.79 \times 10^{-2}$ to $4.40 \times 10^{-2}$, and Keulegan-Carpenter number from $134.5$ to $538.0$. We show that the dynamics of the oscillatory boundary layer and sediment bed are strongly coupled due to two mechanisms: (I) bed permeability, which leads to flow penetration deep inside the sediment layer, a slip velocity at the bed-fluid interface, and the expansion of the boundary layer, and (II) particle motion, which leads to rolling-grain ripples at $\mathrm{Re}_\delta = 400$ and sheet flow at $\mathrm{Re}_\delta = 800$. While at $\mathrm{Re}_\delta = 200$ the sediment bed remains static during the entire cycle, the permeability of the bed-fluid interface causes a thickening of the boundary layer and reduction of the bed shear stress by 38%. With increasing $\mathrm{Re}_\delta$, the particles become mobile, which leads to rolling-grain ripples at $\mathrm{Re}_\delta = 400$ and suspended sediment at $\mathrm{Re}_\delta = 800$. Due to their feedback force on the fluid, the mobile sediment particles cause greater velocity fluctuations in the fluid. In addition, greater flow intrusion causes the bed shear stress to decrease by 54% at $\mathrm{Re}_\delta = 400$and 79% at $\mathrm{Re}_\delta = 800$, compared to the flow over a smooth and impermeable wall.</description>

      <title>Prolate spheroids settling in a quiescent fluid: clustering, microstructures and collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the sedimentation of prolate spheroids in a quiescent fluid by means of the particle-resolved direct numerical simulation. With the increase of the particle volume fraction $\phi$ from $0.1\%$ to $10\%$, we observe a non-monotonic variation of the mean settling velocity of particles, $\langle V_s \rangle$. By virtue of the Voronoi analysis, we find that the degree of particle clustering is highest when $\langle V_s \rangle$ reaches the local maximum at $\phi=1\%$. Under the swarm effect, clustered particles are found to preferentially sample downward fluid flows in the wake regions, leading to the enhancement of the settling speed. As for lower or higher volume fraction, the tendency of particle clustering and the preferential sampling of downward flows are attenuated. Hindrance effect becomes predominant when the volume fraction exceeds 5\% and reduces $\langle V_s \rangle$ to less than the isolated settling velocity. Particle orientation plays a minor role in the mean settling velocity, although individual prolate particles still tend to settle faster in suspensions when they deviate more from the broad-side-on alignment. Moreover, we also demonstrate that particles are prone to form column-like microstructures in dilute suspensions under the effect of wake-induced hydrodynamic attractions. The radial distribution function is higher at a lower volume fraction. As a result, the collision rate scaled by the particle number density decreases with the increasing volume fraction. By contrast, as another contribution to the particle collision rate, the relative radial velocity for nearby particles shows a minor degree of variation due to the lubrication effect.</description>

      <title>Viscous tweezers: controlling particle orientation with viscosity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Control of particle motion is generally achieved by applying an external field that acts directly on each particle. Here, we propose a global way to manipulate the motion of a particle by dynamically changing the properties of the fluid in which it is immersed. We exemplify this principle by considering a small particle sinking in an anisotropic fluid whose viscosity depends on the shear axis. In the Stokes regime, the motion of an immersed object is fully determined by the viscosity of the fluid through the mobility matrix, which we explicitly compute for a pushpin-shaped particle. Rather than falling upright under the force of gravity, as in an isotropic fluid, the pushpin tilts to the side, sedimenting at an angle determined by the viscosity anisotropy axis. By changing this axis, we demonstrate control over the pushpin orientation as it sinks, even in the presence of noise, using a closed feedback loop. This strategy to control particle motion, that we dub viscous tweezers, could be experimentally realized in systems ranging from polyatomic fluids under external fields to chiral active fluids of spinning particles by suitably changing their direction of global alignment or anisotropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new neural network based large eddy simulation framework for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations based on the paradigm "discretize first, filter and close next". This leads to full model-data consistency and allows for employing neural closure models in the same environment as where they have been trained. Since the LES discretization error is included in the learning process, the closure models can learn to account for the discretization. Furthermore, we employ a divergence-consistent discrete filter defined through face-averaging and provide novel theoretical and numerical filter analysis. This filter preserves the discrete divergence-free constraint by construction, unlike general discrete filters such as volume-averaging filters. We show that using a divergence-consistent LES formulation coupled with a convolutional neural closure model produces stable and accurate results for both a-priori and a-posteriori training, while a general (divergence-inconsistent) LES model requires a-posteriori training or other stability-enforcing measures.</description>

Abstract: The decomposition of oceanic flow into its balanced and unbalanced motions carries theoretical and practical significance for the oceanographic community. These two motions have distinct dynamical characteristics and affect the transport of tracers differently from one another. The launch of Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite provides a prime opportunity to diagnose the surface balanced and unbalanced motions on a global scale at an unprecedented spatial resolution. Here, we apply dynamic-mode decomposition (DMD), a linear-algebraic data-driven method, to a tidally-forced numerical simulation and one-day-repeat SWOT observations of sea-surface height (SSH) in the Gulf Stream extension. DMD is able to separate out the spatial modes associated with sub-inertial periods from super-inertial periods. The sub-inertial modes of DMD can be used to extract geostrophically balanced motions from SSH fields, which have an imprint of internal tides and gravity waves. We utilize the statistical relation between relative vorticity and strain rate as the metric to gauge the extraction of geostrophy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulent fluctuations exhibit universal scaling laws that are independent of large-scale statistics. It is often explained that such universality is caused by the loss of information about large-scale statistics during the cascade process. In our previous study [T. Tanogami and R. Araki, Phys. Rev. Research 6, 013090 (2024)], we applied information thermodynamics to turbulence and proved that information of large-scale turbulent fluctuations is propagated to small scales. As a first step toward understanding how universality emerges at small scales under the influence of the information flow from large scales, here we investigate the scale locality of the information flow for the Sabra shell model. First, we analytically show that the information flow can be decomposed into scale-local and scale-nonlocal parts. Then, we prove that the scale-nonlocal part can be ignored compared to the scale-local part. This result implies that the information transfer from large to small scales occurs mainly through scale-local interactions, which is consistent with the scale locality of the energy cascade.</description>

Abstract: In three-dimensional turbulence, information of turbulent fluctuations at large scales is propagated to small scales. Here, we investigate the relation between the information flow and turbulent fluctuations described by a shell model. We first establish a connection between the information flow and phase-space contraction rate. From this relation, we then prove an inequality between the information flow and turbulent fluctuations, which suggests that the information flow from large to small scales amplifies turbulent fluctuations at small scales. This inequality can also be interpreted as a quantification of Landau's objection to the universality of turbulent fluctuations. We also discuss differences between the information flow and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy.</description>

      <title>A high resolution simulation of protoplanetary disk turbulence driven by the vertical shear instability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A high resolution fourth-order Pad\'e scheme is used to simulate locally isothermal 3D disk turbulence driven by the vertical shear instability (VSI) using 268.4 M points. In the early non-linear period of axisymmetric VSI, angular momentum transport by vertical jets creates correlated N-shaped radial profiles of perturbation vertical and azimuthal velocity. This implies dominance of positive perturbation vertical vorticity layers and a recently discovered angular momentum staircase with respect to radius ($r$). These features are present in 3D in a weaker form. The 3D flow consists of vertically and azimuthally coherent turbulent shear layers containing small vortices with all three vorticity components active. Previously observed large persistent vortices in the interior of the domain driven by the Rossby wave instability are absent. We speculate that this is due to a weaker angular momentum staircase in 3D in the present simulations compared to a previous simulation. The turbulent viscosity parameter $\alpha(r)$ increases linearly with $r$. At intermediate resolution, the value of $\alpha(r)$ at midradius is close to that of a previous simulation. The specific kinetic energy spectrum with respect to radial wavenumber has a power law region with exponent $-1.84$, close to the value $-2$ expected for shear layers. The spectrum with respect to azimuthal wavenumber has a $-5/3$ region and lacks a $-5$ region reported in an earlier study. Finally, it is found that axisymmetric VSI has artifacts at late times, including a very strong angular momentum staircase, which in 3D is present weakly in the disk's upper layers.</description>
