      <title>The COSMOS-Web Lens Survey (COWLS) I: Discovery of &gt;100 high redshift strong lenses in contiguous JWST imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the COSMOS-Web Lens Survey (COWLS), a sample of over 100 strong lens candidates from the $0.54$\,deg$^2$ COSMOS-Web survey, discovered using exquisite James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging across four wavebands. Following two rounds of visual inspection, over 100 candidates were ranked as `high confidence' or `likely' by at least $50\%$ of inspectors. The COWLS sample has several notable properties: (i) magnified source galaxies spanning redshifts $z \sim 0.1$ to $z \sim 9$, which therefore extend into the epoch of reionisation; (ii) the highest-redshift lens galaxies known, pushing galaxy density profile evolution studies beyond $z \sim 2$; (iii) all lenses are distributed within a contiguous $0.54$\,deg$^2$ region, allowing for joint strong and weak lensing analyses; and (iv) a subset exhibits lensed source emission ray-traced near the lens galaxy centers, enabling studies of supermassive black holes and dust absorption. A key innovation of our approach is the use of lens modelling to aid in identifying lenses that may otherwise be missed. This paper is accompanied by the first COWLS public release, providing JWST NIRCam imaging in four bands, lens models, pixelized source reconstructions and lens redshift estimates : https://github.com/Jammy2211/COWLS_COSMOS_Web_Lens_Survey</description>

      <title>New constraints on the galactic ionizing efficiency and escape fraction at 2.5 &lt; z &lt; 6 based on quasar absorption spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of the ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) can probe the sources of the extragalactic ionizing background. We provide new measurements of the ionizing emissivity of galaxies using measurements of the ionizing background and ionizing photon mean free path from high-redshift quasar spectra at $2.5 &lt; z &lt; 6$. Unlike most prior works, we account for radiative-transfer effects and possible neutral islands from the tail of reionization at $z &gt; 5$. We combine our results with measurements of the UV luminosity function to constrain the average escaping ionizing efficiency of galaxies, $\langle f_{\rm esc} \xi_{\rm ion}\rangle_{L_{\rm UV}}$. Assuming galaxies with $M_{\rm UV} &lt; -11$ emit ionizing photons, we find $\log (\langle f_{\rm esc} \xi_{\rm ion}\rangle_{L_{\rm UV}}/{\rm erg^{-1}Hz}) = 24.47_{-0.17}^{+0.09}$ and $24.75_{-0.28}^{+0.15}$ at $z=5$ and $6$, and $1\sigma$ upper limits of $24.48$ and $24.31$ at $z = 2.5$ and $4$, respectively. We also estimate the population-averaged $f_{\rm esc}$ using measurements of intrinsic ionizing efficiency from JWST. We find $\langle f_{\rm esc} \rangle = 0.126_{-0.041}^{+0.034}$ and $0.224_{-0.108}^{+0.098}$ at $z=5$ and $6$, and $1\sigma$ upper limits of $f_{\rm esc}&lt; 0.138$ and $0.096$ at $z=2.5$ and $4$, respectively, for $M_{\rm UV} &lt; -11$. Our findings are consistent with prior measurements of $f_{\rm esc} \lesssim 10\%$ at $z \leq 4$, but indicate a factor of several increase between $z = 4$ and $6$. The steepness of this evolution is sensitive to the highly uncertain mean free path and ionizing background intensity at $z&gt;5$. Lastly, we find $1.10^{+0.21}_{-0.39}$ photons per H atom are emitted into the IGM between $z=6$ and $=5.3$. This is $\approx 4\times$ more than needed to complete the last $20\%$ of reionization absent recombinations, suggesting that reionization's end was likely absorption-dominated.</description>

      <title>Seeding Cores: A Pathway for Nuclear Star Clusters from Bound Star Clusters in the First Billion Years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the formation of star clusters in a dwarf galaxy progenitor during the first 700 Myr of cosmic history using a cosmological radiation-hydrodynamic simulation with a realistic sub-grid star formation efficiency (SFE) model, derived from AU-scale radiation-MHD simulations of molecular clouds with varying mass, density, and metallicity. Using this model for cloud-scale SFEs, the galaxy forms stars stochastically, assembling most of its $10^6~{\rm M_\odot}$ in stars by redshift $z=8$ through two star-forming bursts (SFBs), each lasting $\sim10~{\rm Myr}$, separated by $80~{\rm Myr}$ of quiescence. Clouds reach SFEs up to $80\%$ during the first SFB, forming bound star clusters (densities $\sim10^{2-4} ~{\rm M_\odot\:pc^{-2}}$, radii $\lesssim 3~{\rm pc}$) resembling those observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in strongly lensed galaxies. Star clusters follow a flat power-law mass function with slope $\Gamma \sim -0.4$. The most massive star clusters ($10^{4-5} ~{\rm M_\odot}$) grow through mergers and have metallicity spreads of $0.05 - 0.1$ dex that roughly scale with mass. The second SFB forms loosely bound star clusters with higher metallicities: $-1.95 &lt; \log(Z/{\rm Z_\odot}) &lt; -1.50$ at lower SFEs ($2 - 20\%$). At $z \sim 8.7$, a nuclear star cluster (NSC) is seeded, growing $83\%$ of its mass ($ 2.4 \times 10^5 ~{\rm M_\odot}$, $20\%$ of the galaxy's stellar mass) through mergers with pre-existing clusters and the rest through in-situ star formation. The early formation of NSCs has interesting implications for seeding supermassive black holes and the population of "little red dots" recently discovered by JWST at $z \gtrsim 5$.</description>

      <title>The COSMOS-Web Lens Survey (COWLS) II: depth, resolution, and NIR coverage from JWST reveal 17 spectacular lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COSMOS-Web Lens Survey (COWLS) presents the first systematic search for strong gravitational lenses in the COSMOS-Web field using data from the \textit{James Webb} Space Telescope (\textit{JWST}). Using high-resolution NIRCam imaging, we visually inspected over 42\,660 galaxies and identified over 400 lensing candidates. From this sample and based on \textit{JWST}/NIRCam imaging only, we report here the 17 most obvious and spectacular strong lensing systems. These lenses, characterised by large Einstein rings and arcs and their distinct lens and source colours, were found through only the visual inspection of the lens-light-subtracted image data and were immediately visible due to their spectacular appearance. We showcase how spectacular strong lenses are at the extremes of lens parameter space. Their exceptionally high signal-to-noise, multi-wavelength imaging enables unprecedented lensing analysis, including `\textit{HST}-dark' source galaxies that are also invisible in the deeper bluer \textit{JWST} wavebands, enabling clean deblending between the lens and the source. Sources may exhibit dramatic morphological changes across wavelengths, and dust absorption within lenses may be detectable by eye. No other instrument, including the \textit{Hubble} Space Telescope, can discover or image such lenses with comparable detail. We estimate that \textit{JWST} uncovers a new spectacular lens approximately every 10 to 12 NIRCam pointings, suggesting that over 40 such lenses remain undetected within its first three years of observations. All COWLS data is publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>The COSMOS-Web Lens Survey (COWLS) III: forecasts versus data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare forecasts for the abundance and properties of strong gravitational lenses in the COSMOS-Web survey, a $0.54$ deg$^2$ survey of the COSMOS field using the NIRCam and MIRI instruments aboard JWST, with the first catalogue of strong lens candidates identified in the observed NIRCam data, COWLS. We modify the lenspop package to produce a forecast for strong lensing in COSMOS-Web. We add a new mock galaxy catalogue to use as the source population, as well as the COSMOS-Web survey specifications, including the transmission data for the four NIRCam filters used. We forecast 107 strong lenses can be detected in COSMOS-Web across all bands, assuming complete subtraction of the lens galaxy light. The majority of the lenses are forecast to have small Einstein radii ($\theta_{\rm E} &lt; 1$ arcsecond) and lie at redshifts between $0 &lt; z &lt;2$, whilst the source redshift distribution peaks at $z\sim 3$ and has a long tail extending up to $z \sim 11$, unambiguously showing that strong lensing in JWST can probe the entirety of the epoch of reionisation. We compare our forecast with the distributions of Einstein radii, lens photometric redshifts, and lens and source magnitudes in the observed lenses, finding that whilst the forecast and observed Einstein radii distributions match, the redshifts and magnitudes do not. The observed lens redshift distribution peaks at a slightly lower redshift than the forecast one, whilst the lens magnitudes are systematically brighter in the observed data than in the forecast. Assuming the validity of the lenspop forecast, this finding motivates further inspection of the COWLS data to search for the as-yet undiscovered population of faint, high-redshift lenses.</description>

      <title>Relighting the fire in Hickson Compact Group (HCG) 15: magnetised fossil plasma revealed by the SKA Pathfinders &amp; Precursors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08840v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the life cycle and evolution of active galactic nuclei (AGN), the environment plays an important role. In particular, the over-dense environments of galaxy groups, where dynamical interactions and bulk motions have significant impact, offer an excellent but under-explored window into the life cycles of AGN and the processes that shape the evolution of relativistic plasma. Pilot Survey observations with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey recovered diffuse emission associated with the nearby (z = 0.0228) galaxy group HCG15, which was revealed to be strongly linearly polarised. We study the properties of this emission in unprecedented detail to settle open questions about its nature and its relation to the group-member galaxies. We perform a multi-frequency spectropolarimetric study of HCG15 incorporating our ASKAP EMU observations as well as new data from MeerKAT, LOFAR, the GMRT, and the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), plus X-ray data from XMM-Newton and optical spectra from the Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT). Our study confirms that the diffuse structure represents remnant emission from historic AGN activity, likely associated with HCG15-D, some 80-86 Myr ago (based on ageing analysis). We detect significant highly linearly-polarised emission from a diffuse 'ridge'-like structure with a highly ordered magnetic field. Our analysis suggests that this emission is generated by draping of magnetic field lines in the intra-group medium (IGrM), although further exploration with simulations would aid our understanding. We confirm that HCG15-C is a group-member galaxy. Finally, we report the detection of thermal emission associated with a background cluster at redshift z ~ 0.87 projected onto the IGrM of HCG15, which matches the position and redshift of the recent SZ detection of ACT-CL J0207.8+0209.</description>

      <title>The Youngest Star Clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the youngest stellar clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), utilising a multi-wavelength approach. We analyse data spanning from infrared to ultraviolet wavelengths, with the goal of enhancing our understanding of these clusters' physical properties, such as age, mass, and size. Our methodology includes a novel cluster detection procedure; it employs machine learning techniques for the accurate identification of these young clusters. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis, using the Automated Stellar Cluster Analysis tool, plays a crucial role in deriving the clusters' key physical parameters. Our findings provide significant insights into the early stages of stellar and galactic evolution, particularly in dwarf galaxy environments, and contribute to the broader understanding of star formation and cluster evolution. For the 109 clusters in our sample younger than 5 Myr, we measure a positive correlation between cluster mass and the mass of the most massive star in the cluster. This study emphasises the importance of multi-wavelength observations in revealing the intricate properties of young stellar clusters.</description>

      <title>Flares in the Changing Look AGN Mrk 590. II: Deep X-ray observations reveal a Comptonizing inner accretion flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mrk 590 is a Changing Look AGN currently in an unusual repeat X-ray and UV flaring state. Here, we report on deep X-ray observations with XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and NICER, obtained at a range of X-ray flux levels. We detect a prominent soft excess below 2 keV; its flux is tightly correlated with that of both the X-ray and UV continuum, and it persists at the lowest flux levels captured. Our Bayesian model comparison strongly favors inverse Comptonization as the origin of this soft excess, instead of blurred reflection. We find only weak reflection features, with R~0.4 assuming Compton-thick reflection. Most of this reprocessing occurs at least $\sim$800 gravitational radii (roughly three light-days) from the continuum source. Relativistically broadened emission is weak or absent, suggesting the lack of a standard `thin disk' at small radii. We confirm that the predicted broad-band emission due to Comptonization is roughly consistent with the observed UV--optical photometry. This implies an optically thick, warm ($kT_e\sim0.3$ keV) scattering region that extends to at least $\sim10^3$ gravitational radii, reprocessing any UV thermal emission. The lack of a standard `thin disk' may also explain the puzzling $\sim3$-day X-ray to UV delay previously measured for Mrk 590. Overall, we find that the X-ray spectral changes in Mrk 590 are minimal, despite substantial luminosity changes. Other well-studied changing look AGN display more dramatic spectral evolution, e.g., disappearing continuum or soft excess. This suggests that a diversity of physical mechanisms in the inner accretion flow may produce a UV--optical changing-look event.</description>

      <title>FAST Discovery of A Gas-rich and Ultra-faint Dwarf Galaxy: KK153</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a high-sensitivity HI survey using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we identified an isolated HI cloud with a system velocity of ~127.0 km/s, which is associated with an optical galaxy KK153 in space. The HI gas of KK153 shows a typical disk-galaxy structure. Using the Baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, we obtained that the distance to KK153 is 2.0_{-0.8}^{+1.7} Mpc. Adopting such distance, we derived a stellar mass of 4.1_{-2.6}^{+10.0}*10^{5} Msun and a neutral gas fraction of 0.63, implying that KK153 is a gas-rich ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxy in the Local Group or its outskirts. KK153 shows a cool (~200 K) and warm (~7400 K) two-phase neutral medium. The g-r color distribution of KK153 suggests that new stars are mostly forming in its inner disk. The dynamical mass of KK153 is 6.9_{-3.0}^{+5.5}*10^{7} Msun, which is about 60 times larger than its baryonic matter. Detection of such a low-mass and gas-rich halo poses a challenge to the theory of cosmic reionization.</description>

      <title>Frequency-resolved time lags due to X-ray disk reprocessing in AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last years, a number of broadband reverberation mapping campaigns have been conducted to explore the short-term UV and optical variability of nearby AGN. Despite the extensive data collected, the origin of the observed variability is still debated in the literature. Frequency-resolved time lags offer a promising approach to distinguish between different scenarios, as they probe variability on different time scales. In this study, we present the expected frequency-resolved lags resulting from X-ray reprocessing in the accretion disk. The predicted lags are found to feature a general shape that resembles that of observational measurements, while exhibiting strong dependence on various physical parameters. Additionally, we compare our model predictions to observational data for the case of NGC 5548, concluding that the X-ray illumination of the disk can effectively account for the observed frequency-resolved lags and power spectra in a self-consistent way. To date, X-ray disk reprocessing is the only physical model that has successfully reproduced the observed multi-wavelength variability, in both amplitude and time delays, across a range of temporal frequencies.</description>

      <title>The SAMI Galaxy Survey: large-scale environment affects galaxy spin amplitudes and the formation of slow rotators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the impact of the large-scale 3D density field, as defined by deep, wide-field galaxy surveys, on stellar spin ($\lambda_{\rm R_e}$) and the distributions of fast and slow rotators. We use the GAMA spectroscopic redshift survey to reconstruct the cosmic web and obtain spatially-resolved stellar kinematics from the SAMI Galaxy Survey. Among various local and large-scale environment metrics, the distance to the closest filament ($D_{\rm fil}$) correlates most significantly with $\lambda_{\rm R_e}$, but it is secondary to the more dominant roles played by stellar age and mass. Fast rotators tend to have increasing $\lambda_{\rm R_e}$ going from nodes to filaments to voids, independently of mass. Slow rotators and mass-matched fast rotators are found to have significantly different distributions of large-scale environment metrics but consistent distributions of local environment metrics. About 95% of slow rotators have $D_{\rm fil}\leq2$Mpc, while covering broader ranges (similar to fast rotators) in distance to nodes and voids, local galaxy density, halo mass, and position with respect to the halo. At fixed mass, the fraction of slow rotators, $f_{\rm SR}$, increases for smaller $D_{\rm fil}$, especially for massive galaxies. While controlling for age or mass, only galaxies very close to filaments and nodes show a significant impact of local environment on $f_{\rm SR}$. Our results demonstrate that the cosmic web leaves an imprint on galactic spin amplitudes, and that pre-processing by mergers occurring within filaments is likely to be an important physical mechanism for the formation of slow rotators before they reach nodes.</description>

      <title>High Resolution VLBI Imaging of Nearby Low Luminosity AGN jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (LLAGN) represent a unique class of AGN in the local universe. Extensive studies of these objects are essential for a comprehensive understanding of jet physics, as past research has largely focused on more powerful radio sources. In this report, we present our recent VLBI studies of two prominent nearby LLAGN, NGC 4261 and M104 (the Sombrero galaxy). Specifically, we address the kinematics, collimation, and fundamental physical parameters of their jets, and probe the possible origin of the radio emission at millimeter wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Multi-frequency Very Long Baseline Interferometry Study of Emission and Absorption in the Two-Sided Jets of NGC 3998</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the multi-frequency, multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) study of the two-sided jets in the low-luminosity active galactic nucleus NGC 3998, where physical properties of the jets on parsec scales remain poorly understood. Using Very Long Baseline Array data observed at 1.4, 1.7, 2.3, and 5 GHz, we detect symmetric twin jets aligned along the north-south direction, with a total extent of $\sim 5.3$ pc. Notably, the position angle of the pc-scale jets differs by $26^\circ$-$30^\circ$ from that of the kpc-scale jets, suggesting the possibility of jet precession. Based on the frequency-dependent core shift and north/south jet brightness ratio, we identify the northern jet as the approaching jet and the southern jet as the counter-jet. Measurements of the radial intensity profile on both sides indicate a change in the counter-jet emission from rapid fading to a slower decline at 1.4, 1.7 and 2.3 GHz. Spectral analysis shows that the approaching jet exhibits an optically thin spectrum, while the counter-jet is dominated by an optically thick, inverted spectrum. These findings tentatively suggest free-free absorption in NGC 3998, which should be verified in future studies. Finally, our observations also reveal a flat-spectrum VLBI core, showing significant radio variability that is likely linked to a jet ejection event.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field properties of the SNR HB 9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to study the polarization and magnetic field properties of the SNR HB 9 using new 21-cm continuum cube data from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio telescope (FAST). We computed the Faraday depth at 21 cm, and re-analyzed the rotation measures (RMs) of HB 9 using in addition Effelsberg 2695-MHz and Urumqi 4800-MHz polarization data. FAST total-intensity images of two subbands are decomposed into components of multiple angular scales to check spectral-index variation via temperature versus temperature plots (TT-plots). The filamentary emission has a spectral index ($S\sim\nu^{\alpha}$) of $\alpha=-$0.52, corresponding to freshly accelerated relativistic electrons. The diffuse emission has a steeper spectrum of $\alpha=-$0.63, corresponding to confined electrons that are no longer accelerated. The FAST detected 1385-MHz polarized emission might come from a thin layer in the outer envelope of the shells, with a Faraday depth of 4-28 rad m$^{-2}$ from the Faraday rotation synthesis result. The RMs derived from the Effelsberg 2695-MHz and Urumqi 4800-MHz polarization data show about 70 rad m$^{-2}$ in the eastern and northern shell, and 124 rad m$^{-2}$ in the inner and southern patches. The regular magnetic field is about 5$-$8 $\mu$G over the remnant. The northern shell shows depolarization at 2695 MHz relative to the 4800-MHz polarization data, indicating an additional random magnetic field of 12 $\mu$G on the scale of 0.6 pc. The shock wave might have entered the dense gas environment in the northern-shell region and has driven turbulence to cause depolarization at 2695 MHz.</description>

      <title>Tomography of the Ophiuchus Molecular Cloud with Velocity Features in C$_2$H $N=1-0$ spectra: A Pilot Study of Coherent Sub-structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The C$_2$H $N=1-0$ transition was used to investigate the possible line of sight sub-structures from the dense and optically thick in $^{13}$CO $J=1-0$ regions in the Ophiuchus star forming molecular cloud. With a 0.2 K or lower noise, multi-peak spectra were obtained and then used for identifying sub-structures. There are clues, e.g., the core velocity dispersion remains unchanged with the increasing scale that this cloud has a mild thickness in the line of sight direction and a large amount of overlapping CO cores, as expected, at least two coherent layers have been found. The integrated intensity maps of these two layers are different in shape and morphology. Inferred from the point velocity dispersion, one sub-structure with a thickness of $\sim 1$ pc was found, while other substructures were more likely to be fragments.</description>

      <title>Tiny-Scale Properties within the Interstellar Medium towards PSR J1644$-$4559: I. Observational Evidence of Turbulence-induced Tiny Scale Atomic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated HI absorption toward a single pulsar, PSR J1644$-$4559, and its variability over timescales from days to years, using Murriyang, CSIRO's Parkes Radio Telescope. Our 19 epochs of spectral observations, spanning 1.2 years with intervals as short as 1 day, provide the most comprehensive cadence coverage for monitoring HI absorption to date. We identified two significant detections of tiny-scale atomic structure (TSAS) with spatial scales ranging from a lower limit of $\sim$11 au to an upper limit of 165 au, both exhibiting integrated signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 5.0. We find a relationship between linear size and optical depth variation in the cold neutral medium (CNM) component hosting the TSAS, described by a power-law relationship, $\Delta\tau_{\rm int} = \Delta\tau_0 (\Delta L)^{(\alpha-2)/2}$, with $\alpha = 4.1 \pm 0.4$. This is the first observational evidence explicitly connecting TSAS to turbulence in CNM. This power-law index is significantly steeper than previously reported values for the CNM, where $\alpha$ ranges from 2.3 to 2.9, but similar to those observed in the warm ionized gas. Additionally, we observe no significant variation in $\alpha$ across the entire range of spatial scales traced in our study, indicating that turbulence may be cascading down and dissipating at smaller scales. While there is no precise proper motion measurement for this pulsar, our estimates for the turbulence dissipation in the CNM place the lower and upper limits at less than 0.03 au and 0.4 au, respectively.</description>

      <title>Exploring symbolic regression and genetic algorithms for astronomical object classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the use of symbolic regression (SR) combined with genetic algorithms (GA) to classify astronomical objects. Using the SDSS17 dataset from Kaggle, which includes 100,000 observations of stars, galaxies, and quasars, we applied SR to 10\% of the data to derive a mathematical expression capable of distinguishing these classes. A genetic algorithm was then employed to optimize the hyperparameters of the expression, refining the model's performance. The final model achieved a Cohen's kappa value of 0.81, indicating a strong agreement with true classifications. Our results demonstrate that the SR+GA approach can produce interpretable and accurate models for the classification of astronomical objects, offering a promising alternative to traditional black-box machine learning methods.</description>

      <title>The infrared traced star formation rates of associated absorption lines quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some optically selected quasars exhibit Mg II assoicated absorption lines (AALs), and its origin remains unclear. In this paper, we compile a sample of 1769 quasars, with or without Mg II AALs. Of which 1689 are Far-Infrared (FIR) detected quasars and the rest are not detected in FIR. For the FIR undetected quasars, we obtain stacks for both with and without Mg II AAL quasars. Then we estimate the star formation rates (SFRs) within quasar host galaxies based on their FIR luminosities derived from their FIR greybody components, and find that, although quasars with Mg II AALs have significantly redder median composite spectra than those without Mg II AALs, the SFR distributions of the two types of quasars are statistically indistinguishable. These results do not require an evolutionary link between the quasars with and without Mg II AALs, and would be reconciled if an orientation effect cannot be ignored among the quasars hosting different types of absorption lines.</description>

      <title>Exploring the hardness of the ionizing radiation with the infrared softness diagram. II. Bimodal distributions in both the ionizing continuum slope and the excitation in active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After exploring the infrared softness diagram to characterize the hardness of the incident ionizing radiation in star-forming regions, we exploit the availability of high-excitation lines in the same spectral regime to explore its use for studying the narrow-line regions in AGN. We adapted the IR softness diagram to consider very high-excitation lines, such as [Ne V] 14.3,24.3 $\mu$m or [O IV] 25.9$\mu$m. The measured emission-line ratios were included as inputs for the code HCm-Teff-IR, in order to provide a quantification for both the ionization and the $\alpha_{\rm OX}$ parameters. The latter is sensitive to the spectral shape of the incident continuum in AGN. We applied this to a large AGN sample including different spectral types with available Spitzer/IRS, Herschel/PACS and/or SOFIA/FIFI-LS mid-IR spectroscopic observations. The combination of the ([Ne II] 12.8 $\mu$m+[Ne III] 15.6$\mu$m)/[Ne V] 14.3$\mu$m and [O III] 52,88 $\mu$m/[O IV] 25.9$\mu$m emission line ratios is a robust proxy for the shape of the ionizing continuum in AGN. An alternative based on the [S III] 18.7 $\mu$m+[S IV] 10.5$\mu$m lines can be used instead. The inclusion of very high-excitation lines in HCm-Teff-IR, to derive both $\alpha_{\rm OX}$ and $U$ for the studied sample, points to a bimodal distribution of galaxies. One of the peaks is characterized by relatively harder values of $\alpha_{\rm OX}$ around -1.4 in combination with low values for log $U$ around -2.4, while the other peak shows a softer $\alpha_{\rm OX}$ around -1.7 and high values of log $U$ around-1.5. This result is consistent with the existence of two very marked AGN populations., one with a softer ionizing continuum, possibly dominated by a radiatively efficient accretion disk in bright Seyfert nuclei. In contrast, we observe a harder radiation field in low-luminosity AGN, where the accretion disk is expected to recede.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an updated catalog of stellar parameters, including effective temperature, luminosity classification, and metallicity, for over fifty million stars from the SkyMapper Southern Survey (SMSS) DR4 and Gaia DR3. The accuracy of the derived parameters remains consistent with those achieved in SMSS DR2 using the same methods. Thanks to the advancements in SMSS DR4, photometric-metallicity estimates are now available for an unprecedented number of metal-poor stars. The catalog includes over 13 million metal-poor (MP; [Fe/H]&lt;-1) stars, nearly three million very metal-poor (VMP; [Fe/H]&lt;-2.0) stars, and approximately 120,000 extremely metal-poor (EMP; [Fe/H]&lt;-3.0) stars -- representing an increase by a factor of 4-6 compared to SMSS DR2. This catalog, combined with other stellar parameters obtained through our efforts, will be made available at https://nadc.china-vo.org/data/sports/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of the structure and kinematics of cores associated with the regions of massive star and star cluster formation are necessary for constructing scenario for the evolution of these objects. We analyzed spectral maps of the massive cores of G012.418+00.506, G326.472+00.888, G328.567--00.535, G335.586--00.289 and G343.127--00.063 from the MALT90 survey in the HCO$^+$(1--0) and H$^{13}$CO$^+$(1--0) lines. The cores are at different stages of evolution and have signs of contraction. By fitting spectral maps calculated within the framework of a spherically symmetric model into the observed ones, the parameters of the radial profiles of density, turbulent velocity and contraction velocity were calculated. The power-law index of the density decay with distance from the center varies in the range of $\sim 1.5-2.8$. The lowest value is obtained for the core of G326.472+00.888 without internal sources. The contraction velocity in all cores depends weakly on the distance from the center, decreasing with an index of $\sim 0.1$, which differs from the free-fall mode. There are indications of rotation for the cores of G328.567--00.535 and G335.586--00.289. Analysis of $^{13}$CO(2--1) data from the SEDIGISM survey for the regions G012.418+00.506, G335.586--00.289, and G343.127--00.063 revealed motions from the surrounding gas toward the cores. The results obtained indicate that the massive cores under consideration interact with their environment and are apparently in a state of global collapse.t the massive cores under consideration interact with their environment and are apparently in a state of global collapse.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present measurements in the context of a survey of southern hemisphere binary and multiple stellar systems observed with the Zorro Speckle dual diffraction-limited optical imaging camera on the 8.1m Gemini-South telescope carried out between 2019 and 2023. The overall motivation of our survey, as well as some initial results of these observations, are outlined to demonstrate the capabilities - and limitations - of Zorro. We report on the astrometric characterization of the instrument in terms of the precision and accuracy of our measurements and provide details of our custom-made data reduction pipeline. For targets with separations smaller than 0.4 arcsec, an overall precision of 1 mas in the radial and tangential directions is obtained, while the uncertainty in position angle is 0.2 deg. Relative astrometry and contrast brightness in the two Zorro filters at 562 and 832 nm are reported for 70 pairs on 64 distinct systems (six are triples). Eleven new binaries are found, mostly of small separations (down to 15 mas), and large brightness contrast (up to Delta m=6 in the red channel). Our results indicate that the Zorro instrument, when properly calibrated, delivers excellent quality data for visual binary studies of tight and/or faint companions.</description>

      <title>Detection of magnetic fields in superclusters of galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields in large scale structure filaments beyond galaxy clusters remain poorly understood. Superclusters offer a unique setting to study these low density environments, where weak signals make detection challenging. The Faraday rotation measure (RM) of polarized sources along supercluster lines of sight helps constrain magnetic field properties in these regions. This study aims to determine magnetic field intensity in low density environments within superclusters using RM measurements at different frequencies. We analyzed three nearby (z&lt;0.1) superclusters, Corona Borealis, Hercules, and Leo, where polarization observations were available at 1.4 GHz and 144 MHz. Our catalogue includes 4497 polarized background sources with RM values from literature and unpublished 144 MHz data. We constructed 3D density cubes for each supercluster to estimate density at RM measurement locations. By grouping RM values into three density bins (outskirts, filaments, and nodes) we examined RM variance linked to mean density. We found an RM variance excess of 2.5 \pm 0.5 rad^2 m^{-4} between the lowest-density regions outside the supercluster and the low-density filamentary regions within. This suggests an intervening magnetic field in the supercluster filaments. Modeling the RM variance with a single scale, randomly oriented magnetic field, we constrained the line of sight magnetic field to B_{//} = 19^{+50}_{-8} nG after marginalizing over reversal scale and path length. Our findings align with previous studies of large scale structure filaments, suggesting that adiabatic compression alone (B_{||} \sim 2 nG) cannot fully explain the observed field strengths. Other amplification mechanisms likely contribute to the evolution of magnetic fields in superclusters.</description>

      <title>Hints of Primordial Magnetic Fields at Recombination and Implications for the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial Magnetic Fields (PMFs), long studied as potential relics of the early Universe, accelerate the recombination process and have been proposed as a possible way to relieve the Hubble tension. However, previous studies relied on simplified toy models. In this study, for the first time, we use the recent high-precision evaluations of recombination with PMFs, incorporating full magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations and detailed Lyman-alpha radiative transfer, to test PMF-enhanced recombination ($b\Lambda$CDM) against observational data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and Type Ia supernovae (SN). Focusing on non-helical PMFs with a Batchelor spectrum, we find a preference for present-day total field strengths of approximately 5-10 pico-Gauss. Depending on the dataset combination, this preference ranges from mild ($\sim 1.8\sigma$ with Planck + DESI) to moderate ($\sim 3\sigma$ with Planck + DESI + SH0ES-calibrated SN) significance. The $b\Lambda$CDM has Planck + DESI $\chi^2$ values equal or better than those of the $\Lambda$CDM model while predicting a higher Hubble constant. The favored field strengths align closely with those required for cluster magnetic fields to originate entirely from primordial sources, without the need for additional dynamo amplification or stellar magnetic field contamination. Future high-resolution CMB temperature and polarization measurements will be crucial for confirming or further constraining the presence of PMFs at recombination.</description>

      <title>Galactic Halos and rotating bosonic dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07839v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotating bosonic dark matter halos are considered as potential candidates for modeling dark matter in galactic halos. These bosonic dark matter halos can be viewed as a dilute and very extended version of bosonic stars, and the methods used for the calculation and analysis of the latter objects can be directly applied. Bosonic stars, a hypothetical type of astrophysical objects, are categorized into two primary families, based on the nature of the particles composing them: Einstein-Klein-Gordon stars and Proca stars. We examine various models from both families and the rotation curves which their contribution induces in different galaxies, to identify the most plausible candidates that explain the flattening of orbital velocities observed in galactic halos. By exploring different combinations of our dark matter models with observable galactic features, we propose an interesting source to compensate for the apparent lack of matter in dwarf and spiral galaxies, providing a possible explanation for this longstanding astronomical puzzle.</description>

      <title>The AstroSat UV Deep Field South II: A diverse set of Lyman-continuum leakers at $z\sim1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09515v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the detection of 5 newly identifed Lyman-continuum (LyC) leaker candidates at redshifts 0.99-1.42 in the AstroSat UV Deep Field South F154W image. We derive physical properties of these galaxies using a combination of spectral-energy distribution fitting and information from publicly available spectra. The estimated escape fraction of these objects vary from 14-85\% after accounting for the IGM attenuation. With only about a dozen known leakers at these redshifts, these detections significantly raise the fraction of LyC leakers in this redshift range. High-resolution HST UV imaging reveals that a subset of the galaxies in our sample have blue star-forming structures that are likely associated with harder ionizing sources. We find tentative evidence that the LyC emission is spatially offset from the non-ionizing UV continuum centers of these galaxies. The integrated properties of these galaxies, such as the UV continuum slope, dust attenuation, stellar mass, and $[\text{O III}] \lambda 5007/ [\text{O II}] \lambda 3727$ ratios, make them atypical compared to known LyC leakers. The leakage of LyC photons from these systems presents a compelling challenge.</description>

      <title>The GALAH Survey: Stellar parameters and abundances for 800,000 Gaia RVS spectra using GALAH DR4 and The Cannon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analysing stellar parameters and abundances from nearly one million Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) spectra poses challenges due to the limited spectral coverage (restricted to the infrared Ca II triplet) and variable signal-to-noise ratios of the data. To address this, we use The Cannon, a data-driven method, to transfer stellar parameters and abundances from the GALAH (GALactic Archaeology with HERMES) DR4 (R ~ 28,000) catalogue to the lower resolution Gaia DR3 RVS spectra (R ~ 11,500). Our model, trained on 14,484 common targets, predicts parameters such as $T_{\text{eff}}$, $\log g$, and $[\text{Fe/H}]$, along with several other elements across approximately 800,000 Gaia RVS spectra. We utilise stars from open and globular clusters present in the Gaia RVS catalogue to validate our predicted mean $[\text{Fe/H}]$ with high precision (~0.02-0.10 dex). Additionally, we recover the bimodal distribution of $[\text{Ti/Fe}]$ versus $[\text{Fe/H}]$, reflecting the high and low $\alpha$-components of Milky Way disc stars, demonstrating The Cannon's capability for accurate stellar abundance determination from medium-resolution Gaia RVS spectra. The methodologies and resultant catalogue presented in this work highlight the remarkable potential of the RVS dataset, which by the end of the Gaia mission will comprise spectra of over 200 million stars.</description>

      <title>ODIN: Star Formation Histories Reveal Formative Starbursts Experienced by Lyman Alpha Emitting Galaxies at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we test the frequent assumption that Lyman Alpha Emitting galaxies (LAEs) are experiencing their first major burst of star formation at the time of observation. To this end, we identify 74 LAEs from the ODIN Survey with rest-UV-through-NIR photometry from UVCANDELS. For each LAE, we perform non-parametric star formation history (SFH) reconstruction using the Dense Basis Gaussian process-based method of spectral energy distribution fitting. We find that a strong majority (67%) of our LAE SFHs align with the frequently assumed archetype of a first major star formation burst, with at most modest star formation rates (SFRs) in the past. However, the rest of our LAE SFHs have significant amounts of star formation in the past, with 28% exhibiting earlier bursts of star formation with the ongoing burst having the highest SFR (dominant bursts), and the final 5% having experienced their highest SFR in the past (non-dominant bursts). Combining the SFHs indicating first and dominant bursts, ~95% of LAEs are experiencing their largest burst yet -- a formative burst. We also find that the fraction of total stellar mass created in the last 200 Myr is ~1.3 times higher in LAEs than in mass-matched Lyman Break Galaxy (LBG) samples, and that a majority of LBGs are experiencing dominant bursts, reaffirming that LAEs differ from other star forming galaxies. Overall, our results suggest that multiple evolutionary paths can produce galaxies with strong observed Ly$\alpha$ emission.</description>

      <title>Galactic foreground emissions randomization due to chaotic/turbulent dynamics of magnetized plasma dominated by magnetic helicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using results of numerical simulations and astrophysical observations (mainly in the WMAP and Planck frequency bands) it is shown that Galactic foreground emission becomes more sensitive to the mean magnetic field with the frequency, that results in the appearance of two levels of its randomization due to chaotic/turbulent dynamics of magnetized interstellar medium dominated by the magnetic helicity. The galactic foreground emission is more randomized at higher frequencies. The Galactic synchrotron and polarized dust emissions have been studied in detail. It is shown that the magnetic field imposes its level of randomization on the synchrotron and dust emission. The background magnetic field and emission have also been briefly discussed in this context. It is shown that they are considerably less randomized than the foreground ones. The main method for the theoretical consideration used in this study is the Kolmogorov-Iroshnikov phenomenology in the frames of distributed chaos notion. Despite the vast differences in the values of physical parameters and spatio-temporal scales between the numerical simulations and the astrophysical observations, there is a quantitative agreement between the results of the astrophysical observations and the numerical simulations in the frames of the distributed chaos notion.</description>

      <title>PDRs4All. XII. FUV-driven formation of hydrocarbon radicals and their relation with PAHs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present subarcsecond-resolution ALMA mosaics of the Orion Bar PDR in [CI] 609um, C2H (4-3), and C18O (3-2) emission lines complemented by JWST images of H2 and aromatic infrared band (AIB) emission. The rim of the Bar shows very corrugated structures made of small-scale H2 dissociation fronts (DFs). The [CI] 609 um emission peaks very close (~0.002 pc) to the main H2-emitting DFs, suggesting the presence of gas density gradients. These DFs are also bright and remarkably similar in C2H emission, which traces "hydrocarbon radical peaks" characterized by very high C2H abundances, reaching up to several x10^-7. The high abundance of C2H and of related hydrocarbon radicals, such as CH3, CH2, and CH, can be attributed to gas-phase reactions driven by elevated temperatures, the presence of C+ and C, and the reactivity of FUV-pumped H2. The hydrocarbon radical peaks roughly coincide with maxima of the 3.4/3.3 um AIB intensity ratio, a proxy for the aliphatic-to-aromatic content of PAHs. This implies that the conditions triggering the formation of simple hydrocarbons also favor the formation (and survival) of PAHs with aliphatic side groups, potentially via the contribution of bottom-up processes in which abundant hydrocarbon radicals react in situ with PAHs. Ahead of the DFs, in the atomic PDR zone (where [H]&gt;&gt;[H2]), the AIB emission is the brightest, but small PAHs and carbonaceous grains undergo photo-processing due to the stronger FUV field. Our detection of trace amounts of C2H in this zone may result from the photoerosion of these species. This study provides a spatially resolved view of the chemical stratification of key carbon carriers in a PDR. Overall, both bottom-up and top-down processes appear to link simple hydrocarbon molecules with PAHs in molecular clouds; however, the exact chemical pathways and their relative contributions remain to be quantified.</description>

      <title>Wind of Change: Faraday Rotation in a Simulated Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic fields significantly influence the structure of galaxies' interstellar media, but our understanding of magnetic field strengths and structures in external galaxies is severely limited. The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) offers a unique opportunity for improvement due to its proximity and large angular size, allowing for various detailed observations, particularly rich datasets of rotation measures and dispersion measures (RM and DM). However, interpreting these measurements is challenging due to the need for assumptions about the 3D structure for which we can only access line-of-sight integrated quantities. To address this, we conduct a suite of high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the LMC, incorporating star formation, star-by-star feedback, and ram pressure stripping by the Milky Way's circumgalactic medium (CGM), experienced as a circumgalactic wind in the frame of the LMC. Synthetic observations of these simulations allow us to identify parameters that closely match observed RM and DM values. Our best model, which is an excellent match to the real LMC, yields magnetic field strengths of $\sim 1.4~\mu{\rm G}$ (ordered) and $\sim 1.6~\mu{\rm G}$ (turbulent). In this model, Milky Way CGM wind experienced by the LMC plays a critical role in shaping the RM data, with the bulk of the RM signal arising not from the LMC's plane, but from warm, $\sim 10^4$ K, gas in a Reynolds layer region $\sim 1$ kpc off the plane where relatively dense material stripped from the LMC is partially ionised by hard extragalactic radiation fields. This finding suggests that we should be cautious about generalising inferences from the LMC to other galaxies that may not be shaped by similar interactions.</description>

      <title>ATOMS: ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions -XXI. A Large-sample Observational Study of Ethanol and Dimethyl Ether in Hot Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hot cores, as a stage of massive star formation, exhibit abundant line emissions of COMs. We present a deep line survey of two isomers of C$_2$H$_6$O: ethanol (C$_2$H$_5$OH; EA), and dimethyl ether (CH$_3$OCH$_3$; DE) as well as their possible precursor CH$_3$OH towards 60 hot cores by using the ALMA 3 mm line observations. EA is detected in 40 hot cores and DE is detected in 59 hot cores. Of these, EA and DE are simultaneously detected in 39 hot cores. We calculate rotation temperatures and column densities of EA and DE by using the XCLASS software. The average rotation temperature of EA is higher than that of DE, whereas the average column density of EA is lower than that of DE. Combined with previous studies of hot cores and hot corinos, we find strong column density correlations among EA and DE ($\rho$ = 0.92), EA and CH$_3$OH ($\rho$ = 0.82), as well as DE and CH$_3$OH ($\rho$ = 0.80). The column density ratios of EA/DE versus the column densities of CH$_3$OH remain nearly constant with values within ~ 1 order of magnitude. These strong correlations and the stable ratios, suggest that EA, DE, and CH$_3$OH could be chemically linked, with CH$_3$OH potentially serving as a precursor for EA and DE. Compared with chemical models, the three different warm-up timescale models result in the systematic overproduction of EA and the systematic underproduction of DE. Therefore, our large sample observations can provide crucial constraints on chemical models.</description>

      <title>Regulating Sommerfeld resonances for multi-state systems and higher partial waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-range attractive interactions between dark matter particles can significantly enhance their annihilation, particularly at low velocities. This ``Sommerfeld enhancement'' is typically computed by evaluating the deformation of the two-particle wavefunction due to the long-range potential, while ignoring the physics associated with the annihilation, and then scaling the appropriate annihilation matrix elements by factors that depend on the wavefunction in the limit where the particles approach zero relative separation. It has long been recognized that this approach is a valid approximation only in the limit where the annihilation rate is small, and breaks down in the regime where the enhanced annihilation rate approaches the unitarity bound, in which case ignoring the impact of the annihilation physics on the two-particle wavefunction cannot be justified and leads to apparent violations of unitarity. In the case where the physics relevant to annihilation occurs at a parametrically shorter distance scale (higher energy scale) compared with the long-range potential, we provide a simple prescription for correcting the Sommerfeld enhancement for the effects of the short-range physics, valid for all partial waves and for systems where multiple states are coupled by the long-range potential.</description>
