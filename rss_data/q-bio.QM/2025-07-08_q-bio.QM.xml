      <title>Human-Guided Feature Selection for Accurate Cardiomyocyte Dysfunction Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early identification of cardiomyocyte dysfunction is a critical challenge for the prognosis of diastolic heart failure (DHF) exhibiting impaired left ventricular relaxation (ILVR). Myocardial relaxation relies strongly on efficient intracellular calcium (${\text{Ca}}^{2+}$) handling. During diastole, a sluggish removal of ${\text{Ca}}^{2+}$ from cardiomyocytes disrupts sarcomere relaxation, leading to ILVR \textit{at the organ level}. Characterizing myocardial relaxation \textit{at the cellular level} requires analyzing both sarcomere length (SL) transients and intracellular calcium kinetics (CK). However, due to the complexity and redundancy in SL and CK data, identifying the most informative features for accurate classification is challenging. To address this, we developed a robust feature selection pipeline involving statistical significance testing (p-values), hierarchical clustering, and feature importance evaluation using random forest (RF) classification to select the most informative features from SL and CK data. SL and CK transients were obtained from prior studies involving a transgenic phospho-ablated mouse model exhibiting ILVR (AAA mice) and wild-type as non-transgenic control mice (NTG). By iteratively refining the feature set, we trained a RF classifier using the selected reduced features. For comparison, we evaluated the performance of the classifier using the full set of original features as well as a dimensionally reduced set derived through principal component analysis (PCA). The confusion matrices demonstrated that the reduced feature set achieved comparable performance to the full feature set and outperformed the PCA-based approach, while offering better interpretability by retaining biologically relevant features. These findings suggest that a small, carefully chosen set of biological features can effectively detect early signs of cardiomyocyte dysfunction.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Swarms Durability to Threats via Graph Signal Processing and GNN-based Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Swarms, such as schools of fish or drone formations, are prevalent in both natural and engineered systems. While previous works have focused on the social interactions within swarms, the role of external perturbations--such as environmental changes, predators, or communication breakdowns--in affecting swarm stability is not fully understood. Our study addresses this gap by modeling swarms as graphs and applying graph signal processing techniques to analyze perturbations as signals on these graphs. By examining predation, we uncover a "detectability-durability trade-off", demonstrating a tension between a swarm's ability to evade detection and its resilience to predation, once detected. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this trade-off, explicitly tying it to properties of the swarm's spatial configuration. Toward task-specific optimized swarms, we introduce SwaGen, a graph neural network-based generative model. We apply SwaGen to resilient swarm generation by defining a task-specific loss function, optimizing the contradicting trade-off terms simultaneously.With this, SwaGen reveals novel spatial configurations, optimizing the trade-off at both ends. Applying the model can guide the design of robust artificial swarms and deepen our understanding of natural swarm dynamics.</description>

      <title>LANTERN: A Machine Learning Framework for Lipid Nanoparticle Transfection Efficiency Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of new ionizable lipids for efficient lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-mediated RNA delivery remains a critical bottleneck for RNA-based therapeutics development. Recent advances have highlighted the potential of machine learning (ML) to predict transfection efficiency from molecular structure, enabling high-throughput virtual screening and accelerating lead identification. However, existing approaches are hindered by inadequate data quality, ineffective feature representations, low predictive accuracy, and poor generalizability. Here, we present LANTERN (Lipid nANoparticle Transfection Efficiency pRedictioN), a robust ML framework for predicting transfection efficiency based on ionizable lipid representation. We benchmarked a diverse set of ML models against AGILE, a previously published model developed for transfection prediction. Our results show that combining simpler models with chemically informative features, particularly count-based Morgan fingerprints, outperforms more complex models that rely on internally learned embeddings, such as AGILE. We also show that a multi-layer perceptron trained on a combination of Morgan fingerprints and Expert descriptors achieved the highest performance ($\text{R}^2$ = 0.8161, r = 0.9053), significantly exceeding AGILE ($\text{R}^2$ = 0.2655, r = 0.5488). We show that the models in LANTERN consistently have strong performance across multiple evaluation metrics. Thus, LANTERN offers a robust benchmarking framework for LNP transfection prediction and serves as a valuable tool for accelerating lipid-based RNA delivery systems design.</description>

      <title>SPATIA: Multimodal Model for Prediction and Generation of Spatial Cell Phenotypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how cellular morphology, gene expression, and spatial organization jointly shape tissue function is a central challenge in biology. Image-based spatial transcriptomics technologies now provide high-resolution measurements of cell images and gene expression profiles, but machine learning methods typically analyze these modalities in isolation or at limited resolution. We address the problem of learning unified, spatially aware representations that integrate cell morphology, gene expression, and spatial context across biological scales. This requires models that can operate at single-cell resolution, reason across spatial neighborhoods, and generalize to whole-slide tissue organization. Here, we introduce SPATIA, a multi-scale generative and predictive model for spatial transcriptomics. SPATIA learns cell-level embeddings by fusing image-derived morphological tokens and transcriptomic vector tokens using cross-attention and then aggregates them at niche and tissue levels using transformer modules to capture spatial dependencies. SPATIA incorporates token merging in its generative diffusion decoder to synthesize high-resolution cell images conditioned on gene expression. We assembled a multi-scale dataset consisting of 17 million cell-gene pairs, 1 million niche-gene pairs, and 10,000 tissue-gene pairs across 49 donors, 17 tissue types, and 12 disease states. We benchmark SPATIA against 13 existing models across 12 individual tasks, which span several categories including cell annotation, cell clustering, gene imputation, cross-modal prediction, and image generation. SPATIA achieves improved performance over all baselines and generates realistic cell morphologies that reflect transcriptomic perturbations.</description>

      <title>The Spatial Regime Conversion Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the spatial regime conversion method (SRCM), a novel hybrid modelling framework for simulating reaction-diffusion systems that adaptively combines stochastic discrete and deterministic continuum representations. Extending the regime conversion method (RCM) to spatial settings, the SRCM employs a discrete reaction-diffusion master equation (RDME) representation in regions of low concentration and continuum partial differential equations (PDEs) where concentrations are high, dynamically switching based on local thresholds. This enables efficient and accurate simulation of systems in which stochasticity plays a key role but is not required uniformly across the domain. We specify the full mathematical formulation of the SRCM, including conversion reactions, hybrid kinetic rules, and consistent numerical updates. The method is validated across several one-dimensional test systems, including simple diffusion from a region of high concentration, the formation of a morphogen gradient, and the propagation of FKPP travelling waves. Results show that the SRCM captures key stochastic features while offering substantial gains in computational efficiency over fully stochastic models.</description>

      <title>Completion of the DrugMatrix Toxicogenomics Database using 3-Dimensional Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore applying a tensor completion approach to complete the DrugMatrix toxicogenomics dataset. Our hypothesis is that by preserving the 3-dimensional structure of the data, which comprises tissue, treatment, and transcriptomic measurements, and by leveraging a machine learning formulation, our approach will improve upon prior state-of-the-art results. Our results demonstrate that the new tensor-based method more accurately reflects the original data distribution and effectively captures organ-specific variability. The proposed tensor-based methodology achieved lower mean squared errors and mean absolute errors compared to both conventional Canonical Polyadic decomposition and 2-dimensional matrix factorization methods. In addition, our non-negative tensor completion implementation reveals relationships among tissues. Our findings not only complete the world's largest in-vivo toxicogenomics database with improved accuracy but also offer a promising methodology for future studies of drugs that may cross species barriers, for example, from rats to humans.</description>

      <title>Artificial intelligence in drug discovery: A comprehensive review with a case study on hyperuricemia, gout arthritis, and hyperuricemic nephropathy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper systematically reviews recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), with a particular focus on machine learning (ML), across the entire drug discovery pipeline. Due to the inherent complexity, escalating costs, prolonged timelines, and high failure rates of traditional drug discovery methods, there is a critical need to comprehensively understand how AI/ML can be effectively integrated throughout the full process. Currently available literature reviews often narrowly focus on specific phases or methodologies, neglecting the dependence between key stages such as target identification, hit screening, and lead optimization. To bridge this gap, our review provides a detailed and holistic analysis of AI/ML applications across these core phases, highlighting significant methodological advances and their impacts at each stage. We further illustrate the practical impact of these techniques through an in-depth case study focused on hyperuricemia, gout arthritis, and hyperuricemic nephropathy, highlighting real-world successes in molecular target identification and therapeutic candidate discovery. Additionally, we discuss significant challenges facing AI/ML in drug discovery and outline promising future research directions. Ultimately, this review serves as an essential orientation for researchers aiming to leverage AI/ML to overcome existing bottlenecks and accelerate drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Segmentation of separated Lumens in 3D CTA images of Aortic Dissection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aortic dissection is a serious pathology and requires an emergency management. It is characterized by one or more tears of the intimal wall of the normal blood duct of the aorta (true lumen); the blood under pressure then creates a second blood lumen (false lumen) in the media tissue. The two lumens are separated by an intimal wall, called flap. From the segmentation of connected lumens (more precisely, blood inside lumens) of an aortic dissection 3D Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) image, our previous studies allow us to retrieve the intimal flap by using Mathematical Morphology operators, and characterize intimal tears by 3d thin surfaces that fill them, these surfaces are obtained by operating the Aktouf et al. closing algorithm proposed in the framework of Digital Topology. Indeed, intimal tears are 3D holes in the intimal flap; although it is impossible to directly segment such non-concrete data, it is nevertheless possible to "materialize" them with these 3D filling surfaces that may be quantified or make easier the visualization of these holes.
  In this paper, we use these surfaces that fill tears to cut connections between lumens in order to separate them.
  This is the first time that surfaces filling tears are used as an image processing operator (to disconnect several parts of a 3D object). This lumen separation allows us to provide one of the first cartographies of an aortic dissection, that may better visually assist physicians during their diagnosis.
  Our method is able to disconnect lumens, that may also lead to enhance several current investigations (registration, segmentation, hemodynamics).</description>

      <title>Structure from Noise: Confirmation Bias in Particle Picking in Structural Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confirmation bias is a fundamental challenge in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), where prior expectations can lead to systematic errors in data interpretation. This bias may emerge at multiple stages of the reconstruction pipeline, and in particular in the critical particle picking stage, where 2D particles (in cryo-EM) or 3D subtomograms (in cryo-ET) are extracted from highly noisy micrographs or tomograms. Focusing on two widely used methodologies, template matching and deep neural networks, we combine theoretical analysis with controlled experiments to demonstrate that both methods, when applied to pure noise, can produce persistent molecular structures, a phenomenon we term structure from noise. This artifact highlights a critical vulnerability in current workflows: the potential for particle-picking algorithms to inject strong prior-driven bias into downstream analyses. We then propose practical mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of such biases. Together, our findings deepen the theoretical understanding of confirmation bias in cryo-EM and cryo-ET and call for cautious interpretation of reconstructions, primarily when relying on template-driven particle picking.</description>

Abstract: We summarize recent progress on the theory and applications of structural identifiability of compartmental models. On the applications side, we review identifiability analyses undertaken recently for models arising in epidemiology, oncology, and other areas; and we summarize common approaches for handling models that are unidentifiable. We also highlight recent theoretical and algorithmic results on how to reparametrize unidentifiable models and, in the context of linear compartmental models, how to predict identifiability properties directly from the model structure. Finally, we highlight future research directions.</description>

      <title>A cautionary tale of model misspecification and identifiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematical models are routinely applied to interpret biological data, with common goals that include both prediction and parameter estimation. A challenge in mathematical biology, in particular, is that models are often complex and non-identifiable, while data are limited. Rectifying identifiability through simplification can seemingly yield more precise parameter estimates, albeit, as we explore in this perspective, at the potentially catastrophic cost of introducing model misspecification and poor accuracy. We demonstrate how uncertainty in model structure can be propagated through to uncertainty in parameter estimates using a semi-parametric Gaussian process approach that delineates parameters of interest from uncertainty in model terms. Specifically, we study generalised logistic growth with an unknown crowding function, and a spatially resolved process described by a partial differential equation with a time-dependent diffusivity parameter. Allowing for structural model uncertainty yields more robust and accurate parameter estimates, and a better quantification of remaining uncertainty. We conclude our perspective by discussing the connections between identifiability and model misspecification, and alternative approaches to dealing with model misspecification in mathematical biology.</description>

      <title>Species Vulnerability and Ecosystem Fragility: A Dual Perspective in Food Webs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ecosystems face intensifying threats from climate change, overexploitation, and other human pressures, emphasizing the urgent need to identify keystone species and vulnerable ones. While established network-based measures often rely on a single metric to quantify a species' relevance, they overlook how organisms can be both carbon providers and consumers, thus playing a dual role in food webs. Here, we introduce a novel approach that assigns each species two complementary scores--an importance index quantifying their centrality as carbon source and a predatory index capturing their vulnerability. We show that species with high importance index are more likely to trigger co-extinctions upon removal, while high-robustness index species typically endure until later stages of collapse, in line with their broader prey ranges. On the other hand, low robustness index species are the most vulnerable and susceptible to extinctions. Tested on multiple food webs, our method outperforms traditional degree-based analyses and competes effectively with eigenvector-based approaches, while also providing additional insights. This scalable and data-driven approach, relying solely on interaction data, provides a cost-effective tool that complements expert classifications for prioritizing conservation efforts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07836v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cancer evolves continuously over time through a complex interplay of genetic, epigenetic, microenvironmental, and phenotypic changes. This dynamic behavior drives uncontrolled cell growth, metastasis, immune evasion, and therapy resistance, posing challenges for effective monitoring and treatment. However, today's data-driven research in oncology has primarily focused on cross-sectional analysis using data from a single modality, limiting the ability to fully characterize and interpret the disease's dynamic heterogeneity. Advances in multiscale data collection and computational methods now enable the discovery of longitudinal multimodal biomarkers for precision oncology. Longitudinal data reveal patterns of disease progression and treatment response that are not evident from single-timepoint data, enabling timely abnormality detection and dynamic treatment adaptation. Multimodal data integration offers complementary information from diverse sources for more precise risk assessment and targeting of cancer therapy. In this review, we survey methods of longitudinal and multimodal modeling, highlighting their synergy in providing multifaceted insights for personalized care tailored to the unique characteristics of a patient's cancer. We summarize the current challenges and future directions of longitudinal multimodal analysis in advancing precision oncology.</description>

Abstract: There is growing recognition in both the experimental and modelling literature of the importance of spatial structure to the dynamics of viral infections in tissues. Aided by the evolution of computing power and motivated by recent biological insights, there has been an explosion of new, spatially-explicit models for within-host viral dynamics in recent years. This development has only been accelerated in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Spatially-structured models offer improved biological realism and can account for dynamics which cannot be well-described by conventional, mean-field approaches. However, despite their growing popularity, spatially-structured models of viral dynamics are underused in biological applications. One major obstacle to the wider application of such models is the huge variety in approaches taken, with little consensus as to which features should be included and how they should be implemented for a given biological context. Previous reviews of the field have focused on specific modelling frameworks or on models for particular viral species. Here, we instead apply a scoping review approach to the literature of spatially-structured viral dynamics models as a whole to provide an exhaustive update of the state of the field. Our analysis is structured along two axes, methodology and viral species, in order to examine the breadth of techniques used and the requirements of different biological applications. We then discuss the contributions of mathematical and computational modelling to our understanding of key spatially-structured aspects of viral dynamics, and suggest key themes for future model development to improve robustness and biological utility.</description>

      <title>EAP4EMSIG -- Enhancing Event-Driven Microscopy for Microfluidic Single-Cell Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microfluidic Live-Cell Imaging (MLCI) yields data on microbial cell factories. However, continuous acquisition is challenging as high-throughput experiments often lack real-time insights, delaying responses to stochastic events. We introduce three components in the Experiment Automation Pipeline for Event-Driven Microscopy to Smart Microfluidic Single-Cell Analysis (EAP4EMSIG): a fast, accurate Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)-based autofocusing method predicting the focus offset, an evaluation of real-time segmentation methods and a real-time data analysis dashboard. Our MLP-based autofocusing achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.105 $\mu$m with inference times from 87 ms. Among eleven evaluated Deep Learning (DL) segmentation methods, Cellpose reached a Panoptic Quality (PQ) of 93.36 %, while a distance-based method was fastest (121 ms, Panoptic Quality 93.02 %).</description>

      <title>Predicting function of evolutionarily implausible DNA sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Genomic language models (gLMs) show potential for generating novel, functional DNA sequences for synthetic biology, but doing so requires them to learn not just evolutionary plausibility, but also sequence-to-function relationships. We introduce a set of prediction tasks called Nullsettes, which assesses a model's ability to predict loss-of-function mutations created by translocating key control elements in synthetic expression cassettes. Across 12 state-of-the-art models, we find that mutation effect prediction performance strongly correlates with the predicted likelihood of the nonmutant. Furthermore, the range of likelihood values predictive of strong model performance is highly dependent on sequence length. Our work highlights the importance of considering both sequence likelihood and sequence length when using gLMs for mutation effect prediction.</description>

      <title>Quantification of Information Flow by Dual Reporter System and Its Application to Bacterial Chemotaxis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mutual information is a theoretically grounded metric for quantifying cellular signaling pathways. However, its measurement demands characterization of both input and output distributions, limiting practical applications. Here, we present alternative method that alleviates this requirement using dual reporter systems. By extending extrinsic-intrinsic noise analysis, we derive a mutual information estimator that eliminates the need to measure input distribution. We demonstrate our method by analyzing the bacterial chemotactic pathway, regarding multiple flagellar motors as natural dual reporters. We show the biological relevance of the measured information flow by comparing it with theoretical bounds on sensory information. This framework opens new possibilities for quantifying information flow in cellular signaling pathways.</description>

      <title>SHREC: A Framework for Advancing Next-Generation Computational Phenotyping with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: Computational phenotyping is a central informatics activity with resulting cohorts supporting a wide variety of applications. However, it is time-intensive because of manual data review, limited automation, and difficulties in adapting algorithms across sources. Since LLMs have demonstrated promising capabilities for text classification, comprehension, and generation, we posit they will perform well at repetitive manual review tasks traditionally performed by human experts. To support next-generation computational phenotyping methods, we developed SHREC, a framework for comprehensive integration of LLMs into end-to-end phenotyping pipelines. Methods: We applied and tested the ability of three lightweight LLMs (Gemma2 27 billion, Mistral Small 24 billion, and Phi-4 14 billion) to classify concepts and phenotype patients using previously developed phenotypes for ARF respiratory support therapies. Results: All models performed well on concept classification, with the best model (Mistral) achieving an AUROC of 0.896 across all relevant concepts. For phenotyping, models demonstrated near-perfect specificity for all phenotypes, and the top-performing model (Mistral) reached an average AUROC of 0.853 for single-therapy phenotypes, despite lower performance on multi-therapy phenotypes. Conclusion: Current lightweight LLMs can feasibly assist researchers with resource-intensive phenotyping tasks such as manual data review. There are several advantages of LLMs that support their application to computational phenotyping, such as their ability to adapt to new tasks with prompt engineering alone and their ability to incorporate raw EHR data. Future steps to advance next-generation phenotyping methods include determining optimal strategies for integrating biomedical data, exploring how LLMs reason, and advancing generative model methods.</description>

      <title>A practical identifiability criterion leveraging weak-form parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we define a practical identifiability criterion, (e, q)-identifiability, based on a parameter e, reflecting the noise in observed variables, and a parameter q, reflecting the mean-square error of the parameter estimator. This criterion is better able to encompass changes in the quality of the parameter estimate due to increased noise in the data (compared to existing criteria based solely on average relative errors). Furthermore, we leverage a weak-form equation error-based method of parameter estimation for systems with unobserved variables to assess practical identifiability far more quickly in comparison to output error-based parameter estimation. We do so by generating weak-form input-output equations using differential algebra techniques, as previously proposed by Boulier et al [1], and then applying Weak form Estimation of Nonlinear Dynamics (WENDy) to obtain parameter estimates. This method is computationally efficient and robust to noise, as demonstrated through two classical biological modelling examples.</description>

      <title>A Real-Time Digital Twin for Type 1 Diabetes using Simulation-Based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately estimating parameters of physiological models is essential to achieving reliable digital twins. For Type 1 Diabetes, this is particularly challenging due to the complexity of glucose-insulin interactions. Traditional methods based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo struggle with high-dimensional parameter spaces and fit parameters from scratch at inference time, making them slow and computationally expensive. In this study, we propose a Simulation-Based Inference approach based on Neural Posterior Estimation to efficiently capture the complex relationships between meal intake, insulin, and glucose level, providing faster, amortized inference. Our experiments demonstrate that SBI not only outperforms traditional methods in parameter estimation but also generalizes better to unseen conditions, offering real-time posterior inference with reliable uncertainty quantification.</description>
