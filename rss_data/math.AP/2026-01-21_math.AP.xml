      <title>Poisson semigroup and the Gruet formula for the heat kernels on spaces of constant curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the Poisson and heat equations on spaces of constant curvature. More explicitly we provide new methods for obtaining old and new explicit formulas for the Poisson and heat semigroups on the Euclidean, spherical and hyperbolic spaces $\R^n$, $\S^n$ and $\H^n$ . We obtain the Gruet formula for the heat kernels in Euclidean and spherical spaces $\R^n$ and $\S^n$, which are new and we provide a new elementary method to derive the classical Gruet formula Gruet\cite{Gruet} for the kernel of the heat semigroup on the hyperbolic space $\H^n$.</description>

      <title>Construction of a Gibbs measure for the zonal Dirac equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework to construct Gibbs measures for the Dirac equation. We consider the Dirac equation on the sphere with a "Hartree-type" nonlinearity. We consider a zonal model, that is the analog of a spherically symmetric model but on the sphere. We build a Gibbs measure for this model. With a compactness argument, we prove the existence of a random variable that is a weak solution to the Dirac equation and whose law is the Gibbs measure at all times.</description>

      <title>On large periodic traveling surface waves in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study large traveling surface waves within a two-dimensional finite depth, free boundary, homogeneous, incompressible and viscous fluid governed by Darcy's law. The fluid is bound by a gravitational force to a flat rigid bottom and meets an atmosphere of constant pressure at the top with its free surface, where it does not experience any capillarity effects. Additionally, the fluid is subject to a fixed, but arbitrarily selected, forcing data profile with variable amplitude. We use the Riemann mapping to equivalently reformulate the resulting two-dimensional free boundary problem as a single one-dimensional fully nonlinear pseudodifferential equation for a function describing the domain's geometry. By discovering a hidden ellipticity in the reformulated equation, we are able to import a global implicit function theorem to construct a connected set of traveling waves, containing both the quiescent solution and large amplitude members. We find that either solutions continue to exist for arbitrarily large data amplitude or else one of a finite number of meaningful breakdown scenarios must occur. This work stands as the first non perturbative construction of large traveling surface waves in any free boundary viscous fluid without surface tension.</description>

      <title>Topological and Purely Topological Alignment Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Euler Alignment system of collective behavior, equipped with `topological' interaction protocols, which were introduced to the mathematical literature by Shvydkoy and Tadmor. Interactions subject to these protocols may depend on both the Euclidean distance between agents and on the mass distribution between them -- the `topological' component. When the interaction protocol is regular, we prove sufficient conditions for the existence of global-in-time classical solutions, related to the initial nonnegativity of a conserved quantity of the system. The remainder of our results explore the case where the interactions are `purely' topological and the interactions do not depend on the Euclidean distance. We show that in this case, the system decouples into an autonomous velocity equation in mass coordinates together with a scalar conservation law with time-dependent flux determined by the velocity. We analyze the long-time behavior for the dynamics associated to both regular and singular protocols.</description>

      <title>Weighted fractional ultrahyperbolic diffusion on geometrically deformed domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard fractional models on manifolds often conflate geometric anisotropy with medium heterogeneity. In this Letter, we overcome this rigidity by deriving the fundamental solution for a weighted space-time fractional ultrahyperbolic operator, denoted by $(-\Box_{\phi,\omega})^{\beta}$. Using a novel spectral approach based on the Weighted Fourier Transform, we explicitly \textbf{decouple the medium density from the geometric deformation}. A crucial finding is the emergence of a \textbf{geometry-independent drift mechanism} driven purely by the inhomogeneity of the medium. The Green's function is obtained in closed form via the Fox H-function, providing a unified and computable framework for anomalous transport in complex, structurally deformed media.</description>

      <title>Global weak solutions to the isentropic compressible Navier--Stokes equations with vacuum and unbounded density in a half-plane under Dirichlet boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the global existence of a class of weak solutions to the isentropic compressible Navier--Stokes equations in a half-plane with Dirichlet boundary conditions, allowing for vacuum both in the interior and at infinity, under a suitably small initial total energy. The solutions constructed here admit unbounded densities and lie in an intermediate regularity regime between the finite-energy weak solutions of Lions--Feireisl and the framework of Hoff. This result generalizes previous works of Hoff (Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 55 (2002), pp. 1365--1407) and Perepelitsa (Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 212 (2014), pp. 709--726) concerning discontinuous solutions by allowing vacuum states and unbounded density. Our analysis relies on the Green function method and new estimates involving the specific structure of the equations and the geometry of the half-plane. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result concerning global weak solutions within Hoff's framework on an unbounded domain that simultaneously accommodates Dirichlet boundary conditions and far-field vacuum. The intermediate-regularity class developed here may be viewed as a natural extension of Hoff's theory, precisely tailored to overcome the two corresponding obstructions: the lack of global space-time control of the effective viscous flux arising from far-field vacuum and the absence of boundary-induced regularity gains in the no-slip setting.</description>

      <title>Lowest eigenvalues and higher order elliptic differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a closed, smooth Riemannian manifold of dimension $m \geq 1$. It is not difficult to produce an example of an elliptic differential operator on $(M,g)$ that has the property that there exists a sign-changing eigenfunction that is associated with the lowest eigenvalue. Indeed, $\Delta_g^2 + \lambda_2 \Delta_g$ does the job, where $\Delta_g:=div_g \nabla_g$. and where $\lambda_2$ is the second lowest eigenvalue of the operator $-\Delta_g$. The question that remains is how rare are elliptic differential operators whose lowest eigenvalue has this property. In this paper, the author proves that elliptic operators of the form $\Delta_g^2 - div_g(T-\lambda_2 g^{-1}) d$, where $T$ is a negative semi-definite $(2,0)$-tensor field on $M$, and where $g^{-1}$ is the inverse metric tensor, have the property that there exists a sign-changing eigenfunction that is associated with the lowest eigenvalue of the operator. This suggests that there are a lot of fourth-order elliptic operators with the property that there exists a sign-changing eigenfunction that is associated with the lowest eigenvalue of the operator.</description>

      <title>Microscopic derivation of a one-dimensional lubrication model with roughness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a hydrodynamic model for the motion of inertial particles with a spherical hard core, interacting through lubrication forces and pairwise repulsive forces. The repulsion arises from the assumption that each particle is surrounded by a thin rough layer of reduced permeability. We prove that, as the number of particles tends to infinity (and their size tends to 0), the microscopic dynamics converges to a macroscopic hydrodynamic model in which congestion effects are encoded directly into the macroscopic interaction forces, depending on a local critical density transported by the flow. In particular, we extend the work of Lefebvre-Lepot and Maury where non-inertial particles, submitted to only a lubrication force were considered, and present the convergence proof when inertial effects and roughness are taken into account.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Landau-de Gennes theory in the one constant limit. The bulk domain is the exterior of a spherical colloid. A Rapini-Papoular surface potential is imposed on the colloid surface, supplemented by a homogeneous far-field condition at spatial infinity. Under the axially symmetric ansatz and the Lyuksyutov constraint, we show that energy minimizers exhibit boojum disclinations at the two poles of the colloid. The local structure of these boojum disclinations is also characterized.</description>

      <title>Sharpness of the Osgood Criterion for the Continuity Equation with Divergence-free Vector Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any modulus of continuity $\omega$ that fails the Osgood condition, we construct a divergence-free velocity field $v \in C_t C^\omega_x$ for which the associated ODE admits at least two distinct flow maps. In other words, non-uniqueness does not occur merely for a single or even finitely many trajectories, but instead on a set of initial conditions $E$ of positive Lebesgue measure. In fact, the set $E$ has full measure inside a cube where the construction is supported. Moreover, we also construct a divergence-free velocity field $v \in C_{t}C^\omega_x$ for which the associated continuity equation admits two distinct solutions $\mu^1$ and $\mu^2$ which are absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure for almost every time, and start from the same initial datum $\bar \mu \ll \mathscr{L}^{d}$. Our construction introduces two novel ideas: (i) We introduce the notion of "parallelization", where at each time, the velocity field consists of simultaneous motion across multiple nested spatial scales. This differs from most explicit constructions in the literature on mixing or anomalous dissipation, where the velocity on different scales acts at separate times. This is crucial to cover the whole class of non-Osgood moduli of continuity. (ii) Inspired by a recent work of Bru\`e, Colombo and Kumar, we develop a new fixed-point framework that naturally incorporates the parallelization mechanism. This framework allows us to construct anomalous solutions of the continuity equation that belong to $L^1(\mathbb{R}^d)$ a.e. in time.</description>

      <title>Higher integrability of solutions to elliptic equations under additional sign constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solutions to elliptic equations often exhibit higher regularity properties such as \emph{higher integrability}. That is, for instance, a solution $u$ to a system that a priori only satisfies $ u \in W^{1,r}$ is more regular and even in the Sobolev space $W^{1,s}$ for some $s&gt;r$. Under additional constraints of the sign of specific terms such as $(\partial_i u)$ this improvement of regularity can be sharpened further.
  In this work, we consider two examples of such higher integrability results: First, we show a version of M\"uller's result on the higher integrability of the determinant for maps $u \in W^{1,n} $ such that $\mathrm{det}(\nabla u) \geq 0$ (or $ \mathrm{det}_-(\nabla u) \in L \log L$). Second, we consider (very weak) solutions to the $p$-Laplace equation that satisfy sign constraints for their partial derivatives, i.e. that $(\partial_i u)_- $ is of higher integrability than $(\partial_i u)_+$. To prove our results, we use the method of Lipschitz truncation; for the second example we further develop a variation of this technique, the \emph{asymmetric} Lipschitz truncation.</description>

      <title>Navier slip effects in micropolar thin-film flow: a rigorous derivation of Reynolds-type models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stationary flow of incompressible micropolar fluid in a thin three-dimensional domain under Navier slip boundary condition for the velocity and no-spin condition for microrotation. After rescaling the governing equations, we perform a rigorous asymptotic analysis as the film thickness tends to zero, considering a friction coefficient dependent on the small parameter. According to the scaling of the slip coefficient, we identify three distinct regimes: perfect slip, partial slip, and no-slip. For each regime, we derive the corresponding reduced micropolar system and obtain explicit expressions for the velocity and microrotation fields. This leads to a generalized Reynolds-type equation for the pressure, highlighting the impact of slip effects on the micropolar thin-film flow.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a semilinear equation involving the fractional Laplacian on the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^n$. Unlike in conformally compact Einstein manifolds, the fractional Laplacian on $\mathbb{H}^n$ does not enjoy conformal covariance. By employing Helgason-Fourier analysis, we explicitly derive the Green's function of the fractional Laplacian on $\mathbb{H}^n$ and study its asymptotic behaviors. We then apply a direct method of moving planes to the integral form of the equation, establishing symmetry of solutions and nonexistence of positive solutions in the critical and subcritical cases, respectively. In addition, we develop several maximum principles on hyperbolic space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the large-time behavior of solutions to a one-dimensional conservation law featuring a non-convex flux and an artificial heat flux term regulated by Cattaneo's law, forming a 2$\times$2 system of hyperbolic equations. Under the conditions of small wave strength and sufficiently small initial perturbations, we demonstrate the time-asymptotic stability of a composite wave that combines a degenerate Oleinik shock and a rarefaction wave. The proof utilizes the Oleinik entropy condition, the a-contraction method with time-dependent shifts, and weighted energy estimates.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of arbitrary structures in a three-dimensional doubly degenerate nutrient taxis system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The doubly degenerate nutrient taxis system \begin{equation}\label {0.1} \left\{ \begin{aligned} &amp;u_{t}=\nabla \cdot (uv\nabla u)-\chi \nabla \cdot (u^{\alpha}v\nabla v)+\ell uv,&amp;x\in \Omega,\, t&gt;0,\\ &amp; v_{t}=\Delta v-uv,&amp;x\in \Omega,\, t&gt;0,\\ \end{aligned} \right. \end{equation} is considered under zero-flux boundary conditions in a smoothly bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ where $\alpha&gt;0,\chi&gt;0$ and $\ell&gt; 0$. By developing a novel class of functional inequalities to address the challenges posed by
  the doubly degenerate diffusion mechanism in \eqref{0.1}, it is shown that for $\alpha\in(\frac{3}{2},\frac{19}{12})$, the associated initial-boundary value problem admits a global continuous weak solution for sufficiently regular initial data. Furthermore, in an appropriate topological setting, this solution converges to an equilibrium $(u_\infty, 0)$ as $t\rightarrow \infty$. Notably, the limiting profile $u_{\infty}$ is non-homogeneous when the initial signal concentration $v_0$ is sufficiently small, provided the initial data $u_0$ is not identically constant.</description>

When the Cherrier-Escobar invariant of the compact Riemannian manifold with boundary is positive, we show that the optimal controls are equal to their associated optimal states. Moreover, we show that the optimal controls are minimizers of the Cherrier-Escobar functional, and hence induce conformal metrics with zero scalar curvature and constant mean curvature. Furthermore, we show the existence of an optimal control under an Aubin type assumption. For the standard unit ball, we derive a sharp Sobolev trace type inequality and prove that the standard bubbles-namely conformal factor of metrics conformal to the standard one with zero scalar curvature and constant mean curvature -- are the only optimal controls and hence equal to their associated optimal states.</description>

      <title>Representation theorems for nonvariational solutions of the Helmholtz equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a possibly multiply connected bounded open subset $\Omega$ of ${\mathbb{R}}^n$ of class $C^{\max\{1,m\},\alpha}$ for some $m\in {\mathbb{N}}$, $\alpha\in]0,1[$ and we plan to solve both the Dirichlet and the Neumann problem for the Helmholtz equation in $\Omega$ and in the exterior of $\Omega$ in terms of acoustic layer potentials. Then we turn to prove an integral representation theorem solutions of the Helmholtz equation in terms of a single layer acoustic potential. The main focus of the paper is on $\alpha$-H\"{o}lder continuous solutions which may not have a classical normal derivative at the boundary points of $\Omega$ and that may have an infinite Dirichlet integral around the boundary of $\Omega$\, \textit{i.e.}, case $m=0$. Namely for solutions that do not belong to the classical variational setting.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Behavior of the Principal Eigenvalue Problems with Large Divergence-Free Drifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following principal eigenvalue problem with a large divergence-free drift: \begin{equation}\label{0.1} -\varepsilon\Delta \phi-2\alpha\nabla m(x)\cdot\nabla \phi+V(x)\phi=\lambda_\alpha \phi\ \,\ \text{in}\, \ H_0^1(\Omega),\tag{0.1} \end{equation} where the domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^N (N\ge 1)$ is bounded with smooth boundary $\partial\Omega$, the constants $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and $\alpha&gt;0$ are the diffusion and drift coefficients, respectively, and $m(x)\in C^{2}(\bar{\Omega})$, $V (x)\in C^{\gamma}(\bar{\Omega})~(0&lt;\gamma&lt;1)$ are given functions. For a class of divergence-free drifts where $m$ is a harmonic function in $\Omega$ and has no first integral in $H_{0}^{1}(\Omega)$, we prove the convergence of the principal eigenpair $(\lambda_\alpha, \phi)$ for (0.1) as $\alpha\rightarrow+\infty$, which addresses a special case of the open question proposed in [H. Berestycki, F. Hamel and N. Nadirashvili, CMP, 2005]. Moreover, we further investigate the refined limiting profiles of the principal eigenpair $(\lambda_\alpha, \phi)$ for (0.1) as $\alpha\rightarrow+\infty$, which display the visible effects of the large divergence-free drifts on the principal eigenpair $(\lambda_\alpha, \phi)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of radial solutions of the semilinear elliptic equation $\Delta u +f(u)=0$ in ${\bf R^N}$, where $N \geq 3$ and $f$ is a general superciritical nonlinearity. We give a classification of the solution structures with respect to the stability of radial solutions, and establish criteria for the existence and nonexistence of stable radial solutions in terms of the limits of $f'(u)F(u)$ as $u \to 0$ or $\infty$, where $F(u) = \int^{\infty}_u 1/f(t)dt$. Furthermore, we show the relation between the existence of singular stable solutions and the solution structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is devoted to presenting an abstract theory of time-fractional gradient flow equations for time-dependent convex functionals in real Hilbert spaces. The main results are concerned with the existence of strong solutions to time-fractional abstract evolution equations governed by time-dependent subdifferential operators. To prove these results, Gronwall-type lemmas for nonlinear Volterra integral inequalities and fractional chain-rule formulae are developed. Moreover, the obtained abstract results are applied to the initial-boundary value problem for time-fractional nonlinear parabolic equations on moving domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show a localization estimate for local solutions to the parabolic equation $-\partial_t u+\mbox{div} (A\nabla u)=0$ with zero Neumann data, assuming that the $L^p$ Neumann problem and $L^{p'}$ Dirichlet problem for the adjoint operator are solvable in a Lipschitz cylinder for some $p\in(1,\infty)$. Using this result, we establish the solvability of the Neumann problem in the atomic Hardy space for parabolic operators with bounded, measurable, time-dependent coefficients, and hence obtain the interpolation of solvability of the $L^p$ Neumann problem.</description>

      <title>Rigidity results in multi-bubble dynamics for non-radial energy-critical heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the classification of asymptotic behaviors in multi-bubble dynamics for the energy-critical nonlinear heat equations in large dimensions $N\geq7$ without symmetry. This multi-bubble dynamics appears naturally at least for a sequence of times in view of soliton resolution. We assume each bubble is given by the scalings and translations of $\pm W$ with (localized) non-colliding conditions for a sequence of times, where $W$ is the ground state. The case of one soliton was previously established and in particular there is no blow-up. We consider the case of $J\geq2$ solitons, where we expect only infinite-time blow-up.
  We are able to identify three different scenarios, where we have a continuous-in-time resolution with an unexpected universal blow-up speed. The first one is when one scaling is much larger than the others. In this case, one bubble does not concentrate (hence stabilize) and the other bubbles concentrate with the universal blow-up speed $t^{-2/(N-6)}$ together with strong sign constraints. Next, assuming we are not in the first scenario, we establish a non-degenerate condition on the positions of bubbles to obtain that all bubbles concentrate with the universal blow-up speed $t^{-1/(N-4)}$. The last case we consider is a degenerate, but not too much degenerate, scenario. Here again, we obtain that all bubbles concentrate with the universal blow-up speed $t^{-1/(N-3)}$. This last rate has not been discovered before. Our theorem covers the case of four or less bubbles and we provide the construction of examples. To our knowledge, this is the first classification result in the non-radial multi-bubble dynamics, where both the scales, positions, and signs enter the dynamics nontrivially.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a class of non-cylindrical domains where Dirichlet-type problems for parabolic equations, such as the heat equation, can be posed and solved. The regularity for the boundary of this class of domains is a mixed Lipschitz condition, as described in the bulk of the paper. The main tool is an adequate version of the implicit function theorem for functions with this kind of regularity. It is proved that the class introduced herein is of the same type as domains previously considered by several authors.</description>

      <title>A Landau-de Gennes Type Theory for Cholesteric-Helical Smectic-Smectic C* Liquid Crystal Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a rigorous mathematical analysis of a modified Landau-de Gennes (LdG) theory modeling temperature-driven phase transitions between cholesteric, helical smectic, and smectic C* phases. This model couples a tensor-valued order parameter (nematic orientational order) with a real-valued order parameter (smectic layer modulation). We establish the existence of energy minimizers of the modified LdG energy in three dimensions, subject to Dirichlet conditions, and rigorously analyze the energy minimizers in two asymptotic limits. First, in the Oseen--Frank limit, we show that the global minimizer strongly converges to a minimizer of the Landau-de Gennes bulk energy. Second, in the limit of dominant elastic constants, we prove that the global minimizers converge to a classical helical director profile. Finally, through stability analysis and bifurcation theory, we derive the complete sequence of symmetry-breaking transitions with decreasing temperature-from the cholesteric phase (with in-plane twist and no layering) to an intermediate helical smectic phase (with in-plane twist and layering), and ultimately to the smectic C* phase (with out-of-plane twist and layering). These theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A Sharp Global Boundedness Result for Keller--Segel--(Navier--)Stokes Systems with Rapid Diffusion and Saturated Sensitivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Keller--Segel--(Navier--)Stokes system posed in a smooth bounded domain \(\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N\) with \(N = 2,3\): \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} n_t + u \cdot \nabla n = \Delta n - \nabla \cdot \big( n S(n)\nabla c \big), \\[2mm] u \cdot \nabla c = \Delta c - c + n, \\[2mm] u_t + \kappa (u \cdot \nabla) u = \Delta u - \nabla P + n \nabla \phi, \\[2mm] \nabla \cdot u = 0, \end{cases} \end{equation*} where \(\kappa \in \left \{0,1 \right \} \), the given gravitational potential \(\phi \in W^{2, \infty}(\Omega)\), and the chemotactic sensitivity function \(S \in C^2([0,\infty))\).
  Under no-flux boundary conditions for \(n\) and \(c\), together with the Dirichlet boundary condition for \(u\), we show that, provided the initial data satisfy suitable regularity assumptions, the following results hold: \begin{itemize}
  \item If \(N = 2\), \(\kappa = 1\), and the sensitivity function satisfies
  \(\lim_{\xi \to \infty} S(\xi) = 0\), then the Keller--Segel--Navier--Stokes system admits
  a global classical solution that remains uniformly bounded in time.
  \item If \(N = 3\), \(\kappa = 0\), and \(S\) satisfies
  \[
  |S(\xi)| \le K_S (\xi + 1)^{-\alpha} \quad \text{for all } \xi \ge 0,
  \]
  with some constants \(K_S &gt; 0\) and \(\alpha &gt; \frac{1}{3}\), then the
  Keller--Segel--Stokes system possesses a global bounded classical solution. \end{itemize} Our results are optimal, since it is well established that, in the absence of fluid effects, blow-up can occur when $S \equiv \mathrm{const}$ in two dimensions, or when $\alpha &lt; \tfrac{1}{3}$ in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Sub-wavelength resonances in two-dimensional multi-layer elastic media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the sub-wavelength resonances in two-dimensional elastic media characterized by high contrasts in both Lam\'e parameters and density. Our contributions are fourfold. First, it is proved that the operator $\hat{\mathbf{S}}_{\partial D}^{\omega}$, which serves as a leading order approximation to $\mathbf{S}_{\partial D}^{\omega}$ as $\omega\rightarrow0$, is invertible in the space $\mathcal{L}(L^{2}\left(\partial D)^{2},H^{1}(\partial D)^{2}\right)$. Second, based on layer potential techniques in combination with asymptotic analysis, we derive an original formula for the leading-order terms of sub-wavelength resonance frequencies, which are controlled by the determinant of the $3N \times 3N$ matrices. Specifically, there are $3N$ resonance frequencies within an $N$-nested layer structure. In addition, the scattering field exhibits an enhancement coefficient on the order of $\mathcal{O}(\omega^{-2})$ as the incident frequency $\omega$ approaches the resonance frequency. Third, by applying spectral properties to solve the corresponding eigenvalue problem, we compute the quantitative expressions for sub-wavelength resonance frequencies within a disk. Finally, some numerical experiments are provided to illustrate theoretical results and demonstrate the existence of the sub-wavelength resonance modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns wave propagation in a class of scalar reaction-diffusion-convection equations with $p$-Laplacian-type diffusion and monostable reaction. We introduce a new concept of a non-smooth traveling wave profile, which allows us to treat discontinuous diffusion with possible degenerations and singularities at 0 and 1, as well as only piecewise continuous convective velocity. Our approach is based on comparison arguments for an equivalent non-Lipschitz first-order ODE. We formulate sufficient conditions for the existence and non-existence of these generalized solutions and discuss how the convective velocity affects the minimal wave speed compared to the problem without convection. We also provide brief asymptotic analysis of the profiles, for which we need to assume power-type behavior of the diffusion and reaction terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we consider the so-called field-road diffusion model in a bounded domain, consisting of two parabolic PDEs posed on sets of different dimensions and coupled through (symmetric) nonlinear exchange terms. We propose a new and rather direct functional inequalities approach to prove the exponential decay of a relative entropy, and thus the convergence of the solution towards the stationary state selected by the total mass of the initial datum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \emph{Monge-Amp\`ere} torsion deficit of an open, bounded convex set $\Omega\subset\R^n$ of class $C^2$ is the normalized gap between the value of the torsion functional evaluated on $\Omega$ and its value on the ball with the same $(n-1)$-quermassintegral as $\Omega$. Using the technique of the \emph{shape derivative}, we prove that the ratio between this deficit and to a geometric deficit arising from the \emph{Alexandrov-Fenchel inequality}, for any given family of open, bounded convex sets of $\R^n$ ($n\geq2$) of class $C^2$, smoothly converging to a ball, is bounded from below by a dimensional constant. We also show that this ratio is always bounded from above by a constant.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the incompressible generalised Navier-Stokes-Voigt equations within a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, where $d \geq 2$. The governing momentum equation is expressed as: \begin{align*} \partial_t(\boldsymbol{v} - \kappa \Delta \boldsymbol{v}) + \nabla \cdot (\boldsymbol{v} \otimes \boldsymbol{v}) + \nabla \pi - \nu \nabla \cdot \big( |\mathbf{D}(\boldsymbol{v})|^{p-2} \mathbf{D}(\boldsymbol{v}) \big) = \boldsymbol{f}. \end{align*} Here, for $d \in \{2,3\}$, $\boldsymbol{v}$ represents the velocity field, $\pi$ denotes the pressure, and $\boldsymbol{f}$ is the external forcing term. The constants $\kappa$ and $\nu$ correspond to the relaxation time and kinematic viscosity, respectively. The parameter $p \in (1, \infty)$ characterizes the fluid's flow behavior, and $\mathbf{D}(\boldsymbol{v})$ denotes the symmetric part of the velocity gradient $\nabla \boldsymbol{v}$. For the power-law exponent $p \in \big( \frac{2d}{d+2}, \infty \big)$, we establish the existence of a weak solution to the generalised Navier-Stokes-Voigt equations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the weak solution is unique for the same range of the exponent $p$. The optimality of our results lies in the framework's use of a Gelfand triple, which allows the Aubin-Dubinskii lemma to yield strong convergence of approximate solutions, essential for existence and valid precisely for $p &gt; \frac{2d}{d+2}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a Benamou--Brenier type transportation metric for nonnegative measures on a finite reversible Markov chain, which endows the space of measures with a Riemannian structure. Using this geometric framework, we identify a generalized heat equation with source as the gradient flow of the discrete entropy. Moreover, by means of a local \L{}ojasiewicz inequality, we prove exponential convergence of the flow to a unique equilibrium. Our results clarify the role of the Benamou--Brenier formulation in discrete optimal transport for nonnegative measures and provide a coherent geometric interpretation of generalized diffusion equations with source terms.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein geometry of nonnegative measures on finite Markov chains II: Geodesic and duality formulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the geodesic structure and the associated Kantorovich-type duality for a Benamou-Brenier-type transportation metric defined on the space of nonnegative measures over a finite reversible Markov chain. The metric is introduced through a dynamic formulation that combines transport and source costs along solutions of a nonconservative continuity equation, where mass variation is constrained to occur along a fixed strictly positive reference direction. We show that geodesics associated with this metric exhibit a non-locality property: almost every time, they are supported on the whole state space, independently of the choice of endpoints. Moreover, along optimal curves, the source term displays a characteristic temporal profile, with mass creation occurring at early times and subsequent decay as the curve approaches the target measure. As an application of this property, we compare our metric with the shift-transport distance and prove that the latter is always bounded above by our metric. Finally, we establish a Kantorovich-type duality formula in terms of Hamilton-Jacobi subsolutions, which provides a characterization of the metric and highlights the role of the momentum associated with geodesic curves.</description>

      <title>On the splitting of Neumann eigenvalues in perforated domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of splitting of eigenvalues of the Neumann Laplacian under singular domain perturbations. We consider a domain perturbed by the excision of a small spherical hole shrinking to an interior point. Our main result establishes that the splitting of multiple eigenvalues is a generic property: if the center of the hole is located outside a set of Hausdorff dimension $N-1$ and the radius is sufficiently small, multiple eigenvalues split into branches of lower multiplicity. The proof relies on the validity of an asymptotic expansion for the perturbed eigenvalues in terms of the scaling parameter. Such an asymptotic formula is of independent interest and generalizes previous results; notably, in dimension $N\geq 3$, it is valid for holes of arbitrary shape.</description>

      <title>PDE aspects of the dynamical optimal transport in the Lorentzian setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the crucial features of optimal transport on Riemannian manifolds is the equivalence of the `static', original, formulation of the problem and of the `dynamic' one, based on the study of the continuity equation. This furnishes the key link between Wasserstein geometry and PDEs that has found so many applications in the last 20 years.
  In this paper we investigate this kind of equivalence on spacetimes. At the PDE level, this requires to transition from the continuity equation to a suitable `continuity inequality', to which we shall refer to as `causal continuity inequality'. As a direct consequence of our findings we obtain a Lorentzian version of the celebrated Benamou--Brenier formula.</description>

      <title>Onsager's Mean Field Theory of Vortex Flows with Singular Sources: Blow-Up and Concentration without Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the Onsager statistical mechanics description of turbulent Euler flows with point singularities, we make a first step in the generalization of the mean field theory in [Caglioti, Lions, Marchioro, Pulvirenti; Comm. Math. Phys. (1995)]. On one side we prove the equivalence of statistical ensembles, on the other side we are bound to the analysis of a new blow up phenomenon, which we call "blow up and concentration without quantization", where the mass associated with the concentration is allowed to take values in a full interval of real numbers. This singular behavior may be regarded as lying between the classical blow up-concentration-quantization and the blow up without concentration phenomenon first proposed in [Lin, Tarantello; C.R. Math. Acad. Sci. Paris (2016)]. A careful analysis is needed to generalize known pointwise estimates in this non standard context, resulting in a complete description of the allowed asymptotic profiles.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Stability of Rarefaction Waves for the Hyperbolized Navier-Stokes-Fourier System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the asymptotic stability of rarefaction waves for a one-dimensional compressible fluid system, where the Newton's law of viscosity and Fourier's law of heat conduction are replaced by Maxwell's law and Cattaneo's law, respectively. The system, which generalizes the classical Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations, features finite signal propagation speeds. We consider the Cauchy problem in Lagrangian coordinates with initial data connecting two different constant states via a rarefaction wave of the corresponding Euler system. Our main result proves that, provided the initial perturbation and wave strength are sufficiently small, the relaxation system admits a unique global solution. Furthermore, this solution converges uniformly to the background rarefaction wave as time approaches infinity. The proof is established through a combination of the relative entropy method and usual energy estimates.</description>

      <title>Analytic spectral perturbation theory for a high-contrast Maxwell operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study analytic spectral perturbation theory for the time-harmonic Maxwell operator in a perfectly electrically conducting cavity containing a high-contrast core--shell structure. The dielectric permittivity equals $1$ in a bounded inclusion and a small complex parameter $\delta$ in the surrounding shell. The limit $\delta \to 0$ corresponds to an infinite-contrast regime and leads to a degenerate Maxwell system. Despite this degeneracy, we develop a detailed spectral theory for the limiting problem for general Lipschitz inclusions and shells.
  Using a novel operator-theoretic reformulation, we prove complex-analytic dependence of the spectrum on $\delta$ in a neighborhood of $\delta = 0$. When the inclusion is a ball, we analyze the asymptotic expansion of eigenvalues and identify conditions under which the leading-order term is independent of the geometry of the surrounding shell. We also construct examples of resonances for which the leading-order asymptotics depend sensitively on the shell geometry, even in this symmetric setting. These results clarify the mechanisms underlying geometry-invariance of resonances in high-contrast Maxwell systems and explain their robustness under small complex perturbations.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of an incompressible fluid-elastic structure system using a vacuum bubble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a priori estimates for the system of partial differential equations modeling the interaction between an elastic body and an incompressible fluid in a 3D curved domain. The fluid is governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and contains a bubble whose interior is a vacuum. The elastic body is described by a damped wave equation, and interaction with the fluid takes place along a free interface whose initial domain is curved. We show that the presence of the vacuum bubble stabilizes the system in the sense that it provides control of the average of the pressure function, and hence allows global existence and exponential decay of smooth solutions for small data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish, for the first time, explicit a priori and regularity estimates for solutions of the Dirichlet problem for Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman operators from stochastic control, whose principal half-eigenvalues have opposite signs. In addition, if the negative eigenvalue is not too negative, the problem can have exactly two, one or zero solutions, depending on the valuation function. This is a novel exact multiplicity result for fully nonlinear equations, which also yields a generalization of the Ambrosetti-Prodi theorem to such equations.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we investigate the (2+1)-dimensional damping forcing coupled Burgers equation, which is obtain by adding damping and forcing terms from couple Burgers equation. The Lax pair of the (2+1)-dimensional damping forcing coupled Burgers equation is established. With the help of Lax pair, we derive the $N$-fold Darboux transformation of (2+1)-dimensional damping forcing coupled Burgers equation. Using one fold and two fold Darboux transformation, we demonstrated some wave solutions including solitary wave solution and periodic wave solution. The impact of damping and forcing terms in solitary wave solution and periodic solution is graphically demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Sharp Quantitative Forms of the Hardy Inequality on Cartan-Hadamard Manifolds via Sobolev-Lorentz Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the quantitative form of the classical Hardy inequality. In our first result, we prove the following quantitative bound under the assumption that the $\mathbb{M}^N$ is a Riemannian model satisfying the centered isoperimetric inequality: We prove that $$ \|\nabla_g u\|^2_{L^{2}(\mathbb{M}^N)} - \frac{(N-2)^2}{4}\left\|\frac{u}{r(x)}\right\|^2_{L^2(\mathbb{M}^N)} \geq C [\mbox{dist}(u, Z)]^{\frac{4N}{N-2}}\left\|\frac{u}{r(x)}\right\|^2_{L^2(\mathbb{M}^N)},$$ for every real-valued weakly differentiable function $u$ on $\mathbb{M}^N$ such that $|\nabla_g u| \in L^2(\mathbb{M}^N)$ and $u$ decays to zero at infinity. Here $r(x) = d_g(x,x_0)$ denotes the geodesic distance from a fixed pole $x_0,$ the set $Z$ represents the family of virtual extremals, and the distance is understood in an appropriate generalized Lorentz-type space. Our approach is built on the symmetrization technique on manifolds, combined with a novel Jacobian-type transformation that provides a precise way for comparing volume growth, level sets, and gradient terms across the two geometries of Euclidean and manifold settings. When coupled with symmetrization, this framework yields sharp control over the relevant functionals and reveals how the underlying curvature influences extremal behavior. Our result generalizes the seminal result of Cianchi-Ferone [Ann. Inst. H. Poincar\'e C Anal. Non Lin\'eaire 25 (2008)] to the curved spaces. Moreover, building upon this transformation, we succeed in extending Sobolev-Lorentz embedding-classically formulated in the Euclidean setting to the broader framework of Cartan-Hadamard models and we establish an optimal Sobolev-Lorentz embedding in this geometric setting. Finally, we establish a quantitative correspondence between the Hardy deficit on the manifold and an appropriate weighted Hardy deficit in Euclidean space, showing that each controls the other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a variational problem motivated by models of species population density in a nonhomogeneous environment. We first analyze local minimizers and the structure of the saturated region (where the population attains its maximal density) from a free boundary perspective. By comparing the original problem with a radially symmetric minimization problem and studying its properties, we then establish the existence and structure of a global solution. Analytic examples of radially symmetric solutions and numerical simulations illustrate the theoretical results and provide insight into spatial saturation patterns in population models. We further highlight an unresolved question regarding the quasiconcavity of minimizers.</description>

      <title>Analytic description of the moving moisture front in soils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fact that moisture propagates in soils at a finite speed is confirmed by natural everyday experience as well as by controlled laboratory tests. In this text, we rigorously derive analytical upper bounds for the speed of moisture front propagation under gravity for the solution to the Richards equation with compactly supported initial data. The main result is an explicit criterion describing a competition between gravity and capillarity, where the dominant effect is determined by the characteristics of the soil. If capillarity prevails, the initially wet regions remain wet for all times, while if gravity is dominant, moisture travels downward at a speed that is asymptotically bounded from below and above. As a by-product, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a solution to an initial value problem for the degenerate Richards equation on the whole space. Numerical simulations based on the proposed model confirm the theoretical predictions, with results that closely match experimental observations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the free boundary problem for a finite-depth layer of viscous incompressible fluid in arbitrary dimension, modeled by the Stokes or Navier-Stokes equations. In addition to the gravitational field acting in the bulk, the free boundary is acted upon by surface tension and an external stress tensor posited to be in traveling wave form. We prove that for any isotropic stress tensor with periodic profile, there exists a locally unique periodic traveling wave solution, which can have large amplitude. Moreover, we prove that the constructed traveling wave solutions are asymptotically stable for the dynamic free boundary Stokes equations. Our proofs rest on the analysis of the nonlocal normal-stress to normal-Dirichlet operators for the Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations in domains of Sobolev regularity.</description>

      <title>The global well-posedness for master equations of mean field games of controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we establish the global well-posedness for master equations of mean field games of controls, where the interaction is through the joint law of the state and control. Our results are proved under two different conditions: the Lasry-Lions monotonicity and the displacement $\lambda$-monotonicity, both considered in their integral forms. We provide a detailed analysis of both the differential and integral versions of these monotonicity conditions for the corresponding nonseparable Hamiltonian and examine their relation. The proof of global well-posedness relies on the propagation of these monotonicity conditions in their integral forms and a priori uniform Lipschitz continuity of the solution with respect to the measure variable.</description>

      <title>Boundary Delocalization and Spectral Packets for Dirichlet Eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a boundary delocalization principle for high-frequency Dirichlet eigenfunctions on smooth strictly convex domains. The main result excludes persistent boundary concentration at the level of individual eigenmodes when compared to short spectral packets of sublinear length. Quantitatively, we compare boundary energies of single eigenfunctions to packet sums over frequency windows of size N_k = o(k), without asserting any asymptotic gain in magnitude. The main mode-to-packet estimate relies only on the Rellich identity. For the multi-mode bias exclusion we additionally use the boundary local Weyl law to obtain a packet zero-mean cancellation estimate. This mode-to-packet comparison is independent of eigenvalue monotonicity and is stable under eigenvalue crossings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superposition operators have been widely studied in nonlinear analysis, which are essential for the well-posedness theory of nonlinear equations. In this paper, we investigate the boundedness estimates of superposition operators with non-smooth symbols on quantum Besov spaces, which significantly generalize McDonald's results \cite{McNLE} for infinitely differentiable symbols and have rich applications in the well-posedness theory of noncommutative PDEs. As a byproduct, we prove the equivalence of the two descriptions of quantum Besov spaces, resolving the conjecture proposed in \cite[Remark 3.16]{McNLE}. The new ingredients in the proof also involve quantum chain rule and nonlinear interpolation.</description>

      <title>The linearization approach to the Calder\'on problem revisited: reconstruction via the Born approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linearization techniques are widely used in the analysis and numerical solution of the Calder\'on inverse problem, even if their theoretical basis is not fully understood. In this article, we study the effectiveness of linearization for reconstructing a conductivity from its Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map, combining rigorous analysis with numerical experiments. In particular, we prove that any DtN map arising from a radial conductivity in the unit ball of $\mathbb{R}^d$ admits an exact representation as a linearized DtN map for a uniquely determined integrable function, the Born approximation. We linearize on a family of background conductivities that includes the constant case, giving a rigorous foundation for linearization-based methods in this framework. We also characterize the Born approximation as a solution of a generalized moment problem. Since this moment problem is formally well-defined even for non-radial conductivities, we use it to develop a numerical algorithm to reconstruct the Born approximation of a general conductivity on the unit disk. We provide numerical experiments to test the resolution and robustness of the Born approximation in different situations. Finally, we show how it can be used as the starting point of an algorithm for reconstructing a conductivity from its DtN map.</description>

      <title>Pollutant-induced changes in fish pigmentation and spatial patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pigmentation abnormalities, ranging from hypo- to hyperpigmentation, can serve as biomarkers of developmental disruption in fish exposed to environmental contaminants. However, the mechanistic pathways underlying these alterations remain poorly understood. Studies have shown that pattern formation in fish development requires specific pigment cell interactions. Motivated by experimental observations of pigmentation alterations following contaminant exposure, we investigate how pollutants influence pigment cell self-organization using a continuum reaction-diffusion-advection framework. The model incorporates nonlocal Morse-type kernels to describe short- and long-range interactions among melanophores and xanthophores. Our results show that perturbations to the strengths of adhesion or repulsion can drive transitions between stripes, spots, and mixed patterns, reproducing phenotypes characteristic of fish pigmentation mutants. In particular, homotypic interactions are sensitive to contamination, leading to pronounced changes in melanophore density and resulting pigmentation patterns. Time-dependent simulations indicate that pigment changes from early short-term contaminant exposure may be recoverable, whereas prolonged exposure can lead to sustained pigment loss. In a growing fish, contaminant-induced changes in cell-cell interactions directly influence stripe formation rate, stripe number, and pigmentation levels. Overall, our study provides insight into the mechanistic link between experimentally observed pigmentation alterations and the changes in spatial patterns of adult fish.</description>

Abstract: We derive sharp bounds for the boundary control cost of the one-dimensional fractional Schr\"odinger and heat equations. The analysis of the lower bound is based on the study of the control cost of a related singular boundary control problem in finite time, using tools from complex analysis. The analysis of the upper bound relies on the moment method, involving estimates of the Fourier transform of a class of compactly supported functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a novel approach for the existence of solutions to an incompressible fluid-rigid body interaction problem in three dimensions. Our approach introduces an iteration based on a sequence of related problems posed on domains with prescribed evolution. In particular we prove the short-time existence of strong solutions to a system coupling the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations to the ordinary differential equations governing the motion of a rigid body, with no slip boundary conditions on the boundary of the rigid body, provided that the relative density $\frac{\rho}{\rho_B}$, is sufficiently small. We also discuss the use of our iterative approach in numerical methods for the moving boundary problem, and complement this with some numerical experiments in two dimensions which demonstrate the necessity of the smallness assumption on $\frac{\rho}{\rho_B}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider non-linear regression models corrupted by generic noise when the regression functions form a non-linear subspace of L^2, relevant in non-linear PDE inverse problems and data assimilation. We show that when the score of the model is injective, the Fisher information operator is automatically invertible between well-identified Hilbert spaces, and we provide an operational characterization of these spaces. This allows us to construct in broad generality the efficient Gaussian involved in the classical minimax and convolution theorems to establish information lower bounds, that are typically achieved by Bayesian algorithms thus showing optimality of these methods. We illustrate our results on time-evolution PDE models for reaction-diffusion and Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the Inverse Boundary Value Problem (IBVP) for classical fields, specifically focusing on the recovery of parallelly transformed fields within a region based on known boundary data. We introduce a local solution framework, termed "covariant tomography," that uses geometric decomposition to reconstruct interior fields and currents within star-shaped open subsets. The core of our approach involves decomposing differential forms into exact and antiexact components, enabling the formulation of the parallel transport equation via a homotopy operator. We examine three primary extension techniques - radial, heat equation, and harmonic - to map boundary values into the interior, noting that the choice of extension directly influences the regularity of the resulting currents. The proposed methodology provides a systematic way to identify the realizability of boundary values and offers solutions for both current and gauge field tomography. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of this framework through illustrative examples in low-dimensional spaces and electromagnetic potential reconstruction in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$.</description>

      <title>Long-time behavior of solutions to fluid dynamic shape optimization problems via phase-field method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the long time behavior of solutions to a shape and topology optimization problem with respect to the time-dependent Navier--Stokes equations. The sought topology is represented by a stationary phase-field that represents a smooth indicator function. The fluid equations are approximated by a porous media approach and are time-dependent. In the latter aspect, the considered problem formulation extends earlier work.
  We prove that if the time horizon tends to infinity, minima of the time-dependent problem converge towards minima of the corresponding stationary problem. To do so, a convergence rate with respect to the time horizon, of the values of the objective functional, is analytically derived. This allowed us to prove that the solution to the time-dependent problem converges to a phase-field, as the time horizon goes to infinity, which is proven to be a minimizer for the stationary problem. We validate our results by numerical investigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the transport properties of Schr\"odinger operators on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with potentials that are periodic in some directions and compactly supported in the others. Such systems are known to produce surface states that are weakly confined near the support of the potential. We show that a natural set of surface states exhibits directional ballistic transport, characterized by ballistic transport in the periodic directions and its absence in the others. To prove this, we develop a Floquet theory that captures the analytic variation of surface states. The main idea consists of reformulating the eigenvalue problem for surface states as a Fredholm problem via the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map.</description>

Abstract: We prove an abstract theorem of maximal hypoellipticy showing that in an abstract calculus under some natural assumptions, an operator is maximally hypoelliptic if and only if its principal symbol is left invertible. We then show that our theorem implies various known results in the literature like regularity theorem for elliptic operators, Helffer and Nourrigat's resolution of the Rockland conjecture, Rodino's theorem on regularity of operators on products of manifolds, and our resolution of the Helffer-Nourrigat conjecture. Other examples like our resolution of the microlocal Helffer-Nourrigat conjecture will be given in a sequel to this paper.
  Our arguments are based on the theory of $C^*$-algebras of Type I.</description>

      <title>The Harnack inequality without convexity for curve shortening flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1995, Hamilton introduced a Harnack inequality for convex solutions of the mean curvature flow. In this paper we prove an alternative Harnack inequality for curve shortening flow, i.e. one-dimensional mean curvature flow, that does not require any assumption of convexity. For an initial proper curve in the plane whose ends are radial lines but which is otherwise arbitrarily wild, we use the Harnack inequality to give an explicit time by which the curve shortening flow evolution must become graphical. This gives a new instance of delayed parabolic regularity. The Harnack inequality also gives estimates describing how a polar graphical flow with radial ends settles down to an expanding solution. Finally, we relate our Harnack inequality to Hamilton's by identifying a pointwise curvature estimate implied by both Harnack inequalities in the special case of convex flows.</description>

Abstract: We study an inverse problem related to the dynamical Schr{\"o}dinger equation in a bounded domain of $\Rb^n,n\geq 2$. Since the concerned non-linear Schr\"odinger equation possesses a trivial solution, we linearize the equation around the trivial solution. Demonstrating the well-posedness of the direct problem under appropriate conditions on initial and boundary data, it is observed that the solution admits $\eps$-expansion. By taking into account the fact that the terms $\Oh(|\nabla u(t,x)|^3)$ are negligible in this context, we shall reconstruct the time-dependent coefficients such as electric potential and vector-valued function associated with quadratic nonlinearity from the knowledge of input-output map using the geometric optics solution and Fourier inversion.</description>

      <title>Improvements in $L^2$ Restriction bounds for Neumann Data along closed curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.01208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We seek to improve the restriction bounds of Neumann data of Laplace eigenfunctions $u_h$ by studying the $L^2$ restriction bounds of Neumann data and their $L^2$ concentration as measured by defect measures. Let $\gamma$ be a closed smooth curve with unit exterior normal $\nu$. We can show that $\| h \partial_\nu u_{h} \|_{L^2(\Gamma)}=o(1)$ if $\{u_h\}$ is tangentially concentrated with respect to $\gamma$. As a key ingredient of the proof, we give a detailed analysis of the $L^2$ norms over $\gamma$ of the Neumann data $h\partial_\nu u_h$ when mircolocalized away the cotangential direction.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness and large-time behavior of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with hyperbolic heat conduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Fourier's law, which states that the heat flux is proportional to the temperature gradient, induces the paradox of infinite propagation speed for heat conduction. To accurately simulate the real physical process, the hyperbolic model of heat conduction named Cattaneo's law was proposed, which leads to the finite speed of heat propagation. A natural question is that whether the large-time behavior of the heat flux for compressible flow would be different for these two laws. In this paper, we aim to address this question by studying the global well-posedness and optimal time-decay rates of classical solutions to the compressible Navier-Stokes system with Cattaneo's law. By designing a new method, we obtain the optimal time-decay rates for the highest derivatives of the heat flux, which cannot be derived for the system with Fourier's law by Matsumura and Nishida [Proc. Japan Acad. Ser. A Math. Sci., 55(9):337-342, 1979]. In this sense, our results first reveal the essential differences between the two laws.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15651v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we treat the Fisher-KPP equation with a Caputo-type time fractional derivative and discuss the propagation speed of the solution. The equation is a mathematical model that describes the processes of sub-diffusion, proliferation, and saturation. We first consider a traveling wave solution to study the propagation of the solution, but we cannot define it in the usual sense due to the time fractional derivative in the equation. We therefore assume that the solution asymptotically approaches a traveling wave solution, and the asymptotic traveling wave solution is formally introduced as a potential asymptotic form of the solution. The existence and the properties of the asymptotic traveling wave solution are discussed using a monotone iteration method. Finally, the behavior of the solution is analyzed by numerical simulations based on the result for asymptotic traveling wave solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop computer-assisted tools to study semilinear equations of the form \begin{equation*} -\Delta u -\frac{x}{2}\cdot \nabla{u}= f(x,u,\nabla u) ,\quad x\in\mathbb{R}^d. \end{equation*} Such equations appear naturally in several contexts, and in particular when looking for self-similar solutions of parabolic PDEs. We develop a general methodology, allowing us not only to prove the existence of solutions, but also to describe them very precisely. We introduce a spectral approach based on an eigenbasis of $\mathcal{L}:= -\Delta -\frac{x}{2}\cdot \nabla$ in spherical coordinates, together with a quadrature rule allowing to deal with nonlinearities, in order to get accurate approximate solutions. We then use a Newton-Kantorovich argument, in an appropriate weighted Sobolev space, to prove the existence of a nearby exact solution. We apply our approach to nonlinear heat equations, to nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations and to a generalised viscous Burgers equation, and obtain both radial and non-radial self-similar profiles.</description>

      <title>Uniform Resolvent Estimates for Subwavelength Resonators: The Minnaert Bubble Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02192v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subwavelength resonators are small scaled objects that exhibit contrasting medium properties (eigher in intensity or sign) while compared to the ones of a uniform background. Such contrasts allow them to resonate at specific frequencies. There are two ways to mathematically define these resonances. First, as the frequencies for which the related system of integral equations is not injective. Second, as the frequencies for which the related resolvent operator of the natural Hamiltonian, given by the wave-operator, has a pole.
  In this work, we consider, as the subwavelength resonator, the Minneart bubble. We show that these two mentioned definitions are equivalent. Most importantly,
  1. we derive the related resolvent estimates which are uniform in terms of the size/contrast of the resonators. As a by product, we show that the resolvent operators have no scattering resonances in the upper half complex plane while they exhibit two scattering resonances in the lower half plane which converge to the real axis, as the size of the bubble tends to zero. As these resonances are poles of the natural Hamiltonian, given by the wave-operator, and have the Minnaert frequency as their dominating real part, this justifies calling them Minnaert resonances.
  2. we derive the asymptotic estimates of the generated scattered fields which are uniform in terms of the incident frequency and which are valid everywhere in space (i.e. inside or outside the bubble).
  The dominating parts, for both the resolvent operator and the scattered fields, are given by the ones of the point-scatterer supported at the location of the bubble. In particular, these dominant parts are non trivial (not the same as those of the background medium) if and only if the used incident frequency identifies with the Minnaert one.</description>

      <title>A uniform-in-time nonlocal approximation of the standard Fokker-Planck equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03870v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a nonlocal approximation of the Fokker-Planck equation in which we can estimate the speed of convergence to equilibrium in a way which does not degenerate as we approach the local limit of the equation. This uniform estimate cannot be easily obtained with standard inequalities or entropy methods, but can be obtained through the use of Harris's theorem, finding interesting links to quantitative versions of the central limit theorem in probability. As a consequence one can prove that solutions of this nonlocal approximation converge to solutions of the usual Fokker-Planck equation uniformly in time-hence we show the approximation is asymptotic-preserving in this sense. The associated equilibrium has some interesting tail and regularity properties, which we also study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the local Lipschitz regularity for solutions to an orthotropic q-Laplacian-type equation within the Heisenberg group. Our approach is largely inspired by the works of X. Zhong, who investigated the q-Laplacian in the same setting and proved the H\"older regularity for the gradient of solutions. Due to the degeneracy of the current equation, such regularity for the gradient of solutions is not even known in the Euclidean setting for dimensions greater than 2, where only boundedness is expected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We deal with the time-domain acoustic wave propagation in the presence of a subwavelength resonator given by a Minneart bubble. This bubble is small scaled and enjoys high contrasting mass density and bulk modulus. It is well known that, under certain regimes between these scales, such a bubble generates a single low-frequency (or subwavelength) resonance called Minnaert resonance. In this paper, we study the wave propagation governed by Minnaert resonance effects in time domain. We derive the point-approximation expansion of the wave field. The dominant part is a sum of two terms.
  1. The first one, which we call the primary wave, is the wave field generated in the absence of the bubble.
  2. The second one, which we call the resonant wave, is generated by the interaction between the bubble and the background. It is related to a Dirac-source, in space, that is modulated, in time, with a coefficient which is a solution of a $1$D Cauchy problem, for a second order differential equation, having as propagation and attenuation parameters the real and the imaginary parts, respectively, of the Minnaert resonance.
  We show that the evolution of the resonant wave remains valid for a large time of the order $\epsilon^{-1}$, where $\epsilon$ is the radius of the bubble, after which it collapses by exponentially decaying. Precisely, we confirm that such resonant wave have life-time inversely proportional to the imaginary part of the related subwavelength resonances, which is in our case given by the Minnaert one. In addition, the real part of this resonance fixes the period of the wave.</description>

      <title>On some Sobolev and P\'olya-Szeg\"o type inequalities with weights and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15490v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are motivated by studying a boundary-value problem for a class of semilinear degenerate elliptic equations
  \begin{align}\tag{P}\label{P}
  \begin{cases}
  - \Delta_x u - |x|^{2\alpha} \dfrac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = f(x,y,u), &amp; \textrm{in } \Omega,
  u = 0, &amp; \textrm{on } \partial \Omega,
  \end{cases}
  \end{align}
  where $x = (x_1, x_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2$, $\Omega$ is a bounded smooth domain in $\mathbb{R}^3$, $(0,0,0) \in \Omega $, and $\alpha &gt; 0$.
  In this paper, we will study this problem by establishing embedding theorems for weighted Sobolev spaces. To this end, we need a new P\'olya-Szeg\"o type inequality, which can be obtained by studying an isoperimetric problem for the corresponding weighted area. Our results then extend the existing ones in \cite{nga, Luyen2} to the three-dimensional context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the existence, non-existence, uniqueness, and multiplicity of positive solutions to the following problem: \begin{align}\label{P}
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{l}
  D_{0+}^\alpha u + h(t)f(u) = 0, \quad 0&lt;t&lt;1, \\[1ex]
  u(0)=u(1)=0,
  \end{array}
  \right. \end{align} where $D_{0+}^\alpha$ is the Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative of order $\alpha\in(1,2]$. Firstly, by considering the first eigenvalue $\lambda_1(\alpha)$ of the corresponding eigenvalue problem, we establish the existence of positive solutions for both sublinear and superlinear cases involving $\lambda_1(\alpha)$, thereby extending existing results in the literature. In addition, we address the issue of non-existence, which reinforces the sharpness of both hypotheses. Secondly, we demonstrate the uniqueness of positive solutions. For the sublinear case, we impose certain monotonicity conditions on $f$. For the superlinear case, we assume that $h$ satisfies a specific condition to ensure the uniqueness of positive solutions when $\alpha =2.$ Near $\alpha =2,$ we prove uniqueness by leveraging the non-degeneracy of the unique solution, which represents a novel approach to studying fractional-order differential equations. Finally, we apply this methodology to establish the multiple existence of at least three positive solutions for H\'{e}non-type problems, which is also a new contribution.</description>

Abstract: The Born approximation of a potential in the context of the Calder\'on inverse problem is an object that can be formally defined in terms of spectral data of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map of the corresponding Schr\"odinger operator. In this article, we prove, in the case of radial potentials in the Euclidean ball and any fixed energy, that the Born approximation is well-defined as a compactly supported radial distribution, and that the Calder\'on problem can be reformulated as recovering a potential from its Born approximation. In addition, we show that the Born approximation depends locally on the potential and captures exactly its singularities, and that the functional that maps the Born approximation to the potential is H\"older continuous. We also prove that the Born approximation converges to the potential in the high-energy limit. Moreover, we give an explicit formula for the Fourier transform of the Born approximation at any fixed energy, and illustrate how it can be used as the basis of an accurate procedure to approximate a potential from its Dirichlet-to-Neumann map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07379v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coupling between evolutionary and ecological changes (eco-evolutionary dynamics) has been shown to be relevant among diverse species, and is also of interest outside of ecology, i.e. in cancer evolution. These dynamics play an important role in determining survival in response to climate change, motivating the need for mathematical models to capture this often complex interplay. Models incorporating eco-evolutionary dynamics often sacrifice analytical tractability to capture the complexity of real systems, do not explicitly consider the effect of population heterogeneity, or focus on long-term behaviour. In order to capture population heterogeneity, both transient, and long-term dynamics, while retaining tractability, we generalise a moment-based method applicable in the regime of small segregational variance to the case of time-dependent mortality and birth. These results are applied to a predator-prey model, where ecological parameters such as the contact rate between species are trait-structured. The trait-distribution of the prey species is shown to be approximately Gaussian with constant variance centered on the mean trait, which is asymptotically governed by an autonomous ODE. In this way, we make explicit the impact of eco-evolutionary dynamics on the transient behaviour and long-term fate of the prey species.</description>

Abstract: We establish a triple logarithmic stability estimate of determining the potential in a Helmholtz equation from a partial Dirichlet-to-Neumann map in the high frequency limit. This estimate is proved under the assumption that the potential is known near the boundary of a domain when the dimension is greater than or equal to $3$. In addition, we show a triple logarithmic stability for an interior impedance problem.</description>

      <title>Rigorous analysis of shape transitions in frustrated elastic ribbons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ribbons are elastic bodies of thickness $t$ and width $w$ with $t\ll w\ll 1$ (after appropriate nondimensionalization). Many ribbons in nature have a non-trivial internal geometry, making them incompatible with Euclidean space. This incompatibility -- expressed mathematically as a failure of the Gauss-Codazzi equations for surfaces -- can trigger shape transitions between narrow and wide ribbons. These transitions depend on the internal geometry: ribbons whose incompatibility arises from failure of the Gauss equation always exhibit a transition, whereas those whose incompatibility arises from failure of the Codazzi equations, may or may not. We give the first rigorous analysis of this phenomenon, mainly for ribbons whose first fundamental form is flat. For Gauss-incompatible ribbons we identify the natural energy scaling of the problem and prove the existence of a shape transition. For Codazzi-incompatible ribbons we give a necessary condition for a transition to occur. Furthermore, our study reveals a fundamental distinction: the transition is "microscopic" for Gauss-incompatible ribbons, persisting as the width tends to $0$, whereas it is "mesoscopic" for Codazzi-incompatible ribbons, observable only at small but finite width. The results are obtained by calculating the $\Gamma$-limits, as $t,w\to 0$, for narrow ribbons ($w^2 \ll t$), and wide ribbons (taking $t$ to zero and then $w$), in the natural energy scalings dictated by the internal geometry.</description>

      <title>Periodic operators over a component domain and homogenization of some class of quasi-linear elliptic problems in two-component domain with interfacial resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14944v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the periodic homogenization of quasilinear elliptic PDEs in a two-component domain with an interfacial thermal barrier. It introduces a periodic extension operator that ensures strong convergence of function sequences in the Sobolev space. Moreover, two families of quasilinear elliptic problems in two-component domains with interfacial resistance will be considered here. One family with \(L^2\) data and another family with \(L^1\) data.</description>

      <title>Local Well-Posedness of the Cahn-Hilliard-Biot System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show short-time well-posedness of a diffuse interface model describing the flow of a fluid through a deformable porous medium consisting of two phases. The system non-linearly couples Biot's equations for poroelasticity, including phase-field dependent material properties, with the Cahn-Hilliard equation to model the evolution of the solid, where we further distinguish between the absence and presence of a visco-elastic term of Kelvin-Voigt type. While both problems will be reduced to a fixed-point equation that can be solved using maximal regularity theory along with a contraction argument, the first case relies on a semigroup approach over suitable Hilbert spaces, whereas treating the second case under minimal assumptions with respect to spatial regularity necessitates the application of Banach scales.</description>

      <title>Recovery of Sturm-Liouville operators from partial boundary spectral data and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the inverse Sturm-Liouville problem on a finite interval from partial knowledge of spectral data. Specifically, we show that the potential can be uniquely reconstructed from the knowledge of a fraction of Dirichlet eigenvalues together with the normal derivatives of the corresponding eigenfunctions at both endpoints. We present two novel applications of our spectral result in inverse coefficient determination problems for evolutionary PDEs that include passive wave-based imaging of a medium and active imaging for the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation with unknown internal sources. Our results yield finite time measurement bounds for such inverse coefficient determination problems. A central innovation is the use of Kahane's interpolation theorem to analyze endpoint time traces of solutions, enabling the recovery without requiring analyticity assumptions or infinite-time data, as in previous approaches. Finally, in the appendix, we present a spectral interpolation theorem for one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^n$ be a Lipschitz domain. We prove that, $\Omega$ satisfies the following Serrin-type overdetermined system
  $$u \in W^{1,2}(\mathbb R^n), \quad u=0\ \text{ a.e. in }\mathbb R^n\setminus \Omega,\quad \Delta u=\mathbf{c}\mathscr{H}^{n-1}|_{\partial^*\Omega} - \mathbf{1}_{\Omega}\,dx,$$
  in the weak sense if and only if $\Omega$ is a ball. Here $\mathscr H^{n-1}$ denotes the $(n-1)$-dimensional Hausdorff measure. Moreover, a generalization of our method in the anisotropic setting is discussed. Our approach offers an alternative proof to [15] in the case of Lipschitz domains, introducing a novel viewpoint to settle [18, Question 7.1].</description>

      <title>Fujita Phenomenon for Mixed Local--Nonlocal Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Cauchy problem for a semilinear parabolic equation driven by a mixed local-nonlocal diffusion operator of the form \[ \partial_t u - (\Delta - (-\Delta)^{\mathsf{s}})u = \mathsf{h}(t)|x|^{-b}|u|^p + t^\varrho \mathbf{w}(x), \qquad (x,t)\in \mathbb{R}^N\times (0,\infty), \] where $\mathsf{s}\in (0,1)$, $p&gt;1$, $b\geq 0$, and $\varrho&gt;-1$. The function $\mathsf{h}(t)$ is assumed to belong to the generalized class of regularly varying functions, while $\mathbf{w}$ is a prescribed spatial source. We first revisit the unforced case and establish sharp blow-up and global existence criteria in terms of the critical Fujita exponent, thereby extending earlier results to the wider class of time-dependent coefficients. For the forced problem, we derive nonexistence of global weak solutions under suitable growth conditions on $\mathsf{h}$ and integrability assumptions on $\mathbf{w}$. Furthermore, we provide sufficient smallness conditions on the initial data and the forcing term ensuring global-in-time mild solutions. Our analysis combines semigroup estimates for the mixed operator, test function methods, and asymptotic properties of regularly varying functions. To our knowledge, this is the first study addressing blow-up phenomena for nonlinear diffusion equations with such a class of time-dependent coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a nonlocal extension of the Aw-Rascle-Zhang traffic model, where the pressure-like term is modeled as a convolution between vehicle density and a kernel function. This formulation captures nonlocal driver interactions and aligns structurally with the Euler-alignment system studied in [23]. Using a sticky particle approximation, we construct entropy solutions to the equation for the cumulative density and prove convergence of approximate solutions to weak solutions of the nonlocal system. The analysis includes well-posedness, stability estimates, and an entropic selection principle.</description>

      <title>Qualitative Behavior of Solutions to a Forced Nonlocal Thin-Film Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional nonlocal degenerate fourth-order parabolic equation with inhomogeneous forces relevant to hydraulic fracture modeling. Employing a regularization scheme, modified energy/entropy methods, and novel differential inequality techniques, we establish global existence and long-time behavior results for weak solutions under both time-and space-dependent and time-and space-independent inhomogeneous forces. Specifically, for the time-and space-dependent force $S(t, x)$, we prove that the solution converges to $\bar{u}_0+\frac{1}{|\Omega|}\int_0^\infty \int_\Omega S(r, x)\, dxdr $, where $\bar{u}_0=\frac{1}{|\Omega|}\int_{\Omega}u_{0}(x)\,dx$ is the spatial average of the initial data, and we provide bilateral estimates for the convergence rate. For the time-and space-independent force $S_0$, we show that the solution approaches the linear function $\bar{u}_0 + tS_0$ at an exponential rate.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear scalar field equations with a critical Hardy potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence of solutions for the nonlinear scalar field equation $$-\Delta u - \frac{(N-2)^2}{4|x|^2} u = g(u), \quad \mbox{in } \mathbb{R}^N \setminus \{0\},$$ where the potential $-\frac{(N-2)^2}{4|x|^2}$ is the critical Hardy potential and $N \geq 3$. The nonlinearity $g$ is continuous and satisfies general subcritical growth assumptions of the Berestycki-Lions type. The problem is approached using variational methods within a non-standard functional setting. The natural energy functional associated with the equation is defined on the space $X^1(\mathbb{R}^N)$, which is the completion of $H^1(\mathbb{R}^N)$ with respect to the norm induced by the quadratic part of the functional. We establish the existence of a nontrivial solution $u_0 \in X^1(\mathbb{R}^N)$ that satisfies the Poho\v{z}aev constraint $\mathcal{M}$ and minimizes the energy functional on $\mathcal{M}$. Furthermore, assuming $g$ is odd, we prove the existence of at least one non-radial solution.</description>

      <title>Elastic scattering by locally rough interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the first well-posedness result for elastic scattering by locally rough interfaces in both two and three dimensions. Inspired by the Helmholtz decomposition, we discover a fundamental identity for the stress vector, revealing an intrinsic relationship among the generalized stress vector, the Lame constants and certain tangential differential operators. This identity leads to two key limits for surface integrals involving scattered solutions, from which we deduce the first uniqueness result of direct problem for all frequencies. Through a detailed analysis, applying the steepest descent method, subsequently we derive the existence and uniqueness of the corresponding two-layered Green's tensor along with its explicit expression when the transmission coefficient equals 1. Finally, by leveraging properties of the Green's tensor, we establish the existence of solutions via the variational method and the boundary integral equation, thereby achieving the first well-posedness result for elastic scattering by rough interfaces.</description>

      <title>The time fractional stochastic partial differential equations with non-local operator on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive well-posedness and regularity theory for time-fractional stochastic partial differential equations on $\mathbb{R}^d$ driven by mixed Wiener--L\'evy noises. The equations feature a Caputo time derivative $\partial_t^\alpha$ ($0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$) and a spatial nonlocal operator $\phi(\Delta)$ generated by a subordinate Brownian motion, leading to a doubly nonlocal structure.
  For the case $p \ge 2$, we prove the existence, uniqueness, and sharp Sobolev regularity of weak solutions in the scale of $\phi$-Sobolev spaces $\mathcal{H}_p^{\phi,\gamma+2}(T)$. Our approach combines harmonic analysis techniques (Fefferman--Stein theorem, Littlewood--Paley theory) with stochastic analysis to handle the combined Wiener and L\'evy noise terms. In the special case of cylindrical Wiener noise, a dimensional constraint $d &lt; 2\kappa_0\bigl(2 - (2\sigma_2 - 2/p)_+/\alpha\bigr)$ is obtained.~For the low-regularity case $1 \le p \le 2$, where maximal function estimates fail, we construct unique local mild solutions in $L_p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for equations driven by pure-jump L\'evy space-time white noise, using stochastic truncation and fixed-point arguments.
  The results unify and extend previous theories by simultaneously incorporating time-space nonlocality and jump-type randomness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a sparse bound in the context of Schauder theory for divergence form elliptic partial differential equations. In addition, we show how an iteration argument inspired by sparse domination bounds can be used to deduce gradient reverse H\"older inequalities for equations with non-constant coefficients from the theory for constant coefficient equations. We deal with coefficient matrices whose entries are either H\"older continuous or just uniformly continuous, leading to different results. The purpose of the approach is to highlight the connection between Schauder theory and duality of local Hardy spaces and local H\"older spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a compact, connected Riemannian manifold of dimension $n\ge 2$, and let $\{e_j\}_{j=0}^\infty$ be an orthonormal basis of Laplace eigenfunctions $-\Delta_g e_j=\lambda_j^2 e_j$. Given a finite Borel measure $\mu$ on $M$, consider the Kuznecov sum \[
  N_\mu(\lambda):=\sum_{\lambda_j\le \lambda}\Bigl|\int_M e_j\,d\mu\Bigr|^2. \] Assume that $\mu$ admits an averaged $s$-density constant $A_\mu$ with correlation dimension $s\in(0,n)$. We prove that \[N_\mu(\lambda)= (2\pi)^{-(n-s)}\,{\rm vol}(B^{\,n-s})\,A_\mu\,\lambda^{n-s}+ o(\lambda^{n-s})\qquad (\lambda\to\infty). \] The averaged $s$-density condition is necessary for such a one-term asymptotic, and in general, the remainder $o(\lambda^{n-s})$ is sharp in the sense that it cannot be improved uniformly to a power-saving error term. This extends the classical Kuznecov formula of Zelditch for smooth submanifold measures to a broad class of singular and fractal measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04702v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the previous study (Ishida, 2025), the author proved the uniqueness of short-range potential functions using the Enss-Weder time-dependent method (Enss and Weder, 1995) for a two-body quantum system described by time-decaying harmonic oscillators. In this study, we extend the result of Ishida (2025) to the $N$-body case. We use the approaches developed in Enss and Weder (1995), Weder (1996), and Valencia and Weder (2012) to prove that the high-velocity limit of the scattering operator uniquely determines all the pairwise interaction potentials among the $N$ particles, focusing respectively on each fixed pair of particles.</description>

Abstract: A classical result by Poznyak asserts that any smooth $2$-dimensional Riemannian metric $g$, posed on the closure of a simply connected domain $\omega\subset\mathbb{R}^2$, has a smooth isometric immersion into $\mathbb{R}^4$. Using techniques of convex integration, we prove that for any $2$-dimensional $g\in\mathcal{C}^{r,\beta}$, an isometric immersion of regularity $\mathcal{C}^{1,\alpha}(\bar\omega,\mathbb{R}^4)$ for any $\alpha&lt;\min\{\frac{r+\beta}{2},1\}$, may be found arbitrarily close to any short immersion. The fact that this result's regularity reaches $\mathcal{C}^{1,1-}$ for $g\in \mathcal{C}^2$, which is referred to as "full flexibility", should be contrasted with: (i) the regularity $\mathcal{C}^{1,1/3-}$ achieved by Cao, Hirsch and Inauen for isometric immersions into $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ and the lack of flexibility (rigidity) of such isometric immersions with regularity $\mathcal{C}^{1, 2/3+}$ proved by Borisov and then by Conti, de Lellis and Szekelyhidi; (ii) the regularity $\mathcal{C}^{1,1-}$ obtained byt K\"allen for isometric immersions into higher codimensional space $\mathbb{R}^{8}$; and (iii) the regularity $\mathcal{C}^{1,\frac{1}{1+d(d+1)/k}-}$ proved by the author in the general case of $d$-dimensional metrics and $(d+k)$-dimensional immersions for the closely related Monge-Amp\`ere system.</description>

      <title>Convergence rates of self-repelling diffusions on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of self-repelling diffusions on compact Riemannian manifolds whose drift is the gradient of a potential accumulated along their trajectory. When the interaction potential admits a suitable spectral decomposition, the dynamics and its environment are equivalent to a finite-dimensional degenerate diffusion. We show that this diffusion is a second-order lift of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process whose invariant law corresponds to the Gaussian invariant measure of the environment, and immediately obtain a general upper bound on the rate of convergence to stationarity using the framework of second-order lifts. Furthermore, using a flow Poincar\'e inequality, we develop lower bounds on the convergence rate. We show that, in the periodic case, these lower bounds improve upon those of Bena\"im and Gauthier (Probab. Theory Relat. Fields, 2016), and even match the order of the upper bound in some cases.</description>

      <title>Stability for Strichartz inequalities: Existence of minimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantitative stability associated with the adjoint Fourier restriction inequality, focusing on the paraboloid and two-dimensional sphere cases. We show that these Strichartz-stability inequalities admit minimizers attaining their sharp constants, provided that these sharp constants are strictly smaller than the corresponding spectral-gap constants. Furthermore, for the two-dimensional sphere case, we obtain the existence of minimizers.</description>
