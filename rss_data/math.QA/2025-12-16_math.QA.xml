      <title>Discrete quantum groups and their duals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete quantum groups were introduced as duals of compact quantum groups by Podle\'s and Woronowicz in 1990. Shortly after, they were defined and studied intrinsically by Effros and Ruan, and by this author. In 1998, with the introduction of the multiplier Hopf algebras with integrals (also called algebraic quantum groups), the duality between discrete and compact quantum groups became part of the more general duality in the self-dual category of these algebraic quantum groups. Again a few years later the duality was extended to all locally compact quantum groups.
  In these notes, we give a new and a somewhat updated approach of the theory of discrete quantum groups. In particular, we view them as special cases of algebraic quantum groups. The duality between the compact quantum groups and the discrete quantum groups is seen in this larger context. This has a number of advantages as we will explain.
  On the one hand, we provide quite a bit of information about how all of this fits into the more general theory of algebraic quantum groups and its duality. Occasionally, we even go one step further and look at the most general case of locally compact quantum groups. Also sometimes, we compare with known results in pure Hopf algebra theory. On the other hand however, we have tried to make these notes highly self-contained. The aim of these notes in the first place is not to give new results but rather to review known results in a more modern perspective, taking into account recent developments. We believe this may be helpful for people who want to work with compact and discrete quantum groups now.</description>

      <title>Operadic Calculus for Higher Colour-Kinematics Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for algebraic foundations of colour-kinematics duality and the double-copy construction has brought into focus a generalization of Batalin--Vilkovisky algebras, referred to here as coexact BV-algebras and as $\textrm{BV}^\square$-algebras in other sources. While these structures capture the cubic sector, they fail to encode higher-valence phenomena, for which a homotopy-theoretic extension becomes necessary. This work introduces a conceptual notion of homotopy coexact BV-algebra, defined through the homotopical interplay of commutative and BV structures, and provides a concrete model in terms of generators and relations, obtained through an extension the theory of Koszul duality for operads. The resulting framework enables the systematic use of homotopical tools -- $\infty$-morphisms, homotopy transfer, rectification, and deformation theory -- and naturally accommodates the quartic-level structures recently identified in Yang--Mills theory.</description>

      <title>Signatures in TQFT : Asymptotics and Modularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the signature $\sigma_g(\frac q p)$ of $\mathrm{SU}_2$-TQFT vector spaces associated to surfaces of genus $g$, as a function of the defining root of unity $\zeta=e^{i\pi q/p}$. We prove that $\frac{1}{p^2}\sigma_2(\frac{q}{p})$ converges to $\Lambda(\theta)=\frac{16}{\pi^3}\sum\limits_{n\ge 1, \textrm{ odd}}\frac{1}{n^3\sin(n\pi\theta)}$ when $\frac{q}{p}$ goes to an irrational number $\theta\in [0,1]$ under certain conditions. We also observe that the function $\Lambda(\theta)$ is the boundary value of an Eichler integral of a level $2$ modular form of weight $4$, and use this to propose a conjectural transformation law for the signature function in genus 2 similar to the reciprocity formula for classical Dedekind sums.</description>

      <title>Triangular Prism Equations and Categorification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.06522v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the triangular prism equations (TPE) for fusion categories, obtained by evaluating triangular prisms in terms of tetrahedra. Using an oriented graphical calculus, we show that the geometric symmetries of the regular tetrahedron are preserved. In the spherical case, we prove that the TPE are equivalent to the pentagon equations after a suitable change of basis. These equations provide new insight for managing complexity via localization. As a consequence, and using the Fuchs-Runkel-Schweigert theorem on the second Frobenius-Schur indicator, we obtain new categorification criteria. As an application, we solve all remaining open cases to complete the classification of unitary 1-Frobenius simple integral fusion categories up to rank 8 and up to Frobenius-Perron dimension 20000.</description>

      <title>A Drinfeld Presentation of the Queer Super-Yangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a Drinfeld presentation for the super-Yangian $\mathrm{Y}(\mathfrak{q}_n)$ associated with the queer Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{q}_n$. The Drinfeld generators of $\mathrm{Y}(\mathfrak{q}_n)$ are obtained through a block Gauss decomposition of the generator matrix in its RTT presentation, and the Drinfeld relations are explicitly computed by utilizing a block version of its RTT relations. As a byproduct, we obtain a new expression for the central series of $\mathrm{Y}(\mathfrak{q}_n)$ in terms of Gauss generators.</description>

      <title>Yang-Baxter extremal characters of wreath products of finite groups with the infinite symmetric group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a finite group. To a representation $\pi$ of $T$ and an involutive solution of the Yang-Baxter equation (an $R$-matrix) verifying the "extended" reflection equation, we associate a character and a representation of the wreath product $G:=T\wr \mathfrak{S}_\infty$. The set of extremal characters of $G$ is in bijection with a continuous set of parameters. In this article, we characterize exactly what subset of parameters does correspond to an extremal Yang-Baxter character of $G$.</description>

      <title>Codes in algebras of direct products of groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09695v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain the Wedderburn-Artin decomposition of a semisimple group algebra associated to a direct product of finite groups. We also provide formulae for the number of all possible group codes, and their dimensions, that can be constructed in a group algebra. As particular cases, we present the complete algebraic description of the group algebra of any direct product of groups whose direct factors are cyclic, dihedral, or generalised quaternion groups.</description>

      <title>(2+1)d Lattice Models and Tensor Networks for Gapped Phases with Categorical Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gapped phases in 2+1 dimensional quantum field theories with fusion 2-categorical symmetries were recently classified and characterized using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) approach arXiv:2408.05266, arXiv:2502.20440. In this paper, we provide a systematic lattice model construction for all such gapped phases. Specifically, we consider "all-boson type" fusion 2-category symmetries, all of which are obtainable from 0-form symmetry groups $G$ (possibly with an 't Hooft anomaly) via generalized gauging--that is, by stacking with an $H$-symmetric TFT and gauging a subgroup $H$. The continuum classification directly informs the lattice data, such as the generalized gauging that determines the symmetry category, and the data that specifies the gapped phase. We construct commuting projector Hamiltonians and ground states applicable to any non-chiral gapped phase with such symmetries. We also describe the ground states in terms of tensor networks. In light of the length of the paper, we include a self-contained summary section presenting the main results and examples.</description>

      <title>Structure and Invariants of Weyl-Type Algebras with Hyperbolic Sine Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces and systematically studies a class of Weyl-type algebras enriched with hyperbolic sine and power generators over a field of characteristic zero, defined as $A_{p,t,\cA} = \Weyl{\sinh(\pm x^{p} \sinh(t)),\; \sinh(\cA x),\; x^{\cA}}$ in the associative setting and $\Nass{\sinh(\pm x^{p} \sinh(t)),\; \sinh(\cA x),\; x^{\cA}}$ in a non-associative framework. We establish fundamental structural properties, including the triviality of the center for the non-associative version and the explicit description $Z(A_{p,t,\cA}) = \FF[\sinh(\pm x^{p} \sinh(t))]$ for the associative one, proving that $A_{p,t,\cA}$ is an Azumaya algebra over its center and represents a nontrivial class in the Brauer group $\Br(\FF(y))$. Furthermore, we compute the Gelfand--Kirillov dimension for relevant examples and demonstrate its key properties, such as additivity under tensor products and the growth dichotomy. We completely characterize the automorphism group of $A_{p,t,\cA}$ as a semidirect product of a torus with a discrete group, and provide a sharp isomorphism criterion showing that the parameter $t$ is a complete invariant in the family. The paper concludes with two open problems concerning the GK dimension of non-associative hyperbolic sine algebras and the classification of their deformations, pointing toward future research directions in non-associative growth theory and deformation rigidity.</description>
