      <title>The $L_p$ dual Minkowski problem for capillary hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the $L_p$ dual Minkowski problem for capillary hypersurfaces for $p&gt;q$, which aims to find a capillary convex body with a prescribed capillary $(p,q)$-the dual curvature measure in the Euclidean half-space. We reduce it to a Monge-Amp\`ere type equation with a Robin boundary condition on the unit spherical cap, and prove that there exists a unique smooth solution that solves this problem provided $\theta\in (0,\frac{\pi}{2})$.</description>

      <title>Neutral Deformation Modes of Minimal Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stretching, drilling, and bending are the independent deformation modes of a thin shell, each of which has an individual energy content. When the energy content of a mode vanishes, that mode is neutral. We characterize all neutral modes of deformation of minimal surfaces into minimal surfaces. A hierarchy is found among these: a stretching neutral mode (which is an isometry) is also drilling neutral, and a drilling neutral mode is also bending neutral. Thus, all isometries of a minimal surface are globally neutral and give rise to soft elasticity. More generally, all minimal surfaces can be classified relative to a reference one in terms of three energy contents, which can be given in closed form.</description>

      <title>Local structure of gradient almost Ricci solitons with harmonic Weyl tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate a gradient almost Ricci soliton with harmonic Weyl tensor. We first prove that its Ricci tensor has at most three distinct eigenvalues of constant multiplicities in a neighborhood of a regular point of the potential function. Then, we classify those with exactly two distinct eigenvalues. It is worth mentioning that the case with exactly one eigenvalue has already been settled elsewhere. Our results are based on a local representation of these manifolds as multiply warped products of a one-dimensional base, having at most two Einstein fibers, which we also obtain in this paper. These results extend a result by Catino, who assumes, in addition, that the Weyl tensor is radially flat, and a result by Kim, who considers the four-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>Nonexistence of the metric with positive intermediate curvatures on manifolds with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish curvature obstruction theorems for manifolds with boundary. Our main theorems show that, for dimensions up to 7, a topologically nontrivial compact manifold with boundary cannot have a metric of positive $m$-intermediate curvature if the boundary is $m$-convex, and some rigidity result holds if $m$-intermediate curvature is nonnegative. This non-existence persists after performing a connected sum with an arbitrary manifold. These results generalize results of \cite{brendle,chenshuli,ChuKwongLee,Xu} to manifold with boundary.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of complete K\"ahler-Einstein metrics under cscK perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study constant scalar curvature K\"ahler (cscK) metrics on a complete non-compact K\"ahler-Einstein manifold. We give a sufficient condition under which any cscK perturbation of the K\"ahler-Einstein metric remains K\"ahler-Einstein. As a model case, we extend Huang-Xiao's resolution of Cheng's conjecture if the Bergman metric has constant scalar curvature on bounded strictly pseudoconvex domains with smooth boundary.</description>

      <title>Moving Manifolds and the Poincare Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a differential geometric formulation of the Poincare problem using the calculus of moving surfaces (CMS). In this framework, an n dimensional compact hypersurface evolves under a velocity field that couples motion to the extrinsic curvature tensor while preserving topology through smooth diffeomorphic flow. A variational energy principle identifies constant mean curvature (CMC) manifolds as the unique stationary equilibria of CMS dynamics. Consequently, the evolution of any compact simply connected hypersurface relaxes to a CMC equilibrium and, in the isotropic case, to the round sphere. Unlike Ricci flow approaches, which are dimension restricted and require topological surgery, the CMS formulation holds for all dimensions and preserves manifold topology for all time. This provides a deterministic geometric mechanical route to the Poincare conclusion, unifying dynamics, topology, and equilibrium geometry within a single analytic framework.</description>

      <title>Positive Chern and Riemannian Scalar Curvatures on Noncompact Complex Cylinder $ X \times \mathbb{C} $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ X $ be an oriented, closed manifold with $ \dim X \geqslant 2 $. In this article, we give both Riemannian geoemtry and complex geometry results on (sub)manifolds of the type $ X \times \mathbb{C}^{k} $ or $ X \times \mathbb{R}^{k} $. For Riemannian geometry side, we show that if $ X \times \mathbb{C} = X \times \mathbb{R}^{2} $ admits a Riemannian metric $ g $ with uniformly positive scalar curvature and bounded curvature, such that some novel conformally invariant $ g $-angle condition is satisfied, then there exists a metric $ \tilde{g} $ conformal to $ g $ such that $ \tilde{g} |_{X} $ has positive scalar curvature. This Riemannian path implies a complex geometry result: we show that if the complex manifold $ X \times \mathbb{C} $ admits a Hermitian metric $ \omega $ whose associated Riemannian metric $ g $ has uniformly positive scalar curvature and is of bounded curvature, then $ X \times \mathbb{C} $ admits a Hermitian metric $ \tilde{\omega} $ with positive Chern scalar curvature, provided that some $ g $-angle condition is satisfied. The Riemannian geometry result partially answers a 1994 Rosenberg-Stolz conjecture. The complex geometry result extends a result of XiaoKui Yang from compact Hermitian manifolds to noncompact Hermitian manifolds of type $ X \times \mathbb{C} $. We further generalize both the Riemannian and complex geometry results to $ X \times \mathbb{R}^{k} $ or $ X \times \mathbb{C}^{k} $ for any $ k \geqslant 1 $ by imposing a generalized conformally invariant angle condition.</description>

      <title>Harmonic maps in singular geometry and rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This survey reviews results on harmonic maps into spaces of non-positive curvature, with a focus on targets that lack smooth structure. More precisely, we consider targets that are complete metric spaces with non-positive curvature in the sense of Alexandrov, commonly referred to as NPC (non-positively curved) or CAT(0) spaces. We discuss applications of harmonic maps to rigidity phenomena, including generalizations of Margulis superrigidity and the holomorphic rigidity of Teichm\"uller space. Our approach relies heavily on the regularity theory of harmonic maps to non-smooth targets, enabling differential-geometric techniques to be employed in the absence of any smooth structure on the target.</description>

      <title>The algebraic square of an irreducible complex spinor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize, in every dimension and signature, the algebraic squares of an irreducible complex spinor as a pair of exterior forms satisfying a prescribed system of algebraic relations that we present in terms of the geometric product of the underlying quadratic vector space. As a result, we obtain a general correspondence between irreducible complex spinors and algebraically constrained exterior forms, which clarifies the subtle relationship between spinors and exterior forms and contributes towards the understanding of spinors as the square root of geometry. We use this formalism to construct the squares of an irreducible complex spinor in Euclidean dimensions up to six, and also to construct the squares of a generic, possibly non-pure and non-unit, irreducible complex chiral spinor in eight Euclidean dimensions. Elaborating on this result, we consider a natural notion of spinorial instanton that we study for connections on a principal bundle with a complex structure group as well as for curvings of a $\mathbb{C}^{\ast}$-bundle gerbe defined on a Lorentzian six-manifold.</description>

      <title>On operator fields in the upper triangular Toeplitz form</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we solve the fundamental problem of describing the coordinate transformations that preserve the upper triangular Toeplitz form of the given operator field. Surprisingly, this problem is closely related to the description of all Nijenhuis operators in the same form. This description, as well as the formulas for the aforementioned coordinate transformations, are given by the implicit formulas involving matrix-valued functions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of recovering a time dependent matrix valued potential on a globally hyperbolic manifold from the knowledge of the source to solution map of a wave equation including a connection 1-form term. We exhibit sufficient conditions for solving this inverse problem under the assumption that the the manifold is stationary and that the connection term is time independent. The proof is based on two ingredients. The first is reduction of the problem to the study of a non-Abelian light ray transform and holds assuming global hyperbolicity only. The second is the study of this transform and establishing a link with a Riemannian analogue.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15454v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that in Cartan-Hadamard manifolds $M^n$, $n\geq 3$, closed infinitesimally convex hypersurfaces $\Gamma$ bound convex flat regions, if curvature of $M^n$ vanishes on tangent planes of $\Gamma$. This encompasses Chern-Lashof-Sacksteder characterization of compact convex hypersurfaces in Euclidean space, and some results of Greene-Wu-Gromov on rigidity of Cartan-Hadamard manifolds. It follows that closed simply connected surfaces in $M^3$ with minimal total absolute curvature bound Euclidean convex bodies, as stated by Gromov in 1985. The proofs employ the Gauss-Codazzi equations, a generalization of Schur comparison theorem to CAT($k$) spaces, and other techniques from Alexandrov geometry outlined by Petrunin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05801v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the systole function is topologically Morse on the moduli space $\mathcal M_{g,n}$ and the $\text{sys}_T$ functions are $C^2$-Morse on the Deligne-Mumford compactification $\overline{\mathcal M}_{g,n}$. In this paper, We show that these Morse functions admit an index gap on $\mathcal M_{g,n}$. Specifically, there exists a universal constant $C&gt;0$ such that any critical point in $\mathcal M_{g,n}$ has Morse index at least $C\log\log(g+n)$. This implies by Morse theory that the low degree homology of the Deligne-Mumford compactification $\overline{\mathcal M}_{g,n}$ comes from the boundary $\partial\mathcal M_{g,n}$.</description>

      <title>Spin(7)-instantons on Joyce's first examples of compact Spin(7)-manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct $Spin(7)$-instantons on one of Joyce's compact $Spin(7)$-manifolds. The underlying compact $Spin(7)$-manifold given by Joyce is the same as in Lewis' construction of $Spin(7)$-instantons. However, our construction method and the resulting instantons are new. The compact $Spin(7)$-manifold is constructed by gluing a $Spin(7)$-orbifold and certain local model spaces around the orbifold singularities. We construct our instantons by gluing non-flat connections on the local model spaces to a flat connection on the $Spin(7)$-orbifold. We deliver more than $20,000$ new four-parameter families of examples of $Spin(7)$-instantons within the structure groups $SO(3), SO(4), SO(5), SO(7)$, and $SO(8)$.</description>

      <title>Introducing Various Notions of Distances between Space-Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16800v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of causally-null-compactifiable space-times which can be canonically converted into a compact timed-metric-spaces using the cosmological time of Andersson-Howard-Galloway and the null distance of Sormani-Vega. We produce a large class of such space-times including future developments of compact initial data sets and regions which exhaust asymptotically flat space-times. We then present various notions of intrinsic distances between these space-times (introducing the timed-Hausdorff distance) and prove some of these notions of distance are definite in the sense that they equal zero iff there is a time-oriented Lorentzian isometry between the space-times. These definite distances enable us to define various notions of convergence of space-times to limit space-times which are not necessarily smooth. Many open questions and conjectures are included throughout.</description>

      <title>Symplectification of Rank 2 Distributions, Normal Cartan Connections, and Cartan Prolongations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Doubrov--Zelenko symplectification procedure for rank $2$ distributions with $5$-dimensional cube -- originally motivated by optimal control theory -- through the lens of Tanaka--Morimoto theory for normal Cartan connections. In this way, for ambient manifolds of dimension $ n \geq 5 $, we prove the existence of the normal Cartan connection associated with the symplectified distribution. Furthermore, we show that this symplectification can be interpreted as the $(n-4)$th iterated Cartan prolongation at a generic point. This interpretation naturally leads to two questions for an arbitrary rank $2$ distribution with $5$-dimensional cube: (1) Is the $(n-4)$th iterated Cartan prolongation the minimal iteration where the Tanaka symbols become unified at generic points? (2) Is the $(n-4)$th iterated Cartan prolongation the minimal iteration admitting a normal Cartan connection via Tanaka--Morimoto theory? Our main results demonstrate that: (a) For $n &gt; 5$, the answer to the second question is positive (in contrast to the classical $n = 5$ case from $G_2$-parabolic geometries); (b) For $n \geq 5$, the answer to the first question is negative: unification occurs already at the $(n-5)$th iterated Cartan prolongation.</description>

      <title>On Geometry and Topology of Hessian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01176v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a differentiable manifold $M$, a pair $(M, \nabla)$ is termed an affine manifold, if $\nabla$ is a flat and torsion-free connection on the tangent bundle $TM\rightarrow M$. A Riemannian metric $g$ on $M$ is called a Hessian metric on $(M, \nabla)$, if $g$ can be expressed locally as the Hessian quadratic form $\nabla(df)$ of some smooth potential $f$. An affine manifold equipped with a Hessian metric is termed a Hessian manifold. We study the topology and geometry of Hessian manifolds.
  Key topological constraints are derived, including the vanishing of the Euler characteristic for any compact Hessian manifold and infinite torsion-freeness of its fundamental group. We demonstrate that compact Hessian manifolds with an abelian fundamental group are homeomorphic to the flat torus. The theory of flat line bundles is developed to introduce the canonical and obstruction bundles, which are used to prove that a curved compact orientable Hessian manifold must be a mapping torus. Curvature properties are then discussed. As an application, we prove that all compact Hessian-Einstein manifolds are flat.
  A Hessian manifold $((M, \nabla),g)$ is said to be of Koszul type, if there exists a $1$-form $\eta\in\Omega^1(M)$ such that $g=\nabla\eta$. We place emphasis on Hessian manifolds of Koszul type, establishing an equivalence between their existence and that of positive flat line bundles, space-like Lagrangian embeddings, and hyperbolic affine structures. A duality with radiant manifolds, analogous to the classical Legendre transformation, is explored. We also construct a non-trivial family of compact Hessian manifolds of Koszul type with negative scalar curvature, and classify all complete Hessian surfaces.</description>

      <title>A Characterization of Quasi-Einstein Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the modified Ricci solitons as a new class of Einstein type metrics that contains both Ricci solitons and $n$-quasi-Einstein metrics. This class is closely related to the construction of the Ricci solitons that are realised as warped products. A modified Ricci soliton appears as part of a special solution of the modified Ricci-harmonic flow, which result a new characterization of $n$-quasi-Einstein metrics. We also study the modified Ricci almost solitons. In the spirit of the Lichnerowicz and Obata first eigenvalue theorems, we prove that in the class of compact Riemannian manifolds with constant scalar curvature the standard sphere with a structure of gradient modified Ricci almost soliton is rigid under some specific geometric conditions. Moreover, we display an example of modified Ricci-harmonic soliton.</description>

      <title>Gradient Einstein-type Sasakian manifolds with $\alpha=0$ are trivial</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Catino, Mastrolia, Monticelli, and Rigoli have launched an ambitious program to study known geometric solitons from a unified perspective, termed Einstein-type manifolds. This framework allows one to treat Ricci solitons, Yamabe solitons, and all of their generalizations simultaneously. Einstein-type manifolds are characterized by four constants $\alpha, \beta, \mu$ and $\rho$. In this paper, we show that when $\alpha = 0$ gradient Einstein-type Sasakian manifolds are trivial. As a consequence, many geometric solitons on Sasakian manifolds turn out to be trivial.</description>

      <title>The $C^0$-inextendibility of a class of FLRW spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the singularity structure of FLRW spacetimes without particle horizons at the $C^0$-level of the metric. We show that in the case of constant spatial curvature $K=+1$, and without any further assumptions on the scale factor, the big bang singularity is sufficiently strong to exclude continuous spacetime extensions to the past. On the other hand it is known that in the case of constant spatial curvature $K=-1$ continuous spacetime extensions through the big-bang exist for certain choices of scale factor [4], giving rise to Milne-like cosmologies. Complementing these results we exhibit a geometric obstruction to continuous spacetime extensions which is present for a large range of scale factors in the case $K=-1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the issue of uniqueness of solutions in the conformal method for solving the constraint equations in general relativity with arbitrary mean curvature as developed initially by Holst, Nagy, Tsogtegerel and Maxwell. We show that the solution they construct is unique amongst those having volume below a certain threshold.</description>

      <title>HKKN-stratifications in a non-compact framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we study HKKN stratifications, both algebraically and analytically, for a Cartesian product between a vector space and a compact K{\"a}hler manifold. We then use these stratifications to prove convexity properties of the moment map for non-compact analytic subsets invariant under a Borel subgroup.</description>
