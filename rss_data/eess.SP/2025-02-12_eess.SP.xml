      <title>Electromagnetic Channel Statistics for Continuous-Aperture Array (CAPA) Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The channel statistics of a continuous-aperture array (CAPA)-based channel are analyzed using its continuous electromagnetic (EM) properties. The received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is discussed under isotropic scattering conditions. Using Landau's theorem, the eigenvalues of the autocorrelation of the EM fading channel are shown to exhibit a step-like behavior. Building on this, closed-form expressions for the probability distribution of the SNR and the average channel capacity are derived. Numerical results are provided to validate the accuracy of the derivations.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Beamforming for Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uncertainty of the sensing target brings great challenge to the beamforming design of the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. To address this issue, we model the scattering coefficient and azimuth angle of the target as random variables and introduce a novel metric, expected detection probability (EPd), to quantify the average detection performance from a Bayesian perspective. Furthermore, we design a Bayesian beamforming scheme to optimize the expected detection probability under the limited power budget and communication performance constraints. A successive convex approximation and semidefinite relaxation-based (SCA-SDR) algorithm is developed for the complicated non-convex optimization problem corresponding to the beamforming scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms other benchmarks and exhibits robust detection performance when parameters of the target are unknown and random.</description>

      <title>Smell of Source: Learning-Based Odor Source Localization with Molecular Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Odor source localization is a fundamental challenge in molecular communication, environmental monitoring, disaster response, industrial safety, and robotics. In this study, we investigate three major approaches: Bayesian filtering, machine learning (ML) models, and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with the aim of odor source localization in a single-source, single-molecule case. By considering the source-sensor architecture as a transmitter-receiver model we explore source localization under the scope of molecular communication. Synthetic datasets are generated using a 2D advection-diffusion PDE solver to evaluate each method under varying conditions, including sensor noise and sparse measurements. Our experiments demonstrate that \textbf{Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)} achieve the lowest localization error of \(\mathbf{0.89 \times 10^{-6}}\) m, outperforming \textbf{machine learning (ML) inversion} (\(\mathbf{1.48 \times 10^{-6}}\) m) and \textbf{Kalman filtering} (\(\mathbf{1.62 \times 10^{-6}}\) m). The \textbf{reinforcement learning (RL)} approach, while achieving a localization error of \(\mathbf{3.01 \times 10^{-6}}\) m, offers an inference time of \(\mathbf{0.147}\) s, highlighting the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency among different methodologies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate frequency-selective dynamic scattering array (DSA), a versatile antenna structure capable of performing joint wave-based computing and radiation by transitioning signal processing tasks from the digital domain to the electromagnetic (EM) domain. The numerical results demonstrate the potential of DSAs to produce space-frequency superdirective responses with minimal usage of radiofrequency (RF) chains, making it particularly attractive for future holographic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Over-The-Air Control of UAV Swarm Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coordinated controlling a large UAV swarm requires significant spectrum resources due to the need for bandwidth allocation per UAV, posing a challenge in resource-limited environments. Over-the-air (OTA) control has emerged as a spectrum-efficient approach, leveraging electromagnetic superposition to form control signals at a base station (BS). However, existing OTA controllers lack sufficient optimization variables to meet UAV swarm control objectives and fail to integrate control with other BS functions like sensing. This work proposes an integrated sensing and OTA control framework (ISAC-OTA) for UAV swarm. The BS performs OTA signal construction (uplink) and dispatch (downlink) while simultaneously sensing objects. Two uplink post-processing methods are developed: a control-centric approach generating closed-form control signals via a feedback-looped OTA control problem, and a sensing-centric method mitigating transmission-induced interference for accurate object sensing. For the downlink, a non-convex problem is formulated and solved to minimize control signal dispatch (transmission) error while maintaining a minimum sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Simulation results show that the proposed ISAC-OTA controller achieves control performance comparable to the benchmark optimal control algorithm while maintaining high sensing accuracy, despite OTA transmission interference. Moreover, it eliminates the need for per-UAV bandwidth allocation, showcasing a spectrum-efficient method for cooperative control in future wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Towards THz-based Obstacle Sensing: A Generative Radio Environment Awareness Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obstacle sensing is essential for terahertz (THz) communication since the subsequent beam management can avoid THz signals blocked by the obstacles. In parallel, radio environment, which can be manifested by channel knowledge such as the distribution of received signal strength (RSS), reveals signal propagation situation and the corresponding obstacle information. However, the awareness of the radio environment for obstacle sensing is challenging in practice, as the sparsely deployed THz sensors can acquire only little a priori knowledge with their RSS measurements. Therefore, we formulate in this paper a radio environment awareness problem, which for the first time considers a probability distribution of obstacle attributes. To solve such a problem, we propose a THz-based generative radio environment awareness framework, in which obstacle information is obtained directly from the aware radio environment. We also propose a novel generative model based on conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN), where U-net and the objective function of the problem are introduced to enable accurate awareness of RSS distribution. Simulation results show that the proposed framework can improve the awareness of the radio environment, and thus achieve superior sensing performance in terms of average precision regarding obstacles' shape and location.</description>

      <title>Non-Interchangeability between Heart Rate Variability and Pulse Rate Variability During Supine-to-Stand Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heart rate variability (HRV) is widely recognized as a valuable biomarker for assessing autonomic cardiac regulation. Pulse rate variability (PRV) is a common surrogate of HRV given the wide usability of PPG in commercially available devices. However, there is no clear conclusion on whether PRV can replace HRV given their different physiological mechanisms. This study evaluates the interchangeability of young adults HRV and PRV during supine-to-stand (STS) tests which are known as common posture transitions in daily life monitoring. Fifteen features from time, frequency and nonlinear domains were extracted from both electrocardiography and PPG signals. Paired t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests examined the difference between the extracted HRV and PRV features during supine, transition and standing phases separately. One feature showed significant difference in the supine phase, and this discrepancy increased to four in the transition and standing phases. These findings suggested that PRV is different from HRV in the STS tests, despite the fact that both metrics can reflect the sympathetic activation triggered by the posture changes.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Model for Weakly-Supervised Speech Dereverberation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new training strategy to improve speech dereverberation systems using minimal acoustic information and reverberant (wet) speech. Most existing algorithms rely on paired dry/wet data, which is difficult to obtain, or on target metrics that may not adequately capture reverberation characteristics and can lead to poor results on non-target metrics. Our approach uses limited acoustic information, like the reverberation time (RT60), to train a dereverberation system. The system's output is resynthesized using a generated room impulse response and compared with the original reverberant speech, providing a novel reverberation matching loss replacing the standard target metrics. During inference, only the trained dereverberation model is used. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves more consistent performance across various objective metrics used in speech dereverberation than the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Hyper Compressed Fine-Tuning of Large Foundation Models with Quantum Inspired Adapters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large foundation models for specific tasks has become increasingly challenging due to the computational and storage demands associated with full parameter updates. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this issue by updating only a small subset of model parameters using adapter modules. In this work, we propose \emph{Quantum-Inspired Adapters}, a PEFT approach inspired by Hamming-weight preserving quantum circuits from quantum machine learning literature. These models can be both expressive and parameter-efficient by operating in a combinatorially large space while simultaneously preserving orthogonality in weight parameters. We test our proposed adapters by adapting large language models and large vision transformers on benchmark datasets. Our method can achieve 99.2\% of the performance of existing fine-tuning methods such LoRA with a 44x parameter compression on language understanding datasets like GLUE and VTAB. Compared to existing orthogonal fine-tuning methods such as OFT or BOFT, we achieve 98\% relative performance with 25x fewer parameters. This demonstrates competitive performance paired with a significant reduction in trainable parameters. Through ablation studies, we determine that combining multiple Hamming-weight orders with orthogonality and matrix compounding are essential for performant fine-tuning. Our findings suggest that Quantum-Inspired Adapters offer a promising direction for efficient adaptation of language and vision models in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Downlink and Uplink ISAC in Continuous-Aperture Array (CAPA) Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A continuous-aperture array (CAPA)-based integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) framework is proposed for both downlink and uplink scenarios. Within this framework, continuous operator-based signal models are employed to describe the sensing and communication processes. The performance of communication and sensing is analyzed using two information-theoretic metrics: the communication rate (CR) and the sensing rate (SR). 1) For downlink ISAC, three continuous beamforming designs are proposed: i) the communications-centric (C-C) design that maximizes the CR, ii) the sensing-centric (S-C) design that maximizes the SR, and iii) the Pareto-optimal design that characterizes the Pareto boundary of the CR-SR region. A signal subspace-based approach is proposed to derive the closed-form optimal beamformers for the considered designs. On this basis, closed-form expressions are derived for the achievable CRs and SRs, and the downlink rate region achieved by CAPAs is characterized. 2) For uplink ISAC, the C-C and S-C successive interference cancellation (SIC)-based methods are proposed to manage inter-functionality interference. Using the subspace approach along with the time-sharing technique, closed-form expressions for the optimal beamformers are derived, and the achievable CRs, SRs, and rate region are analyzed. Numerical results demonstrate that, for both downlink and uplink, CAPA-based ISAC achieves higher CRs and SRs as well as larger CR-SR regions compared to conventional spatially discrete array (SPDA)-based ISAC.</description>

      <title>An Unconventional Ultra-Sub-Wavelength Receiving Nano-Antenna Activated by ac Spin Pumping and the ac Inverse Spin Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report an extreme sub-wavelength unconventional receiving antenna. It consists of an array of nanomagnets connected to heavy metal nanostrips. Incident electromagnetic (EM) radiation generates intrinsic and extrinsic spin waves in the nanomagnets, which pump spin into the heavy metal nanostrips at their own frequencies giving rise to a polychromatic alternating voltage across the latter owing to the ac inverse spin Hall effect. This implements a receiving nano-antenna. We demonstrate its operation at two different EM wave frequencies of 1.5 GHz and 2.4 GHz - the latter being the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi frequency. We measure the receiving gain at 2.4 GHz to be approximately -9 db. The free space radiated wavelength "lambda" at 2.4 GHz is 12.5 cm while the antenna area A is merely 160 micron^2, making the ratio A/lambda^2 = 0.97x10^-8. This antenna's receiving gain should be very poor because of the tiny size. Yet the measured gain is more than 4000 times larger than the theoretical limit for a conventional antenna of this size at this wavelength because of the unconventional operating principle.</description>

      <title>Beamfocusing Capabilities of a Uniform Linear Array in the Holographic Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of multiantenna technologies in the near field offers the possibility of focusing the energy in spatial regions rather than just in angle. The objective of this paper is to provide a formal framework that allows to establish the region in space where this effect can take place and how efficient this focusing can be, assuming that the transmit architecture is a uniform linear array (ULA). A dyadic Green's channel model is adopted, and the amplitude differences between the receiver and each transmit antenna are effectively incorporated in the model. By considering a second-order expansion of the SNR around the intended receiver, a formal criterion is derived in order to establish whether beamfocusing is feasible or not. An analytic description is provided that determines the shape and position of the asymptotic ellipsoid where a minimum SNR is achieved. Further insights are provided by considering the holographic regime, whereby the number of elements of the ULA increase without bound while the distance between adjacent elements converges to zero. This asymptotic framework allows to simplify the analytical form of the beamfocusing feasibility region, which in turn provides some further insights into the shape of the coverage regions depending on the position of the intended receiver. In particular, it is shown that beamfocusing is only possible if the size of the ULA is at least $4.4\lambda$ where $\lambda$ is the transmission wavelength. Furthermore, a closed form analytical expression is provided that asymptotically determines the maximum distance where beamfocusing is feasible as a function of the elevation angle. In particular, beamfocusing is only feasible when the receiver is located between a minimum and a maximum distance from the array, where these upper and lower distance limits effectively depend on the angle of elevation</description>

      <title>Detection of presence and number of persons by a Wi-Fi signal: a practical RSSI-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present experimental results and theoretical methods for the precise determination of the presence and the number of persons in an observed area by using Wi-Fi signals. Our setup does not require active cooperation of persons present in the Wi-Fi field, and relies only on the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), which is read by the detectors. We first show that the standard deviation of the measured RSSI data can be used as a practical tool to establish the presence of a person (or more persons) with high precision, in particular when the signal source is inside the measurement room. For the more difficult problem of counting the number of persons, we have employed machine learning algorithms to analyze data collected on nine different detectors and up to nine people present in our experiment. We have achieved excellent results (prediction accuracy of $98 \%$ and above) for counting already with only few detectors utilized in the analysis. While generalizations to nontrivial indoor geometries (such as odd shapes, more rooms, and greater size) may be of interest in some applications, where additional care with respect to positioning od detectors can be needed (or even placing additional detectors), this approach may be useful due to its conceptual practicality and solid prediction results.</description>

Abstract: The contemporary landscape of wireless technology underscores the critical role of precise localization services. Traditional global navigation satellite systems (GNSS)-based solutions, however, fall short when it comes to indoor environments, and existing indoor localization techniques such as electromagnetic fingerprinting methods face challenges of additional implementation costs and limited coverage. This article explores an innovative solution that blends low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), unlocking its potential for realizing seamless indoor and outdoor localization (SIOL) with global coverage. After a comprehensive review of the distinctive characteristics of LEO satellites and RISs, we showcase their potential for SIOL applications through two case studies on position error bound evaluation. Finally, we discuss system architectures and highlight open challenges in such systems.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks in EEG-based Emotion Recognition: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01138v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compared to other modalities, EEG-based emotion recognition can intuitively respond to the emotional patterns in the human brain and, therefore, has become one of the most concerning tasks in the brain-computer interfaces field. Since dependencies within brain regions are closely related to emotion, a significant trend is to develop Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for EEG-based emotion recognition. However, brain region dependencies in emotional EEG have physiological bases that distinguish GNNs in this field from those in other time series fields. Besides, there is neither a comprehensive review nor guidance for constructing GNNs in EEG-based emotion recognition. In the survey, our categorization reveals the commonalities and differences of existing approaches under a unified framework of graph construction. We analyze and categorize methods from three stages in the framework to provide clear guidance on constructing GNNs in EEG-based emotion recognition. In addition, we discuss several open challenges and future directions, such as Temporal full-connected graph and Graph condensation.</description>

      <title>Data Assimilation with Machine Learning Surrogate Models: A Case Study with FourCastNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern data-driven surrogate models for weather forecasting provide accurate short-term predictions but inaccurate and nonphysical long-term forecasts. This paper investigates online weather prediction using machine learning surrogates supplemented with partial and noisy observations. We empirically demonstrate and theoretically justify that, despite the long-time instability of the surrogates and the sparsity of the observations, filtering estimates can remain accurate in the long-time horizon. As a case study, we integrate FourCastNet, a weather surrogate model, within a variational data assimilation framework using partial, noisy ERA5 data. Our results show that filtering estimates remain accurate over a year-long assimilation window and provide effective initial conditions for forecasting tasks, including extreme event prediction.</description>

      <title>Digital and Hybrid Precoding Designs in Massive MIMO with Low-Resolution ADCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17638v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) have emerged as an efficient solution for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems to reap high data rates with reasonable power consumption and hardware complexity. In this paper, we study precoding designs for digital, fully connected (FC) hybrid, and partially connected (PC) hybrid beamforming architectures in massive MIMO systems with low-resolution ADCs at the receiver. We aim to maximize the spectral efficiency (SE) subject to a transmit power budget and hardware constraints on the analog components. The resulting problems are nonconvex and the quantization distortion introduces additional challenges. To address them, we first derive a tight lower bound for the SE, based on which we optimize the precoders for the three beamforming architectures under the majorization-minorization framework. Numerical results validate the superiority of the proposed precoding designs over their state-of-the-art counterparts in systems with low-resolution ADCs, particularly those with 1-bit resolution. The results show that the PC hybrid precoding design can achieve an SE close to those of the digital and FC hybrid precoding designs in 1-bit systems, highlighting the potential of the PC hybrid beamforming architectures.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Analysis of One-bit Quantized Box-Constrained Precoding in Large-Scale Multi-User Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the design of multi-antenna precoding strategies, considering hardware limitations such as low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs), which necessitate the quantization of transmitted signals. The typical approach starts with optimizing a precoder, followed by a quantization step to meet hardware requirements. This study analyzes the performance of a quantization scheme applied to the box-constrained regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoder in the asymptotic regime, where the number of antennas and users grows proportionally. The box constraint, initially designed to cope with low-dynamic range amplifiers, is used here to control quantization noise rather than for amplifier compatibility. A significant challenge in analyzing the quantized precoder is that the input to the quantization operation does not follow a Gaussian distribution, making traditional methods such as Bussgang's decomposition unsuitable. To overcome this, the paper extends the Gordon's inequality and introduces a novel Gaussian Min-Max Theorem to model the distribution of the channel-distorted precoded signal. The analysis derives the tight lower bound for the signal-to-distortion-plus-noise ratio (SDNR) and the bit error rate (BER), showing that optimal tuning of the amplitude constraint improves performance.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Sequential Change Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of detecting a change in the distribution of a high-dimensional multivariate normal time series. Assuming that the post-change parameters are unknown and estimated using a window of historical data, we extend the framework of quickest change detection (QCD) to the highdimensional setting in which the number of variables increases proportionally with the size of the window used to estimate the post-change parameters. Our analysis reveals that an information theoretic quantity, which we call the Normalized High- Dimensional Kullback-Leibler divergence (NHDKL), governs the high-dimensional asymptotic performance of QCD procedures. Specifically, we show that the detection delay is asymptotically inversely proportional to the difference between the NHDKL of the true post-change versus pre-change distributions and the NHDKL of the true versus estimated post-change distributions. In cases of perfect estimation, where the latter NHDKL is zero, the delay is inversely proportional to the NHDKL between the post-change and pre-change distributions alone. Thus, our analysis is a direct generalization of the traditional fixed-dimension, large-sample asymptotic framework, where the standard KL divergence is asymptotically inversely proportional to detection delay. Finally, we identify parameter estimators that asymptotically minimize the NHDKL between the true versus estimated post-change distributions, resulting in a QCD method that is guaranteed to outperform standard approaches based on fixed-dimension asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Review of Deep Unfolding Techniques for Next-Generation Wireless Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of machine learning in wireless communications has been extensively explored, with deep unfolding emerging as a powerful model-based technique. Deep unfolding enhances interpretability by transforming complex iterative algorithms into structured layers of deep neural networks (DNNs). This approach seamlessly integrates domain knowledge with deep learning (DL), leveraging the strengths of both methods to simplify complex signal processing tasks in communication systems. To provide a solid foundation, we first present a brief overview of DL and deep unfolding. We then explore the applications of deep unfolding in key areas, including signal detection, channel estimation, beamforming design, decoding for error-correcting codes, sensing and communication, power allocation, and security. Each section focuses on a specific task, highlighting its significance in emerging 6G technologies and reviewing recent advancements in deep unfolding-based solutions. Finally, we discuss the challenges associated with developing deep unfolding techniques and propose potential improvements to enhance their applicability across diverse wireless communication scenarios.</description>

      <title>Faster Convergence with Less Communication: Broadcast-Based Subgraph Sampling for Decentralized Learning over Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consensus-based decentralized stochastic gradient descent (D-SGD) is a widely adopted algorithm for decentralized training of machine learning models across networked agents. A crucial part of D-SGD is the consensus-based model averaging, which heavily relies on information exchange and fusion among the nodes. Specifically, for consensus averaging over wireless networks, communication coordination is necessary to determine when and how a node can access the channel and transmit (or receive) information to (or from) its neighbors. In this work, we propose $\texttt{BASS}$, a broadcast-based subgraph sampling method designed to accelerate the convergence of D-SGD while considering the actual communication cost per iteration. $\texttt{BASS}$ creates a set of mixing matrix candidates that represent sparser subgraphs of the base topology. In each consensus iteration, one mixing matrix is sampled, leading to a specific scheduling decision that activates multiple collision-free subsets of nodes. The sampling occurs in a probabilistic manner, and the elements of the mixing matrices, along with their sampling probabilities, are jointly optimized. Simulation results demonstrate that $\texttt{BASS}$ enables faster convergence with fewer transmission slots compared to existing link-based scheduling methods. In conclusion, the inherent broadcasting nature of wireless channels offers intrinsic advantages in accelerating the convergence of decentralized optimization and learning.</description>

      <title>Optimal Configuration of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces With Non-uniform Phase Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existing methods for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) beamforming in wireless communications are typically limited to uniform phase quantization. However, in practical applications, engineering challenges and design requirements often lead to non-uniform phase and bit resolution of RIS units, which limits the performance potential of these methods. To address this issue, this paper pioneers the study of discrete non-uniform phase configuration in RIS-assisted multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication and formulates an optimization model to characterize the problem. For single-user scenarios, the paper proposes a partition-andtraversal (PAT) algorithm that efficiently achieves the global optimal solution through systematic search and traversal. For larger-scale multi-user scenarios, aiming to balance performance and computational complexity, an enhanced PAT-based algorithm (E-PAT) is developed. By optimizing the search strategy, the E-PAT algorithm significantly reduces computational overhead and achieves linear complexity. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed PAT and EPAT algorithms. Additionally, we provide a detailed analysis of the impact of non-uniform phase quantization on system performance.</description>

      <title>UNSURE: self-supervised learning with Unknown Noise level and Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01985v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, many self-supervised learning methods for image reconstruction have been proposed that can learn from noisy data alone, bypassing the need for ground-truth references. Most existing methods cluster around two classes: i) Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE) and similar approaches that assume full knowledge of the noise distribution, and ii) Noise2Self and similar cross-validation methods that require very mild knowledge about the noise distribution. The first class of methods tends to be impractical, as the noise level is often unknown in real-world applications, and the second class is often suboptimal compared to supervised learning. In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework that characterizes this expressivity-robustness trade-off and propose a new approach based on SURE, but unlike the standard SURE, does not require knowledge about the noise level. Throughout a series of experiments, we show that the proposed estimator outperforms other existing self-supervised methods on various imaging inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Physics-augmented Deep Learning with Adversarial Domain Adaptation: Applications to STM Image Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image denoising is a critical task in various scientific fields such as medical imaging and material characterization, where the accurate recovery of underlying structures from noisy data is essential. Although supervised denoising techniques have achieved significant advancements, they typically require large datasets of paired clean-noisy images for training. Unsupervised methods, while not reliant on paired data, typically necessitate a set of unpaired clean images for training, which are not always accessible. In this paper, we propose a physics-augmented deep learning with adversarial domain adaption (PDA-Net) framework for unsupervised image denoising, with applications to denoise real-world scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images. Our PDA-Net leverages the underlying physics to simulate and envision the ground truth for denoised STM images. Additionally, built upon Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), we incorporate a cycle-consistency module and a domain adversarial module into our PDA-Net to address the challenge of lacking paired training data and achieve information transfer between the simulated and real experimental domains. Finally, we propose to implement feature alignment and weight-sharing techniques to fully exploit the similarity between simulated and real experimental images, thereby enhancing the denoising performance in both the simulation and experimental domains. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PDA-Net successfully enhances the quality of STM images, offering promising applications to enhance scientific discovery and accelerate experimental quantum material research.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Optimal Change Detection for Unnormalized Pre- and Post-Change Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of detecting changes when only unnormalized pre- and post-change distributions are accessible. This situation happens in many scenarios in physics such as in ferromagnetism, crystallography, magneto-hydrodynamics, and thermodynamics, where the energy models are difficult to normalize.
  Our approach is based on the estimation of the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) statistics, which is known to produce optimal performance. We first present an intuitively appealing approximation method. Unfortunately, this produces a biased estimator of the CUSUM statistics and may cause performance degradation. We then propose the Log-Partition Approximation Cumulative Sum (LPA-CUSUM) algorithm based on thermodynamic integration (TI) in order to estimate the log-ratio of normalizing constants of pre- and post-change distributions. It is proved that this approach gives an unbiased estimate of the log-partition function and the CUSUM statistics, and leads to an asymptotically optimal performance. Moreover, we derive a relationship between the required sample size for thermodynamic integration and the desired detection delay performance, offering guidelines for practical parameter selection. Numerical studies are provided demonstrating the efficacy of our approach.</description>
