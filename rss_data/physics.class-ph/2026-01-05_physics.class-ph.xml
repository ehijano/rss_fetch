      <title>Electrostatics of a Finite Conducting Cylinder: Elliptic-Kernel Integral Equation and Capacitance Asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the electrostatics of a thin, finite-length conducting cylindrical shell held at constant potential V0. Exploiting axial symmetry, we recast the problem as a one-dimensional singular integral equation for the axial surface-charge density, with a kernel written in terms of complete elliptic integrals. A Chebyshev-weighted collocation scheme that incorporates the square-root edge singularity yields rapidly convergent charge profiles and dimensionless capacitances for arbitrary aspect ratios L/a, recovering known long- and short-cylinder limits and providing accurate benchmark values in the intermediate regime. The method offers a compact, numerically robust reference formulation for the electrostatics of finite cylindrical conductors.</description>

      <title>Transpositional rule for constrained systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamics of nonholonomic mechanical systems, focusing on fundamental variational assumptions and the role of the transpositional rule. We analyze how the Cetaev condition and the first variation of constraints define compatible virtual displacements for systems subject to kinematic constraints, including those nonlinear in generalized velocities. The study explores the necessary conditions for commutation relations to hold, clarifying their impact on the consistency of the derived equations of motion. By detailing the interplay between these variational identities and the Lagrangian derivatives of constraint functions, we elucidate the differences between equations of motion formulated via the d'Alembert--Lagrange principle and those obtained from extended time-integral variational principles. This work aims to provide a clearer theoretical framework for applying these core principles to nonholonomic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Reversibility, Chaos, and Attractors in Periodically Sheared Elastic Filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of filaments in flow are central to understanding a wide range of biological and soft-matter systems, yet their behavior under time-dependent forcing remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the long-time dynamics of Brownian inextensible elastic filaments subjected to strong uniform oscillatory shear by combining microfluidic experiments on actin filaments with numerical simulations based on a fluctuating Euler-Bernoulli elastica model in a viscous fluid. As the oscillation period increases, irreversibility emerges from the interplay of flow-induced deformations and thermal noise. This leads to a departure from reversible, deterministic rigid-body dynamics: in this regime, the filaments cycle between nearly straight, flow-aligned conformations at full periods and buckled shapes at half periods. Owing to the time-glide symmetry of the system, two such attracting states in fact coexist with a phase shift of half a period. The system spontaneously selects one, but occasionally switches between them as a result of noise, producing intermittent transitions between apparent order and disorder. This system constitutes an experimentally accessible realization of stochastic symmetry breaking, attractor hopping, and intermittency in a minimal nonequilibrium soft-matter system, with novel implications for the design and control of soft matter systems under time-dependent flows.</description>

      <title>Calculus and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00911v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is an introduction to calculus, and its applications to basic questions from physics. We first discuss the theory of functions $f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$, with the notion of continuity, and the construction of the derivative $f'(x)$ and of the integral $\int_a^bf(x)dx$. Then we investigate the case of the complex functions $f:\mathbb C\to\mathbb C$, and notably the holomorphic functions, and harmonic functions. Then, we discuss the multivariable functions, $f:\mathbb R^N\to\mathbb R^M$ or $f:\mathbb R^N\to\mathbb C^M$ or $f:\mathbb C^N\to\mathbb C^M$, with general theory, integration results, maximization questions, and basic applications to physics.</description>
