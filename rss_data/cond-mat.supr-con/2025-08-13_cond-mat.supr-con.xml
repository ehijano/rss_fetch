      <title>Fluctuation response of a superconductor with temporally correlated noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss how a finite noise correlation time, which can arise through coupling to engineered nonthermal environments, affects the fluctuation-driven response in a superconductor above its critical temperature. Using the phenomenological time-dependent Ginzburg--Landau model, we formulate the stochastic dynamics within the path-integral framework. Our analysis reveals that the transport response can be enhanced when the noise correlation time becomes comparable to the intrinsic relaxation time of the superconductor. The magnitude and character of this resonant-like effect depend strongly on the system's dimensionality.</description>

      <title>The doping evolution of the charge density wave and charge density fluctuations in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cuprate superconductors show various collective charge correlations that are intimately connected with their electronic properties. In particular, charge order in the form of an incommensurate charge density wave (CDW) order with an in-plane wavevector $\delta_{\text{CDW}} \approx $ 0.23--0.35~r.l.u. appears to be universally present. In addition to CDW, dynamic charge density fluctuations (CDF) are also present with wavevectors comparable to $\delta_{\text{CDW}}$. CDFs are present up to $\sim300\;$K and have relatively short correlation lengths of $\xi \sim 20$\;\AA. Here we use Cu-$L_3$ and O-$K$ resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to study the doping dependence of CDW and CDFs in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$. We fit our data with (quasi)elastic peaks resulting from the CDW and up to four inelastic modes associated with oxygen phonons that can be strongly coupled to the CDFs. Our analysis allows us to separate the charge correlations into three components: the CDW with wavevector $\delta_{4a-\text{CDW}} \approx 0.24$ and two CDF components with $\delta_{4a-\text{CDF}} \approx 0.24$ and $\delta_{3a-\text{CDF}} \approx 0.30$. We find that for $T \approx T_c$ the CDW coexists with the CDFs for dopings near $x=p \sim 1/8$. The $4a$-CDW disappears beyond $x=0.16$ and the $4a$-CDF beyond $x=0.19$, leaving only a weak $3a$-CDF at the highest doping studied, $x=0.22$. Our data suggest that low-energy charge fluctuations exist up to doping $x=0.19=p^{\star}$, where the pseudogap disappears, however, we find no evidence that they are associated with a quantum critical point.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale lattice heterostructure in high Tc superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low temperature superconductivity was known since 1957 to be described by BCS theory for an effective single band metals controlled by the density of states at the Fermi level, very far from band edges, the electron phonon coupling, and the energy of the boson in the pairing interaction w0, but BCS has failed to predict high temperature superconductivity in different materials above about 23 K. High temperature superconductivity above 35 K since 1986 has been a matter of materials science where manipulating the lattice complexity of high temperature superconducting ceramic oxides (HTSC) has driven material scientists to grow new HTSC quantum materials up to 138K in HgBa2Ca2Cu3O8 (Hg1223) at ambient pressure and near room temperature in pressurized hydrides. This perspective covers the major results of materials scientist in these last 39 years investigating the role of lattice inhomogeneity detected in these new quantum complex materials. We highlight the nanoscale heterogeneity in these complex materials and elucidate their special role played in the physics for HTSC. Especially, it is pointed out that the geometry of lattice and charge complex heterogeneity at nanoscale is essential and intrinsic in the mechanism of rising quantum coherence at high temperature</description>

      <title>Enhanced superconductivity in ultrathin FeSe films on SrTiO3 via resonant anti-shielding: Superconductivity meets superfluidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A vanishingly small dielectric function reflects a singular polarization response in a medium, leading to collective plasmonic or polaronic excitations that can enhance Cooper pairing in superconductors via a resonant anti-shielding (RAS) effect. Here, we show that RAS can explain the dramatic enhancement of superconductivity-relative to bulk FeSe, observed in single-unit-cell FeSe films on SrTiO$_3$ (STO) and related substrates. Moreover, we present evidence that RAS may play a central role in driving the Cooper pair condensate into a bipolaronic superfluid state. This interpretation aligns with a recent quantum Monte Carlo simulation by Zhang, et al. [Phys. Rev. X 13, 011010 (2023)], which indicated enhanced bipolaronic superconductivity in two-dimensional systems with moderately strong electron-phonon coupling. RAS may therefore represent a promising strategy for engineering high-T$_c$ superconducting heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Flux Response of Rotation-Invariant Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Threading magnetic flux into topological phases can induce bound states that reveal intrinsic properties of the ground state. In a 3D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulator, a quantized $\pi$ flux traps a pair of 1D helical modes, whereas a trivial insulator hosts none. In this work, we show that in the presence of even-fold rotation symmetry $C_n$, a 3D band insulator features a refined $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ classification of the flux response. Specifically, it can host two distinct types of helical flux-bound modes that are distinguished by their angular momentum. When both types of flux modes coexist, the system is not a strong topological insulator, but a $C_n$-protected topological crystalline insulator. Building on this result, we propose that flux-threaded nanowires of such topological phase provide a natural platform for realizing 1D crystalline topological superconductors with multiple $C_n$-protected Majorana modes.</description>

      <title>Proximity superconductivity in chiral kagome antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments on the chiral kagome antiferromagnet Mn$_3$Ge have provided strong evidence of proximity-induced spin-polarized superconductivity. We introduce and explore a minimal model which exhibits a rich phase diagram as a function of chemical potential and spin canting. We find a valley-singlet superconducting phase for chemical potentials and canting consistent with the experimental system. This phase transitions into a Chern insulator at larger canting and gives way to topological superconducting phases with Chern numbers ${\cal C}_{\rm BdG} = \pm 1, \pm 3$ at other chemical potentials. Our results show that proximity-induced superconductivity in kagome antiferromagnets is a promising route towards exotic superconductivity with spin-polarized Cooper pairs, with potential applications in spintronics.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic superconductivity with excitonic Cooper pairs: Application to $\Gamma$-valley twisted semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theory of ferromagnetic superconductivity that emerges upon doping a correlated ferromagnetic insulator through the condensation of excitonic Cooper pairs, which are charge-$2e$ bosonic quasiparticles made of Cooper pairs strongly hybridized with excitons. By solving a model of spin-polarized electrons using the strong-coupling expansion to the second order, we demonstrate the emergence of excitonic Cooper pairs from electron-hole fluctuations upon doping a strongly correlated insulator. We characterize their binding energy, effective mass, and the resulting superconducting transition temperature. We propose possible realization of spin-polarized superconductivity in twisted semiconductors with honeycomb moir\'e superlattice.</description>

      <title>Dynamical signatures and control of time-reversal breaking in twisted nodal superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations of time-reversal breaking superconductivity at twisted cuprate interfaces motivate the development of new approaches to better characterize this emergent phenomenon. Here we study the dynamical properties of the order parameters at the twisted unconventional superconductor interfaces. We reveal the emergence of a soft collective mode (Josephson plasmon) at the time-reversal breaking transition, which can be tuned by temperature, twist angle or magnetic field. Furthermore, nonlinear dynamical responses contain direct signatures of both the transition and the broken symmetry itself. In particular, we show that second harmonic generation is a necessary and sufficient signature of the symmetry breaking. Finally, we demonstrate that strong nonlinear driving induces dynamical phase transitions between phases with and without spontaneous symmetry breaking, introducing a tool for their out-of-equilibrium control. We discuss the signatures of our predictions in AC current-driven experiments on twisted Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ interfaces.</description>

      <title>Frequency dependence of temporal spin stiffness and short-range magnetic order in the doped two-dimensional Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study doping and temperature dependencies of temporal and spatial spin stiffnesses of the Hubbard model within the mean field approach for incommensurate magnetic order. We show that the frequency dependence of temporal spin stiffness within the considered mean-field approach is crucial to obtain small values of correlation length, comparable to those observed in cuprates. Using the obtained spin stiffnesses, we obtain the temperature and doping dependence of correlation length within the large-$N$ limit of the respective nonlinear sigma model. In agreement with the experimental data on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ we obtain short range magnetic order with relatively small correlation length at $0.1 \lesssim x\lesssim 0.2$, and magnetically ordered ground state in the narrow doping region $0.05\lesssim x \lesssim 0.1$. The latter state may correspond to the spin-frosen state, observed in the experimental data on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$.</description>
