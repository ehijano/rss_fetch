      <title>K\"ahler-Einstein metrics arising from micro-canonical measures and Hamiltonian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce new probabilistic and variational constructions of (twisted) K\"ahler-Einstein metrics on complex projective algebraic varieties, drawing inspiration from Onsager's statistical mechanical model of turbulence in two-dimensional incompressible fluids. The probabilistic construction involves microcanonical measures associated with the level sets of the pluricomplex energy, which give rise to maximum entropy principles. These, in turn, yield novel characterizations of K\"ahler-Einstein metrics, as well of Fano varieties admitting such metrics. Additionally, connections to Hamiltonian dynamics are uncovered, resulting in a new evolution equation, that generalizes both the 2D incompressible Euler equation and the 2D semi-geostrophic equation.</description>

      <title>The stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation on Jacobi structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jacobi structures are known to generalize Poisson structures, encompassing symplectic, cosymplectic, and Lie-Poisson manifolds. Notably, other intriguing geometric structures -- such as contact and locally conformal symplectic manifolds -- also admit Jacobi structures but do not belong to the Poisson category. In this paper, we employ global stochastic analysis techniques, initially developed by Meyer and Schwartz, to rigorously introduce stochastic Hamiltonian systems on Jacobi manifolds. We then propose a stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) framework as an alternative perspective on the underlying dynamics. We emphasize that many of our results extend the work of Bismut [Bis80, Bis81] and L\'azaro-Cam\'i \&amp; Ortega [LCO08, LCO09]. Furthermore, aspects of our geometric Hamilton-Jacobi theory in the stochastic setting draw inspiration from the deterministic contributions of Abraham \&amp; Marsden [AM78], de Le\'on \&amp; Sard\'on [dLS17], Esen et al. [EdLSZ21], and related literature.</description>

      <title>On mixed super quasi-Einstein manifolds with Ricci-Bourguignon solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper delves into the study of mixed super quasi-Einstein manifolds of dimension $n$ (for short, ${\rm M^{n}_{SQE}}$), focusing on their geometric and physical attributes. Initially, we explore several properties of ${\rm M^{n}_{SQE}}$, including conformal Ricci pseudosymmetry, Einstein's field equation, and the space-matter tensor. Subsequently, we characterize mixed super quasi-Einstein manifolds that admit Ricci-Bourguignon solitons. We establish that if the generator vector field is torse-forming, the manifold reduces to a pseudo generalized quasi-Einstein manifold, and we provide a detailed characterization of the eigenvalue problem associated with the symmetric tensor. To substantiate our findings, we construct an example to illustrate the existence of mixed super quasi-Einstein spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop analysis of H\"older continuous mappings with applications to geometry and topology of the Heisenberg groups. We cover the theory of distributional Jacobians of H\"older continuous mappings and pullbacks of differential forms under H\"older continuous mappings. That includes versions of the change of variables formula and the Stokes theorem for H\"older continuous mappings. The main applications are in the setting of the Heisenberg groups, where we provide a simple proof of a generalization of the Gromov non-embedding theorem, and new results about the H\"older homotopy groups of the Heisenberg groups.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose $(M^i_t)_{t\in [0,T)}$, $i=1,2$, are two mean curvature flows in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ encountering a multiplicity one compact singularity at time $T$, in such a manner that for every $k$, the Hausdorff distance between the two flows, $d_H$, satisfies $d_{H}(M^1_t,M^2_t)/(T-t)^k \rightarrow 0$. We demonstrate that $M^1_t=M^2_t$ for every $t$. This generalizes a result of Martin-Hagemayer and Sesum, who proved the case where $M^1_t$ is itself a self-similarly shrinking flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of para-Kaehler immersions in para-Kaehler space forms. As a consequence, we prove that, in general, a local para-Kaehler immersion cannot be globally extended, even if it is defined on a simply connected para-Kaehler manifold. Finally, we classify para-Kaehler immersions between para-Kaehler space forms.</description>

      <title>Disentanglement Learning via Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12696v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose TopDis (Topological Disentanglement), a method for learning disentangled representations via adding a multi-scale topological loss term. Disentanglement is a crucial property of data representations substantial for the explainability and robustness of deep learning models and a step towards high-level cognition. The state-of-the-art methods are based on VAE and encourage the joint distribution of latent variables to be factorized. We take a different perspective on disentanglement by analyzing topological properties of data manifolds. In particular, we optimize the topological similarity for data manifolds traversals. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first one to propose a differentiable topological loss for disentanglement learning. Our experiments have shown that the proposed TopDis loss improves disentanglement scores such as MIG, FactorVAE score, SAP score, and DCI disentanglement score with respect to state-of-the-art results while preserving the reconstruction quality. Our method works in an unsupervised manner, permitting us to apply it to problems without labeled factors of variation. The TopDis loss works even when factors of variation are correlated. Additionally, we show how to use the proposed topological loss to find disentangled directions in a trained GAN.</description>

      <title>Involutive scroll structures on solutions of 4D dispersionless integrable hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A rational normal scroll structure on an $(n+1)$-dimensional manifold $M$ is defined as a field of rational normal scrolls of degree $n-1$ in the projectivised cotangent bundle $\mathbb{P}T^*M$. We show that geometry of this kind naturally arises on solutions of various 4D dispersionless integrable hierarchies of heavenly type equations. In this context, rational normal scrolls coincide with the characteristic varieties (principal symbols) of the hierarchy. Furthermore, such structures automatically satisfy an additional property of involutivity. Our main result states that involutive scroll structures are themselves governed by a dispersionless integrable hierarchy, namely, the hierarchy of conformal self-duality equations.</description>

      <title>Betti number estimates for non-negatively curved graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish Betti number estimates for graphs with non-negative Ollivier curvature, and for graphs with non-negative Bakry-\'Emery curvature, providing a discrete analogue of a classical result by Bochner for manifolds. Specifically, we show that for graphs with non-negative Ollivier curvature, the first Betti number is bounded above by half of the minimum combinatorial vertex degree. In contrast, for graphs with non-negative Bakry-\'Emery curvature, we prove that the first Betti number of the path homology is bounded above by the minimum combinatorial vertex degree minus one. We further present various rigidity results, characterizing graphs that attain the upper bound on the first Betti number under non-negative Ollivier curvature. Remarkably, these graphs are precisely the discrete tori, similar to the Riemannian setting. Furthermore, we show that the results obtained using the Ollivier curvature extend to the setting of potentially non-reversible Markov chains. Additionally, we explore rigidity cases depending on the idleness parameter of the Ollivier curvature, i.e., we characterize rigidity for bone-idle graphs with non-negative Ollivier curvature that attain the upper Betti number bound. We further establish an upper bound on the first Betti number under a more general assumption, where non-negative Ollivier curvature is required only outside a finite subset. Finally, we provide several examples, e.g., we prove that for a potentially non-reversible Markov chain on a cycle of length at least five, there always exists a unique path metric with constant Ollivier curvature. Moreover, this metric has non-negative Ollivier curvature, and the upper Betti number bound is attained if and only if the curvature is zero.</description>

      <title>Curved Kakeya sets and Nikodym problems on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study curved Kakeya sets associated with phase functions satisfying Bourgain's condition. In particular, we show that the analysis of curved Kakeya sets arising from translation-invariant phase functions under Bourgain's condition, as well as Nikodym sets on manifolds with constant sectional curvature, can be reduced to the study of standard Kakeya sets in Euclidean space. Combined with the recent breakthrough of Wang and Zahl, our work establishes the Nikodym conjecture for three-dimensional manifolds with constant sectional curvature.
  Moreover, we consider $(d,k)$-Nikodym sets and $(s,t)$-Furstenberg sets on Riemannian manifolds. For manifolds with constant sectional curvature, we prove that these problems can similarly be reduced to their Euclidean counterparts. As a result, the Furstenberg conjecture on two-dimensional surfaces with constant Gaussian curvature follows from the work of Ren and Wang.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce a notion of tensor product of (twisted) quiver representations with relations in the category of $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules. As a first application of our notion, we see that tensor products of polystable quiver bundles are polystable and later we use this to both deduce a quiver version of the Segre embedding and to identify distinguished closed subschemes of $\text{GL}(n,\mathbb{C})$-character varieties of free abelian groups.</description>

Abstract: Using the Wodzicki residue, we build Wodzicki-Chern-Simons (WCS) classes in $H^{2k-1}(LM)$ associated to the residue Chern character on the loop space $LM$ of a Riemannian manifold $M^{2k-1}$. These WCS classes are associated to the $L^2$ connection and the Sobolev $s=1$ connections on $LM.$ The WCS classes detect several families of 5-manifolds whose isometry group has infinite fundamental group. These manifolds are the total spaces of the circle bundles associated to a multiple $p\omega, |p|\gg 0$, of the K\"ahler form $\omega$ over an integral K\"ahler surface.</description>

      <title>A normalized Ricci flow on surfaces with boundary towards the complete hyperbolic metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(\overline{M},g_0)$ be a $2$-D compact surface with boundary $\partial M$ and its interior $M$. We show that for a large class of initial and boundary data, the initial-boundary value problem of the normalized Ricci flow $(1.10)-(1.12)$, with prescribed geodesic curvature $\psi$ on $\partial M$, has a unique solution for all $t&gt;0$, and it converges to the complete hyperbolic metric locally uniformly in $M$. Here the natural condition that $\psi&gt;0$ causes the main difficulty in the a priori estimates in the corresponding initial-boundary problem $(1.15)-(1.17)$ of the parabolic equations, for which an auxiliary Cauchy-Dirichlet problem is introduced. We also provide examples of the boundary data $\psi$ which fits well with the natural asymptotic behavior of the geodesic curvature, but the solution to $(1.10)-(1.12)$ fails to converge to the complete hyperbolic metric.</description>

      <title>Partition functions of determinantal point processes on polarized K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic expansion of the partition functions of determinantal point processes defined on a polarized K\"ahler manifold. The full asymptotic expansion of the partition functions is derived in two ways: one using Bergman kernel asymptotics and the other using the Quillen anomaly formula along with the asymptotic expansion of the Ray-Singer analytic torsion. By combining these two expressions, we show that each coefficient is given by geometric functionals on K\"ahler metrics satisfying the cocycle identity, and its first variation is closely related to the asymptotic expansion of the Bergman kernel. In particular, these functionals naturally generalize the Mabuchi functional in K\"ahler geometry and the Liouville functional on Riemann surfaces. Furthermore, we show that a Futaki-type holomorphic invariant obstructs the existence of critical points for each geometric functional given by the coefficients of the asymptotic expansion. Finally, we verify some of our results through explicit computations, which hold without the polarization assumption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a survey about the contruction of warped products between (semi-)Riemannian manifolds and metric (measure) spaces. The resulting spaces will be semi-Riemannian manifolds, metric (measure) spaces or Lorentzian metric and metric measure spaces. We present details of the contruction in each case and we will highlight important properties like fiber independence and the energy equation. Warped products behave nicely in relation with curvature lower bounds. Here we will focus on sectional and Ricci curvature lower bounds and their Lorentzian counterparts. Throughout the article we provide many examples and formulate questions and conjectures.</description>

Abstract: In this work we establish a gradient bound and Liouville-type theorems for solutions to Quasi-linear elliptic equations on compact Riemannian Manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature. Also, we provide a local splitting theorem when the inequality in the gradient bound becomes equality at some point. Moreover, we prove a Harnack-type inequality and an ABP estimate for the gradient of solutions in domains contained in the manifold.</description>

      <title>Fully non-linear elliptic equations on complex manifolds</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a broad class of fully nonlinear elliptic equations on Hermitian manifolds. On one hand, under the optimal structural assumptions we derive $C^{2,\alpha}$-estimate for solutions of the equations on closed Hermitian manifolds. On the other hand, we treat the Dirichlet problem. In both cases, we prove the existence theorems with unbounded condition.</description>
