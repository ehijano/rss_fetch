      <title>Response to Comment from Robert Cousins on Confidence intervals for the Poisson distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robert Cousins has posted a comment on my manuscript on ``Confidence intervals for the Poisson distribution''. His key point is that one should not include in the likelihood non-physical parameter values, even for frequency statistics. This is my response, in which I contend that it can be useful to do so when discussing such descriptive statistics.</description>

      <title>Development of a new phase-retrieval algorithm from a single-shot image for X-ray schlieren microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a new phase-retrieval algorithm from an X-ray schlieren image is proposed. The schlieren method allows phase-contrast imaging with an objective lens and a knife-edge filter placed at the back focal plane of the objective. This method finds a wide range of applications in the visible-light region for transparent specimen visualization. The schlieren contrast does not directly correspond to the phase shift. However, the phase map can be reconstructed from a single-shot schlieren image of a transparent and weak-phase object using the filtered Fourier transform method. A proof-of-principle experiment was performed in the hard-X-ray region at the AR-NE1A beamline of the Photon Factory facility at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK).</description>

      <title>Inferring Mobility Reductions from COVID-19 Disease Spread along the Urban-Rural Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic reshaped human mobility through policy interventions and voluntary behavioral changes. Mobility adaptions helped mitigate pandemic spread, however our knowledge which environmental, social, and demographic factors helped mobility reduction and pandemic mitigation is patchy. We introduce a Bayesian hierarchical model to quantify heterogeneity in mobility responses across time and space in Germany's 400 districts using anonymized mobile phone data. Decomposing mobility into a disease-responsive component and disease-independent factors (temperature, school vacations, public holidays) allows us to quantify the impact of each factor. We find significant differences in reaction to disease spread along the urban-rural gradient, with large cities reducing mobility most strongly. Employment sectors further help explain variance in reaction strength during the first wave, while political variables gain significance during the second wave. However, reduced mobility only partially translates to lower peak incidence, indicating the influence of other hidden factors. Our results identify key drivers of mobility reductions and demonstrate that mobility behavior can serve as an operational proxy for population response.</description>

      <title>Citizen science dataset on residents' urban heat perception in outdoor public spaces of climate-vulnerable neighborhoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a dataset generated to investigate urban heat and thermal perception across five neighborhoods in the Barcelona metropolitan area. In collaboration with 14 non-academic partner organizations, we conducted a series of citizen science campaigns involving 439 residents as co-researchers engaged throughout all stages of the research process. Participants, residents of areas classified as highly or very highly climate-vulnerable, identified 210 public outdoor sites relevant to their daily lives. These locations were subsequently characterized using a range of spatial and environmental indicators pertinent to urban heat island effects, urban health, and climate resilience. Over the course of 48 thermal walks, participants carried portable, low-cost sensors that continuously recorded air temperature, relative humidity, and geolocation, resulting in 296,286 processed microclimatic data points. At pre-defined sites, individuals completed standardized surveys to report their Thermal Sensation Votes and Thermal Comfort Votes, yielding 5,169 self-reported entries. Sociodemographic data were also collected to further contextualize participants' responses. The resulting dataset integrates objective environmental measurements with subjective perceptions of heat, enabling point-by-point analysis of thermal experience within the urban fabric. It offers a novel, multi-dimensional resource to support research on heat, thermal inequality, and the experiential dimensions of climate vulnerability, and is intended to inform evidence-based decision-making in urban planning, public health, and climate adaptation.</description>

      <title>Bayesian MINFLUX localization microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MINFLUX microscopy allows for localization of fluorophores with nanometer precision using targeted scanning with an illumination profile with a minimum. However, current scanning patterns and the overall procedure are based on heuristics, and may therefore be suboptimal. Here we present a rigorous Bayesian that offers maximal resolutions from either minimal detected photons or minimal exposures. We estimate using simulated localization runs that this approach should reduce the number of photons required for 1 nm resolution by a factor of about four.</description>

      <title>UniFoil: A Universal Dataset of Airfoils in Transitional and Turbulent Regimes for Subsonic and Transonic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21124v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present UniFoil, a large publicly available universal airfoil dataset based on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations. It contains over 500,000 samples spanning a wide range of Reynolds and Mach numbers, capturing both transitional and fully turbulent flows across incompressible to compressible regimes. UniFoil is designed to support machine learning research in fluid dynamics, particularly for modeling complex aerodynamic phenomena. Most existing datasets are limited to incompressible, fully turbulent flows with smooth field characteristics, overlooking the critical physics of laminar\-turbulent transition and shock\-wave interactions\-features that exhibit strong nonlinearity and sharp gradients. UniFoil addresses this limitation by offering a broad spectrum of realistic flow conditions. Turbulent simulations utilize the Spalart\-Allmaras (SA) model, while transitional flows are modeled using an e^N\-based transition prediction method coupled with the SA model. The dataset includes a comprehensive geometry set comprising over 4,800 natural laminar flow (NLF) airfoils and 30,000 fully turbulent (FT) airfoils, covering a diverse range of airfoil designs relevant to aerospace, wind energy, and marine applications. This dataset is also valuable for scientific machine learning, enabling the development of data-driven models that more accurately capture the transport processes associated with laminar-turbulent transition. UniFoil is freely available under a permissive CC\-BY\-SA license.</description>

      <title>Approximating the universal thermal climate index using sparse regression with orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article explores novel data-driven modeling approaches for analyzing and approximating the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI), a physiologically-based metric integrating multiple atmospheric variables to assess thermal comfort. Given the nonlinear, multivariate structure of UTCI, we investigate symbolic and sparse regression techniques as tools for interpretable and efficient function approximation. In particular, we highlight the benefits of using orthogonal polynomial bases-such as Legendre polynomials-in sparse regression frameworks, demonstrating their advantages in stability, convergence, and hierarchical interpretability compared to standard polynomial expansions. We demonstrate that our models achieve significantly lower root-mean squared losses than the widely used sixth-degree polynomial benchmark-while using the same or fewer parameters. By leveraging Legendre polynomial bases, we construct models that efficiently populate a Pareto front of accuracy versus complexity and exhibit stable, hierarchical coefficient structures across varying model capacities. Training on just 20% of the data, our models generalize robustly to the remaining 80%, with consistent performance under bootstrapping. The decomposition effectively approximates the UTCI as a Fourier-like expansion in an orthogonal basis, yielding results near the theoretical optimum in the L2 (least squares) sense. We also connect these findings to the broader context of equation discovery in environmental modeling, referencing probabilistic grammar-based methods that enforce domain consistency and compactness in symbolic expressions. Taken together, these results illustrate how combining sparsity, orthogonality, and symbolic structure enables robust, interpretable modeling of complex environmental indices like UTCI - and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approximation in both accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Geometric Features of Higher-Order Networks via the Spectral Triplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our work is concerned with simplicial complexes that describe higher-order interactions in real complex systems. This description allows to go beyond the pairwise node-to-node representation that simple networks provide and to capture a hierarchy of interactions of different orders. The prime contribution of this work is the introduction of geometric measures for these simplicial complexes. We do so by noting the non-commutativity of the algebra associated with their matrix representations and consequently we bring to bear the spectral triplet formalism of Connes on these structures and then notions of associated dimensions, curvature, and distance can be computed to serve as characterizing features in addition to known topological metrics.</description>
