      <title>Perturbative bootstrap of the Wilson-line defect CFT: Multipoint correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the defect CFT associated with the half-BPS Wilson line in $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. Using a perturbative bootstrap approach, we derive new analytical results for multipoint correlators of protected defect operators at large $N$ and weak coupling. At next-to-next-to-leading order, we demonstrate that the simplest five- and six-point functions are fully determined by non-perturbative constraints -- which include superconformal symmetry, crossing symmetry, and the pinching of operators to lower-point functions -- as well as by a single integral, known as the train track integral. Additionally, we present new analytical results for the four-point functions $\langle 1122 \rangle$ and $\langle 1212 \rangle$.</description>

      <title>Perturbative bootstrap of the Wilson-line defect CFT: Bulk-defect-defect correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the correlators of bulk and defect half-BPS operators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory with a Maldacena-Wilson line defect, focusing on the case involving one bulk and two defect local operators. We analyze the non-perturbative constraints on these correlators, which include a topological sector, pinching and splitting limits, as well as a compatibility with expanding in superconformal blocks. Using these constraints, we compute a variety of bulk-defect-defect correlators up to next-to-leading order at weak coupling, and observe that transcendental terms cancel. Additionally, we study the two leading terms in the strong-coupling regime, and present partial results for the next-to-next-to-leading order.</description>

      <title>Unitarity through PT symmetry in Quantum Quadratic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theories described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians are known to possess strictly positive energy eigenvalues and exhibit unitary time evolution if the Hamiltonian is symmetric under discrete parity and time (PT) transformation. In this work, we demonstrate how quantum quadratic gravity, a theory that generally violates unitarity when viewed as a Hermitian quantum field theory, can be complex-deformed into such a PT-symmetric theory with an action that consists of a ghost-less Hermitian free part and non-Hermitian interactions. Paying special attention to the gauge symmetry present in the theory, we quantize in the covariant operator formalism after suggesting how the framework might be extended to the pseudo-Hermitian picture. We find compelling evidence that the resulting quantum theory possesses a unitary inner product and a sensible interpretation of quantum probability, thus avoiding the ghost problem present in the Hermitian formulation of quadratic gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a mixed-state generalization of the multi-entropy through the canonical purification, which we called reflected multi-entropy. We propose the holographic dual of this measure. For the tripartite case, a field-theoretical calculation is performed using a six-point function of twist operators at large $c$ limit. At both zero and finite temperature, the field-theoretical results match the holographic results exactly, supporting our holographic conjecture of this new measure.</description>

      <title>Classical Continuum Limit of the String Field Theory Dual to Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the classical continuum limit of the string field theory dual to the $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ lattice gauge theory and investigate various fundamental phenomena in the continuum theory at the mean-field level. Our construction of the continuum theory is based on the concept of {\it area derivative}, which can be regarded as a generalization of the ordinary derivative $\partial/\partial x^\mu$ to operators acting on functional fields $\phi[C]$ on the loop space. The resultant continuum theory has a $\mathbb{Z}_N^{}$ $1$-form global symmetry, which originates in the $\mathbb{Z}_N^{}$ center symmetry in the gauge theory. We find that the confined and deconfined phases of the gauge theory are identified by the unbroken and broken phases of the $\mathbb{Z}_N^{}$ symmetry respectively by showing the Area/Perimeter law of the classical solution. In the broken phase, the low-energy effective theory is described by a $\mathrm{BF}$-type topological field theory and has a emergent $\mathbb{Z}_N^{}$ $(D-2)$-form global symmetry. The existence of the emergent symmetry is deeply related to $(D-2)$-dimensional topological configurations (i.e. center vortex for $D=4$), and we explicitly construct such a topological defect in the continuum theory. Finally, we also comment on the upper and lower critical dimensions of the gauge theory/string field theory.</description>

      <title>Gauging generalised symmetries in linear gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of a free spin-2 field on Minkowski spacetime has 1-form and $(d-3)$-form symmetries associated with conserved currents formed by contractions of the linearised Riemann tensor with conformal Killing-Yano 2-forms. We show that a subset of these can be interpreted as Noether currents for specific shift symmetries of the graviton that involve a Killing vector and a closed 1-form parameter. We give a systematic method to gauge these 1-form symmetries by coupling the currents to background gauge fields and introducing a particular set of counter-terms involving the background fields. The simultaneous gauging of certain pairs of 1-form and $(d-3)$-form symmetries is obstructed by the presence of mixed 't Hooft anomalies. The anomalous pairs of symmetries are those which are related by gravitational duality. The implications of these anomalies are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute analytically greybody factors for asymptotically flat spherically symmetric black holes with stringy higher derivative corrections in d dimensions in the high frequency limit. Our calculations include both the eikonal limit - where the real part of the frequency of the scattered wave is much larger than the imaginary part - and the highly damped case - where the imaginary part of the frequency is much larger than the real part -, addressing the emission of gravitons and test scalar fields, and yielding full transmission and reflection scattering coefficients.</description>

      <title>No-Boundary State for Klein Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytic continuation from $(3,1)$ signature Minkowski to $(2,2)$ signature Klein space has emerged as a useful tool for the understanding of scattering amplitudes and flat space holography. Under this continuation, past and future null infinity merge into a single boundary ($\mathcal{J}$) which is the product of a null line with a $(1,1)$ signature torus. The Minkowskian $\mathcal{S}$-matrix continues to a Kleinian $\mathcal{S}$-vector which in turn may be represented by a Poincar\'e-invariant vacuum state $|\mathcal{C}\rangle$ in the Hilbert space built on $\mathcal{J}$. $|\mathcal{C} \rangle$ contains all information about $\mathcal{S}$ in a novel, repackaged form. We give an explicit construction of $|\mathcal{C}\rangle$ in a Lorentz/conformal basis for a free massless scalar. $\mathcal{J}$ separates into two halves $\mathcal{J}_\pm $ which are the asymptotic null boundaries of the regions timelike and spacelike separated from the origin. $|\mathcal{C}\rangle$ is shown to be a maximally entangled state in the product of the $\mathcal{J}_\pm $ Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Regge trajectories and bridges between them in integrable AdS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the analytic continuation in the spin of the planar spectrum of ABJM theory using the integrability-based Quantum Spectral Curve (QSC) method. Under some minimal assumptions, we classify the analytic properties of the Q functions appearing in the QSC compatible with the spin being non-integer. In this way we find not one - but two distinct possibilities. These two choices correspond to a discrete symmetry of the web of Regge trajectories under a spin shadow transformation: a symmetry which, to the best of our knowledge, had not been discussed before for the Chew-Frautschi plot. Under this symmetry, which we refer to as ``twist/co-twist symmetry'', a Regge trajectory is flipped into a ``bridge'', which connects leading with sub-leading Regge trajectories. Zigzagging between trajectories and bridges one can reach infinitely many real sheets of the spin Riemann surface without needing to go explicitly around the branch points located in the complex spin plane. We discuss how a very similar and previously unnoticed phenomenon occurs in $\mathcal{N}$=4 SYM. We present numerical results for Regge trajectories in ABJM theory at finite coupling, in particular we compute exactly the coupling dependence of the position of the leading Regge pole in the correlator of four stress tensors. The shape of this leading trajectory shows a behaviour at weak coupling that strongly resembles the BFKL limit in $\mathcal{N}$=4 SYM.</description>

      <title>Horizon causality from holographic scattering in asymptotically dS$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the AdS/CFT correspondence, direct scattering in the bulk may not have a local boundary analog. A nonlocal implementation on the boundary requires $O(1/G_N)$ mutual information. This statement is formalized by the connected wedge theorem, which can be proven using general relativity within AdS$_3$ but also by applying quantum information theory on the boundary, suggesting that the theorem applies to any holographic duality. We examine scattering within the static patch of asymptotically dS$_3$ spacetime, which is conjectured to be described by a quantum theory on the stretched horizon in static patch holography. We prove that causality on the horizon should be induced from null infinities $\mathcal{I}^{\pm}$ to maintain consistency with the theorem. Specifically, signals propagating in the static patch are associated with local operators at $\mathcal{I}^{\pm}$. Our results suggest a novel connection between static patch holography and the dS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>Second-order cosmological perturbations produced by scalar-scalar coupling during inflation stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08261v5 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the perturbations up to the 2nd-order for a power-law inflation driven by a scalar field in synchronous coordinates. We present the 1st-order solutions, and analytically solve the 2nd-order perturbed Einstein equation and scalar field equation, give the 2nd-order solutions for all the scalar, vector, and tensor metric perturbations, as well as the perturbed scalar field. During inflation, the 1st-order tensor perturbation is a wave and is decoupled from other perturbations, the scalar metric perturbation and the perturbed scalar field are coupled waves, propagating at the speed of light, differing from those in the dust and relativistic fluid models. The 1st-order vector perturbation is not wave and just decreases during inflation. The 2nd-order perturbed Einstein equation is similar in structure to the 1st-order one, but various products of the 1st-order perturbations occur as the effective source, among which the scalar-scalar coupling is considered in this paper. The solutions of all the 2nd-order perturbations consist of a homogeneous part similar to the 1st-order solutions, and an inhomogeneous part in a form of integrations of the effective source. The 2nd-order vector perturbation is also a wave since the effective source is composed of the 1st-order waves. We perform the residual gauge transformations between synchronous coordinates up to the 2nd-order, and identify the 1st-order and 2nd-order gauge modes.</description>

      <title>Absorption, Scattering, Geodesics, Shadows and Lensing Phenomena of Black Holes in Effective Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the signatures of black holes within an effective quantum gravity framework recently proposed in the literature [1] . We begin by outlining the general setup, highlighting the two distinct models under consideration. This includes a discussion of their general properties, interpretations, and the structure of the event and inner horizons. We then examine the behavior of light in this context, analyzing geodesics, the photon sphere, and shadow formation. To validate our results, we estimate lower bounds for the shadow radius based on observational data from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Subsequently, we derive the partial radial wave equation for scalar perturbations, enabling us to study the absorption cross section in both low and high frequency regimes. Additionally, we evaluate the greybody factors and provide bounds for both bosonic and fermionic fields. Finally, we present a detailed analysis of gravitational lensing in both the weak and strong deflection limits. For the weak deflection regime, the Gauss Bonnet theorem is employed, while for the strong deflection limit, the Tsukamoto approach is utilized.</description>

      <title>Multi wavefunction overlap and multi entropy for topological ground states in (2+1) dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-wavefunction overlaps -- generalizations of the quantum mechanical inner product for more than two quantum many-body states -- are valuable tools for studying many-body physics. In this paper, we investigate the multi-wavefunction overlap of (2+1)-dimensional gapped ground states, focusing particularly on symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states. We demonstrate how these overlaps can be calculated using the bulk-boundary correspondence and (1+1)-dimensional edge theories, specifically conformal field theory. When applied to SPT phases, we show that the topological invariants, which can be thought of as discrete higher Berry phases, can be extracted from the multi-wavefunction overlap of four ground states with appropriate symmetry actions. Additionally, we find that the multi-wavefunction overlap can be expressed in terms of the realignment of reduced density matrices. Furthermore, we illustrate that the same technique can be used to evaluate the multi-entropy -- a quantum information theoretical quantity associated with multi-partition of many-body quantum states -- for (2+1)-dimensional gapped ground states. Combined with numerics, we show that the difference between multi-entropy for tripartition and second R\'enyi entropies is bounded from below by $(c_{{\it tot}}/4)\ln 2$ where $c_{{\it tot}}$ is the central charge of ungappable degrees of freedom. To calculate multi-entropy numerically for free fermion systems (such as Chern insulators), we develop the correlator method for multi-entropy.</description>

      <title>Casimir effect in Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a Josephson junction, the supercurrent is determined by both the discrete sub-gap part of the spectrum due to Andreev bound states and the continuous part of the spectrum from energy states outside the superconducting gap. We consider the cohesive force exerted on a junction, which is thermodynamically conjugated to the superflow, and comment on its connection to the Casimir effect in quantum electrodynamics. In contrast to the supercurrent, it is shown that in ballistic short junctions, the force is predominantly contributed by the continuum. Its magnitude is universally defined by the energy gap and coherence length of the superconductor per spin-dependent transverse mode. This force scales non-analytically with the junction length and is periodic with the superconducting phase. For long ballistic junctions, the force results from the interplay of oscillatory contributions originating from both bound states and the continuum. The resulting asymptotic limit for the force is established, including the correction terms. Thermal and impurity effects on the force are briefly discussed.</description>

Abstract: Exactly solvable (spinless) lattice fermions with wide range interactions are constructed explicitly based on {\em exactly solvable stationary and reversible Markov chains} $\mathcal{K}^R$ reported a few years earlier by Odake and myself. The reversibility of $\mathcal{K}^R$ with the stationary distribution $\pi$ leads to a positive classical Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}^R$. The exact solvability of $\mathcal{H}^R$ warrants that of a spinless lattice fermion $c_x$, $c_x^\dagger$, $\mathcal{H}^R_f=\sum_{x,y\in\mathcal{X}}c_x^\dagger\mathcal{H}^R(x,y) c_y$ based on the principle advocated recently by myself. The reversible Markov chains $\mathcal{K}^R$ are constructed by convolutions of the orthogonality measures of the discrete orthogonal polynomials of Askey scheme. Several explicit examples of the fermion systems with wide range interactions are presented.</description>

      <title>Probing deviations to Kerr geometry with extreme mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the primary research aims of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission is to comprehensively map the Kerr spacetime, a fundamental pursuit in the realm of general relativity. To achieve this goal, it is essential to develop precise tools capable of discerning any deviations from the Kerr geometry. Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) stand out as particularly promising sources for probing the spacetime metric, offering profound insights into gravitational phenomena. In this direction, we analyze a deformed Kerr geometry, being the central source of an EMRI system, with an inspiralling object that exhibits eccentric equatorial motion. We conduct a leading-order post-Newtonian analysis and examine the deviations in gravitational wave flux and phase with their leading-order contributions. Our findings evaluate the detectability of these deviations through gravitational wave dephasing and mismatch, highlighting the pivotal role of LISA observations in advancing our understanding of spacetime geometry.</description>

      <title>Validity of black hole complementarity in an accelerating Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black hole complementarity has been well understood in spherically symmetric black holes. To study its validity for an accelerating Schwarzschild black hole, which has a preferred direction, we perform the thought experiment proposed by Susskind and Thorlacius and further investigate the criteria set by Hayden and Preskill. First, we derive thermodynamic quantities that satisfy the first law of thermodynamics. Using these quantities, we conduct thought experiments based on the Page time and the scrambling time, which show that black hole complementarity remains valid, although the energy required for the duplication of information depends on the angle due to the axisymmetric metric.</description>

      <title>Tracing the nonlinear formation of an interfacial wave spectral cascade from one to few to many</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Far-from-equilibrium phenomena unveil the intricate principles of complex systems, including snowflake growth and fluid turbulence, with broad applications ranging from foreign exchange trading to climate modeling. A recurring feature across these systems is the emergence of a spectral cascade, where energy is transferred across the system's length scales, following a simple power law. The statistical theory of weak wave turbulence, in which only leading order interactions are considered, successfully predicts scaling laws for stationary states in idealised scenarios. Realistic conditions, such as finite size and amplitude effects, and strong dissipation, remain beyond our current understanding. Lacking comprehensive theoretical insight, we experimentally trace the formation of a spectral cascade under these conditions. Using an externally driven fluid-fluid interface, we successfully resolve individual wave modes and track their real-time evolution from one to few to many. This process culminates in a steady state whose power spectral density is fully characterised by a power-law scaling. We further quantify specific interactions through statistical correlations to reveal a hierarchy in the wave-mixing order, thus confirming a key assumption of weak-wave turbulence. We present a comprehensive time-evolution analysis that is crucial in identifying critical points where the interface undergoes significant changes. Our findings validate that the interfacial dynamics can be effectively modelled using a weakly nonlinear Lagrangian theory, enabling us to explore its applicability to other out-of-equilibrium systems. Notably, we uncover intriguing connections to reheating scenarios following cosmic inflation in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Connecting quasi-normal modes with causality in Lovelock theories of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eikonal correspondence between the quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of asymptotically flat static spherically symmetric black holes and the properties of unstable null circular geodesics is studied in the case of higher dimensional Lovelock black holes (BHs). It is known that such correspondence does not generically hold for gravitational QNMs associated with BHs in Lovelock theories. In the present work, we revisit this correspondence and establish the relationship between the eikonal QNMs and the causal properties of the gravitational field equations in Lovelock theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>Precessions of spherical orbits in the rotating Melvin black hole spacetime and its constraints from the jet of M87*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate precessions of spherical orbits of timelike particles in the background of a rotating black hole immersed in the Melvin magnetic field, and probe effects of the magnetic field on the precession period. Our results show that effects of the magnetic field on the particles' motions gradually decrease with the titled angle and finally vanish as the titled angle tends to $\pi/2$. With the increase of the magnetic field parameter, we find that the precession becomes rapidly. Modelling the spherical orbit to the warp radius in the accretion disk and with the observed precession period from the jet of M87*, we analyze the allowed regions of the black hole parameters and the warp radius in the accretion disk. Especially, we find a novel degenerated phenomenon of precession periods arising from magnetic field for two different spherical orbits, which does not appear in the usual Kerr black hole case. Moreover, we also discuss the possibility of observing effects of the magnetic field on the precession periods of jets for astrophysical black holes. Our study could help to further understand the rotating Melvin black hole and the relationship between magnetic fields and precessions of jets.</description>

      <title>Prospects for sub-EW ALP searches via $\gamma+b\bar{b}$ signatures at the LHC using jet substructure techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current Large Hadron Collider (LHC) data show no clear indication of new physics and only incremental improvements are anticipated at the energy frontier in the near future. However, while the focus of the LHC has been on constraining TeV scale physics, new particles could still be hiding below the electroweak scale. In order to obtain sensitivity to a new light boson with couplings to SM fermions, a potentially promising decay channel, for resonances with mass $\gtrsim {\cal O}(10)$ GeV, would be the decay to $b\bar b$ pairs. The measurement of such signatures is challenging due to the trigger requirements at the LHC. In this work, we explore the LHC sensitivity to a light pseudoscalar, or axion-like particle (ALP), in the $b\bar{b}$ final state with an associated photon, using jet substructure techniques, in the mass range between 10 GeV and 100 GeV. We obtain projected exclusions on the ALP-fermion coupling in a region of phase space which has not so far been probed by direct searches. We further discuss the impact that lower trigger thresholds may have on the LHC reach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1803.06164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I show that holographic calculations of entanglement entropy in the context of AdS bulk space modified by wormhole geometries provide the expected entanglement magnitude. This arises in the context of string theory by means of additional geometric structure that is seen by the string in its bulk evolution. The process can be described as a net entanglement flow towards stringy geometry. I make use of the fact that as opposed to quantum field theory, strings have additional winding mode states around small extra dimensions which modify the area computation given by the standard application of the Ryu-Takayanagi entanglement entropy formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the second and final part of ``Topological twists of massive SQCD''. Part I is available at arXiv:2206.08943. In this second part, we evaluate the contribution of the Coulomb branch to topological path integrals for $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric QCD with $N_f\leq 3$ massive hypermultiplets on compact four-manifolds. Our analysis includes the decoupling of hypermultiplets, the massless limit and the merging of mutually non-local singularities at the Argyres-Douglas points. We give explicit mass expansions for the four-manifolds $\mathbb{P}^2$ and $K3$. For $\mathbb{P}^2$, we find that the correlation functions are polynomial as function of the masses, while infinite series and (potential) singularities occur for $K3$. The mass dependence corresponds mathematically to the integration of the equivariant Chern class of the matter bundle over the moduli space of $Q$-fixed equations. We demonstrate that the physical partition functions agree with mathematical results on Segre numbers of instanton moduli spaces.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Scalar Field as a Possible Candidate for Phantom Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a single pseudo-scalar (PS) field in the mathematically backed and parity preserving modifications of the standard St${\ddot u}$ckelberg formalism (SSF) in the context of the Lagrangian formulation of the (i) two (1 + 1)-dimensional (2D) massive Abelian 1-form gauge theory, (ii) three (2 + 1)-dimensional (3D) massive Abelian 2-form gauge theory, and (iii) four (3 + 1)-dimensional (4D) massive Abelian 3-form gauge theory. This PS field always turns-up with the (i) negative kinetic term, and (ii) higher order derivative terms. The latter terms are rendered into the well-defined terms due to the imposition of the on-shell condition for the PS field which is derived from the properly gauge-fixed Lagrangian densities for the above theories. These Lagrangian densities incorporate into themselves the (i) PS field with the negative kinetic term, and (ii) pure scalar field with the positive kinetic term. However, both these fields satisfy the Klein-Gordon (KG) equation of motion. The PS field (having the negative kinetic term and a well-defined mass) is one of the possible candidates for the ``phantom'' field which plays a crucial role in the cyclic, bouncing and self-accelerated cosmological models of the Universe. The ``exotic'' PS field also satisfies one of the criteria for being a possible candidate for dark matter</description>

Abstract: We employ holography to calculate the quantum complexity of $T\bar{T}$-deformation, utilizing the complexity equals volume (CV) and the complexity equals action (CA) proposals within the bulk spacetime with a finite radius cutoff. We find that the complexity of the deformed theory differs from the renormalized complexity of the original theory by a geometric functional: the bending (Willmore) energy of the time-constant slice of the base manifold. We use this result to propose an unambiguous scheme for calculating holographic quantum complexity through the CA proposal.</description>

      <title>Remote Hawking-Moss instanton and the Lorentzian path integral</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hawking-Moss (HM) bounce solution implies that the tunneling amplitude between vacua is uniquely determined by the vacuum energy at the initial vacuum and the top of a potential barrier, regardless of the field distance between them $\Delta \phi$. This implausible conclusion was carefully discussed in [E. J. Weinberg, Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 251303, (2007)], and it was concluded that the conventional HM amplitude is not reliable for a transition to the top of distant local maxima (hereinafter referred to as the remote HM transition). We revisit this issue and study the impact of the quantum tunneling effect on the remote HM transition. We demonstrate that the amplitude for such a distant transition is indeed smaller than the conventional HM amplitude by employing the Lorentzian path integral in a simple setup. We consider a linear potential, which allows for analytic treatments, and evaluate the up-tunneling probability of a homogeneous scalar field in de Sitter spacetime. The Picard-Lefschetz theory is employed to identify the relevant Lefschetz thimble, representing the relevant tunneling trajectory. We then compare the resulting transition amplitude with the conventional HM amplitude. We find that when the field separation $|\Delta \phi|$ is larger, the quantum-tunneling amplitude, estimated by our Lorentzian path integral, is smaller than that of the conventional HM amplitude. This implies that the transition amplitude may be significantly suppressed if the thermal interpretation is not applicable and the quantum-tunneling effect is dominant for the remote HM transition.</description>

Abstract: For the first time, we investigate the non-perturbative dynamics of single field inflation with a departure from slow-roll. Using simulations, we find that oscillatory features in the potential can drastically alter the course of inflation, with major phenomenological implications. In certain cases, the entire Universe gets trapped in a forever inflating de Sitter state. In others, only some regions get stuck in a false vacuum, offering an alternative channel for primordial black hole formation. Analogous to the flap of a butterfly, these results show that small-scale phenomena can have profound consequences on the evolution of the entire Universe. This demonstrates the necessity of a non-perturbative approach in the exploration of the small-scale physics of inflation, particularly in the regime relevant for gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Gauged Gaussian PEPS -- A High Dimensional Tensor Network Formulation for Lattice Gauge Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gauge theories form the basis of our understanding of modern physics - ranging from the description of quarks and gluons to effective models in condensed matter physics. In the non-perturbative regime, gauge theories are conventionally treated discretely as lattice gauge theories. The resulting systems are evaluated with path-integral based Monte Carlo methods. These methods, however, can suffer from the sign problem and do not allow for a direct evaluation of real-time dynamics. In this work, we present a unified and comprehensive framework for gauged Gaussian Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), a variational ansatz based on tensor networks. We review the construction of Hamiltonian lattice gauge theories, explain their similarities with PEPS, and detail the construction of the state. The estimation of ground states is based on a variational Monte Carlo procedure with the PEPS as an ansatz state. This sign-problem-free ansatz can be efficiently evaluated in any dimension with arbitrary gauge groups, and can include dynamical fermionic matter, suggesting new options for the simulation of non-perturbative regimes of gauge theories, including QCD.</description>

Abstract: We explore the possibility of traversable wormhole formation in the dark matter halos in the context of $f(Q)$ gravity. We obtain the exact wormhole solutions with anisotropic matter source based on the Bose-Einstein condensate, Navarro-Frenk-White, and pseudo-isothermal matter density profiles. Notably, we present a novel wormhole solution supported by these dark matters using the expressions for the density profile and rotational velocity along with the modified field equations to calculate the redshift and shape functions of the wormholes. With a particular set of parameters, we demonstrate that our proposed wormhole solutions fulfill the flare-out condition against an asymptotic background. Additionally, we examine the energy conditions, focusing on the null energy conditions at the wormhole's throat, providing a graphical representation of the feasible and negative regions. Our study also examines the wormhole's shadow in the presence of various dark matter models, revealing that higher central densities result in a shadow closer to the throat, whereas lower values have the opposite effect. Moreover, we explore the deflection of light when it encounters these wormholes, particularly noting that light deflection approaches infinity at the throat, where the gravitational field is extremely strong.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we base our analysis on the assumption that the existence of a photon sphere is an intrinsic feature of any ultra-compact gravitational structure with spherical symmetry. Utilizing the concept of a topological photon sphere, we categorize the behaviors of various gravitational models based on the structure of their photon spheres. This innovative approach enables us to define boundaries for black hole parameters, subsequently allowing us to classify the model as either a black hole or a naked singularity. Indeed, we will demonstrate that the presence of this interplay between the gravitational structure and the existence of a photon sphere is a unique advantage that can be utilized from both perspectives. Our observations indicate that a gravitational model typically exhibits the behavior of a horizonless structure (or a naked singularity) when a minimum effective potential (a stable photon sphere) appears within the studied spacetime region. Additionally, in this study, we tried to investigate the effect of this structure on the behavior of the photon sphere by choosing models that are affected by the Perfect Fluid Dark Matter (PFDM). Finally, by analyzing a model with multiple event horizons, we show that the proposed method remains applicable even in such scenarios.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04684v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how out-of-equilibrium states thermalize under quantum unitary dynamics is an important problem in many-body physics. In this work, we propose a statistical ansatz for the matrix elements of non-equilibrium initial states in the energy eigenbasis, in order to describe such evolution. The approach is inspired by the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis (ETH) but the proposed ansatz exhibits different scaling. Importantly, we point out the exponentially small cross-correlations between the observable and the initial state matrix elements that determine relaxation dynamics toward equilibrium. We numerically verify scaling and cross-correlation, point out the emergent universality of the high-frequency behavior, and outline possible generalizations.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of a Non-canonical $f(\bar{R},\bar{T})$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work comprises a study of the thermodynamic behavior of modified $f(\bar{R},\bar{T})$ gravity, which had been developed based on a non-canonical theory known as K-essence theory. In this development, we use the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) type of non-standard Lagrangian. We develop a modified first law and generalized second law of thermodynamics (GSLT) within the modified $f(\bar{R},\bar{T})$ gravity, where we consider the background metric to be the usual Friedmann-Lema$\hat{\text{i}}$tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) type. A graphical analysis of surface gravity has been performed for the modified FLRW metric via the $f(\bar{R},\bar{T})$ theory, which is different from the usual FLRW gravity through the usual $f(R,T)$ gravity. Exponential and power law scale factors are used to analyze cosmic surface gravity. Through the investigation of the modified GSLT, using the relation of scale factor with the scalar field, we have seen that during the initial phase of the universe, the entropy's rate of change may be either negative or positive, contingent upon the value of the curvature constant. The negativity of the entropy change indicates that the modified GSLT is not feasible in that particular area for a particular curvature constant. These traits suggest that during the inflationary period, entropy might have been either negative or positive. It has also been seen that entropy saturates every curvature value at different time ranges, which indicates the heat death of the universe.</description>

      <title>Cosmological collider non-Gaussianity from multiple scalars and $R^2$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological collider signals of primordial non-Gaussianity arise at tree level when an extra scalar has Hubble mass during inflation. We critically review the formalism finding that a large class of inflationary theories, based on Planck-scale physics, predict a scalar bi-spectrum around the gravitational floor level. This mild signal arises for example in $R^2$ gravity, in the regime where its gravitational scalar has Hubble-scale mass. Signals much above the gravitational floor arise in theories where scalars undergo multiple turns during inflation, thanks to sub-Planckian physics.</description>

      <title>Local superconformal algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a supermanifold equipped with an odd distribution of maximal dimension and constant symbol, we construct the formal moduli problem of deformations of the distribution. This moduli problem is described by a local super dg Lie algebra that provides both a resolution of the structure-preserving vector fields on superspace and a derived enhancement of superconformal symmetry. Applying our construction in standard physical examples returns the conformal supergravity multiplet in every known example, in any dimension and with any amount of supersymmetry$\unicode{x2014}$whether or not a superconformal algebra exists. We discuss new examples related to twisted supergravity, higher Virasoro algebras, and exceptional super Lie algebras. The compatibility of our techniques with twisting also leads to a computation of every twist of the stress tensor multiplet of a superconformal theory, including universal operator product expansions. Our approach uses a derived model for the space of functions constant along the distribution, which is applicable even when the distribution is non-involutive; we construct other natural multiplets, such as K\"ahler differentials, that appear naturally through this lens on superspace geometry.</description>
