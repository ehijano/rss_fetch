      <title>Enumeration of polyhedra with triangular and hexagonal faces and three faces around each vertex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an exact count of the number of trivalent graphs whose faces all have 3 or 6 sides, or equivalently, the number of polyhedra with triangular and hexagonal faces and three faces around each vertex. The count is given in terms of the prime factorization of the number of vertices. We also enumerate graphs of this type with mirror symmetry, with 3-fold rotational symmetry, and with both types of symmetry.</description>

      <title>Refined enumeration of two-rowed set-valued standard tableaux via two-coloured Motzkin paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive formulae for the number of set-valued standard tableaux of two-rowed shapes, keeping track of the total number of entries, the number of entries in the first row, and the number of entries in the second row. Key in the proofs is a bijection with two-coloured Motzkin paths followed by generating function computations and coefficient extraction helped by the Lagrange inversion formula.</description>

      <title>New results of Bollob\'{a}s-type theorem for affine subspaces and projective subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bollob\'{a}s-type theorem has received a lot of attention due to its application in graph theory. In 2015, G\'{a}bor Heged{\"u}s gave an upper bound of bollob\'{a}s-type affine subspace families for $q\neq 2$, and constructed an almost sharp affine subspaces pair families. In this note, we prove a new upper bound for bollob\'{a}s-type affine subspaces without the requirement of $q\neq 2$, and construct a pair of families of affine subspaces, which shows that our upper bound is sharp. We also give an upper bound for bollob\'{a}s-type projective subspaces, and prove that the Heged{\"u}s's conjecture holds when $q=2$.</description>

      <title>Monochromatic graph decompositions and monochromatic piercing inspired by anti-Ramsey colorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anti-Ramsey theory was initiated in 1975 by Erd\H{o}s, Simonovits and S\'os, inspiring hundreds of publications since then. The present work is the third and last piece of our trilogy in which we introduce a far-reaching generalization via the following two functions for any graph $G$ and family ${\cal F}$ of graphs:
  If $K_2 \in {\cal F}$, let $f(n,G|{\cal F})$ be the smallest integer $k$ such that every edge coloring of $K_n$ with at least $k$ colors forces a copy of $G$ in which all color classes are members of ${\cal F}$.
  If $K_2 \notin {\cal F}$, let $g(n,G|{\cal F})$ be the largest integer $k$ for which there exists an edge coloring of $K_n$ using exactly $k$ colors, such that every copy of $G$ contains an induced color class which is a member of ${\cal F}$.
  We develop methods suitable for deriving asymptotically tight results for the $f$-function and the $g$-function for many combinations of $G$ and ${\cal F}$.
  The preceding parts of the trilogy are arXiv: 2405.19812 and 2408.04257, published in Discrete Applied Math. Vol. 363 and Mathematics Vol. 12:23, respectively.</description>

      <title>Obstructions and dualities for matroid depth parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contraction$^*$-depth is considered to be one of the analogues of graph tree-depth in the matroid setting. In this paper, we investigate structural properties of contraction$^*$-depth of matroids representable over finite fields and rationals. In particular, we prove that the obstructions for contraction$^*$-depth for these classes of matroids are bounded in size. From this we derive analogous results for related notions of contraction-depth and deletion-depth. Moreover, we define a dual notion to contraction$^*$-depth, named deletion$^*$-depth, for $\mathbb{F}$-representable matroids, and by duality extend our results from contraction$^*$-depth to this notion.</description>

      <title>A class of weighted Delannoy numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weighted Delannoy numbers are defined by the recurrence relation $f_{m,n}=\alpha f_{m-1,n}+ \beta f_{m,n-1}+ \gamma f_{m-1,n-1}$ if $m n&gt;0 $, with $f_{m,n}=\alpha^m \beta^n$ if $n m=0$. In this work, we study a generalization of these numbers considering the same recurrence relation but with $f_{m,n}=A^m B^n$ if $n m=0$. More particularly, we focus on the diagonal sequence $f_{n,n}$. With some ingenuity, we are able to make use of well-established methods by Pemantle and Wilson, and by Melczer in order to determine its asymptotic behavior in the case $A,B,\alpha,\beta,\gamma\geq 0$. In addition, we also study its P-recursivity with the help of symbolic computation tools.</description>

      <title>Ramsey-like theorems for the Schreier barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The family of finite subsets $s$ of the natural numbers such that $|s|=1+\min s$ is known as the Schreier barrier in combinatorics and Banach Space theory, and as the family of exactly $\omega$-large sets in Logic. We formulate and prove the generalizations of Friedman's Free Set and Thin Set theorems and of Rainbow Ramsey's theorem to colorings of the Schreier barrier. We analyze the strength of these theorems from the point of view of Computability Theory and Reverse Mathematics. Surprisingly, the exactly $\omega$-large counterparts of the Thin Set and Free Set theorems can code $\emptyset^{(\omega)}$, while the exactly $\omega$-large Rainbow Ramsey theorem does not code the halting set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the lengths and starting positions of the longest monochromatic arithmetic progressions for a fixed difference in the Fibonacci word. We provide a complete classification for their lengths in terms of a simple formula. Our strongest results are proved using methods from dynamical systems, especially the dynamics of circle rotations. We also employ computer-based methods in the form of the automatic theorem-proving software Walnut. This allows us to extend recent results concerning similar questions for the Thue-Morse sequence and the Rudin-Shapiro sequence. This also allows us to obtain some results for the Fibonacci word that do not seem to be amenable to dynamical methods.</description>

      <title>Universal geometric non-embedding of random regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Delta \ge 3$ be fixed, $n \ge n_\Delta$ be a large integer. It is a classical result that $\Delta$--regular expanders on $n$ vertices are not embeddable as geometric (distance) graphs into Euclidean space of dimension less than $c \log n$, for some universal constant $c$. We show that for typical $\Delta$-regular graphs, this obstruction is universal with respect to the choice of norm. More precisely, for a uniform random $\Delta$-regular graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, it holds with high probability: there is no normed space of dimension less than $c\log n$ which admits a geometric graph isomorphic to $G$. The proof is based on a seeded multiscale $\varepsilon$--net argument.</description>

      <title>Block Designs and K-Geodetic Graphs: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: K-geodetic graphs (K capital) are defined as graphs in which each pair of nonadjacent vertices has at most K paths of minimum length between them. A K-geodetic graph is geodetic if K=1, bigeodetic if K=2 and trigeodetic if K=3. K-geodetic graphs are applied effectively to the solution of several practical problems in distinct areas of computer science, hence the importance of their study. Four problems are central to the study of K-geodetic graphs, namely, characterization, construction, enumeration and classification. The problems of finding the general classification of K-geodetic graphs for each of their classes K=1,2,3 are open. The present paper is a survey dedicated to the construction of K-geodetic graphs for K=1,2,3 using balanced incomplete block designs (BIBDs). To this purpose, we use block designs as combinatorial structures defined in terms of completely predetermined parameters, which is essential for the easy construction of the K-geodetic graphs described in this survey.</description>

      <title>Predicting the depth of the most recent common ancestor of a random sample of $k$ species: the impact of phylogenetic tree shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the following question: how close to the ancestral root of a phylogenetic tree is the most recent common ancestor of $k$ species randomly sampled from the tips of the tree? For trees having shapes predicted by the Yule-Harding model, it is known that the most recent common ancestor is likely to be close to (or equal to) the root of the full tree, even as $n$ becomes large (for $k$ fixed). However, this result does not extend to models of tree shape that more closely describe phylogenies encountered in evolutionary biology. We investigate the impact of tree shape (via the Aldous $\beta-$splitting model) to predict the number of edges that separate the most recent common ancestor of a random sample of $k$ tip species and the root of the parent tree they are sampled from. Both exact and asymptotic results are presented. We also briefly consider a variation of the process in which a random number of tip species are sampled.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we define and classify the sign-equivalent exchange matrices. We give a Diophantine explanation for the differences between rank 2 cluster algebras of finite type and affine type based on \cite{CL24}. We classify the positive integer points of the Markov mutation invariant and its variant. As an application, several classes of Diophantine equations with cluster algebraic structures are exhibited.</description>

      <title>Auslander regular algebras and Coxeter matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Iyama's grade bijection for Auslander-Gorenstein algebras coincides with the bijection introduced by Auslander-Reiten. This result uses a new characterisation of Auslander-Gorenstein algebras. Furthermore, we show that the grade bijection of an Auslander regular algebra coincides with the permutation matrix P in the Bruhat factorisation of the Coxeter matrix. This gives a new, purely linear algebraic interpretation of the grade bijection and allows us to calculate it in a much quicker way than was previously known. We give several applications of our main results. First, we show that the permanent of the Coxeter matrix of an Auslander regular algebra is either 1 or -1. Second, we obtain a new combinatorial characterisation of distributive lattices among the class of finite lattices. Explicitly, a lattice is distributive if and only if its Coxeter matrix can be written as PU where P is a permutation matrix and U is an upper triangular matrix. Other applications include new homological results about modules in blocks of category $\mathcal{O}$ of semisimple Lie algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type $A$ and type $B$ permutohedral varieties are classic examples of mathematics, and their topological invariants are well known. This naturally leads to the investigation of the topology of their real loci, known as type $A$ and type $B$ real permutohedral varieties.
  The rational cohomology rings of type $A$ real permutohedral varieties are fully described in terms of alternating permutations. Until now, only rational Betti numbers of type $B$ real permutohedral varieties have been described in terms of $B$-snakes. In this paper, we explicitly describe the multiplicative structure of the cohomology rings of type $B$ real permutohedral varieties in terms of $B$-snakes.</description>

      <title>Faces of homogeneous cones and applications to homogeneous chordality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A convex cone $\mathcal{K}$ is said to be homogeneous if its group of automorphisms acts transitively on its relative interior. Important examples of homogeneous cones include symmetric cones and cones of positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices that follow a sparsity pattern given by a homogeneous chordal graph. Our goal in this paper is to elucidate the facial structure of homogeneous cones and make it as transparent as the faces of the PSD matrices. We prove that each face of a homogeneous cone $\mathcal{K}$ is mapped by an automorphism of $\mathcal{K}$ to one of its finitely many so-called principal faces. Furthermore, constructing such an automorphism can be done algorithmically by making use of a generalized Cholesky decomposition. Among other consequences, we give a proof that homogeneous cones are projectionally exposed, which strengthens the previous best result that they are amenable. Using our results, we will carefully analyze the facial structure of cones of PSD matrices satisfying homogeneous chordality and discuss consequences for the corresponding family of PSD completion problems.</description>

Abstract: In 1997, Van Hamme proposed 13 supercongruences on truncated hypergeometric series. Van Hamme's (B.2) supercongruence was first confirmed by Mortenson and received a WZ proof by Zudilin later. In 2012, using the WZ method again, Sun extended Van Hamme's (B.2) supercongruence to the modulus $p^4$ case, where $p$ is an odd prime. In this paper, by using a more general WZ pair, we generalize Hamme's (E.2) and (F.2) supercongruences, as well as two supercongruences by Swisher, to the modulus $p^4$ case. Our generalizations of these supercongruences are related to Euler polynomials. We also put forward a relevant conjecture on $q$-congruences for further study.</description>

      <title>Pattern Avoidance for Fibonacci Sequences using $k$-Regular Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two $k$-ary Fibonacci recurrences are $a_k(n) = a_k(n-1) + k \cdot a_k(n-2)$ and $b_k(n) = k \cdot b_k(n-1) + b_k(n-2)$. We provide a simple proof that $a_k(n)$ is the number of $k$-regular words over $[n] = \{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ that avoid patterns $\{121, 123, 132, 213\}$ when using base cases $a_k(0) = a_k(1) = 1$ for any $k \geq 1$. This was previously proven by Kuba and Panholzer in the context of Wilf-equivalence for restricted Stirling permutations, and it creates Simion and Schmidt's classic result on the Fibonacci sequence when $k=1$, and the Jacobsthal sequence when $k=2$. We complement this theorem by proving that $b_k(n)$ is the number of $k$-regular words over $[n]$ that avoid $\{122, 213\}$ with $b_k(0) = b_k(1) = 1$ for any~$k \geq 2$. Finally, we conjecture that $|Av^{2}_{n}(\underline{121}, 123, 132, 213)| = a_1(n)^2$ for $n \geq 0$. That is, vincularizing the Stirling pattern in Kuba and Panholzer's Jacobsthal result gives the Fibonacci-squared numbers.</description>

      <title>Extremal density for subdivisions with length or sparsity constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $H$, a balanced subdivision of $H$ is obtained by replacing all edges of $H$ with internally disjoint paths of the same length. In this paper, we prove that for any graph $H$, a linear-in-$e(H)$ bound on average degree guarantees a balanced $H$-subdivision. This strengthens an old result of Bollob\'as and Thomason, and resolves a question of Gil-Fern\'{a}ndez, Hyde, Liu, Pikhurko and Wu.
  We observe that this linear bound on average degree is best possible whenever $H$ is logarithmically dense. We further show that this logarithmic density is the critical threshold: for many graphs $H$ below this density, its subdivisions are forcible by a sublinear-in-$e(H)$ bound on average degree. We provide such examples by proving that the subdivisions of any almost bipartite graph $H$ with sublogarithmic density are forcible by a sublinear-in-$e(H)$ bound on average degree, provided that $H$ satisfies some additional separability condition.</description>

      <title>Integro-differential rings on species and derived structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the theory of species, differential as well as integral operators are known to arise in a natural way. In this paper, we shall prove that they precisely fit together in the algebraic framework of integro-differential rings, which are themselves an abstraction of classical calculus (incorporating its Fundamental Theorem). The results comprise (set) species as well as linear species. Localization of (set) species leads to the more general structure of modified integro-differential rings, previously employed in the algebraic treatment of Volterra integral equations. Furthermore, the ring homomorphism from species to power series via taking generating series is shown to be a (modified) integro-differential ring homomorphism. As an application, a topology and further algebraic operations are imported to virtual species from the general theory of integro-differential rings.</description>

      <title>An upper bound for the number of chess diagrams without promotion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.09386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2015, Steinerberger showed that the number of legal chess diagrams without promotion is bounded from above by $2\times 10^{40}$. This number was obtained by restricting both bishops and pawns position and by a precise bound when no chessman has been captured. We improve this estimate and show that the number of legal diagrams is less than $4\times 10^{37}$. To achieve this, we define a graph on the set of diagrams and a notion of class of pawn arrangements, leading to a method for bounding pawn positions with any number of men on the board.</description>

      <title>Composable Constraint Models for Permutation Enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17581v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constraint programming (CP) is a powerful tool for modeling mathematical concepts and objects and finding both solutions or counter examples. One of the major strengths of CP is that problems can easily be combined or expanded. In this paper, we illustrate that this versatility makes CP an ideal tool for exploring problems in permutation patterns.
  We declaratively define permutation properties, permutation pattern avoidance and containment constraints using CP and show how this allows us to solve a wide range of problems. We show how this approach enables the arbitrary composition of these conditions, and also allows the easy addition of extra conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques by modelling the containment and avoidance of six permutation patterns, eight permutation properties and measuring five statistics on the resulting permutations. In addition to calculating properties and statistics for the generated permutations, we show that arbitrary additional constraints can also be easily and efficiently added.
  This approach enables mathematicians to investigate permutation pattern problems in a quick and efficient manner. We demonstrate the utility of constraint programming for permutation patterns by showing how we can easily and efficiently extend the known permutation counts for a conjecture involving the class of $1324$ avoiding permutations. For this problem, we expand the enumeration of $1324$-avoiding permutations with a fixed number of inversions to permutations of length 16 and show for the first time that in the enumeration there is a pattern occurring which follows a unique sequence on the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00991v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a descriptive version of Brooks's theorem for directed graphs. In particular, we show that, if $D$ is a Borel directed graph on a standard Borel space $X$ such that the maximum degree of each vertex is at most $d \geq 3$, then unless $D$ contains the complete symmetric directed graph on $d + 1$ vertices, $D$ admits a $\mu$-measurable $d$-dicoloring with respect to any Borel probability measure $\mu$ on $X$, and $D$ admits a $\tau$-Baire-measurable $d$-dicoloring with respect to any Polish topology $\tau$ compatible with the Borel structure on $X$. We also prove a definable version of Gallai's theorem on list dicolorings for directed graphs by showing that any Borel directed graph of bounded degree whose connected components are not Gallai trees is Borel degree-list-dicolorable.</description>

      <title>Invariant Subspaces of Nilpotent Operators. Level, Mean, and Colevel: The Triangle $\Bbb T(n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the category $\mathcal S(n)$ of all pairs $X = (U,V)$, where $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space with a nilpotent operator $T$ with $T^n = 0$, and $U$ is a subspace of $V$ such that $T(U) \subseteq U$. Our main interest in an object $X=(U,V)$ are the three numbers $uX=\dim U$ (for the subspace), $wX=\dim V/U$ (for the factor) and $bX=\dim {\rm Ker} T$ (for the operator). Actually, instead of looking at the reference space $\Bbb R^3$ with the triples $(uX,wX,bX)$, we will focus the attention to the corresponding projective space $\Bbb T(n)$ which contains for a non-zero object $X$ the level-colevel pair {\bf pr}$X = (uX/bX,wX/bX)$ supporting the object $X$.
  We use $\Bbb T(n)$ to visualize part of the categorical structure of $\mathcal S(n)$: The action of the duality $D$ and the square $\tau_n^2$ of the Auslander-Reiten translation are represented on $\Bbb T(n)$ by a reflection and a rotation by $120^\circ$ degrees, respectively. Moreover for $n\geq 6$, each component of the Auslander-Reiten quiver of $\mathcal S(n)$ has support either contained in the center of $\Bbb T(n)$ or with the center as its only accumulation point.
  We show that the only indecomposable objects $X$ in $\mathcal S(n)$ with support having boundary distance smaller than 1 are objects with $bX=1$ which lie on the boundary, whereas any rational vector in $\Bbb T(n)$ with boundary distance at least 2 supports infinitely many indecomposable objects. At present, it is not clear at all what happens for vectors with boundary distance between 1 and 2. The use of $\Bbb T(n)$ provides even in the (quite well-understood) case $n = 6$ some surprises: In particular, we will show that any indecomposable object in $\mathcal S(6)$ lies on one of 12 central lines in $\Bbb T(6)$.
  The paper is essentially self-contained, all prerequisites which are needed are outlined in detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a random graph model with preferential edge attachment and detachment through the embedding into a generalized Yule model. We show that the in-degree distribution of a vertex chosen uniformly at random follows a power law in the supercritical regime but has an exponential decay in the subcritical. We provide the corresponding asymptotics. In the critical regime we observe an intermediate decay. The regimes are clearly defined in terms of parameter ranges.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Low elements and Join Irreducible gates in Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study the "tight gates" of some "regular" partitions in Coxeter groups. In particular, we study the tight gates of the cone type partition of a Coxeter group $W$; a partition giving rise to the minimal automaton recognising the language of reduced words of $W$ recently studied by Parkinson and Yau (2022) and Przytycki and Yau (2024). We show that "tight gates" are the join-irreducible elements of the $m$-low Garside shadows for $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and the smallest Garside shadow of $W$ under the right weak order. In the case of the tight gates of the cone type partition, we show that they also act as a "gate" of the witnesses of boundary roots of cone types. As an application of these results, we give a very efficient method of determining whether two elements have the same cone type without computing the minimal automaton. We also apply our results to explicitly describe the set of ultra-low elements in some select classes of Coxeter groups, thereby verifying a conjecture of Parkinson and Yau for these groups. Furthermore, we explicitly describe the tight gates of the cone type partition in these cases.</description>

      <title>On the generalized coloring numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The \emph{coloring number} $\mathrm{col}(G)$ of a graph $G$, which is equal to the \emph{degeneracy} of $G$ plus one, provides a very useful measure for the uniform sparsity of $G$. The coloring number is generalized by three series of measures, the \emph{generalized coloring numbers}. These are the \emph{$r$-admissibility} $\mathrm{adm}_r(G)$, the \emph{strong $r$-coloring number} $\mathrm{col}_r(G)$ and the \emph{weak $r$-coloring number} $\mathrm{wcol}_r(G)$, where $r$ is an integer parameter. The generalized coloring numbers measure the edge density of bounded-depth minors and thereby provide an even more uniform measure of sparsity of graphs. They have found many applications in graph theory and in particular play a key role in the theory of bounded expansion and nowhere dense graph classes introduced by Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and Ossona de Mendez. We overview combinatorial and algorithmic applications of the generalized coloring numbers, emphasizing new developments in this area. We also present a simple proof for the existence of uniform orders and improve known bounds, e.g., for the weak coloring numbers on graphs with excluded topological minors.</description>

      <title>Fermions and Zeta Function on the Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel fermionic model on the graphs. The Dirac operator of the model consists of deformed incidence matrices on the graph and the partition function is given by the inverse of the graph zeta function. We find that the coefficients of the inverse of the graph zeta function, which is a polynomial of finite degree in the coupling constant, count the number of fermionic cycles on the graph. We also construct the model on grid graphs by using the concept of the covering graph and the Artin-Ihara $L$-function. In connection with this, we show that the fermion doubling is absent, and the overlap fermions can be constructed on a general graph. Furthermore, we relate our model to statistical models by introducing the winding number around cycles, where the distribution of the poles of the graph zeta function (the zeros of the partition function) plays a crucial role. Finally, we formulate gauge theory including fermions on the graph from the viewpoint of the covering graph derived from the gauge group in a unified way.</description>
