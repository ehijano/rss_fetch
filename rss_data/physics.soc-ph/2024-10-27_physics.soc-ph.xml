      <title>Strategic deployment of solar photovoltaics for achieving self-sufficiency in Europe throughout the energy transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition pathways for Europe to achieve carbon neutrality emphasize the need for a massive deployment of solar and wind energy. Global cost optimization would lead to installing most of the renewable capacity in a few resource-rich countries, but policy decisions could prioritize other factors. In this study, we focus on the effect of energy independence on Europe's energy system design. We show that self-sufficiency constraints lead to a more equitable distribution of costs and installed capacities across Europe. However, countries that typically depend on energy imports face cost increases of up to 150% to achieve complete self-sufficiency. Self-sufficiency particularly favours solar photovoltaic (PV) energy, and with declining PV module prices, alternative configurations like inverter dimensioning and horizontal tracking are beneficial enough to be part of the optimal solution for many countries. Moreover, we found that very large solar and wind annual installation rates are required, but they seem feasible in light of recent historical trends.</description>

      <title>Most Swiss-system tournaments are unfair: Evidence from chess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Swiss-system is an increasingly popular tournament format as it provides an attractive trade-off between the number of matches and ranking accuracy. However, few empirical research consider the optimal design of the Swiss-system. We contribute to this issue by investigating the fairness of Swiss-system chess competitions with an odd number of rounds, where half of the players have an extra game with white pieces. They are proven to enjoy a significant advantage and to be overrepresented among both the highest-ranked and outperforming players. Therefore, Swiss-system tournaments should have an even number of rounds and use a pairing mechanism that guarantees a balanced colour assignment.</description>

      <title>The replacement number dynamics in SIR-type epidemic models I: From SSISS to RND picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In SIR-type epidemic models time derivative of prevalence $I$ can always be cast into the form $\dot{I}=(X-1)I$, where $X$ is the replacement number and recovery rate is normalized to one. Assuming $\dot{X}=f(X,I)$ for some smooth function $f$ defines a "replacement number dynamics" (RND). Choosing transmission coefficients $\beta_1&gt;\beta_2$, any such system uniquely maps to an isomorphic "SSISS model", i.e. an abstract SIR-type 3-compartment model. Extending to negative values $\beta_i&lt;0$ takes care of demographic dynamics with compartment dependent birth and death rates. Fixing $f$ and varying $\beta_i$ generates a family of isomorphic SSISS systems, the "SSISS fiber" $\cal{F}(f)$}. A symmetry group $G_\sigma$ acts freely and transitively on fibers $\cal{F}(f)$, so SSISS systems become a principal $G_\sigma$-fiber bundle over the space of RND systems. Choosing two specific 6-parameter polynomials $f$ at most quadratic in $(X,I)$ covers a large class of models in the literature, with in total up to 17 (largely redundant!) parameters, including also reactive social behavior models. Epidemiological admissibility conditions guarantee forward boundedness and absence of periodic solutions in all these models. Part II of this work will prove existence and stability properties of endemic equilibria, which in RND picture simply boils down to analyzing zeros of the parabolas $f|_{I=0}$ and $f|_{X=1}$. This will cover and extend well known results for a wide range of models by a unifying approach while also closing some open issues in the literature.</description>

      <title>Community detection on directed networks with missing edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying significant community structures in networks with incomplete data is a challenging task, as the reliability of solutions diminishes with increasing levels of missing information. However, in many empirical contexts, some information about the uncertainty in the network measurements can be estimated. In this work, we extend the recently developed Flow Stability framework, originally designed for detecting communities in time-varying networks, to address the problem of community detection in weighted, directed networks with missing links. Our approach leverages known uncertainty levels in nodes' out-degrees to enhance the robustness of community detection. Through comparisons on synthetic networks and a real-world network of messaging channels on the Telegram platform, we demonstrate that our method delivers more reliable community structures, even when a significant portion of data is missing.</description>

      <title>Constructive agents nullify the ability of destructive agents to foster cooperation in public goods games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing studies have revealed a paradoxical phenomenon in public goods games, wherein destructive agents, harming both cooperators and defectors, can unexpectedly bolster cooperation. Building upon this intriguing premise, our paper introduces a novel concept: constructive agents, which confer additional benefits to both cooperators and defectors. We investigate the impact of these agents on cooperation dynamics within the framework of public goods games. Employing replicator dynamics, we find that unlike destructive agents, the mere presence of constructive agents does not significantly alter the defective equilibrium. However, when the benefits from constructive agents are outweighed by the damage inflicted by destructive agents, the addition of constructive agents does not affect the ability of destructive agents to sustain cooperation. In this scenario, cooperators can be maintained through a cyclic dominance between cooperators, defectors, and destructive agents, with constructive agents adding complexity but not fundamentally changing the equilibrium. Conversely, if the benefits from constructive agents surpass the harm caused by destructive agents, the presence of constructive agents nullifies the ability of destructive agents to foster cooperation. Our results highlight the nuanced role of constructive agents in cooperation dynamics, emphasizing the necessity of carefully assessing incentive balances when encouraging cooperation.</description>

      <title>UEFA Champions League entry is incentive incompatible again from the 2024/25 season</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12636v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: UEFA declares that it is fully committed to respecting the fundamental values of sport. However, the qualification for the post-2024 UEFA Champions League is not always based on sporting merit. Consequently, a match with misaligned incentives has been barely avoided in the 2023/24 German Bundesliga. Two straightforward solutions are recommended to safeguard the integrity of the competition. Fairness can be easily guaranteed by reversing the order of two articles in the Champions League regulation. Since UEFA repeatedly commits the same mistake that is widely known among researchers, governing bodies in sports are called to work more closely together with the scientific community</description>

      <title>New Coevolution Dynamic as an Optimization Strategy in Group Problem Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coevolution on social models couples the time evolution of the network with the time evolution of the states of the agents. This paper presents a new coevolution dynamic allowing more than one rewiring on the network. We explore how this coevolution can be employed as an optimization strategy for problem-solving capability of task-forces. We used an agent-based model study how this new coevolution dynamic can help a group of agents whose task is to find the global maxima of NK fitness landscapes. Each agent can replace more than one neighbors, and this quantity is a tunable parameter in the model. These rewirings is a way for the agent to obtain information from individuals that were not previously part of its neighborhood. Our results showed that this tunable coevolution can indeed produce gain on the computational cost under certain circunstances. At low average degree (using a random network to connect the agents) and on easy landscape, more rewirings return lower cost, helping the agents to find the global maximum faster. However, at larger average degree and difficult landscape, the effect is more complex. At medium size systems, the coevolution brings optimal results when 3 or 4 neighbors are replaced.</description>
