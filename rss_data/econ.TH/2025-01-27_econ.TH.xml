      <title>The Division of Surplus and the Burden of Proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A surplus must be divided between a principal and an agent. Only the agent knows the surplus' true size and decides how much of it to reveal initially. Both parties can exert costly effort to conclusively prove the surplus' true size. The agent's liability is bounded by the revealed surplus. The principal is equipped with additional funds. The principal designs a mechanism that allocates the burden of proof and divides the surplus. In principal-optimal mechanisms, the principal's effort to acquire proof decreases in the revealed surplus. The agent's effort initially decreases, but then the sign of its slope alternates across five intervals. Applications include wealth taxation, corporate finance, and public procurements.</description>

      <title>From signaling to interviews in random matching markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many two-sided labor markets, interviews are conducted before matches are formed. An increase in the number of interviews in the market for medical residencies raised the demand for signaling mechanisms, in which applicants can send a limited number of signals to communicate interest. We study the role of signaling mechanisms in reducing the number of interviews in centralized random matching markets with post-interview shocks. For the market to clear we focus on interim stability, which extends the notion of stability to ensure that agents do not regret not interviewing with each other. A matching is almost interim stable if it is interim stable after removing a vanishingly small fraction of agents.
  We first study signaling mechanisms in random matching markets when agents on the short side, long side, or both sides signal their top~$d$ preferred partners. Interviews graphs are formed by including all pairs where at least one party has signaled the other. We show that when $d = \omega(1)$, short-side signaling leads to almost interim stable matchings. Long-side signaling is only effective when the market is almost balanced. Conversely, when the interview shocks are negligible and $d = o(\log n)$, both-side signaling fails to achieve almost interim stability. For larger $d \ge \Omega(\log^2 n)$, short-side signaling achieves perfect interim stability, while long-side signaling fails in imbalanced markets. We build on our findings to propose a signaling mechanism for multi-tiered random markets. Our analysis identifies conditions under which signaling mechanisms are incentive compatible. A technical contribution is the analysis of a message-passing algorithm that efficiently determines interim stability and matching outcomes by leveraging local neighborhood structures.</description>

      <title>PASER: A Physics-Inspired Theory for Stimulated Growth and Real-Time Optimization in On-Demand Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative framework for understanding on-demand platforms by quantifying positive network effects, trust, revenue dynamics, and the influence of demand on platform operations at per-minute or even per-second granularity. Drawing inspiration from physics, the framework provides both a theoretical and pragmatic perspective, offering a pictorial and quantitative representation of how on-demand platforms create value. It seeks to demystify their nuanced operations by providing practical, tangible, and highly applicable metrics, platform design templates, and real-time optimization tools for strategic what-if scenario planning. Its model demonstrates strong predictive power and is deeply rooted in raw data. The framework offers a deterministic insight into the workings of diverse platforms like Uber, Airbnb, and food delivery services. Furthermore, it generalizes to model all on-demand service platforms with cyclical operations. It works synergistically with machine learning, game theory, and agent-based models by providing a solid quantitative core rooted in raw data, based on physical truths, and is capable of delivering tangible predictions for real-time operational adjustments. The framework's mathematical model was rigorously validated using highly detailed historical data retrieved with near 100% certainty. Applying data-driven induction, distinct qualities were identified in big data sets via an iterative process. Through analogical thinking, a clear and highly intuitive mapping between the elements, operational principles, and dynamic behaviors of a well-known physical system was established to create a physics-inspired lens for Uber. This novel quantitative framework was named PASER (Profit Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Revenue), drawing an analogy to its physical counterpart, the LASER (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation).</description>

      <title>The Pseudo-Dimension of Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic contract design studies scenarios where a principal incentivizes an agent to exert effort on her behalf. In this work, we focus on settings where the agent's type is drawn from an unknown distribution, and formalize an offline learning framework for learning near-optimal contracts from sample agent types. A central tool in our analysis is the notion of pseudo-dimension from statistical learning theory. Beyond its role in establishing upper bounds on the sample complexity, pseudo-dimension measures the intrinsic complexity of a class of contracts, offering a new perspective on the tradeoffs between simplicity and optimality in contract design. Our main results provide essentially optimal tradeoffs between pseudo-dimension and representation error (defined as the loss in principal's utility) with respect to linear and bounded contracts. Using these tradeoffs, we derive sample- and time-efficient learning algorithms, and demonstrate their near-optimality by providing almost matching lower bounds on the sample complexity. Conversely, for unbounded contracts, we prove an impossibility result showing that no learning algorithm exists.
  Finally, we extend our techniques in three important ways. First, we provide refined pseudo-dimension and sample complexity guarantees for the combinatorial actions model, revealing a novel connection between the number of critical values and sample complexity. Second, we extend our results to menus of contracts, showing that their pseudo-dimension scales linearly with the menu size. Third, we adapt our algorithms to the online learning setting, where we show that, a polynomial number of type samples suffice to learn near-optimal bounded contracts. Combined with prior work, this establishes a formal separation between expert advice and bandit feedback for this setting.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Theory of Money or Prices? A Historical, Theoretical, and Econometric Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research studies the relation between money and prices and its practical implications analyzing quarterly data from United States (1959-2022), Canada (1961-2022), United Kingdom (1986-2022), and Brazil (1996-2022). The historical, logical, and econometric consistency of the logical core of the two main theories of money is analyzed using objective bayesian and frequentist machine learning models, bayesian regularized artificial neural networks, and ensemble learning. It is concluded that money is not neutral at any time horizon and that, despite money is ultimately subordinated to prices, there is a reciprocal influence over time between money and prices which constitute a complex system. Non-neutrality is transmitted through aggregate demand and is based on the exchange value of money as a monetary unit.</description>

      <title>An Alternative Approach for Nonparametric Analysis of Random Utility Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14249v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We readdress the problem of nonparametric statistical testing of random utility models proposed in Kitamura and Stoye (2018). Although their test is elegant, it is subject to computational constraints which leaves execution of the test infeasible in many applications. We note that much of the computational burden in Kitamura and Stoye's test is due to their test defining a polyhedral cone through its vertices rather than its faces. We propose an alternative but equivalent hypothesis test for random utility models. This test relies on a series of equality and inequality constraints which defines the faces of the corresponding polyhedral cone. Building on our testing procedure, we develop a novel axiomatization of the random utility model.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Machines and Incomplete Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The distribution of efficient individuals in the economy and the efforts that they will put in if they are hired, there are two important concerns for a technologically advanced firm. wants to open a new branch. The firm does not have information about the exact level of efficiency of an individual when she is hired. We call this situation incomplete information. The standard principal agent models assume that employees know their efficiency levels. Hence these models design incentive-compatible mechanisms. An incentive-compatible mechanism ensures that a participant does not have the incentive to misreport her efficiency level. This paper does not assume that employees know how efficient they are. This paper assumes that the production technology of the firm is intelligent, that is, the output of the machine reveals the efficiency levels of employees. Employees marginal contributions to the total output of the intelligent machine, the probability distribution of the levels of efficiency and employees costs of efforts together define a game of incomplete information. A characterization of ex-ante Nash Equilibrium is established. The results of the characterization formalize the relationship between the distribution of efficiency levels and the distribution of output.</description>
