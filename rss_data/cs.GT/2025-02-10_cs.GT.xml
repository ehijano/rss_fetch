      <title>Synergistic Traffic Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic assignment analyzes traffic flows in road networks that emerge due to traveler interaction. Traditionally, travelers are assumed to use private cars, so road costs grow with the number of users due to congestion. However, in sustainable transit systems, travelers share vehicles s.t. more users on a road lead to higher sharing potential and reduced cost per user. Thus, we invert the usual avoidant traffic assignment (ATA) and instead consider synergistic traffic assignment (STA) where road costs decrease with use.
  We find that STA is significantly different from ATA from a game-theoretical point of view. We show that a simple iterative best-response method with simultaneous updates converges to an equilibrium state. This enables efficient computation of equilibria using optimized speedup techniques for shortest-path queries. In contrast, ATA requires slower sequential updates or more complicated iteration schemes that only approximate an equilibrium. Experiments with a realistic scenario for the city of Stuttgart indicate that STA indeed quickly converges to an equilibrium. We envision STA as a part of software-defined transportation systems that dynamically adapt to current travel demand. As a first demonstration, we show that an STA equilibrium can be used to incorporate traveler synergism in a simple bus line planning algorithm to potentially greatly reduce the required vehicle resources.</description>

      <title>Shapley Value Approximation Based on k-Additive Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Shapley value is the prevalent solution for fair division problems in which a payout is to be divided among multiple agents. By adopting a game-theoretic view, the idea of fair division and the Shapley value can also be used in machine learning to quantify the individual contribution of features or data points to the performance of a predictive model. Despite its popularity and axiomatic justification, the Shapley value suffers from a computational complexity that scales exponentially with the number of entities involved, and hence requires approximation methods for its reliable estimation. We propose SVA$k_{\text{ADD}}$, a novel approximation method that fits a $k$-additive surrogate game. By taking advantage of $k$-additivity, we are able to elicit the exact Shapley values of the surrogate game and then use these values as estimates for the original fair division problem. The efficacy of our method is evaluated empirically and compared to competing methods.</description>

      <title>On the Price of Anarchy in Packet Routing Games with FIFO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate packet routing games in which network users selfishly route themselves through a network over discrete time, aiming to reach the destination as quickly as possible. Conflicts due to limited capacities are resolved by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) principle. Building upon the line of research on packet routing games initiated by Werth et al., we derive the first non-trivial bounds for packet routing games with FIFO. Specifically, we show that the price of anarchy is at most 2 for the important and well-motivated class of uniformly fastest route equilibria introduced by Scarsini et al. on any linear multigraph. We complement our results with a series of instances on linear multigraphs, where the price of stability converges to at least $\frac{e}{e-1}$. Furthermore, our instances provide a lower bound for the price of anarchy of continuous Nash flows over time on linear multigraphs which establishes the first lower bound of $\frac{e}{e-1}$ on a graph class where the monotonicity conjecture is proven by Correa et al.</description>

      <title>Maximin Share Guarantees for Few Agents with Subadditive Valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of fairly allocating a set of indivisible items among a set of agents. We consider the notion of (approximate) maximin share (MMS) and we provide an improved lower bound of $1/2$ (which is tight) for the case of subadditive valuations when the number of agents is at most four. We also provide a tight lower bound for the case of multiple agents, when they are equipped with one of two possible types of valuations. Moreover, we propose a new model that extends previously studied models in the area of fair division, which will hopefully give rise to further research. We demonstrate the usefulness of this model by employing it as a technical tool to derive our main result, and we provide a thorough analysis for this model for the case of three agents. Finally, we provide an improved impossibility result for the case of three submodular agents.</description>

      <title>People use fast, goal-directed simulation to reason about novel games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: People can evaluate features of problems and their potential solutions well before we can effectively solve them. When considering a game we have never played, for instance, we might infer whether it is likely to be challenging, fair, or fun simply from hearing the game rules, prior to deciding whether to invest time in learning the game or trying to play it well. Many studies of game play have focused on optimality and expertise, characterizing how people and computational models play based on moderate to extensive search and after playing a game dozens (if not thousands or millions) of times. Here, we study how people reason about a range of simple but novel Connect-N style board games. We ask people to judge how fair and how fun the games are from very little experience: just thinking about the game for a minute or so, before they have ever actually played with anyone else, and we propose a resource-limited model that captures their judgments using only a small number of partial game simulations and almost no look-ahead search.</description>

      <title>Game Theory with Simulation in the Presence of Unpredictable Randomisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI agents will be predictable in certain ways that traditional agents are not. Where and how can we leverage this predictability in order to improve social welfare? We study this question in a game-theoretic setting where one agent can pay a fixed cost to simulate the other in order to learn its mixed strategy. As a negative result, we prove that, in contrast to prior work on pure-strategy simulation, enabling mixed-strategy simulation may no longer lead to improved outcomes for both players in all so-called "generalised trust games". In fact, mixed-strategy simulation does not help in any game where the simulatee's action can depend on that of the simulator. We also show that, in general, deciding whether simulation introduces Pareto-improving Nash equilibria in a given game is NP-hard. As positive results, we establish that mixed-strategy simulation can improve social welfare if the simulator has the option to scale their level of trust, if the players face challenges with both trust and coordination, or if maintaining some level of privacy is essential for enabling cooperation.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of Min-Max Langevin Dynamics and Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study zero-sum games in the space of probability distributions over the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ with entropy regularization, in the setting when the interaction function between the players is smooth and strongly convex-strongly concave. We prove an exponential convergence guarantee for the mean-field min-max Langevin dynamics to compute the equilibrium distribution of the zero-sum game. We also study the finite-particle approximation of the mean-field min-max Langevin dynamics, both in continuous and discrete times. We prove biased convergence guarantees for the continuous-time finite-particle min-max Langevin dynamics to the stationary mean-field equilibrium distribution with an explicit bias term which does not scale with the number of particles. We also prove biased convergence guarantees for the discrete-time finite-particle min-max Langevin algorithm to the stationary mean-field equilibrium distribution with an additional bias term which scales with the step size and the number of particles. This provides an explicit iteration complexity for the average particle along the finite-particle algorithm to approximately compute the equilibrium distribution of the zero-sum game.</description>

      <title>The Strong Core of Housing Markets with Partial Order Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the strong core of housing markets when agents' preferences over houses are expressed as partial orders. We provide a structural characterization of the strong core, and propose an efficient algorithm that finds an allocation in the strong core or decides that it is empty, even in the presence of forced and forbidden arcs. The algorithm satisfies the property of group-strategyproofness. Additionally, we show that certain results known for the strong core in the case when agents' preferences are weak orders can be extended to the setting with partial order preferences; among others, we show that the strong core in such housing markets satisfies the property of respecting improvements.</description>

      <title>The Battling Influencers Game: Nash Equilibria Structure of a Potential Game and Implications to Value Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When multiple influencers attempt to compete for a receiver's attention, their influencing strategies must account for the presence of one another. We introduce the Battling Influencers Game (BIG), a multi-player simultaneous-move general-sum game, to provide a game-theoretic characterization of this social phenomenon. We prove that BIG is a potential game, that it has either one or an infinite number of pure Nash equilibria (NEs), and these pure NEs can be found by convex optimization. Interestingly, we also prove that at any pure NE, all (except at most one) influencers must exaggerate their actions to the maximum extent. In other words, it is rational for the influencers to be non-truthful and extreme because they anticipate other influencers to cancel out part of their influence. We discuss the implications of BIG to value alignment.</description>
