      <title>Alignment Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces alignment games, a new class of zero-sum games modeling strategic interventions where effectiveness depends on alignment with an underlying hidden state. Motivated by operational problems in medical diagnostics, economic sanctions, and resource allocation, this framework features two players, a Hider and a Searcher, who choose subsets of a given space. Payoffs are determined by their misalignment (symmetric difference), explicitly modeling the trade-off between commission errors (unnecessary action) and omission errors (missed targets), given by a cost function and a penalty function, respectively.
  We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, deriving closed-form equilibrium solutions that contain interesting mathematical properties based on the game's payoff structure. When cost and penalty functions are unequal, optimal strategies are consistently governed by cost-penalty ratios. On the unit circle, optimal arc lengths are direct functions of this ratio, and in discrete games, optimal choice probabilities are proportional to element-specific ratios.
  When costs are equal, the solutions exhibit rich structural properties and sharp threshold behaviors. On the unit interval, this manifests as a geometric pattern of minimal covering versus maximal non-overlapping strategies. In discrete games with cardinality constraints, play concentrates on the highest-cost locations, with solutions changing discontinuously as parameters cross critical values.
  Our framework extends the theory of geometric and search games and is general enough that classical models, such as Matching Pennies, emerge as special cases. These results provide a new theoretical foundation for analyzing the strategic tension between comprehensive coverage and precise targeting under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Incentivising Personalised Colorectal Cancer Screening: an Adversarial Risk Analysis Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework for incentivising colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programs from the perspective of policymakers and under the assumption that the citizens participating in the program have misaligned objectives. To do so, it leverages tools from adversarial risk analysis to propose an optimal incentive scheme under uncertainty. The work relies on previous work on modeling CRC risk and optimal screening strategies and provides use cases regarding individual and group-based optimal incentives based on a simple financial scheme.</description>

      <title>Robust Voting Rules on the Interval Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study voting rules on the interval domain, where the alternatives are arranged according to an externally given strict total order and voters report intervals of this order to indicate the alternatives they support. For this setting, we introduce and characterize the class of position-threshold rules, which compute a collective position of the voters with respect to every alternative and choose the left-most alternative whose collective position exceeds its threshold value. Our characterization of these rules mainly relies on reinforcement, a well-known population consistency condition, and robustness, a new axiom that restricts how the outcome is allowed to change when a voter removes the left-most or right-most alternative from his interval. Moreover, we characterize a generalization of the median rule to the interval domain, which selects the median of the endpoints of the voters' intervals.</description>

      <title>Multi-weighted Reachability Games and Their Application to Permissiveness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two-player multi-weighted reachability games played on a finite directed graph, where an agent, called P1, has several quantitative reachability objectives that he wants to optimize against an antagonistic environment, called P2. In this setting, we ask what cost profiles P1 can ensure regardless of the opponent's behavior. Cost profiles are compared thanks to: (i) a lexicographic order that ensures the unicity of an upper value and (ii) a componentwise order for which we consider the Pareto frontier. We synthesize (i) lexico-optimal strategies and (ii) Pareto-optimal strategies. The strategies are obtained thanks to a fixpoint algorithm which also computes the upper value in polynomial time and the Pareto frontier in exponential time. The constrained existence problem is proved in P for the lexicographic order and PSPACE-complete for the componentwise order. Finally, we show how complexity results about permissiveness of multi-strategies in two-player quantitative reachability games can be derived from the results we obtained in the two-player multi-weighted reachability games setting.</description>

      <title>Allocation of Indivisible Items with a Common Preference Graph: Minimizing Total Dissatisfaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Allocating indivisible items among a set of agents is a frequently studied discrete optimization problem. In the setting considered in this work, the agents' preferences over the items are assumed to be identical. We consider a very recent measure for the overall quality of an allocation which does not rely on numerical valuations of the items. Instead, it captures the agents' opinion by a directed acyclic preference graph with vertices representing items. An arc $(a,b)$ in such a graph means that the agents prefer item $a$ over item $b$. For a given allocation of items the dissatisfaction of an agent is defined as the number of items which the agent does not receive and for which no more preferred item is given to the agent. Our goal is to find an efficient allocation of the items to the agents such that the total dissatisfaction over all agents is minimized.
  We explore the dichotomy between NP-hard and polynomially solvable instances, depending on properties of the underlying preference graph. While the problem is NP-hard already for three agents even on very restricted graph classes, it is polynomially solvable for two agents on general preference graphs. For an arbitrary number of agents, we derive polynomial-time algorithms for relevant restrictions of the underlying undirected graph. These are trees and, among the graphs of treewidth two, series-parallel graphs and cactus graphs.</description>

      <title>Computing Lindahl Equilibrium for Public Goods with and without Funding Caps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lindahl equilibrium is a solution concept for allocating a fixed budget across several divisible public goods. It always lies in the weak core, meaning that the equilibrium allocation satisfies desirable stability and proportional fairness properties. We consider a model where agents have separable linear utility functions over the public goods, and the output assigns to each good an amount of spending, summing to at most the available budget.
  In the uncapped setting, each of the public goods can absorb any amount of funding. In this case, it is known that Lindahl equilibrium is equivalent to maximizing Nash social welfare, and this allocation can be computed by a public-goods variant of the proportional response dynamics. We introduce a new convex programming formulation for computing this solution and show that it is related to Nash welfare maximization through double duality and reformulation. We then show that the proportional response dynamics is equivalent to running mirror descent on our new formulation. Our new formulation has similarities to Shmyrev's convex program for Fisher market equilibrium.
  In the capped setting, each public good has an upper bound on the amount of funding it can receive, which is a type of constraint that appears in fractional committee selection and participatory budgeting. In this setting, existence of Lindahl equilibrium was only known via fixed-point arguments. The existence of an efficient algorithm computing one has been a long-standing open question. We prove that our new convex program continues to work when the cap constraints are added, and its optimal solutions are Lindahl equilibria. Thus, we establish that approximate Lindahl equilibrium can be efficiently computed. Our result also implies that approximately core-stable allocations can be efficiently computed for the class of separable piecewise-linear concave (SPLC) utilities.</description>

      <title>Can Almost Everybody be Almost Happy? PCP for PPAD and the Inapproximability of Nash</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.02411</link>
      <description>arXiv:1504.02411v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conjecture that PPAD has a PCP-like complete problem, seeking a near equilibrium in which all but very few players have very little incentive to deviate. We show that, if one assumes that this problem requires exponential time, several open problems in this area are settled. The most important implication, proved via a "birthday repetition" reduction, is that the n^O(log n) approximation scheme of [LMM03] for the Nash equilibrium of two-player games is essentially optimum. Two other open problems in the area are resolved once one assumes this conjecture, establishing that certain approximate equilibria are PPAD-complete: Finding a relative approximation of two-player Nash equilibria (without the well-supported restriction of [Das13]), and an approximate competitive equilibrium with equal incomes [Bud11] with small clearing error and near-optimal Gini coefficient.</description>
