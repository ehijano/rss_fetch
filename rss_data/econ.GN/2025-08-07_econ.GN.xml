      <title>AI Investment and Firm Productivity: How Executive Demographics Drive Technology Adoption and Performance in Japanese Enterprises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates how executive demographics particularly age and gender influence artificial intelligence (AI) investment decisions and subsequent firm productivity using comprehensive data from over 500 Japanese enterprises spanning from 2018 to 2023. Our central research question addresses the role of executive characteristics in technology adoption, finding that CEO age and technical background significantly predict AI investment propensity. Employing these demographic characteristics as instrumental variables to address endogeneity concerns, we identify a statistically significant 2.4% increase in total factor productivity attributable to AI investment adoption. Our novel mechanism decomposition framework reveals that productivity gains operate through three distinct channels: cost reduction (40% of total effect), revenue enhancement (35%), and innovation acceleration (25%). The results demonstrate that younger executives (below 50 years) are 23% more likely to adopt AI technologies, while firm size significantly moderates this relationship. Aggregate projections suggest potential GDP impacts of 1.15 trillion JPY from widespread AI adoption across the Japanese economy. These findings provide crucial empirical guidance for understanding the human factors driving digital transformation and inform both corporate governance and public policy regarding AI investment incentives.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Economic Impact of 2025 ICE Raids on California's Agricultural Industry: A Case Study of Oxnard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2025, intensified Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in Oxnard, California, disrupted the state's \$49 billion agricultural industry, a critical supplier of 75% of U.S. fruits and nuts and one-third of its vegetables. This paper quantifies the economic consequences of these raids on labor markets, crop production, and food prices using econometric modeling. We estimate a 20-40% reduction in the agricultural workforce, leading to \$3-7 billion in crop losses and a 5-12% increase in produce prices. The analysis draws on USDA Economic Research Service data and recent ICE detention figures, which show arrests in Southern California rising from 699 in May to nearly 2,000 in June 2025. The raids disproportionately affect labor-intensive crops like strawberries, exacerbating supply chain disruptions. Policy recommendations include expanding the H-2A visa program and legalizing undocumented workers to stabilize the sector. This study contributes to agricultural economics by providing a data-driven assessment of immigration enforcement's economic toll.</description>

      <title>Exports, Labor Markets, and the Environment: Evidence from Brazil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What is the environmental impact of exports? Focusing on 2000-20, this paper combines customs, administrative, and census microdata to estimate employment elasticities with respect to exports. The findings show that municipalities that faced increased exports experienced faster growth in formal employment. The elasticities were 0.25 on impact, peaked at 0.4, and remained positive and significant even 10 years after the shock, pointing to a long and protracted labor market adjustment. In the long run, informal employment responds negatively to export shocks. Using a granular taxonomy for economic activities based on their environmental impact, the paper documents that environmentally risky activities have a larger share of employment than environmentally sustainable ones, and that the relationship between these activities and exports is nuanced. Over the short run, environmentally risky employment responds more strongly to exports relative to environmentally sustainable employment. However, over the long run, this pattern reverses, as the impact of exports on environmentally sustainable employment is more persistent.</description>

      <title>EEA Professional Climate Survey Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2023, the European Economic Association (EEA) Minorities in Economics (MinE) Committee, in collaboration with the German Economic Association (VfS), conducted a professional climate survey to assess diversity, equity, and inclusion in the European economics profession.The survey gathered responses from 861 current and former EEA members, capturing demographic data and experiences across gender, ethnicity, LGBTQ+ identity, disability, and socioeconomic background. Results revealed widespread disparities in perceptions of inclusion, respect, and professional treatment. Reports of discrimination, exclusion, and harassment were significantly higher among women, ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ individuals, and people with disabilities. Geographic differences also emerged, with the Nordic countries reporting the most positive climate and the UK and Italy showing higher levels of dissatisfaction and discrimination. Compared to the American Economic Association 2018 survey, European respondents reported lower satisfaction overall.</description>

      <title>Testing Spillovers in Resource Conservation: Evidence from a Natural Field Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the potential for behavioral interventions aimed at promoting resource conservation within one domain to induce spillovers in another. Through a large-scale natural field experiment involving around 2,000 residents, we assess the direct and spillover effects of real-time feedback and social comparisons on water and energy consumption. Three interventions were implemented: two targeting shower use and one targeting air-conditioning use. We document a significant reduction in shower use attributable to both water-saving interventions, but no direct effects on air-conditioning use from the energy-saving intervention. For spillovers, we precisely estimated null effects on air-conditioning use arising from the water-saving interventions, and vice versa.</description>

      <title>TaxSolver: A methodology to design optimal income tax reform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Across the developed world, there are growing calls to streamline and improve ever more complex income tax codes. Executing reform has proven difficult. Even when the desired outcomes of a reform are clear, the tools to design fitting reforms are lacking. To remedy this, we developed \texttt{TaxSolver}: a methodology to help policymakers realize optimal income tax reform. \texttt{TaxSolver} allows policymakers to focus solely on what they aim to achieve with a reform -- like redistributing wealth, incentivizing labor market participation or reducing complexity -- and the guarantees within which reform is acceptable -- like limiting fluctuations in taxpayer incomes, protecting households from falling into poverty or shocks to overall tax revenue. Given these goals and fiscal guarantees, \texttt{TaxSolver} finds the optimal set of tax rules that satisfies all the criteria or shows that the set of demands are not mathematically feasible. We illustrate \texttt{TaxSolver} by reforming various simulated examples of tax codes, including some that reflect the complexity and size of a real-world tax system.</description>
