      <title>Who is Helping Whom? Analyzing Inter-dependencies to Evaluate Cooperation in Human-AI Teaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-standing research challenges of Human-AI Teaming(HAT) and Zero-shot Cooperation(ZSC) have been tackled by applying multi-agent reinforcement learning(MARL) to train an agent by optimizing the environment reward function and evaluating their performance through task performance metrics such as task reward. However, such evaluation focuses only on task completion, while being agnostic to `how' the two agents work with each other. Specifically, we are interested in understanding the cooperation arising within the team when trained agents are paired with humans. To formally address this problem, we propose the concept of interdependence to measure how much agents rely on each other's actions to achieve the shared goal, as a key metric for evaluating cooperation in human-agent teams. Towards this, we ground this concept through a symbolic formalism and define evaluation metrics that allow us to assess the degree of reliance between the agents' actions. We pair state-of-the-art agents trained through MARL for HAT, with learned human models for the the popular Overcooked domain, and evaluate the team performance for these human-agent teams. Our results demonstrate that trained agents are not able to induce cooperative behavior, reporting very low levels of interdependence across all the teams. We also report that teaming performance of a team is not necessarily correlated with the task reward.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization for Building Social-Influence-Free Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Social Bayesian Optimization (SBO), a vote-efficient algorithm for consensus-building in collective decision-making. In contrast to single-agent scenarios, collective decision-making encompasses group dynamics that may distort agents' preference feedback, thereby impeding their capacity to achieve a social-influence-free consensus -- the most preferable decision based on the aggregated agent utilities. We demonstrate that under mild rationality axioms, reaching social-influence-free consensus using noisy feedback alone is impossible. To address this, SBO employs a dual voting system: cheap but noisy public votes (e.g., show of hands in a meeting), and more accurate, though expensive, private votes (e.g., one-to-one interview). We model social influence using an unknown social graph and leverage the dual voting system to efficiently learn this graph. Our theoretical findigns show that social graph estimation converges faster than the black-box estimation of agents' utilities, allowing us to reduce reliance on costly private votes early in the process. This enables efficient consensus-building primarily through noisy public votes, which are debiased based on the estimated social graph to infer social-influence-free feedback. We validate the efficacy of SBO across multiple real-world applications, including thermal comfort, team building, travel negotiation, and energy trading collaboration.</description>

      <title>Fairness in Multi-Agent AI: A Unified Framework for Ethical and Equitable Autonomous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring fairness in decentralized multi-agent systems presents significant challenges due to emergent biases, systemic inefficiencies, and conflicting agent incentives. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of fairness in multi-agent AI, introducing a novel framework where fairness is treated as a dynamic, emergent property of agent interactions. The framework integrates fairness constraints, bias mitigation strategies, and incentive mechanisms to align autonomous agent behaviors with societal values while balancing efficiency and robustness. Through empirical validation, we demonstrate that incorporating fairness constraints results in more equitable decision-making. This work bridges the gap between AI ethics and system design, offering a foundation for accountable, transparent, and socially responsible multi-agent AI systems.</description>

      <title>The Combined Problem of Online Task Assignment and Lifelong Path Finding in Logistics Warehouses: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the combined problem of online task assignment and lifelong path finding, which is crucial for the logistics industries. However, most literature either (1) focuses on lifelong path finding assuming a given task assigner, or (2) studies the offline version of this problem where tasks are known in advance. We argue that, to maximize the system throughput, the online version that integrates these two components should be tackled directly. To this end, we introduce a formal framework of the combined problem and its solution concept. Then, we design a rule-based lifelong planner under a practical robot model that works well even in environments with severe local congestion. Upon that, we automate the search for the task assigner with respect to the underlying path planner. Simulation experiments conducted in warehouse scenarios at \textit{Meituan}, one of the largest shopping platforms in China, demonstrate that (a)~\textit{in terms of time efficiency}, our system requires only 83.77\% of the execution time needed for the currently deployed system at Meituan, outperforming other SOTA algorithms by 8.09\%; (b)~\textit{in terms of economic efficiency}, ours can achieve the same throughput with only 60\% of the agents currently in use.</description>

      <title>Coupling Agent-Based Simulations and VR universes: the case of GAMA and Unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) and video games, including those taking advantage of virtual reality (VR), have undergone a remarkable parallel evolution, achieving impressive levels of complexity and sophistication. This paper argues that while ABMs prioritize scientific analysis and understanding and VR aims for immersive entertainment, they both simulate artificial worlds and can benefit from closer integration. Coupling both approaches indeed opens interesting possibilities for research and development in various fields, and in particular education, at the heart of the SIMPLE project, an EU-funded project on the development of digital tools for awareness raising on environmental issues. However, existing tools often present limitations, including technical complexity, limited functionalities, and lack of interoperability. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework for linking GAMA, a popular ABM platform, with Unity, a widely used game engine. This framework enables seamless data exchange, real-time visualization, and user interaction within VR environments, allowing researchers to leverage the strengths of both ABMs and VR for more impactful and engaging simulations. We demonstrate the capabilities of our framework through two prototypes built to highlight its potential in representing and interacting with complex socio-environmental system models. We conclude by emphasizing the importance of continued collaboration between the ABM and VR communities to develop robust, user-friendly tools, paving the way for a new era of collaborative research and immersive experiences in simulations.</description>

      <title>Task Offloading in Vehicular Edge Computing using Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) has introduced significant challenges in managing the complex, computation-intensive tasks generated by modern vehicles while offloading tasks to external computing infrastructures such as edge computing (EC), nearby vehicular , and UAVs has become influential solution to these challenges. However, traditional computational offloading strategies often struggle to adapt to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of vehicular environments. In this study, we explored the potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) frameworks to optimize computational offloading through adaptive, real-time decision-making, and we have thoroughly investigated the Markov Decision Process (MDP) approaches on the existing literature. The paper focuses on key aspects such as standardized learning models, optimized reward structures, and collaborative multi-agent systems, aiming to advance the understanding and application of DRL in vehicular networks. Our findings offer insights into enhancing the efficiency, scalability, and robustness of ITS, setting the stage for future innovations in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>EvoFlow: Evolving Diverse Agentic Workflows On The Fly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The past two years have witnessed the evolution of large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems from labor-intensive manual design to partial automation (\textit{e.g.}, prompt engineering, communication topology) and eventually to fully automated design. However, existing agentic automation pipelines often lack LLM heterogeneity and focus on single-objective performance optimization, limiting their potential to combine weaker models for more customized and cost-effective solutions. To address this challenge, we propose EvoFlow, a niching evolutionary algorithm-based framework to automatically search a population of heterogeneous and complexity-adaptive agentic workflows, rather than a single homogeneous, complex workflow. Technically, EvoFlow performs \textit{(1) tag-based retrieval} to extract parent workflows from an agentic population, evolves new workflows through \textit{(2) crossover} and \textit{(3) mutation}, and employs \textit{(4) niching-based selection} to maintain population diversity and quality. Extensive evaluations across seven benchmarks demonstrate that EvoFlow is: \textbf{(I) diverse}, evolving a population of workflows ranging from simple I/O tasks to complex multi-turn interactions; \textbf{(II) high-performing}, outperforming previous handcrafted and automated workflows by $1.23\%\sim29.86\%$; \textbf{(III) economical}, surpassing powerful \llmname{o1-preview} at $12.4\%$ of its inference cost using weaker open-source models.</description>

      <title>Distributed Value Decomposition Networks with Networked Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of distributed training under partial observability, whereby cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning agents (MARL) maximize the expected cumulative joint reward. We propose distributed value decomposition networks (DVDN) that generate a joint Q-function that factorizes into agent-wise Q-functions. Whereas the original value decomposition networks rely on centralized training, our approach is suitable for domains where centralized training is not possible and agents must learn by interacting with the physical environment in a decentralized manner while communicating with their peers. DVDN overcomes the need for centralized training by locally estimating the shared objective. We contribute with two innovative algorithms, DVDN and DVDN (GT), for the heterogeneous and homogeneous agents settings respectively. Empirically, both algorithms approximate the performance of value decomposition networks, in spite of the information loss during communication, as demonstrated in ten MARL tasks in three standard environments.</description>

      <title>MAPF-GPT: Imitation Learning for Multi-Agent Pathfinding at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00134v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is a problem that generally requires finding collision-free paths for multiple agents in a shared environment. Solving MAPF optimally, even under restrictive assumptions, is NP-hard, yet efficient solutions for this problem are critical for numerous applications, such as automated warehouses and transportation systems. Recently, learning-based approaches to MAPF have gained attention, particularly those leveraging deep reinforcement learning. Typically, such learning-based MAPF solvers are augmented with additional components like single-agent planning or communication. Orthogonally, in this work we rely solely on imitation learning that leverages a large dataset of expert MAPF solutions and transformer-based neural network to create a foundation model for MAPF called MAPF-GPT. The latter is capable of generating actions without additional heuristics or communication. MAPF-GPT demonstrates zero-shot learning abilities when solving the MAPF problems that are not present in the training dataset. We show that MAPF-GPT notably outperforms the current best-performing learnable MAPF solvers on a diverse range of problem instances and is computationally efficient during inference.</description>

      <title>MA-DV2F: A Multi-Agent Navigation Framework using Dynamic Velocity Vector Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we propose MA-DV2F: Multi-Agent Dynamic Velocity Vector Field. It is a framework for simultaneously controlling a group of vehicles in challenging environments. DV2F is generated for each vehicle independently and provides a map of reference orientation and speed that a vehicle must attain at any point on the navigation grid such that it safely reaches its target. The field is dynamically updated depending on the speed and proximity of the ego-vehicle to other agents. This dynamic adaptation of the velocity vector field allows prevention of imminent collisions. Experimental results show that MA-DV2F outperforms concurrent methods in terms of safety, computational efficiency and accuracy in reaching the target when scaling to a large number of vehicles.

      <title>(Ir)rationality in AI: State of the Art, Research Challenges and Open Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17165v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of rationality is central to the field of artificial intelligence. Whether we are seeking to simulate human reasoning, or the goal is to achieve bounded optimality, we generally seek to make artificial agents as rational as possible. Despite the centrality of the concept within AI, there is no unified definition of what constitutes a rational agent. This article provides a survey of rationality and irrationality in artificial intelligence, and sets out the open questions in this area. The understanding of rationality in other fields has influenced its conception within artificial intelligence, in particular work in economics, philosophy and psychology. Focusing on the behaviour of artificial agents, we consider irrational behaviours that can prove to be optimal in certain scenarios. Some methods have been developed to deal with irrational agents, both in terms of identification and interaction, however work in this area remains limited. Methods that have up to now been developed for other purposes, namely adversarial scenarios, may be adapted to suit interactions with artificial agents. We further discuss the interplay between human and artificial agents, and the role that rationality plays within this interaction; many questions remain in this area, relating to potentially irrational behaviour of both humans and artificial agents.</description>

      <title>Safe Interval RRT* for Scalable Multi-Robot Path Planning in Continuous Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01752v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of Multi-Robot Path Planning (MRPP) in continuous space. The difficulty of the problem arises from the extremely large search space caused by the combinatorial nature of the problem and the continuous state space. We propose a two-level approach where the low level is a sampling-based planner Safe Interval RRT* (SI-RRT*) that finds a collision-free trajectory for individual robots. The high level can use any method that can resolve inter-robot conflicts where we employ two representative methods that are Prioritized Planning (SI-CPP) and Conflict Based Search (SI-CCBS). Experimental results show that SI-RRT* can quickly find a high-quality solution with a few samples. SI-CPP exhibits improved scalability while SI-CCBS produces higher-quality solutions compared to the state-of-the-art planners for continuous space.</description>

      <title>Paying to Do Better: Games with Payments between Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In repeated games, such as auctions, players typically use learning algorithms to choose their actions. The use of such autonomous learning agents has become widespread on online platforms. In this paper, we explore the impact of players incorporating monetary transfer policies into their agents' algorithms, aiming to influence behavior in their favor through the dynamics between the agents. Our focus is on understanding when players have incentives to make use of monetary transfers, how such payments may affect learning dynamics, and what the implications are for welfare and its distribution among the players. We propose a simple and general game-theoretic model to capture such scenarios. Our results on general games show that in a very broad class of games, self-interested players benefit from letting their learning agents make payments to other learners during the game dynamics, and that in many cases, this kind of behavior improves welfare for all players. Our results on first- and second-price auctions show that in equilibria of the ``payment policy game,'' the agents' dynamics reach strong collusive outcomes with low revenue for the auctioneer. These results raise new questions and highlight a challenge for mechanism design in systems where automated learning agents can benefit from interacting with their peers in the digital ecosystem and outside the boundaries of the mechanism.</description>

      <title>InvestESG: A multi-agent reinforcement learning benchmark for studying climate investment as a social dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: InvestESG is a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) benchmark designed to study the impact of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) disclosure mandates on corporate climate investments. The benchmark models an intertemporal social dilemma where companies balance short-term profit losses from climate mitigation efforts and long-term benefits from reducing climate risk, while ESG-conscious investors attempt to influence corporate behavior through their investment decisions. Companies allocate capital across mitigation, greenwashing, and resilience, with varying strategies influencing climate outcomes and investor preferences. We are releasing open-source versions of InvestESG in both PyTorch and JAX, which enable scalable and hardware-accelerated simulations for investigating competing incentives in mitigate climate change. Our experiments show that without ESG-conscious investors with sufficient capital, corporate mitigation efforts remain limited under the disclosure mandate. However, when a critical mass of investors prioritizes ESG, corporate cooperation increases, which in turn reduces climate risks and enhances long-term financial stability. Additionally, providing more information about global climate risks encourages companies to invest more in mitigation, even without investor involvement.
