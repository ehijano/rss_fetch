      <title>What the Boltzmann money game teaches us about statistical mechanics (and maybe economics)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note explains why a large class of fair, or reversible "money games", i.e., stochastic models of wealth redistribution among agents, lead to steady states described by canonical and microcanonical distributions. The games considered include, for example, ones where more than two agents can be simultaneously involved in money transfers (similarly to many-body collisions in chemical kinetics) and where amounts transferred between agents are random. At the same time, money games that break time reversal symmetry can also lead to the canonical/microcanonical distributions, as illustrated by an explicit example.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Spin Exchange via Temperature-Dependent Transition States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-exchange collisions have been widely studied in recent years, and various quantum-mechanical scattering approaches have been developed to calculate the rates. However, these methods based on global knowledge of wavefunctions can be computationally demanding and do not offer a simple mechanistic interpretation. Here, we present a new semiclassical transition-state theory (SCTST) derived from first principles to describe the nonadiabatic transition between two states which differ only in their spins, where classical TST and Landau--Zener theory fail. We apply our theory to describe the spin-exchange collision between the nuclear spin of 3He and the electronic spin of 23Na. SCTST reveals that the reaction proceeds via a temperature-dependent transition state, determined by an intricate compromise between minimizing the activation energy and maximizing the hyperfine coupling. It further demonstrates the importance of quantum delocalization effects prevalent in spin exchange even when tunneling is suppressed and successfully explains the weak temperature dependence of the rate. Moreover, since it depends only on local information at a single point, the computational cost is significantly reduced.</description>

      <title>The multiconfigurational ground state of a diradicaloid characterized at the atomic scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the tip-induced generation and scanning probe characterization of a singlet diradicaloid, consisting of two phenalenyl units connected by an sp-hybridized C$_{4}$ chain, on an ultrathin insulating NaCl surface. The bond-order contrast along the C$_{4}$ chain measured by atomic force microscopy and mapping of charge-state transitions by scanning tunneling microscopy, in conjunction with multiconfigurational calculations, reveal that the molecule exhibits a many-body ground state. Our study experimentally demonstrates the manifestation of strong electronic correlations in the geometric and electronic structures of a single molecule.</description>

      <title>On the Simulation of Conical Intersections in Water and Methanimine Molecules Via Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic structure of methanimine (CH2NH) and water (H2O) molecules in an effort to locate conical intersections (CIs) using variational quantum algorithms. Our approach implements and compares a range of hybrid quantum-classical methods, including the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD), VQE with Automatically-Adjusted Constraints (VQE-AC), and we explore molecular configurations of interest using a State-Average (SA) approach. Exact Diagonalization is employed as the classical benchmark to evaluate the accuracy of the quantum algorithms. We perform simulations across a range of molecular geometries, basis sets, and active spaces to compare each algorithm's performance and accuracy, and to enhance the detectability of CIs. This work confirms the quantum variational algorithms' capability of describing conical intersections in both molecules, as long as appropriate active spaces and geometries of the molecule are chosen. We also compare the accuracy and reliability of VQE-based methods for computing excited states with classical benchmark methods, and we demonstrate good agreement within desired regions.</description>

      <title>Molecular spin qudits to test generalized Bell inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Yb(trensal) molecular nanomagnet, embedding an electronic spin qubit coupled to a nuclear spin qudit, provides an ideal platform to probe entanglement in a qubit-qudit system.This is demonstrated by developing an optimized pulse sequence to show violation of generalized Bell inequalities and by performing realistic numerical simulations including experimentally measured decoherence. We find that the inequalities are safely violated in a wide range of parameters, proving the robustness of entanglement in the investigated system. Furthermore, we propose a scheme to study qudit-qudit entanglement on a molecular spin trimer, in which two spins 3/2 are linked via an interposed switch to turn on and off their mutual interaction.</description>

      <title>Revealing Nanoscale Ni-Oxidation State Variations in Single-Crystal NMC811 via 2D and 3D Spectro-Ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enabling lithium (Li)-ion batteries with higher energy densities, longer cycle life, and lower costs will underpin the widespread electrification of the transportation and large-scale energy storage industries. Nickel (Ni)-rich layered oxide cathodes, such as LiNi$_{x}$Mn$_{y}$Co$_{z}$O$_{2}$ (NMC, x &gt; 0.8), have gained popularity due to their high specific capacities and lower cobalt content. However, the standard polycrystalline morphology suffers from accelerated degradation at voltages above 4.2 V versus graphite, due to its increased mechanical and chemical instability. Single-crystal NMC (SC-NMC) has emerged as a promising morphology for suppressing the mechanical instability by preventing intergranular cracking; however, robust methods of understanding its chemical degradation pathways are required. We demonstrate how a high-throughput data collection strategy unlocks the ability to perform 2D and 3D ptychography in minutes, where it currently requires hours, and combine this with X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) to visualise the local Ni oxidation state behaviour in SC-NMC811, with nanometre-scale spatial resolution, and use this as a proxy for state-of-charge. By employing this technique at various stages during lifetime cycling to high voltages (&gt;4.2 V), direct mapping of chemical degradation along the Li channels, identification of nucleation sites, and observation of Ni oxidation state heterogeneities across both electrode and particle scales can be achieved. We further correlate these heterogeneities with the formation and growth of the rocksalt phase and oxygen-induced planar gliding. This methodology will advance the fundamental understanding of how high-Ni layered oxide materials chemically degrade during high-voltage operation, guiding the design of more durable battery materials.</description>

      <title>Simplified, Physically Motivated, and Broadly Applicable Range-Separation Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Range-separated hybrid functionals (RSH) with ``ionization energy'' and/or ``optimal tuning'' of the screening parameter have proven to be among the most practical and accurate approaches for describing excited-state properties across a wide range of systems, including condensed matter. However, this method typically requires multiple self-consistent calculations and can become computationally expensive and unstable, particularly for extended systems. In this work, we propose a very simple and efficient alternative approach to determine the screening parameter for RSH based solely on the total electron density of the system and the compressibility sum rule of density functional theory (DFT). This effective screening parameter achieves remarkable accuracy, particularly for charge-transfer excitations, surpassing the performance of previously suggested alternatives. Because it relies only on the electron density, the proposed approach is physically transparent and highly practical to automate DFT calculations in large and complex systems, including bulk solids, where ``tuning'' is not possible.</description>

      <title>Extending orbital-optimized density functional theory to L-edge XPS and beyond: Spin-orbit coupling via non-orthogonal quasi-degenerate perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum mechanical calculations of core electron binding energies (CEBEs) leading to 2p hole states are relevant to interpreting L-edge x-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS), as well as higher edges. Orbital-optimized density functional theory (OO-DFT) accurately predicts K-edge CEBEs but is challenged by the presence of significant spin-orbit coupling (SOC) at L- and higher edges. To extend OO-DFT to L-edges and higher, our method utilizes scalar-relativistic, spin-restricted OO-DFT to construct a minimal, quasi-degenerate basis of core-hole states corresponding to a chosen inner-shell (e.g. ionizing all six possible 2p spin orbitals). Non-orthogonal configuration interaction (NOCI) is then used to make the matrix elements of the full Hamiltonian including SOC in this quasi-degenerate model space of determinants. Using a screened 1-electron SOC operator parametrized with the Dirac-Coulomb-Breit (DCB) Hamiltonian results in doublet splitting (DS) values for 3rd row atoms that are nearly in quantitative agreement with experiment. The resulting NOCI eigenvalues are shifted by the average of the (scalar) OO-DFT CEBEs to yield CEBEs (split by SOC) corrected for dynamic correlation. Comparing calculations on gas phase molecules with experimental results establishes that NO-QDPT with the SCAN functional (NO-QDPT/SCAN), using the DCB screened 1-electron SOC operator is accurate to about 0.2 eV for L-edge CEBEs of molecules containing 3rd row atoms. However, this NO-QDPT approach becomes less accurate for 4th-row elements starting in the middle of the 3d transition metal series, especially as the atomic number increases.</description>

      <title>Static Electric Dipole Polarizability and Hyperpolarizability Tensors from Mean-Field Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First-order electric dipole response functions are implemented for cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) generalizations of Hartree-Fock (HF) and Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) in order to assess the degree to which static molecular response properties are impacted by interactions between electronic degrees of freedom and an optical cavity mode. Isotropically averaged static electric dipole polarizability tensors from QED-HF and QED-DFT are found to be somewhat insensitive to the presence of the cavity under realistic single-molecule coupling strengths. In contrast, the first hyperpolarizability tensor computed using QED-HF can be significantly modified by the cavity, depending on the relative orientation of the molecule and cavity mode polarization axis. For example, compared to the isolated molecule case, the isotropically averaged hyperpolarizability for $p$-nitroaniline decreases by more than 20% when the molecule is coupled to a single-mode optical cavity with a coupling strength of $|\lambda| = 0.05$ a.u. and when the cavity mode is polarized along the principal molecular axis. On the other hand, with this coupling strength and polarization, the isotropically averaged static dipole polarizability from QED-HF or QED-DFT decreases by only $\approx$ 2--5%, depending on the choice of DFT functional.</description>

      <title>Information encoding in spherical DFT</title>

Abstract: Spherical density functional theory (DFT) is a reformulation of the classic theorems of DFT, in which the role of the total density of a many-electron system is replaced by a set of sphericalized densities, constructed by spherically-averaging the total electron density about each atomic nucleus. In Hohenberg-Kohn DFT and its constrained-search generalization, the electron density suffices to reconstruct the spatial locations and atomic numbers of the constituent atoms, and thus the external potential. However, the original proofs of spherical DFT require knowledge of the atomic locations at which each sphericalized density originates, in addition to the set of sphericalized densities themselves. In the present work, we utilize formal results from geometric algebra -- in particular, the subfield of distance geometry -- to show that this spatial information is encoded within the ensemble of sphericalized densities themselves, and does not require independent specification. Consequently, the set of sphericalized densities uniquely determines the total external potential of the system, exactly as in Hohenberg-Kohn DFT. This theoretical result is illustrated through numerical examples for LiF and for glycine, the simplest amino acid. In addition to establishing a sound practical foundation for spherical DFT, the extended theorem provides a rationale for the use of sphericalized atomic basis densities -- rather than orientation-dependent basis functions -- when designing classical or machine-learned potentials for atomistic simulation.</description>

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations present a data-mining challenge, given that they can generate a considerable amount of data but often rely on limited or biased human interpretation to examine their information content. By not asking the right questions of MD data we may miss critical information hidden within it. We combine dimensionality reduction (UMAP) and unsupervised hierarchical clustering (HDBSCAN) to quantitatively characterize prevalent coordination environments of chemical species within MD data. By focusing on local coordination, we significantly reduce the amount of data to be analyzed by extracting all distinct molecular formulas within a given coordination sphere. We then efficiently combine UMAP and HDBSCAN with alignment or shape-matching algorithms to partition these formulas into structural isomer families indicating their relative populations. The method was employed to reveal details of cation coordination in electrolytes based on molecular liquids.</description>

      <title>Tree tensor network hierarchical equations of motion based on time-dependent variational principle for efficient open quantum dynamics in structured thermal environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient method TTN-HEOM for exactly calculating the open quantum dynamics for driven quantum systems interacting with highly structured bosonic baths by combining the tree tensor network (TTN) decomposition scheme to the bexcitonic generalization of the numerically-exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM). The method yields a series of quantum master equations for all core tensors in the TTN that efficiently and accurately capture the open quantum dynamics for non-Markovian environments to all orders in the system-bath interaction. These master equations are constructed based on the time-dependent Dirac--Frenkel variational principle which isolates the optimal dynamics for the core tensors given the TTN ansatz. The dynamics converges to the HEOM when increasing the rank of the core tensors, a limit in which the TTN ansatz becomes exact. We introduce TENSO, Tensor Equations for Non-Markovian Structured Open systems, as a general-purpose Python code to propagate the TTN-HEOM dynamics. We implement three general propagators for the coupled master equations: Two fixed-rank methods that require a constant memory footprint during the dynamics, and one adaptive-rank method with variable memory footprint controlled by the target level of computational error. We exemplify the utility of these methods by simulating a two-level system coupled to a structured bath containing one Drude--Lorentz component and eight Brownian oscillators, which is beyond what can presently be computed using the standard HEOM. Our results show that the TTN-HEOM is capable to simulate both dephasing and relaxation dynamics of driven quantum system interacting with structured baths, even those of chemical complexity, with affordable computational cost.</description>

      <title>FDTD with Auxiliary Bath Fields for Condensed-Phase Polaritonics: Fundamentals and Implementation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding condensed-phase polariton experiments requires accurately accounting for both realistic cavity geometries and the interplay between polaritons and material dark modes arising from microscopic molecular interactions. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) approach numerically propagates classical Maxwell's equations in the time domain, offering a versatile scheme for modeling polaritons in realistic cavities. However, the simple dielectric functions routinely used in FDTD often fail to describe molecular details. Consequently, standard FDTD calculations, to date, cannot accurately describe processes involving the complex coupling between polaritons and dark modes, such as polariton relaxation, transport, and condensation. For more faithful simulations of the energy flow between polaritons and dark modes, herein, local bath degrees of freedom coupled to the material polarization are explicitly included in FDTD to describe the dark-mode dynamics. This method -- FDTD with auxiliary bath fields (FDTD-Bath) -- is implemented in the open-source MEEP package by adding a Lorentz-Bath material susceptibility, where explicit bath modes are coupled to conventional Lorentz oscillators. With this Lorentz-Bath susceptibility, linear polariton spectra and Rabi-splitting-dependent polariton relaxation rates in planar Fabry--P\'erot cavities are reproduced more accurately than those with the conventional Lorentz susceptibility. Supported by a user-friendly Python interface and efficient MPI parallelism, the FDTD-Bath approach implemented in MEEP is ready to model a wide range of polariton phenomena involving realistic cavity geometries.</description>
