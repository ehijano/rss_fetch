      <title>Outflow from the very massive Wolf-Rayet binary Melnick 34</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Melnick 34 (Mk 34) is one of the most massive binary systems known and is one of the brightest X-ray point sources in the 30 Doradus region. We investigated the impact of this massive system on the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM) using the optical spectroscopic capabilities of the narrow-field mode (NFM) of the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). MUSE-NFM spatially resolved the ISM in the vicinity of Mk 34 with a resolution comparable to that of the HST. The analysis of the [NII]$\lambda$6583 and [SII]$\lambda$6717 emission lines reveals a cone-like structure apparently originating from Mk 34 and extending southeast. Electron density maps and radial velocity measurements of the ISM lines further support an outflow scenario traced by these emissions. While no clear northwestern counterpart to this outflow was observed, we note increased extinction in that direction, towards the R136 cluster. The ISM material along the projected diagonal of the outflow on both sides of Mk 34 shows similar properties in terms of the emission line ratios seen in the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich diagram. These results are consistent across two observational epochs. Additionally, we examined the residual maps within a 0.5" radius of Mk 34 after modeling and subtracting the point spread function. The observed variations in the residuals could potentially be linked to Mk 34's known periodic behavior. However, further observations with appropriate cadence are needed to fully monitor the 155 day periodicity of Mk 34's X-ray emissions.</description>

      <title>Modeling contact binaries, III. Population of massive binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among massive stars, binary interaction is the rule rather than the exception. The closest binaries, those with periods of less than about 10 days, undergo mass transfer during core-hydrogen burning, with many of them experiencing a nuclear-timescale contact phase. Current binary population synthesis models predict the mass-ratio distribution of contact binaries to be heavily skewed toward a mass ratio of unity, which is inconsistent with observations. It has been shown that effects of tidal deformation due to the Roche potential, as well as energy transfer in the common layers of a contact binary, alter the internal structure of close binary components. However, previous population studies neglected these effects. We model a population of massive binary stars that undergo mass transfer during core-hydrogen burning, while consistently considering the effects of tidal deformation and energy transfer in contact phases. We use the MESA binary-evolution code to compute large grids of models with primary star masses of $8\,M_\odot$ to $70\,M_\odot$ at Solar metallicity. We then perform a population synthesis study to predict distribution functions of the observational properties of close binary systems, focusing in particular on the mass and luminosity ratio distribution. We find that the effects of tidal deformation and energy transfer have a limited effect on the predicted mass-ratio distribution of massive contact binaries. Only a small fraction of the population has their mass ratio significantly shifted toward a more unequal configuration. However, we suggest that orbital hardening could affect the evolution of contact binaries and their progenitors, and we advocate for a homogeneous set of observed contact binary parameters.</description>

      <title>Constraining core-to-envelope differential rotation in gamma-doradus stars from inertial dips properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of dips in the gravito-inertial modes period-spacing pattern of gamma-Dor stars is now well established by recent asteroseismic studies. Such Lorentzian-shaped inertial dips arise from the interaction of gravito-inertial modes propagating in the radiative envelope of intermediate-mass main sequence stars with pure inertial modes that propagate in their convective core. We aim to investigate the signature of a differential rotation between the convective core and the near-core region inside gamma-Dor stars from the inertial dip properties. We first describe the bi-layer rotation profile we use and the approximations we adopt to maintain the analyticity of our study. We then describe our results on the inertial dip formation, location, and shape. We derive a modified Lorentzian profile and we compare it to the previously obtained results in the solid-body rotation case. This work highlights the inertial dips' probing power of the convective core rotation, an important observable in the context of the understanding of the angular momentum transport and chemicals mixing inside stars.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Sun's coronal magnetic field using the Zeeman effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regular remote sensing of the magnetic field embedded within the million-degree solar corona is severely lacking. This reality impedes fundamental investigations of the nature of coronal heating, the generation of solar and stellar winds, and the impulsive release of energy into the solar system via flares and other eruptive phenomena. Resulting from advancements in large aperture solar coronagraphy, we report unprecedented maps of polarized spectra emitted at 1074 nm by Fe+12 atoms in the active corona. We detect clear signatures of the Zeeman effect that are produced by the coronal magnetic field along the optically thin path length of its formation. Our comparisons with global magnetohydrodynamic models highlight the valuable constraints that these measurements provide for coronal modeling efforts, which are anticipated to yield subsequent benefits for space weather research and forecasting.</description>

      <title>Extending the ALMA Census of Circumstellar Disks in the Upper Scorpius OB Association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ALMA Band 7 continuum (340 GHz) and CO J=3-2 observations for an extended sample of disks in the Upper Scorpius OB Association (Upper Sco, age ~ 10 Myr). The targets were selected from previous studies that identified new members of Upper Sco using photometry and astrometry from the Gaia mission, and the presence of a disk has been inferred from mid-infrared excess emission. The new ALMA observations are combined with previous ALMA data to define a sample of 202 Upper Sco members with disks that have spectral types between G0 and M5.5. Among these sources, 120 (59%) have been detected in the continuum with a signal-to-noise ratio &gt;= 3, and 83 (41%) have been detected in CO J=3-2. Both the continuum and CO J=3-2 fluxes show a strong correlation with the spectral type of the central star and the type of disk inferred from the shape of the infrared spectral energy distribution, where disks around earlier type stars and full disks are more luminous than disks around later type stars and evolved and debris disks. The median dust continuum luminosity is lower for disks in Upper Sco than in younger regions, as found in previous studies, where the differences are more pronounced in later spectral types (M4-M5) than in earlier spectral types.</description>

      <title>Relationship Between the Tilt Angle of Sunspot Group and the Properties of the Next Solar Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the data from the Kodaikanal and Mount Wilson observatories, we investigate the relationships of the tilt angle of sunspot group (SG), including the mean tilt angle and the tilt-angle scatter, during the declining phase with the parameters of the next solar cycle (SC). The main findings are summarized in the following three points. (1) During the declining phase, the correlation between the mean tilt angle and the tilt-angle scatter is statistically insignificant. (2) Six quantities measured during the declining phase show significant anti-correlations with the strength and amplitude of the next SC, and positive correlations with the duration of the ascending phase of the next SC: the standard deviation of tilt angles, the root-mean-square tilt angle, the mean absolute value of tilt angles, the area-weighted absolute value of tilt angles, the latitude-weighted absolute value of tilt angles, and the area- and latitude-weighted absolute value of tilt angles. (3) The correlations of the mean tilt angle, the area-weighted tilt angle, the latitude-weighted tilt angle, and the area- and latitude- weighted tilt angle during the declining phase with the strength, amplitude, and duration of the ascending phase of the next SC are statistically insignificant. These findings demonstrate that the modulation of parameters of the next SC by the tilt-angle scatter during the declining phase plays a vital role in regulating SC variability.</description>

      <title>Searching for radio late-type dwarf stars in the GLEAM-X DR1 catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a new method of multi-wavelength data combination for the search of late-type radio dwarfs, and have put it into practice using GLEAM-X DR1 data. The initial sample is selected by cross-matching the Gaia/DR3 objects with the probability of being a star no less than 99$\%$, and removing the extragalactic objects assigned by the SIMBAD database. The late-type dwarf stars are judged according to their location in the $(BP-RP)_0/M_{\rm G}$ color-magnitude diagram and in the $(J-H)_0/(K-W1)_0$ near-infrared color-color diagram. Furthermore, stellar activity is searched by ultraviolet excess in the GALEX/NUV band and the Rossby number in the TESS light curves. In total, 12 stars are found to be late-type dwarf stars associated with radio source, which is consisted of five stars with the UV excess and seven stars with the Rossby number less than 0.13. Three of these 12 stars are previously studied to be associated with radio objects. All these 12 stars are considered to be reliable counterparts of radio sources.</description>

      <title>Structural and Nucleosynthetic Evolution of Metal-poor &amp; Metal-free Low- and Intermediate-Mass Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this PhD thesis we investigate stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis in the low- and extremely-low metallicity regime - including models of stars with a pure Big Bang composition (i.e. $\rm{Z} = 0$). The metallicity range of the extremely metal-poor (EMP) models calculated is $-6.5 &lt; \rm{[Fe/H]} &lt; -3.0$, with a mass range $0.85 &lt; \rm{M} &lt; 3.0~\rm{M}_{\odot}$. We have also calculated a series of models with a metallicity of $\rm{[Fe/H]} = -1.4$, to compare with observations of abundance patterns in Galactic globular cluster stars. Many of the extremely metal-poor (EMP) and $\rm{Z} = 0$ models experience violent evolutionary episodes not seen at higher metallicities. We refer to these events as `Dual Flashes' (DF) since they are characterised by peaks in the hydrogen and helium burning luminosities occurring at the same time. Some of the material processed by these events is later dredged up by the convective envelope, causing very significant surface pollution. We have calculated the entire evolution of the $\rm{Z} = 0$ and EMP models, including detailed nucleosynthesis and yields. Although subject to many uncertainties these are, as far as we are aware, the only yields available in this mass and metallicity range. We find that our models predict an increased number of carbon-rich stars at the lowest metallicities. This is mainly due to the extra pollution provided by the DF events - which do not occur in higher metallicity models. This concurs well with the observations that show the proportion of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in the Galactic Halo to be higher at lower metallicities. We also compare the chemical pollution arising from our models with the detailed abundance patterns available for some of the most metal-poor CEMP stars, and find mixed results. Fluid dynamics calculations are likely needed to model the violent DF episodes. [Abridged]</description>

      <title>Weighing Single-lined Spectroscopic Binaries Using Tidal Effects on Radial Velocities: The Case of V723 Monocerotis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In single-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB1s) where flux variations due to tidal deformation of the primary star (ellipsoidal variations, EVs) are detected, the binary mass can be determined by combining EVs with the primary's radial velocity (RV) variations from orbital motion and information about the primary's radius. This method has been used for mass estimation in close binaries including X-ray systems, but it has been pointed out that contaminating light from sources other than the primary star could introduce systematic errors in the mass and inclination estimates. Here, we focus on the apparent RV variations caused by asymmetric distortion of the absorption lines of the tidally deformed primary star (tidal RV). Because this signal contains information equivalent to that from photometric EVs, it enables mass estimation of the binary system using only the primary star's absorption lines from high-resolution spectroscopic data, providing a potentially more robust approach against contaminating light. We apply the method to the binary system V723 Monocerotis, where both photometric EV and tidal RV signals are detected, and successfully determine the component masses using only the primary star's RVs and projected rotational velocity, without relying on absolute flux measurements or on stellar evolutionary models. The masses derived from the tidal RV model show a reasonable agreement with those obtained from EVs after carefully modeling the flux contamination from the secondary. This result demonstrates that tidal RVs provide a useful alternative means for mass estimation in SB1s.</description>

      <title>Bolometric Corrections for FU Ori Object Accretion Disk Luminosities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accretion luminosity of an FU Ori disk is a fundamental system parameter, but a challenging one to estimate for all but the most well-studied systems. FU Ori objects are dynamically evolving accretion disks, especially close in time to the outburst epoch. They have a complex multi-temperature disk structure that results in distinctly shaped, broad SEDs. Detailed spectroscopic analysis is required for simultaneous constraint on relevant physical parameters such as the central stellar mass, inner disk radius, disk inclination, and disk accretion rate. However, outbursting systems that are deeply embedded and/or distant may be limited to only photometric measurement, and over only a narrow range of wavelengths. The bolometric corrections necessary to estimate accretion luminosities are not straightforward, and in particular can not be adopted from existing literature on isotropically radiating stars. We present bolometric corrections specific to astrophysical accretion disks for a variety of filters in ongoing and upcoming all-sky surveys.</description>

      <title>Absolute Dimensions of the Interferometric Binary HD 174881: A Test of Stellar Evolution Models for Evolved Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report high-resolution spectroscopic monitoring and long-baseline interferometric observations with the PTI of the 215-day binary system HD 174881 (K1 II-III), composed of two giant stars. The system is spatially resolved with the PTI, as well as in archival measurements with the CHARA Array. Our analysis of these observations, along with an analysis of the spectral energy distribution, have allowed us to infer accurate values for the absolute masses ($3.367^{+0.045}_{-0.041} M_{\odot}$ and $3.476^{+0.043}_{-0.043} M_{\odot}$), radii ($34.0 \pm 1.3 R_{\odot}$ and $22.7 \pm 1.8 R_{\odot}$), effective temperatures ($4620 \pm 100$ K and $4880 \pm 150$ K), and bolometric luminosities of both components, as well as other properties including the orbital parallax (distance). These provide valuable tests of stellar evolution models for evolved stars, which are still relatively uncommon compared to the situation for main-sequence stars. We find generally good agreement of all of these properties of HD 174881 with two sets of recent models (MIST, and PARSEC) at compositions near solar, for ages of 255-273 Myr. We also find evidence of an infrared excess, based largely on the flux measurements from IRAS at 60 and 100 microns.</description>

      <title>Bow Shock and Local Bubble Plasma Unveiled by the Scintillating Millisecond Pulsar J0437$-$4715</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interstellar medium of the Milky Way contains turbulent plasma with structures driven by energetic processes that fuel star formation and shape the evolution of our Galaxy. Radio waves from pulsars are scattered off the small (au-scale and below) structures, resulting in frequency-dependent interference patterns that are modulated in time because of the relative motions of the pulsar, Earth, and plasma. Power spectral analyses of these patterns show parabolic arcs with curvatures that encode the locations and kinematics of individual structures. Here we report the discovery of at least 25 distinct plasma structures in the direction of the brilliant millisecond pulsar, PSR J0437$-$4715, in observations obtained with the MeerKAT radio telescope. Four arcs reveal structures within 5000 au of the pulsar, from a series of shocks induced as the pulsar and its wind interact with the ambient insterstellar medium. The measured radial distance and velocity of the main shock allows us to solve the shock geometry and space velocity of the pulsar in three dimensions, while the velocity of another structure unexpectedly indicates a back flow from the direction of the shock or pulsar-wind tail. The remaining 21 arcs represent a surprising abundance of structures sustained by turbulence within the Local Bubble -- a region of the interstellar medium thought to be depleted of gas by a series of supernova explosions about 14 Myr ago.</description>

      <title>Rising from the Ashes II: The Bar-driven Abundance Bimodality of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Milky Way hosts at least two modes in its present day distribution of Fe and alpha-elements. The exact cause of this bimodality is disputed, but one class of explanations involves the merger between the Milky Way and a relatively massive satellite (Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus) at z~2. However, reproducing this bimodality in simulations is not straightforward, with conflicting results on the prevalance, morphology, and mechanism behind multimodality. We present a case study of a galaxy in the Illustris TNG50 simulation which undergoes sequential phases of starburst, brief quiescence, and then rejuvenation. This scenario results in a pronounced abundance bimodality after a post-processing adjustment of the [alpha/Fe] of old stars designed to mimic a higher star formation efficiency in dense gas. The high- and low-alpha sequences are separated in time by the brief quiescent period, which is not associated with a merger but by the formation of a bar followed by AGN activity. This galaxy indicates a novel scenario in which the alpha-bimodality in the Milky Way is caused by the formation of the bar via AGN-induced quenching. In addition to a stellar age gap in the Milky Way, we predict that abundance bimodalities should be more common in barred as opposed to unbarred galaxies.</description>

Abstract: High precision differential astrometry assesses the positions, distances, and motions of celestial objects in relation to the stars. The focal plane of such space telescope must be calibrated with a precision down to the level of 1e-5 pixel in order to be able to detect Earth-like planets in the close vicinity of the Sun. The presented characterization bench is designed to improve the technology readiness level for the following key points: calibration of new detectors with a high number of pixels and correcting the field distortion using stars in the field of view. The first aim of the project concentrates on the characterization of a 46 megapixels sensor from PYXALIS, to assess its typical parameters using an integrating sphere. The next objective intends to map the intra and extra pixel quantum yield of the detector with a precision of 1e-5 pixels and investigate the evolution of the pixel geometry in response to environment fluctuations. To conduct these tests, an optical bench is designed with an LCD screen and a doublet, used as a source that allows directing light to specific groups of pixels. Interferometric calibration of the detector pixel centroid position will be achieved using fibers that illuminate the detector with Young's fringes. To characterize the distortion of the detector, a diaphragm will produce adjustable optical aberrations to be corrected and therefore change the source sensor positional relationship. The final step involves the simulation of a star's field, which will be imaged on the detector to assess optical quality.</description>

      <title>A data-driven approach for modeling the temporal and spectral evolution of kilonova systematic uncertainties</title>

Abstract: Kilonovae, possible electromagnetic counterparts to neutron star mergers, provide important information about high-energy transient phenomena and, in principle, also allow us to obtain information about the source properties responsible for powering the kilonova. Unfortunately, numerous uncertainties exist in kilonova modeling that, at the current stage, hinder accurate predictions. Hence, one has to account for possible systematic modeling uncertainties when interpreting the observed transients. In this work, we provide a data-driven approach to account for time-dependent and frequency-dependent uncertainties in kilonova models. Through a suite of tests, we find that the most reliable recovery of the source parameters and description of the observational data can be obtained through a combination of kilonova models with time- and frequency-dependent systematic uncertainties. We apply our new method to analyze AT2017gfo. While recovering a total ejecta mass consistent with previous studies, our approach gives insights into the temporal and spectral evolution of the systematic uncertainties of this kilonova. We consistently find a systematic error below $1$ mag between $1$ to $5$ days after the merger. Our work addresses the need for early follow-up of kilonovae at earlier times, and improved modeling of the kilonova at later times, to reduce the uncertainties outside of this time window.</description>

Abstract: Infrared interferometry has seen a revolution over the last few years. The advent of GRAVITY+ is about to enable high-contrast observations, all-sky coverage and faint science up to K=21, with the implementation on 8m-class telescope of extreme adaptive optics, wide-field observations, and soon laser guide stars, following a long-term vision of technological and infrastructure development at VLTI. This major progress in sensitivity lift a fundamental limitation of infrared interferometry, namely the brightness temperature achievable with this technique down to milli-arcsecond resolution imaging. This change of paradigm is a crucial element for the expansion of current arrays to a facility up to one to ten kilometer baselines. Micro-arcsecond scales imaging in the infrared on thermal objects, reaching the highest angular resolution possible even compared to VLBI, could offer a unique window in observational astronomy for the next generation instrument.</description>

      <title>Many elements matter: Detailed abundance patterns reveal star-formation and enrichment differences among Milky Way structural components</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many nucleosynthetic channels create the elements, but two-parameter models characterized by $\alpha$ and Fe nonetheless predict stellar abundances in the Galactic disk to accuracies of 0.02 to 0.05 dex for most measured elements, near the level of current abundance uncertainties. It is difficult to make individual measurements more precise than this to investigate lower-amplitude nucleosynthetic effects, but population studies of mean abundance patterns can reveal more subtle abundance differences. Here we look at the detailed abundances for 67315 stars from APOGEE DR17, but in the form of abundance residuals away from a best-fit two-parameter, data-driven nucleosynthetic model. We find that these residuals show complex structures with respect to age, guiding radius, and vertical action that are not random and are also not strongly correlated with sources of systematic error such as surface gravity, effective temperature, and radial velocity. The residual patterns, especially in Na, C+N, Ni, Mn, and Ce, trace kinematic structures in the Milky Way, such as the inner disk, thick disk, and flared outer disk. A principal component analysis suggests that most of the observed structure is low-dimensional and can be explained by a few eigenvectors. We find that some, but not all, of the effects in the low-$\alpha$ disk can be explained by dilution with fresh gas, so that abundance ratios resemble those of stars with higher metallicity. The patterns and maps we provide could be combined with accurate forward models of nucleosynthesis, star formation, and gas infall to provide a more detailed picture of star and element formation in different Milky Way components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the photometric performance of SPIRIT, a ground-based near-infrared InGaAs CMOS-based instrument (1280 by 1024 pixels, 12 micron pitch), using on-sky results from the SPECULOOS-Southern Observatory during 2022 - 2023. SPIRIT was specifically designed to optimise time-series photometric precision for observing late M and L type stars. To achieve this, a custom wide-pass filter (0.81 - 1.33 microns, zYJ ) was used, which was also designed to minimise the effects of atmospheric precipitable water vapour (PWV) variability on differential photometry. Additionally, SPIRIT was designed to be maintenance-free by eliminating the need for liquid nitrogen for cooling. We compared SPIRIT's performance with a deeply-depleted (2048 by 2048 pixels, 13.5 micron pitch) CCD-based instrument (using an I+z' filter, 0.7 - 1.1 microns) through simultaneous observations. For L type stars and cooler, SPIRIT exhibited better photometric noise performance compared to the CCD-based instrument. The custom filter also significantly minimised red noise in the observed light curves typically introduced by atmospheric PWV variability. In SPIRIT observations, the detector's read noise was the dominant limitation, although in some cases, we were limited by the lack of comparison stars.</description>

      <title>Planet-star interactions with precise transit timing. IV. Probing the regime of dynamical tides for GK host stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical studies show that stars of GK spectral types, with masses below 1.1 Sun mass, are depleted in hot Jupiters. This finding is evidence of tidal orbital decay during the main-sequence lifetime. Theoretical considerations show that in some configurations, the tidal energy dissipation can be boosted by non-linear effects in dynamical tides, which are wave-like responses to tidal forcing. To probe the regime of these dynamical tides in GK stars, we searched for orbital period shortening for 6 selected hot Jupiters in systems with 0.8-1 Sun mass host stars: HATS-18, HIP 65A, TrES-3, WASP-19, WASP-43, and WASP-173A. For the hot Jupiters of our sample, we analysed transit timing data sets based on mid-transit points homogeneously determined from observations performed with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and high-quality data available in the literature. For the TrES-3 system, we also used new transit light curves we acquired with ground-based telescopes. The mid-transit times were searched for shortening of orbital periods through statistical testing of quadratic transit ephemerides. Theoretical predictions on the dissipation rate for dynamical tides were calculated under the regimes of internal gravity waves (IGWs) undergoing wave breaking (WB) in stellar centres and weak non-linear (WNL) wave-wave interactions in radiative layers. Stellar parameters of the host stars, such as mass and age, which were used in those computations, were homogeneously redetermined using evolutionary models with the Bayesian inference. We found that transit times follow the refined linear ephemerides for all ultra-hot Jupiters of our sample. Non-detection of orbital decay allowed us to place lower constraints on the tidal dissipation rates in those planet-star systems. In three systems, HATS-18, WASP-19, and WASP-43, we reject a scenario with total dissipation of IGWs. We conclude that...</description>

      <title>Discrete element simulations of self-gravitating rubble pile collisions: the effects of non-uniform particle size and rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel implementation of a soft sphere, discrete elements code to simulate the dynamics of self-gravitating granular materials. The code is used to study the outcome of sub-sonic collisions between self-gravitating rubble piles with masses ranging from $\sim6\times10^{21}$ to $\sim6\times10^{22}$ g. These masses are representative of asteroids and planetesimals in the $\sim100$~km range. We simulate rubble piles composed of a range of particle sizes and analyze the collisions outcome focusing on the properties of the largest surviving fragment. We successfully test and validate the code against previous results. The results of our study show that rubble piles formed by collision of two parent rubble piles do not maintain the same particle size distribution as their parents. Rubble piles formed in low velocity collisions are characterized by a larger fraction of large particles, while the largest fragments of high-velocity collisions show a significant decrease in their mean particle size. We ascribe this effect to the fact that large particles transmit most of the forces during the collisions. In addition, we find that the mass of the largest post-collision fragment does depend on the rotation of the colliding rubble piles. This effect is especially noticeable when the pre-collision spin axes are parallel with each other and perpendicular to the relative velocity. This finding can be particularly relevant for meter to kilometer sized bodies embedded in protostellar accretion disks, where viscous stresses can efficiently align the target and projectile spin axes.</description>

      <title>Temporal and spectral variations of the X-ray pulsar Cen X-3 observed by NuSTAR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a time-resolved analysis of the accreting X-ray pulsar Cen X-3 using observations carried out by NuSTAR, which cover approximately two binary orbits in different intensity states. The pulse profile is relatively stable over the orbital phase and shows energy dependence. It has an obvious double-peaked shape in the energy band below 15 keV -- with the second pulse peak decreasing as energy increases -- and is gradually dominated by a single peak in higher energy bands. We find that the pulse profile in the energy band of 3-5 keV at high-intensity states shows a subtle triple-peaked shape, with the main peak divided into two subpeaks. We also find a positive correlation between the pulse fraction and both energy and flux. Our spectral analysis reveals that the spectra can be well described by the continuum of Fermi-Dirac cutoff and NPEX models, and the cyclotron line is detected with the centroid energies varying from 26 keV to 29 keV, along with the iron emission line around 6.4 keV. We investigated the dependence between the cyclotron resonant scattering feature (CRSF) centroid energy and luminosity and discuss the theoretical critical luminosity. Although the variation of $E_{\rm cyc}- L_X$ is not distinct, there is a possibility that the critical luminosity lies within the range of $\sim (0.5-4)\times 10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the band of $4-78$ keV. The photon index shows a strong positive correlation with luminosity. Our orbital-phase analysis reveals that the spectral parameters show orbital variability, and the highly variable photoelectric absorption may indicate the existence of clumpy stellar winds.</description>

      <title>Semi-supervised Spectral Classification of DESI White Dwarfs by Dimensionality Reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a new generation of large-sky spectroscopic surveys comes online, the enormous data volume poses unprecedented challenges in classifying spectra. Modern unsupervised techniques have the power to group spectra based on their dominant features, circumventing the complete reliance on training data suffered by supervised methods. We outline the use of dimensionality reduction to generate a 2D map of the structure of an intermediate-resolution spectroscopic dataset. This technique efficiently separates white dwarfs of different spectral classes in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument's Early Data Release (DESI EDR), identifying spectral features that had been missed even by visual classification. By focusing the method on particular spectral regions, we identify white dwarfs with helium features at 90 per cent recall, and cataclysmic variables at 100 per cent recall, illustrating rapid selection of low-contamination samples from spectroscopic surveys. We also demonstrate the use of dimensionality reduction in a supervised manner, outlining a procedure to classify any white dwarf spectrum in comparison with those in the DESI EDR. With upcoming surveys promising tens of millions of spectra, our work highlights the potential for semi-supervised techniques as an efficient means of classification and dataset visualisation.</description>

      <title>Are Lithium-Rich Giants Binaries? A Radial Velocity Variability Analysis of 1,400 Giants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-mass giants with large amounts of lithium (Li) have challenged stellar evolution for decades. One of the possibilities usually discussed to explain them involves the interaction with a close binary companion. This predicts that when compared against their non-enriched counterparts, Li-rich giants should preferentially be found as part of binary systems. In order to test this scenario, we assemble a sample of 1418 giants with radial velocities (RVs) from RAVE, GALAH, and Gaia, as well as stellar parameters and Li abundances from GALAH. Evolutionary states can be determined for 1030 of these giants. We develop a method that quantifies the degree of RV variability, which we use as a proxy for close binary companions. The method is tested and calibrated against samples of known RV standard stars and known spectroscopic binaries. We also compare the results of our RV variability analysis with binarity indicators from Gaia. We find that the accuracy of the classification is controlled by the precision of the RVs, which for the set of RVs available for the giants is 80-85%. Consistent with seismic studies, the resulting sample of giants contains a fraction of Li-rich objects in the red clump (RC) that is twice as large as that for first-ascent giants (RGB). Among RC giants, the fractions of Li-rich objects with high RV variability and with no RV variability are the same as those for Li-normal objects, which argues against a binary interaction scenario for the genesis of the bulk of Li-rich giants at that evolutionary stage. On the other hand, Li-rich giants in the RGB appear to have a small but detectable preference for higher RV variability, and thus possibly a larger close binary fraction, than the Li-normal giants at that stage. Additional measurements of the RVs of these giants at higher RV precision would greatly help confirm and more robustly quantify these results.</description>

      <title>Are nonrelativistic ground state $\ell$-boson stars only stable for $\ell=0$ and $\ell=1$?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous work we analyzed the linear stability of non-relativistic $\ell$-boson stars with respect to radial modes and showed that ground state configurations are stable with respect to these modes, whereas excited states are unstable. In this work we extend the analysis to non-spherical linear mode perturbations. To this purpose, we expand the wave function in terms of tensor spherical harmonics which allows us to decouple the perturbation equations into a family of radial problems. By using a combination of analytic and numerical methods, we show that ground state configurations with $\ell &gt; 1$ possess exponentially in time growing non-radial modes, whereas only oscillating modes are found for $\ell=0$ and $\ell=1$. This leads us to conjecture that nonrelativistic $\ell$-boson stars in their ground state are stable for $\ell=1$ as well as $\ell=0$, while ground state and excited configurations with $\ell &gt; 1$ are unstable.</description>

For the first time, we find convincing spatial-temporal evidence of avalanching behaviour resulting from vortex depinning and collective motion. During a typical avalanche, about 10 to 20 vortices exit the container in a short period, producing a glitch in the superfluid angular momentum and a localised void in the vorticity. After the glitch, vortices continue to depin and circulate around the vorticity void in a similar manner to that seen in previous point-vortex simulations. We present evidence of collective vortex motion throughout this avalanche process. We also show that the effective Magnus force can be used to predict when and where avalanches will occur. Lastly, we comment on the challenge of extrapolating these results to conditions in real neutron stars, which contain many orders of magnitude more vortices.</description>
