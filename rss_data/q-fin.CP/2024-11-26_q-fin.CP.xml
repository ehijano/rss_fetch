      <title>Do Activists Align with Larger Mutual Funds?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates that hedge funds tend to design their activist campaigns to align with the preferences and ideologies of institutions holding large stakes in the target company. I estimate these preferences by analyzing the institutions' previous proxy voting behavior. The results reveal that activists benefit from this approach. Campaigns with a stronger positive correlation between the preferences of larger institutions and activist communications attract more shareholder attention, receive more votes, and are more likely to succeed.</description>

      <title>Predictive Power of LLMs in Financial Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the movement of the stock market and other assets has been valuable over the past few decades. Knowing how the value of a certain sector market may move in the future provides much information for investors, as they use that information to develop strategies to maximize profit or minimize risk. However, market data are quite noisy, and it is challenging to choose the right data or the right model to create such predictions. With the rise of large language models, there are ways to analyze certain data much more efficiently than before.
  Our goal is to determine whether the GPT model provides more useful information compared to other traditional transformer models, such as the BERT model. We shall use data from the Federal Reserve Beige Book, which provides summaries of economic conditions in different districts in the US. Using such data, we then employ the LLM's to make predictions on the correlations. Using these correlations, we then compare the results with well-known strategies and determine whether knowing the economic conditions improves investment decisions. We conclude that the Beige Book does contain information regarding correlations amongst different assets, yet the GPT model has too much look-ahead bias and that traditional models still triumph.</description>

      <title>Pricing Multi-strike Quanto Call Options on Multiple Assets with Stochastic Volatility, Correlation, and Exchange Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quanto options allow the buyer to exchange the foreign currency payoff into the domestic currency at a fixed exchange rate. We investigate quanto options with multiple underlying assets valued in different foreign currencies each with a different strike price in the payoff function. We carry out a comparative performance analysis of different stochastic volatility (SV), stochastic correlation (SC), and stochastic exchange rate (SER) models to determine the best combination of these models for Monte Carlo (MC) simulation pricing. In addition, we test the performance of all model variants with constant correlation as a benchmark. We find that a combination of GARCH-Jump SV, Weibull SC, and Ornstein Uhlenbeck (OU) SER performs best. In addition, we analyze different discretization schemes and their results. In our simulations, the Milstein scheme yields the best balance between execution times and lower standard deviations of price estimates. Furthermore, we find that incorporating mean reversion into stochastic correlation and stochastic FX rate modeling is beneficial for MC simulation pricing. We improve the accuracy of our simulations by implementing antithetic variates variance reduction. Finally, we derive the correlation risk parameters Cora and Gora in our framework so that correlation hedging of quanto options can be performed.</description>

      <title>Tuning into Climate Risks: Extracting Innovation from Television News for Clean Energy Firms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08701v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article develops multiple novel climate risk measures (or variables) based on the television news coverage by Bloomberg, CNBC, and Fox Business, and examines how they affect the systematic and idiosyncratic risks of clean energy firms in the United States. The measures are built on climate related keywords and cover the volume of coverage, type of coverage (climate crisis, renewable energy, and government &amp; human initiatives), and media sentiments. We show that an increase in the aggregate measure of climate risk, as indicated by coverage volume, reduces idiosyncratic risk while increasing systematic risk. When climate risk is segregated, we find that systematic risk is positively affected by the physical risk of climate crises and transition risk from government &amp; human initiatives, but no such impact is evident for idiosyncratic risk. Additionally, we observe an asymmetry in risk behavior: negative sentiments tend to decrease idiosyncratic risk and increase systematic risk, while positive sentiments have no significant impact. These findings remain robust to including print media and climate policy uncertainty variables, though some deviations are noted during the COVID-19 period.</description>
