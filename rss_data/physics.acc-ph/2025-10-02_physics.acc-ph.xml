      <title>Physical Thickness Characterization of the FRIB Production Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FRIB heavy-ion accelerator, commissioned in 2022, is a leading facility
  for producing rare isotope beams (RIBs) and exploring nuclei beyond the limits of stability.
  These RIBs are produced via reactions between stable primary beams and a graphite target.
  Approximately 20-40 \% of the primary beam power is deposited in the target,
  requiring efficient thermal dissipation.
  Currently, FRIB operates with a primary beam power of up to 20 kW. To enhance thermal dissipation efficiency,
  a single-slice rotating graphite target with a diameter of approximately 30 cm is employed.
  The effective target region is a 1 cm-wide outer rim of the graphite disc.
  To achieve high RIB production rates, the areal thickness variation must be constrained within 2 \%.
  This paper presents physical thickness characterizations of FRIB production targets with various nominal thicknesses,
  measured using a custom-built non-contact thickness measurement apparatus.</description>

      <title>Spectral Control of a Cavity-Based X-ray Free-Electron Laser via Active Mode Locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise spectral control in the hard X-ray regime remains a long-standing challenge that limits applications in atomic-scale science and ultrafast spectroscopy. We present an actively mode-locked cavity-based X-ray free-electron laser that achieves deterministic spectral programmability with phase-locked pulse trains and comb-like spectra, by coherently modulating the electron-beam energy. Three-dimensional time-dependent simulations predict \SI{700}{\micro\joule} total energy, \SI{30}{\giga\watt} peak power, and frequency-comb spacing of \SI{1.55}{\electronvolt} set by the modulation frequency. We further develop selective single-line amplification via undulator tapering and absolute frequency positioning through modulation-laser tuning with better than $2 \times 10^{-5}$ relative precision. Importantly, stable mode-locked operation persists under &gt;80\% peak-to-peak cavity-reflectivity variations, substantially relaxing requirements on X-ray optics. These results establish active mode locking as a practical route to fully coherent, spectrally agile hard X-ray sources and enable new opportunities in time-resolved core-level spectroscopy, X-ray quantum optics, and precision metrology.</description>

      <title>Diffraction by Circular and Triangular Apertures as a Diagnostic Tool of Twisted Matter Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study diffraction of twisted matter waves (electrons and light ions carrying orbital angular momentum $\ell/\hbar=0,\pm1,\pm2,\ldots$ by circular and triangular apertures. Within the scalar Kirchhoff-Fresnel framework, circular apertures preserve cylindrical symmetry and produce ringlike far-field profiles whose radii and widths depend on $|\ell|$ but are insensitive to its sign. In contrast, equilateral triangles break axial symmetry and yield structured patterns that encode both the magnitude and the sign of $\ell$. A transparent Fraunhofer mapping links detector coordinates to the Fourier plane, explaining the $(|\ell|+1)$-lobe rule and the sign-dependent rotation of the pattern. We validate these results for both ideal Bessel beams and localized Laguerre-Gaussian packets, and we cross-check them by split-step Fourier propagation of the time-dependent Schr"odinger equation. From these analyses we extract practical design rules (Fraunhofer distance, lattice pitch, detector sampling) relevant to OAM diagnostics with moderately relativistic electrons with $E_{\rm kin}\sim0.1$ to $5$ MeV and light ions with $E_{\rm kin}\sim0.1$ to $1$ MeV/u. Our results establish triangular diffraction as a simple, passive, and robust method for reading out the OAM content of structured quantum beams.</description>
