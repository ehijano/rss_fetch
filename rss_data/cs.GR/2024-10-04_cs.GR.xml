      <title>EgoAvatar: Egocentric View-Driven and Photorealistic Full-body Avatars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Immersive VR telepresence ideally means being able to interact and communicate with digital avatars that are indistinguishable from and precisely reflect the behaviour of their real counterparts. The core technical challenge is two fold: Creating a digital double that faithfully reflects the real human and tracking the real human solely from egocentric sensing devices that are lightweight and have a low energy consumption, e.g. a single RGB camera. Up to date, no unified solution to this problem exists as recent works solely focus on egocentric motion capture, only model the head, or build avatars from multi-view captures. In this work, we, for the first time in literature, propose a person-specific egocentric telepresence approach, which jointly models the photoreal digital avatar while also driving it from a single egocentric video. We first present a character model that is animatible, i.e. can be solely driven by skeletal motion, while being capable of modeling geometry and appearance. Then, we introduce a personalized egocentric motion capture component, which recovers full-body motion from an egocentric video. Finally, we apply the recovered pose to our character model and perform a test-time mesh refinement such that the geometry faithfully projects onto the egocentric view. To validate our design choices, we propose a new and challenging benchmark, which provides paired egocentric and dense multi-view videos of real humans performing various motions. Our experiments demonstrate a clear step towards egocentric and photoreal telepresence as our method outperforms baselines as well as competing methods. For more details, code, and data, we refer to our project page.</description>

      <title>Target Pose Guided Whole-body Grasping Motion Generation for Digital Humans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grasping manipulation is a fundamental mode for human interaction with daily life objects. The synthesis of grasping motion is also greatly demanded in many applications such as animation and robotics. In objects grasping research field, most works focus on generating the last static grasping pose with a parallel gripper or dexterous hand. Grasping motion generation for the full arm especially for the full humanlike intelligent agent is still under-explored. In this work, we propose a grasping motion generation framework for digital human which is an anthropomorphic intelligent agent with high degrees of freedom in virtual world. Given an object known initial pose in 3D space, we first generate a target pose for whole-body digital human based on off-the-shelf target grasping pose generation methods. With an initial pose and this generated target pose, a transformer-based neural network is used to generate the whole grasping trajectory, which connects initial pose and target pose smoothly and naturally. Additionally, two post optimization components are designed to mitigates foot-skating issue and hand-object interpenetration separately. Experiments are conducted on GRAB dataset to demonstrate effectiveness of this proposed method for whole-body grasping motion generation with randomly placed unknown objects.</description>

      <title>Emo3D: Metric and Benchmarking Dataset for 3D Facial Expression Generation from Emotion Description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing 3D facial emotion modeling have been constrained by limited emotion classes and insufficient datasets. This paper introduces "Emo3D", an extensive "Text-Image-Expression dataset" spanning a wide spectrum of human emotions, each paired with images and 3D blendshapes. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), we generate a diverse array of textual descriptions, facilitating the capture of a broad spectrum of emotional expressions. Using this unique dataset, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of language-based models' fine-tuning and vision-language models like Contranstive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) for 3D facial expression synthesis. We also introduce a new evaluation metric for this task to more directly measure the conveyed emotion. Our new evaluation metric, Emo3D, demonstrates its superiority over Mean Squared Error (MSE) metrics in assessing visual-text alignment and semantic richness in 3D facial expressions associated with human emotions. "Emo3D" has great applications in animation design, virtual reality, and emotional human-computer interaction.</description>

      <title>Medial Skeletal Diagram: A Generalized Medial Axis Approach for 3D Shape Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09395v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the Medial Skeletal Diagram, a novel skeletal representation that tackles the prevailing issues around skeleton sparsity and reconstruction accuracy in existing skeletal representations. Our approach augments the continuous elements in the medial axis representation to effectively shift the complexity away from the discrete elements. To that end, we introduce generalized enveloping primitives, an enhancement over the standard primitives in the medial axis, which ensure efficient coverage of intricate local features of the input shape and substantially reduce the number of discrete elements required. Moreover, we present a computational framework for constructing a medial skeletal diagram from an arbitrary closed manifold mesh. Our optimization pipeline ensures that the resulting medial skeletal diagram comprehensively covers the input shape with the fewest primitives. Additionally, each optimized primitive undergoes a post-refinement process to guarantee an accurate match with the source mesh in both geometry and tessellation. We validate our approach on a comprehensive benchmark of 100 shapes, demonstrating the sparsity of the discrete elements and superior reconstruction accuracy across a variety of cases. Finally, we exemplify the versatility of our representation in downstream applications such as shape generation, mesh decomposition, shape optimization, mesh alignment, mesh compression, and user-interactive design.</description>

      <title>TetSphere Splatting: Representing High-Quality Geometry with Lagrangian Volumetric Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20283v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce TetSphere Splatting, a Lagrangian geometry representation designed for high-quality 3D shape modeling. TetSphere splatting leverages an underused yet powerful geometric primitive -- volumetric tetrahedral meshes. It represents 3D shapes by deforming a collection of tetrahedral spheres, with geometric regularizations and constraints that effectively resolve common mesh issues such as irregular triangles, non-manifoldness, and floating artifacts. Experimental results on multi-view and single-view reconstruction highlight TetSphere splatting's superior mesh quality while maintaining competitive reconstruction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, TetSphere splatting demonstrates versatility by seamlessly integrating into generative modeling tasks, such as image-to-3D and text-to-3D generation.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap3D: Improving Multi-view Diffusion Model with Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in multi-view diffusion models for 3D content creation. However, there remains a significant gap in image quality and prompt-following ability compared to 2D diffusion models. A critical bottleneck is the scarcity of high-quality 3D objects with detailed captions. To address this challenge, we propose Bootstrap3D, a novel framework that automatically generates an arbitrary quantity of multi-view images to assist in training multi-view diffusion models. Specifically, we introduce a data generation pipeline that employs (1) 2D and video diffusion models to generate multi-view images based on constructed text prompts, and (2) our fine-tuned 3D-aware MV-LLaVA for filtering high-quality data and rewriting inaccurate captions. Leveraging this pipeline, we have generated 1 million high-quality synthetic multi-view images with dense descriptive captions to address the shortage of high-quality 3D data. Furthermore, we present a Training Timestep Reschedule (TTR) strategy that leverages the denoising process to learn multi-view consistency while maintaining the original 2D diffusion prior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Bootstrap3D can generate high-quality multi-view images with superior aesthetic quality, image-text alignment, and maintained view consistency.</description>
