      <title>The Role of Follow Networks and Twitter's Content Recommender on Partisan Skew and Rumor Exposure during the 2022 U.S. Midterm Election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms shape users' experiences through the algorithmic systems they deploy. In this study, we examine to what extent Twitter's content recommender, in conjunction with a user's social network, impacts the topic, political skew, and reliability of information served on the platform during a high-stakes election. We utilize automated accounts to document Twitter's algorithmically curated and reverse chronological timelines throughout the U.S. 2022 midterm election. We find that the algorithmic timeline measurably influences exposure to election content, partisan skew, and the prevalence of low-quality information and election rumors. Critically, these impacts are mediated by the partisan makeup of one's personal social network, which often exerts greater influence than the algorithm alone. We find that the algorithmic feed decreases the proportion of election content shown to left-leaning accounts, and that it skews content toward right-leaning sources when compared to the reverse chronological feed. We additionally find evidence that the algorithmic system increases the prevalence of election-related rumors for right-leaning accounts, and has mixed effects on the prevalence of low-quality information sources. Our work provides insight into the outcomes of Twitter's complex recommender system at a crucial time period before controversial changes to the platform and in the midst of nationwide elections and highlights the need for ongoing study of algorithmic systems and their role in democratic processes.</description>

      <title>Request a Note: How the Request Function Shapes X's Community Notes System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X's Community Notes is a crowdsourced fact-checking system. To improve its scalability, X recently introduced "Request Community Note" feature, enabling users to solicit fact-checks from contributors on specific posts. Yet, its implications for the system -- what gets checked, by whom, and with what quality -- remain unclear. Using 98,685 requested posts and their associated notes, we evaluate how requests shape the Community Notes system. We find that contributors prioritize posts with higher misleadingness and from authors with greater misinformation exposure, but neglect political content emphasized by requestors. Selection also diverges along partisan lines: contributors more often annotate posts from Republicans, while requestors surface more from Democrats. Although only 12% of posts receive request-fostered notes from top contributors, these notes are rated as more helpful and less polarized than others, partly reflecting top contributors' selective fact-checking of misleading posts. Our findings highlight both the limitations and promise of requests for scaling high-quality community-based fact-checking.</description>

      <title>Revealing Higher-Order Interactions in Complex Networks: A U.S. Diplomacy Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although diplomatic communication has long been examined in the social sciences, its network structure remains underexplored. Using the U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks in 2010 as a case study, we adopt a network-science perspective. We represent diplomatic interactions as a hypergraph and develop a general, random-walk-based pipeline to evaluate this representation against traditional pairwise graphs. We further evaluate the pipeline on legislative co-sponsorship and organizational email data, finding improvements and empirical evidence that clarifies when hypergraph modeling is preferable to pairwise graphs. Overall, hypergraphs paired with appropriately specified random-walk dynamics more faithfully capture higher-order, group-based interactions, yielding a richer structural account of diplomacy and superior performance on interaction-prediction tasks that enables inferring new diplomatic relationships from existing patterns.</description>

      <title>TikTok Rewards Divisive Political Messaging During the 2025 German Federal Election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-form video platforms like TikTok reshape how politicians communicate and have become important tools for electoral campaigning. Yet it remains unclear what kinds of political messages gain traction in these fast-paced, algorithmically curated environments, which are particularly popular among younger audiences. In this study, we use computational content analysis to analyze a comprehensive dataset of N=25,292 TikTok videos posted by German politicians in the run-up to the 2025 German federal election. Our empirical analysis shows that videos expressing negative emotions (e.g., anger, disgust) and outgroup animosity were significantly more likely to generate engagement than those emphasizing positive emotion, relatability, or identity. Furthermore, ideologically extreme parties (on both sides of the political spectrum) were both more likely to post this type of content and more successful in generating engagement than centrist parties. Taken together, these findings suggest that TikTok's platform dynamics systematically reward divisive over unifying political communication, thereby potentially benefiting extreme actors more inclined to capitalize on this logic.</description>

      <title>Beginner's Charm: Beginner-Heavy Teams Are Associated With High Scientific Disruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Teams now drive most scientific advances, yet the impact of absolute beginners -- authors with no prior publications -- remains understudied. Analyzing over 28 million articles published between 1971 and 2020 across disciplines and team sizes, we uncover a universal and previously undocumented pattern: teams with a higher fraction of beginners are systematically more disruptive and innovative. Their contributions are linked to distinct knowledge-integration behaviors, including drawing on broader and less canonical prior work and producing more atypical recombinations. Collaboration structure further shapes outcomes: disruption is high when beginners work with early-career colleagues or with co-authors who have disruptive track records. Although disruption and citations are negatively correlated overall, highly disruptive papers from beginner-heavy teams are highly cited. These findings reveal a "beginner's charm" in science, highlighting the underrecognized yet powerful value of beginner fractions in teams and suggesting actionable strategies for fostering a thriving ecosystem of innovation in science and technology.</description>

      <title>The Content Moderator's Dilemma: Removal of Toxic Content and Distortions to Online Discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is an ongoing debate about how to moderate toxic speech on social media and the impact of content moderation on online discourse. This paper proposes and validates a methodology for measuring the content-moderation-induced distortions in online discourse using text embeddings from computational linguistics. Applying the method to a representative sample of 5 million US political Tweets, we find that removing toxic Tweets alters the semantic composition of content. This finding is consistent across different embedding models, toxicity metrics, and samples. Importantly, we demonstrate that these effects are not solely driven by toxic language but by the removal of topics often expressed in toxic form. We propose an alternative approach to content moderation that uses generative Large Language Models to rephrase toxic Tweets, preserving their salvageable content rather than removing them entirely. We show that this rephrasing strategy reduces toxicity while minimizing distortions in online content.</description>

      <title>Cluster Synchronization via Graph Laplacian Eigenvectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Almost equitable partitions (AEPs) have been linked to cluster synchronization in oscillatory systems, highlighting the importance of structure in collective network dynamics. We provide a general spectral framework that formalizes this connection, showing how eigenvectors associated with AEPs span a subspace of the Laplacian spectrum that governs partition-induced synchronization behavior. This offers a principled reduction of network dynamics, allowing clustered states to be understood in terms of quotient graph projections. Our approach clarifies the conditions under which transient hierarchical clustering and multi-frequency synchronization emerge, and connects these dynamical phenomena directly to network symmetry and community structure. In doing so, we bridge a critical gap between static topology and dynamic behavior-namely, the lack of a spectral method for analyzing synchronization in networks that exhibit exact or approximate structural regularity. Perfect AEPs are rare in real-world networks since most have some degree of irregularity or noise. We define a relaxation of an AEP we call a quasi-equitable partition at level $\delta$ ($\delta-$QEP). $\delta-$QEPs can preserve many of the clustering-relevant properties of AEPs while tolerating structural imperfections and noise. This extension enables us to describe synchronization behavior in more realistic scenarios, where ideal symmetries are rarely present. Our findings have important implications for understanding synchronization patterns in real-world networks, from neural circuits to power grids.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Discovery of Mobility Periodicity for Understanding Urban Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human mobility regularity is crucial for understanding urban dynamics and informing decision-making processes. This study first quantifies the periodicity in complex human mobility data as a sparse identification of dominant positive auto-correlations in time series autoregression and then discovers periodic patterns. We apply the framework to large-scale metro passenger flow data in Hangzhou, China and multi-modal mobility data in New York City and Chicago, USA, revealing the interpretable weekly periodicity across different spatial locations over past several years. The analysis of ridesharing data from 2019 to 2024 demonstrates the disruptive impact of the pandemic on mobility regularity and the subsequent recovery trends. In 2024, the periodic mobility patterns of ridesharing, taxi, subway, and bikesharing in Manhattan uncover the regularity and variability of these travel modes. Our findings highlight the potential of interpretable machine learning to discover spatiotemporal mobility patterns and offer a valuable tool for understanding urban systems.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Sheaf Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equipping graph neural networks with a convolution operation defined in terms of a cellular sheaf offers advantages for learning expressive representations of heterophilic graph data. The most flexible approach to constructing the sheaf is to learn it as part of the network as a function of the node features. However, this leaves the network potentially overly sensitive to the learned sheaf. As a counter-measure, we propose a variational approach to learning cellular sheaves within sheaf neural networks, yielding an architecture we refer to as a Bayesian sheaf neural network. As part of this work, we define a novel family of reparameterizable probability distributions on the rotation group $SO(n)$ using the Cayley transform. We evaluate the Bayesian sheaf neural network on several graph datasets, and show that our Bayesian sheaf models achieve leading performance compared to baseline models and are less sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters under limited training data settings.</description>
