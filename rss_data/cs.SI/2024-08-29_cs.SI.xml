      <title>Characterizing Physician Referral Networks with Ricci Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying (a) systemic barriers to quality healthcare access and (b) key indicators of care efficacy in the United States remains a significant challenge. To improve our understanding of regional disparities in care delivery, we introduce a novel application of curvature, a geometrical-topological property of networks, to Physician Referral Networks. Our initial findings reveal that Forman-Ricci and Ollivier-Ricci curvature measures, which are known for their expressive power in characterizing network structure, offer promising indicators for detecting variations in healthcare efficacy while capturing a range of significant regional demographic features. We also present APPARENT, an open-source tool that leverages Ricci curvature and other network features to examine correlations between regional Physician Referral Networks structure, local census data, healthcare effectiveness, and patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>IC always bad? : Information Cocooning as a Group Emotional Stabilization Role in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research aims to investigate the effects of information cocooning on group mood changes caused by information spreading. The simulation of the realistic network evolution process is realized at the structural level by building a network evolution model based on individual viewpoints. Abstracting the accuracy of the real intelligent recommendation process by setting RA (Recommended Accuracy). By analyzing the information cocoon effect due to the recommendation in the comment section, we provide the structural basis of spreading for the dynamics model. A dynamics model of emotion spreading is developed to explore the trend of individual emotion spreading and to quantify the change of group emotion. Through experiments and analysis, this paper concludes that the information cocoon has a positive effect on the stability of group emotions, and that the H-CAC (Hidden Comment Area Cocoon) structure exists widely in real online social networks, and can produce a protective "harbor" effect in the competition of public opinion and cognitive games. The validity of the model is verified by comparison with real cases and generalization ability experiments. This work provides a multi-perspective analysis and visualization, providing more quantitative results. The research is expected to provide new perspectives and tools for understanding the reality of information cocooning and expanding the scenarios of its use.</description>

      <title>AdaMotif: Graph Simplification via Adaptive Motif Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increase of graph size, it becomes difficult or even impossible to visualize graph structures clearly within the limited screen space. Consequently, it is crucial to design effective visual representations for large graphs. In this paper, we propose AdaMotif, a novel approach that can capture the essential structure patterns of large graphs and effectively reveal the overall structures via adaptive motif designs. Specifically, our approach involves partitioning a given large graph into multiple subgraphs, then clustering similar subgraphs and extracting similar structural information within each cluster. Subsequently, adaptive motifs representing each cluster are generated and utilized to replace the corresponding subgraphs, leading to a simplified visualization. Our approach aims to preserve as much information as possible from the subgraphs while simplifying the graph efficiently. Notably, our approach successfully visualizes crucial community information within a large graph. We conduct case studies and a user study using real-world graphs to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The results demonstrate the capability of our approach in simplifying graphs while retaining important structural and community information.</description>

      <title>OpenFGL: A Comprehensive Benchmarks for Federated Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) has emerged as a promising distributed training paradigm for graph neural networks across multiple local systems without direct data sharing. This approach is particularly beneficial in privacy-sensitive scenarios and offers a new perspective on addressing scalability challenges in large-scale graph learning. Despite the proliferation of FGL, the diverse motivations from practical applications, spanning various research backgrounds and experimental settings, pose a significant challenge to fair evaluation. To fill this gap, we propose OpenFGL, a unified benchmark designed for the primary FGL scenarios: Graph-FL and Subgraph-FL. Specifically, OpenFGL includes 38 graph datasets from 16 application domains, 8 federated data simulation strategies that emphasize graph properties, and 5 graph-based downstream tasks. Additionally, it offers 18 recently proposed SOTA FGL algorithms through a user-friendly API, enabling a thorough comparison and comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate the ability of FGL while also revealing its potential limitations, offering valuable insights for future exploration in this thriving field.</description>

      <title>Branch-and-cut algorithms for colorful components problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We tackle three optimization problems in which a colored graph, where each node is assigned a color, must be partitioned into colorful connected components. A component is defined as colorful if each color appears at most once. The problems differ in the objective function, which determines which partition is the best one. These problems have applications in community detection, cybersecurity, and bioinformatics. We present integer non-linear formulations, which are then linearized using standard techniques. To solve these formulations, we develop exact branch-and-cut algorithms, embedding various improving techniques, such as valid inequalities, bounds limiting the number of variables, and warm-start and preprocessing techniques. Extensive computational tests on benchmark instances demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed procedures. The branch-and-cut algorithms can solve reasonably sized instances efficiently. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose an exact algorithm for solving these problems.</description>

      <title>LLMs generate structurally realistic social networks but overestimate political homophily</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating social networks is essential for many applications, such as epidemic modeling and social simulations. Prior approaches either involve deep learning models, which require many observed networks for training, or stylized models, which are limited in their realism and flexibility. In contrast, LLMs offer the potential for zero-shot and flexible network generation. However, two key questions are: (1) are LLM's generated networks realistic, and (2) what are risks of bias, given the importance of demographics in forming social ties? To answer these questions, we develop three prompting methods for network generation and compare the generated networks to real social networks. We find that more realistic networks are generated with "local" methods, where the LLM constructs relations for one persona at a time, compared to "global" methods that construct the entire network at once. We also find that the generated networks match real networks on many characteristics, including density, clustering, community structure, and degree. However, we find that LLMs emphasize political homophily over all other types of homophily and overestimate political homophily relative to real-world measures.</description>

      <title>Normalized mutual information is a biased measure for classification and community detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Normalized mutual information is widely used as a similarity measure for evaluating the performance of clustering and classification algorithms. In this paper, we argue that results returned by the normalized mutual information are biased for two reasons: first, because they ignore the information content of the contingency table and, second, because their symmetric normalization introduces spurious dependence on algorithm output. We introduce a modified version of the mutual information that remedies both of these shortcomings. As a practical demonstration of the importance of using an unbiased measure, we perform extensive numerical tests on a basket of popular algorithms for network community detection and show that one's conclusions about which algorithm is best are significantly affected by the biases in the traditional mutual information.</description>

      <title>Correlation Clustering with Vertex Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore Cluster Editing and its generalization Correlation Clustering with a new operation called permissive vertex splitting which addresses finding overlapping clusters in the face of uncertain information. We determine that both problems are NP-hard, yet they exhibit significant differences in parameterized complexity and approximability. For Cluster Editing with Permissive Vertex Splitting, we show a polynomial kernel when parameterized by the solution size and develop a polynomial-time algorithm with approximation factor 7. In the case of Correlation Clustering, we establish para-NP-hardness when parameterized by solution size and demonstrate that computing an $n^{1-\epsilon}$-approximation is NP-hard for any constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$. Additionally, we extend the established link between Correlation Clustering and Multicut to the setting with permissive vertex splitting.</description>

      <title>Constant-selection evolutionary dynamics on weighted networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The population structure often impacts evolutionary dynamics. In constant-selection evolutionary dynamics between two types, amplifiers of selection are networks that promote the fitter mutant to take over the entire population, and suppressors of selection do the opposite. It has been shown that most undirected and unweighted networks are amplifiers of selection under a common updating rule and initial condition. Here, we extensively investigate how edge weights influence selection on undirected networks. We show that random edge weights make small networks less amplifying than the corresponding unweighted networks in a majority of cases and also make them suppressors of selection (i.e., less amplifying than the complete graph, or equivalently, the Moran process) in many cases. Qualitatively, the same result holds true for larger empirical networks. These results suggest that amplifiers of selection are not as common for weighted networks as for unweighted counterparts.</description>
