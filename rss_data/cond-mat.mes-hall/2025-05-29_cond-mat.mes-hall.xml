      <title>Selenization of V2O5/WO3 Bilayers for Tuned Optoelectronic Response of WSe2 Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalable and controlled doping of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides is essential for tuning their electronic and optoelectronic properties. In this work, we demonstrate a robust approach for substitution of vanadium in tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$) via the selenization of pre-deposited V$_2$O$_5$/WO$_3$ thin films. By adjusting the thickness of the vanadium oxide layer, the V concentration in W$_{1-x}$V$_x$Se$_2$ is systematically varied. Electrical measurements on field-effect transistors reveal a substantial enhancement in hole conduction, with drain current increasing by nearly three orders of magnitude compared to undoped WSe$_2$. Temperature-dependent electrical resistivity indicates a clear insulator-to-metal transition with increasing V content, likely due to band structure modifications. Concurrently, the photoconductive gain decreases, suggesting enhanced recombination and charge screening effects. These results establish vanadium doping via selenization of V$_2$O$_5$/WO$_3$ films as a scalable strategy for modulating the transport and photoresponse of WSe$_2$, offering promising implications for wafer-scale optoelectronic device integration.</description>

      <title>Telecom quantum dots on GaAs substrates as integration-ready high performance single-photon sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of deterministic single photon sources emitting in the telecommunication bands is a key challenge for quantum communication and photonic quantum computing. Here, we investigate the optical properties and single-photon emission of molecular beam epitaxy grown semiconductor quantum dots emitting in the telecom O- and C- bands. The quantum dots are embedded in a InGaAs matrix with fixed indium content grown on top of a compositionally graded InGaAs buffer. This structure allows for the future implementation of electrically contacted nanocavities to enable high-quality and bright QD emission. In detailed optical characterizations we observe linewidths as low as $ 50 \mu$eV, close to the spectrometer resolution limit, low fine structure splittings close to $ 10 \mu$eV, and $g^{(2)} (0)$ values as low as $0.08$. These results advance the current performance metrics for MBE-grown quantum dots on GaAs substrates emitting in the telecom bands and showcase the potential of the presented heterostructures for further integration into photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Theory of chiral-phonon-activated spin Seebeck effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically explore the generation of spin current driven by a temperature gradient in a junction between a chiral insulator and a normal metal. Based on the gyromagnetic effect caused by microscopic rotation due to phonons, we derive a formula for a spin current when a finite temperature difference is imposed at two ends of the sample. We clarify how the spin current depends on the sample geometry, the thermal conductivity, the heat conductance at the interface, and the average temperature. Our formulation provides a microscopic foundation for the chiral-phonon-activated spin Seebeck effect without relying on magnetism and spin-orbit interactions.</description>

      <title>Integrated phononic waveguide on thin-film lithium niobate on diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate wavelength-scale phononic waveguides formed by transfer-printed thin-film lithium niobate (LN) on bulk diamond (LNOD), a material stack that combines the strong piezoelectricity of LN with the high acoustic velocity and color-center compatibility of diamond. We characterize a delay line based on a 100 micron long phononic waveguide at room and cryogenic temperatures. The total insertion loss through the device at 4 kelvin is -5.8 dB, corresponding to a &gt;50% transducer efficiency, at a frequency of 2.8 gigahertz. Our work represents a step towards phonon-mediated hybrid quantum systems consisting of strain-sensitive color centers in diamond.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of the quantum anomalous Hall effect under microwave drives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators exhibit chiral dissipationless edge states without an external magnetic field, making them a promising material for quantum metrology and microwave applications. However, the breakdown of the zero-resistance state at low currents hinders progress. We investigate and characterize this breakdown under microwave fields (1-25 GHz) by measuring the increase of longitudinal resistance in RF Hall bars and RF Corbino devices made from V-doped (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$ films. Our results point to the role of heating of electron-hole puddles under microwave irradiation, thereby fostering hopping transport. Our work offers insights critical for GHz-range QAH applications.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Hall Effect in Gapless Superconductors: Transverse Supercurrent Converted from Normal Current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A normal metallic system proximitized by a superconductor can exhibit a gapless superconducting state characterized by segmented Fermi surfaces, as confirmed experimentally. In such a state, quasiparticle states remain gapless along one direction, while a superconducting gap opens in the perpendicular direction. This anisotropy enables a novel Hall effect in gapless superconductors, termed the superconducting Hall effect (ScHE), where a longitudinal normal current carried by quasiparticles is converted into a dissipationless transverse supercurrent. Employing both the thermodynamic approach for bulk systems and quantum transport theory for a four-probe setup, we demonstrate the existence of this effect and reveal its intrinsic origin as the quasiparticle Berry curvature. The predicted ScHE can be experimentally verified via the standard angular-dependent Hall measurements performed on gapless superconductors.</description>

      <title>Higher-order thermal transport theory for phonon thermal transport in semiconductors using lattice dynamics calculations and the Boltzmann transport equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phonon thermal conductivity of semiconducting periodic solids can be obtained using the lattice dynamics calculations along with the Boltzmann transport equation and with input from density functional theory calculations. These calculations have resulted in an excellent agreement with experiments without requiring any fitting parameters. However, over the last decade, many material systems have been identified where the lowest level lattice dynamics theory, which is based on the relaxation time approximation solution of the Boltzmann transport equation and considers potential energy surface sampling around the static equilibrium positions of atoms with only three-phonon scatterings, is proved insufficient in describing the thermal transport physics. In this article, we review these higher-order developments in the lattice dynamics theory to describe thermal transport in periodic semiconducting solids. We start with a brief discussion of the lowest-order theory and discuss its limitations along with proposed developments to address these limitations. We discuss prominent success cases of these higher-order developments and present our recommendations on their use for various material systems. Considering that many of these higher-order developments are computationally more demanding compared to the lowest-order theory, we also discussed data-driven approaches to accelerate these calculations. This review article is intended to serve as a reference for both novice and experienced researchers in this field.</description>

      <title>Spin and Charge Control of Topological End States in Chiral Graphene Nanoribbons on a 2D Ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tailor-made graphene nanostructures can exhibit symmetry-protected topological boundary states that host localized spin-$1/2$ moments. However, one frequently observes charge transfer on coinage metal substrates, which results in spinless closed-shell configurations. Using low temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we demonstrate here that pristine topologically nontrivial chiral graphene nanoribbons synthesized directly on the ferromagnet $\textrm{GdAu}_2$ can either maintain a charge-neutral diradical singlet or triplet configuration, or exist in a singly anionic doublet state. As an underlying mechanism, we identify a moir\'{e}-modulated work function and exchange field, as corroborated by Kelvin-probe force microscopy and spin-flip spectroscopy. The joint electrostatic and magnetic interactions allow reversibly switching between the three spin multiplicities by atomic manipulation. We introduce an effective Hubbard dimer model that unifies the effects of local electrostatic gating, electron-electron-correlation, hybridization and exchange field to outline the phase diagram of accessible spin states. Our results establish a platform for the local control of $\pi$-radicals adsorbed on metallic substrates.</description>

      <title>Unconventional magnon transport in antiferromagnet NiPS$_3$ induced by an anisotropic spin-flop transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlocal magnon transport can provide valuable insight into the magnetic properties of magnetic insulators (MIs). A spin-flop transition, a typical magnetic reorientation in antiferromagnets, is expected to affect mag non transport, but studies on this topic are still rare and remain challenging, especially for van der Waals materials. Here we demonstrate the unconventional magnon transport driven by an anisotropic spin-flop transition in the van der Waals antiferromagnet NiPS$_3$. Examining the nonlocal voltage from thermally driven magnons reveals sharp jumps at certain directions when an inplane magnetic field aligns with the b-axis of NiPS$_3$, attributed to an in-plane anisotropic spin-flop transition. Furthermore, thermally driven magnon signal exhibits a 1/d$^2$ decay in thin NiPS$_3$, evidencing that it is dominated by the intrinsic spin Seebeck effect. Our findings highlight that the electrical detection of magnon currents in a nonlocal device geometry serves as a powerful approach for studying magnetic phase transitions in MIs.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Long-range crossed Andreev reflection in a topological insulator nanowire proximitized by a superconductor" by Junya Feng et al</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that the interpretation of the experiment [Nature Physics 21, 708-715 (2025)] is misleading in two respects. First, the bias voltages impact the non-local differential conductance randomly, rather than systematically, and the bias symmetry of the non-local conductance in Fig. 3 can be explained by a fine tuned self-gating effect. Second, the full knowledge of the conductance matrix is insufficient to conclude on the relative values of the crossed-Andreev and elastic cotunneling probabilities, in particular on the dominance of one of them.</description>

      <title>Localized surface plasmons in a Weyl semimetal nanosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the localized surface plasmon modes of a sub-wavelength spherical nanoparticle composed of a Weyl semimetal, taking into account the axion modification of electrodynamics. We derive analytical solutions for dipole and quadrupole normal modes by employing the quasistatic approximation. The axion term leads to modified Fr\"ohlich conditions, resulting in multiple non-degenerate plasmonic resonances with distinct polarization dependencies. In contrast to isotropic conventional metals, the magnetoelectric properties of Weyl semimetals enable an incident electromagnetic field, with the electric field transverse to the surface of the sphere, to excite a localized surface plasmon.</description>

      <title>Shot noise from which-path detection in a chiral Majorana interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the full counting statistics of charge transfer in a chiral Majorana interferometer - a setup where a Dirac mode (an electron-hole mode) is split into two Majorana modes that encircle a number of h/2e vortices in a topological superconductor. Without any coupling to the environment it is known that the low-energy charge transfer is deterministic: An electron is transferred either as an electron or as a hole, dependent on the parity of the vortex number. We show that a stochastic contribution appears if which-path information leaks into the environment, producing the shot noise of random 2e charge transfers with binomial statistics. The Fano factor (dimensionless ratio of shot noise power and conductance) increases without bound as the which-path detection probability tends to unity.</description>

      <title>Fermion parity and quantum capacitance oscillation with partially separated Majorana and quasi-Majorana modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent experiment, flux dependent oscillations of the quantum capacitance were observed in a one dimensional spin-orbit coupled semiconductor superconductor heterostructure connected end to end via a quantum dot and threaded by a magnetic flux. In the topological superconducting phase of the heterostructure, the oscillations corresponding to different fermion parity sectors are shifted by half a period and can serve as a mechanism for fermion parity readout or fusion operations involving a pair of localized, well separated Majorana modes. In this work, we demonstrate that flux induced fermion parity dependent oscillations of the quantum capacitance in a disordered semiconductor superconductor quantum dot system can originate not only from topologically protected, spatially well separated Majorana zero modes (MZMs) localized at the wire ends, but also, generically, from partially separated Majorana modes with significant overlap, as well as from quasi-Majorana modes in the topologically trivial phase, which can be viewed as Andreev bound states whose constituent Majorana wave functions are slightly shifted relative to each other and have nonzero amplitude at opposite ends of the wire. Therefore, while the detection of flux dependent oscillations of quantum capacitance marks an important experimental advance, such observations alone do not constitute evidence of the presence of topological Majorana zero modes.</description>

      <title>Molecular anyons in fractional quantum Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the profound consequences of the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect is the notion of fractionally charged anyons. In spite of extensive experimental study, puzzles remain, however. For example, both shot-noise and Aharonov-Bohm interference measurements sometimes report a charge that is a multiple of the elementary charge. We report here high-precision microscopic calculations that reveal the surprising result that the FQH anyons often bind together into stable clusters, which we term molecular anyons. This is counterintuitive, given that the elementary anyons carry the same charge and are therefore expected to repel one another. The number of anyons in a cluster, its binding energy and its size depend sensitively on the parent FQH state and the interaction between electrons (which is experimentally tunable, e.g., by varying the quantum well width). Our calculations further suggest that the charge-$1/4$ non-Abelian anyons of the $5/2$ FQH state may also bind to form charge-$1/2$ Abelian clusters. The existence of molecular anyons not only can provide a natural explanation for the observed charges, but also leads to a host of new predictions for future experiments and invites a re-analysis of many past ones.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Constraints in DRAM cells: Experimental Verification of Energy Efficiency Limits in Information Erasure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measured the energy efficiency of information erasure using silicon DRAM cells capable of counting charges on capacitors at the single-electron level. Our measurements revealed that the efficiency decreased as the erasure error rate decreased, and notably, the Landauer limit was not achieved even under effectively infinite-time operation. By comparing the measured efficiency with the Landauer limit, we identified a thermodynamic constraint that prevents DRAM from reaching this limit: the inability to prepare the initial state in thermal equilibrium, which in turn prohibits quasi-static operations. This finding has broad implications for DRAM cells and for many electronic circuits sharing similar structures. Furthermore, it validates our experimental approach to discovering thermodynamic constraints that impose tighter, practically relevant limits, opening a new research direction in information thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Dynamic signature of the thermodynamic transition in a novel mean field system</title>

Abstract: Understanding the connection between thermodynamics and dynamics in glass-forming liquids remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics. In this study, we investigate a novel model system that enables a continuous crossover from a standard three dimensional liquid to a fully connected mean field like system by introducing pseudo neighbours. These pseudo neighbours enhance the effective connectivity of the system without altering its local structure. While their presence slows down the dynamics, they influence thermodynamic properties even more significantly. In particular, the configurational entropy obtained via thermodynamic integration vanishes at a temperature much higher than the temperature where the dynamics begin to slow down, leading to a clear breakdown of the Adam Gibbs relation. To uncover a possible dynamical signature of this thermodynamic transition, we analyse bond breakage dynamics. Unlike real-real bonds, which decay similarly in both the parent Kob Andersen model and its mean field variant, real-pseudo bonds exhibit long lived, persistent behaviour with strong temperature dependence. These bonds do not fully decay over time, leading to a finite saturation value of the bond breakage correlation function. Remarkably, we show that the number of surviving pseudo bonds can be analytically estimated and correlates directly with the thermodynamic transition temperature T_K. We propose a phenomenological relation between T_K and the number of surviving pseudo-bonds, establishing a novel link between thermodynamic and dynamic observables. Our results suggest that these persistent pseudo bonds serve as a robust dynamical signature of the thermodynamic transition, and the system might have properties analogous to those of randomly bonded ultrastable glasses.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Temperature Dependence of Exciton Diamagnetism in 2D Ruddlesden-Popper Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered hybrid perovskites containing larger organic cations have demonstrated superior environmental stability, but the presence of these insulating spacers also strengthens the exciton binding energy, which contributes to reduced carrier separation. The consequences of increased binding energy on device efficiency are still not fully documented, and binding energy measurements are often conducted at cryogenic temperatures where linewidths are decreased and a series of hydrogen-like bound states can be identified, but not under ambient conditions where devices are expected to operate. In contrast to the quenching observed in 3D perovskites such as methylammonium lead iodide, where exciton binding energies are thought to decrease at higher temperatures, we present evidence for a smaller excitonic radius at higher temperatures in the $n=5$ member of butylammonium-spaced methylammonium lead iodide, (BA)$_2$(MA)$_{n-1}$Pb$_n$I$_{3n+1}$. We measured the temperature-dependent diamagnetic shift coefficient in magnetic fields up to 40\,T, which is one-third as large at room temperature as those at cryogenic temperatures. In both the ideal 2D and 3D hydrogen models, this trend would indicate that the exciton binding energy more than triples at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Measuring topological invariants of even-dimensional non-Hermitian systems through quench dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate determination of non-Hermitian (NH) topological invariants plays a central role in the study of NH topological phases. In this work, we propose a general framework for directly measuring NH topological invariants in even-dimensional systems through quench dynamics. Our approach hinges on constructing an auxiliary Hermitian matrix topologically equivalent to the original NH Hamiltonian, enabling topological characterization via reduced-dimensional momentum subspaces called band inversion surfaces (BISs). A key insight lies in the emergence of chiral symmetry in the NH Hamiltonian specifically on BISs -- a critical property that allows extension of the dynamical characterization scheme previously developed for odd-dimensional NH systems with chiral or sublattice symmetry [Lin et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 7, L012060 (2025)]. We show that NH topological invariants can be extracted from the winding patterns of a dynamical field constructed from post-quench spin textures on BISs. We demonstrate our approach through a detailed analysis of NH Chern insulators and then extend the framework to higher even-dimensional systems by introducing second-order BISs for characterization. This work establishes an experimentally accessible protocol for detecting NH topological invariants in quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Fischer Information of a Nonequilibrium Anharmonic Donor-Acceptor Rectifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a nonequilibrium donor-acceptor quantum rectifier system coupled to an anharmonic vibrational mode, treating the vibrational dynamics both as a two-level system and as multilevel system. The time-dependent Fischer information is then calculated by deriving a quantum master equation for the reduced system dynamics. We estimate some key rectifier parameters, the donor energy, the acceptor energy, and the vibrational frequency. We report that there is an optimal time for estimating the donor and acceptor energy. However, the anharmonic mode can be estimated better only in the steadystate. The acceptor energy is found to be most precisely estimable, especially under strong coupling and high bias. Donor energy shows limited sensitivity, while vibrational frequency estimation benefits from low temperatures. This work offers a theoretical foundation for enhancing parameter estimation in nanoscale quantum devices, guiding future sensing and metrological applications in quantronic systems.</description>

      <title>Fluxonium as a control qubit for bosonic quantum information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bosonic codes in superconducting resonators are a hardware-efficient avenue for quantum error correction and can harness the favorable error hierarchies provided by long-lived cavities compared to typical superconducting qubits. These benefits can be negated, however, by the necessary coupling to an ancillary control qubit, which often induces highly detrimental effects such as excess decoherence and undesired nonlinearities. It is thus an important question whether a qubit-cavity coupling can be realized that avoids such effects. Here, we investigate the fluxonium as control qubit, motivated by its long lifetime and controllability of Hamiltonian parameters that suggest an avenue toward controlled elimination of undesired nonlinearities. In a proof-of-concept experiment we use the fluxonium to measure the coherence properties of a storage resonator and demonstrate the predictability of the cavity's inherited nonlinearities from the fluxonium. We demonstrate universal control by preparing and characterizing resonator Fock states and their superpositions using selective number-dependent arbitrary phase gates. The fidelities of state preparation and tomography are accounted for by incoherent resonator decay errors in our planar prototype device. Finally, we predict that the fluxonium can achieve beneficial cavity-coupling regimes compared to the transmon, with the potential to eliminate undesirable cavity nonlinearities. These results demonstrate the potential of the fluxonium as a high-performance bosonic control qubit for superconducting cavities.</description>

      <title>Electrical detection of interfacial exchange field at the (ferromagnetic insulator)|(normal metal) interface using spin-dependent scattering</title>

Abstract: The spin-orbit field and interfacial exchange field are two major interface phenomena, and the detection and manipulation of these fields can enable a variety of nanoscale spintronics devices. Optimizing the interfacial exchange field, which governs the spin-dependent scattering asymmetry at (ferromagnetic insulator)-(normal metal) interfaces, will pave the way for next-generation nanoscale, low-power insulator spintronics devices. Here, we demonstrate an experimental pathway to detect an interfacial exchange field between insulating ferromagnet EuS and non-magnetic Cu using magnetoresistance measurements, and show that the spin-dependent scattering at the common interface can lead to a significant current-in-plane magnetoresistance in Py$|$Cu$|$EuS trilayer Hall-bar device. Our experiment suggests that simple magnetoresistance measurements can be used to experimentally detect the interfacial exchange field and thereby the magnetic state of a ferromagnetic insulator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from a double quantum dot realization of a minimal Kitaev chain, we demonstrate that non-Hermicity stabilizes the so-called poor man's Majorana zero modes in a region of parameter space that is much broader than in the Hermitian regime. In particular, we consider the simplest non-Hermitian mechanism which naturally appears due to coupling to normal reservoirs and is commonly present in all transport experiments. Specifically, such couplings induce exceptional points which connect stable and highly tunable zero energy real lines that are well separated from the quasicontinuum. Such zero-energy lines reflect spectral degeneracies protected by topology and represent the non-Hermitian generalization of the Hermitian poor mans Majorana modes occurring at single points in parameter space. Our findings pave the way for realizing robust non-Hermitian effects by combining unconventional superconductors and non-Hermitian topology.</description>

      <title>Entangled Photon-Pair Emission in Waveguide Circuit QED from a Cooper Pair Splitter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15109v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a waveguide circuit QED architecture, we investigate theoretically the single-photon pair emission of a Cooper pair splitter composed of two double quantum dots, each coupled to a microwave transmission line. We find that this system can generate frequency-entangled photon pairs in the left and right transmission lines, specifically a superposition of two photon wave packets at different frequencies. The frequency entanglement of the two photons arises from the particle-hole coherent superposition (i.e., Andreev bound states) involving the delocalized entangled spin singlet. We also estimate a lower bound for the efficiency of entangled photon-pair generation, accounting for the presence of nonradiative processes such as phonon emissions. Our proposal is realistic and achievable with state-of-the-art techniques in quantum microwave engineering with electostatically defined semiconducting quantum dots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using phenomenological Landau free energy, we systematically analyze influence of so-called umklapp contributions on the phase diagram of a solid hosting a commensurate charge-density wave phase. The umklapp terms may change the transition into the ordered state from continuous (second-order) to discontinuous (first-order). Additional elements, such as critical and tricritical points, emerge on the phase diagram under suitable conditions. The proposed mechanism is generalized for the case of nearly-commensurate charge-density wave, as well as spin-density wave orders. Several charge-density-wave-hosting alloys are used as experimentally available examples illustrating the formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04352v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a three-dimensional (3D) topological phase resembling a Weyl semimetal, modulated by a periodic potential and engineered through Floquet dynamics. This system is constructed by stacking two-dimensional Chern insulators and hosts Weyl-like points defined in the parameter space $(k_x, k_y, z)$, distinct from conventional Weyl points in momentum space $(k_x, k_y, k_z)$. The Weyl-semimetal-like phase exhibits characteristics akin to those of Weyl semimetals, including linear dispersion near the Weyl-like points, nontrivial bulk topology, and the presence of Fermi arcs connecting the Weyl-like points. Unlike traditional Weyl semimetals, these features manifest in real space rather than momentum space. Furthermore, we calculate the local density of states, the layer Hall conductance, and the total 3D Hall conductivity, demonstrating that the Weyl-semimetal-like phase remains stable under weak and moderate interlayer couplings. Finally, we compute the Floquet Chern number and show that the positions of the Weyl-like points can be tuned via high-frequency laser pumping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exotic quantum Hall systems hosting counter-propagating edge states can show seemingly non-universal transport regimes, usually depending on the size of the sample. We experimentally probe transport in a quantum Hall sample engineered to host a tunable number of counter-propagating edge states. The latter are coupled by Landauer reservoirs, which force charge equilibration over a tunable effective length. We show that charge transport is determined by the balance of up- and downstream channels, with a ballistic regime emerging for unequal numbers of channels. For equal numbers, we observe a transition to a critical diffusive regime, characterized by a diverging equilibration length. Our approach allows simulating the equilibration of hole-conjugate states and other exotic quantum Hall effects with fully controlled parameters using well-understood quantum Hall states.</description>

Abstract: Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) combined with electrical modes provides a powerful contactless approach to characterize material electrical properties at the nanoscale. However, conventional electrostatic models often overlook dynamic charge effects, which are particularly relevant for 2D materials deposited on insulating substrates. In this work, we introduce a theoretical framework that extends traditional electrostatic models by incorporating charge dynamics, analyzing two key cases: quasi-ideal conductors and quasi-ideal insulators. Our model establishes a characteristic timescale, $\tau$, which governs charge redistribution and measurement reliability. Experimental validation using Graphene Oxide, Reduced Graphene Oxide, and lightly reduced GO demonstrates strong dependence of frequency shift on surface conductivity, confirming our predictions. Temperature-dependent measurements further reveal conductivity variations consistent with disordered electronic materials. These findings provide critical insight into the impact of finite surface conductivity on AFM-based techniques and establish a novel method for evaluating charge dynamics in individual flakes of 2D materials and propose an alternative, contactless method for estimating surface conductivity.</description>

      <title>Enantiosensitive locking of photoelectron spin and cation orientation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When electrons pass through chiral molecules, their transmission is strongly influenced by the orientation of their spin: molecules with opposite handedness preferentially transmit electrons with oppositely aligned spins. The underlying nature of this striking phenomenon, known as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), remains controversial: its observed strength far surpasses predictions based on the typically weak spin-orbit interaction. A significant fraction of CISS phenomena are driven by light, and thus could be controlled at the ultrafast scale, and impact chemical change following photoionization or photoexcitation. To date, most studies of spin-selective enantio-sensitive photodynamics have concentrated on the influence of the magnetic field component of light. Here, we establish dynamical and geometric mechanisms of spin-selective photo-induced dynamics that arise purely from electric dipole interactions. Using one-photon ionization as an example, we report a new effect: enantio-sensitive locking of molecular cation orientation to the spins of the photoelectron and the hole in the parent molecule. One-photon ionization is an ubiquitous process, where CISS has already been found in oriented samples. Remarkably, the new effect that we report here emerges upon photoionization of randomly oriented chiral molecules, establishing CISS in amorphous chiral media.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Favorability of the 1T Phase over the 1H Phase in Group III Metal Monochalcogenide Zigzag Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05971v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Owing to the promising optoelectronic and thermoelectric properties of two-dimensional (2D) group III-VI materials (MXs), their nanoribbons (NRs) have attracted notable attention as an emerging class of quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) nanostructures. Due to the fact that the most stable 2D monolayer polymorph of MXs is the 1H phase, to date, existing studies in the literature have predominantly focused on the NRs formed from 1H phase MXs. Nevertheless, NRs of the 1T phase have received little to no attention. Employing ab initio simulations based on density functional theory, we systematically compared the thermodynamic stability of hydrogen passivated and unpassivated 1T and 1H ZNRs of GaS, GaSe, and InSe. Our results reveal that non-polar 1T phase MX ZNRs are thermodynamically more favorable than polar 1H MX ZNRs at widths up to 34 nm, a range that is realizable through contemporary experimental fabrication techniques. Furthermore, unlike metallic 1H ZNRs, 1T ZNRs remain semiconductor and retain a Mexican-hat-shaped top valence bands. Complementarily, hydrogenation energies of 1T InSe ZNRs are positive, and due to the edge-localized states, the 1T unpassivated ZNRs possess nearly flat top valence bands. Our findings serve as a compass for subsequent synthesis pathways of group III-VI NRs.</description>

We demonstrate that the bound photon pairs can concentrate at the edge of the array and link this to the non-Hermitian skin effect. Unlike tight-binding non-Hermitian setups, the bound states in the waveguide-coupled array exhibit infinite radiative lifetimes when the array has an infinite size. However, in a finite array, non-Hermiticity and localization of bound pairs emerge due to their chiral dissociation into scattering states. Counterintuitively, when the photons are preferentially emitted to the right, the bound pairs are localized at the left edge of the array and vice versa.</description>

      <title>The fundamental localization phases in quasiperiodic systems: A unified framework and exact results</title>

Abstract: The disordered quantum systems host three types of quantum states, the extended, localized, and critical, which bring up seven distinct fundamental phases in nature: three pure phases and four coexisting ones with mobility edges, yet a unified theory with full characterization and realization of all these phases has not been developed. Here we propose a complete and unified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic (QP) system which realizes all the fundamental localization phases, with the exact and universal results being obtained for their characterization. First, we show that the pure phases are obtained when the chiral symmetry preserves in the proposed spinful QP model, giving a criterion for the emergence of the pure phases and otherwise the coexisting ones. Further, we uncover a novel universal mechanism for the critical states that their emergence is protected by the generalized incommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful QP model, which considerably broadens the rigorous realizations of the exotic critical states. We then show the criteria of exact solvability for the present spinful QP system, with which we construct various exactly solvable models for all distinct localization phases. In particular, we propose two novel models, dubbed spin-selective QP lattice model and QP optical Raman lattice model, to achieve all basic types of mobility edges and all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization physics, respectively. The experimental scheme is proposed and studied in detail to realize these models with high feasibility. This study establishes a complete and profound theoretical framework which enables an in-depth exploration of the broad classes of all fundamental localization phenomena in QP systems, and offers key insights for constructing their exactly solvable models with experimental feasibility.</description>

      <title>Threshold-less and Flexibly Tunable Frequency Comb via Floquet Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05877</link>

Abstract: Frequency combs have revolutionized communication, metrology and spectroscopy. Numerous efforts have been dedicated to developing integrated combs, predominantly relying on Pockels or Kerr mechanisms. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a new type of frequency comb-Floquet cavity frequency comb-that does not rely on intrinsic material non-linearity. By periodically modulating the resonance frequency of a cavity, a Floquet cavity with multiple equally spaced frequency components is created. The pump tone interacts with the pre-modulated cavity, generating the output frequency comb. This approach offers a flexible tuning range and operates in a threshold-less manner, obviating the need to overcome nonlinear initiation threshold. We implement this on a microwave cavity optomechanical system on-chip. Compared to Kerr optomechanical combs, this approach efficiently generates comb with pump signal far from the cavity's intrinsic frequency, and the power required for detection is reduced by approximately a factor of \(10^6\), providing a promising platform for frequency comb generation.</description>
