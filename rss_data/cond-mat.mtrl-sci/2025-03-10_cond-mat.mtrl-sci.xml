      <title>Lateral Exchange Bias for N\'eel-Vector Control in Atomically Thin Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomically thin van der Waals (vdW) magnets have emerged as a fascinating platform for the exploration of novel physical phenomena arising from their reduced dimensionality and exceptional material properties. Their single-crystalline nature and ultimate miniaturization position them as leading candidates for next-generation spintronic applications. Antiferromagnetic (AF) vdW magnets are of particular interest, as they combine the advantages of vdW magnets with the functionality of AF spintronics, offering unique opportunities for ultrafast and robust spintronic devices. However, the lack of approaches to locally and deterministically manipulate their order parameter -- the N\'eel-vector -- remains a key limitation. Here, we introduce a fundamentally new paradigm in nanomagnetism, which we term lateral exchange bias (LEB), to achieve N\'eel vector control in bilayers of the vdW AF CrSBr. We exploit the single-crystalline registry formed by terraced CrSBr samples, where the bilayer N\'eel vector is controlled by LEB from neighboring, odd-layered flakes, whose nonzero magnetization we manipulate using magnetic fields. Using this control, we achieve nonvolatile manipulation of magnetic domains and domain walls (DWs) in AF CrSBr bilayers, establishing a powerful toolkit for controlling atomically thin AFs at the nanoscale. Our results challenge conventional views on exchange bias and provide a previously unexplored mechanism for achieving atomic-scale control of AFic order. Our findings pave the way for the development of advanced spintronic architectures and quantum technologies based on vdW magnets.</description>

      <title>Red Emission from Strain-Relaxed Bulk InGaN Active Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-In-content InGaN quantum wells (QWs) in red light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are typically grown at low temperatures to ensure effective In incorporation. In this study, red LEDs based on bulk InGaN active region were demonstrated. The growth temperature of bulk InGaN was ~800C, which is over 100C higher than the typical growth temperature of red QWs. By introducing high-density trench structures in the underlying green multi-quantum wells (MQWs), the compressive strain in bulk InGaN was relaxed by ~96%. With strain relaxation, phase separation occurred in the bulk InGaN, forming low-In-content (blue) and high-In-content (red) phases. The red phase acted as carrier localization centers, enabling red light emission under electrical injection. The red LEDs based on bulk InGaN exhibited a peak wavelength of 645 nm at 20 mA, with on-wafer peak external quantum efficiency of 0.32%. This study presents a new epitaxial strategy for red InGaN LEDs.</description>

      <title>A full breakthrough in vacuum ultraviolet nonlinear optical performance of NH4B4O6F</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of suitable vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals has hindered the development of compact, high-power VUV sources via second harmonic generation (SHG). Here, we report on the development of the fluorooxoborate crystal NH4B4O6F (ABF) as a promising material for VUV light generation. For the first time, devices with specific phase-matching angles were constructed, achieving a record 158.9 nm VUV light through phase-matching SHG and a maximum nanosecond pulse energy of 4.8 mJ at 177.3 nm with a conversion efficiency of 5.9 %. The enhanced NLO performance is attributed to optimized arrangements of fluorine-based units creating asymmetric sublattices. This work marks a significant milestone in the field of NLO materials, facilitating the future applications of compact, high-power VUV lasers utilizing ABF.</description>

      <title>Revealing localised dark-exciton populations in 2D perovskites via magneto-optical microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The successful development of optoelectronic devices is contingent on a detailed understanding of interactions between light and excited energy states in photoactive materials. In 2D perovskites, excitons are the dominant photogenerated species and their energetic structure plays a pivotal role, governing photon absorption and emission processes. In these materials, dark exciton states can undergo photoluminescence due to the relaxation of selection rules and this process can be modulated by an external magnetic field, enabling unambiguous identification of the exciton fine structure. Previous reports of magneto-optical spectroscopy on 2D perovskites have been restricted to the macroscopic response, where key information is lost regarding the microscopic heterogeneity of the photoluminescence. Here, we use magneto-optical microscopy for the first time on perovskite materials to elucidate the spatial variation of exciton emission processes. In 2D perovskite thin films, we distinguish between regions of localised bright and dark exciton populations, correlated to the film morphology. In single crystals, we show that dark excitons become localised at the edges, where excitons can be trapped in two distinct types of sub-gap states. This work represents significant progress in understanding the properties of exciton emission in 2D perovskites, which is crucial for the development of optoelectronic technology.</description>

      <title>Neutral but Impactful: Gallium Cluster-Induced Nanopores from Beam-Blanked Gallium Ion Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral atoms emitted from liquid metal ion sources are an often-overlooked source of contamination and damage in focused ion beam microscopy. Beyond ions and single atoms, these sources also emit atom clusters. While most studies have investigated charged clusters, here we demonstrate that neutral clusters are also emitted. These neutral clusters bypass the electrostatic beam blanking system, allowing them to impinge on samples even when the ion beam is blanked. We investigate this phenomenon using thin (&lt;20 nm) freestanding membranes of hexagonal boron nitride, silicon, and silicon nitride as targets. Randomly dispersed nanopores that form upon neutral cluster exposure are revealed. The average nanopore diameter is ~2 nm with a narrow size distribution, suggesting that the atom clusters emitted from the source have a preferred size. Various electron microscopy techniques are used to characterize the nanopores, including high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, multislice ptychography, and electron energy-loss spectroscopy. Finally, we show how electron irradiation in the transmission electron microscope can be used to both remove any amorphous material that may clog the pores and to controllably grow the pores to specific sizes. Tunable nanopores such as these are interesting for nanofluidic applications involving size-selective membranes.</description>

      <title>Thickening of liquids using copolymer grafted nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise control over the flow behavior of liquids is a critical problem and is demanding for multifaceted applications. Introducing surface-engineered nanoparticles into the liquid can tune the flow behavior. However, the extent of tunability depends on the compatibility of the surface groups on nanoparticles and the liquid matrix. Herein, we report a strategy to synthesize solvophilic surface-engineered nanoparticles demonstrating its capability to control the flow property of chemically distinct liquids like silicone oil and polyethylene glycol. Silylated polyether amine-modified silica nanoparticles with polymer brush-like structure were selected as the model synthesized material. By combining rheological experiments with coarse-grained molecular dynamic (CGMD) simulations, we demonstrate that adding these grafted nanoparticles significantly impacts the viscosity of both liquids. The impact of grafting density on the rheological properties was also corroborated. Simulations indicate the formation of a diverse array of nanoparticle microstructures, including contact aggregates, bridged aggregates, and one-dimensional string-like structures that dictate the viscosity of the material. Furthermore, we show that copolymers with predominantly matrix-compatible moieties facilitate the intercalation of matrix molecules within the polymer brushes, enhancing interactions at the molecular level. This work provides fundamental insights into the design of composite materials with tunable rheological properties, offering new pathways for optimizing liquid formulations.</description>

      <title>First-principles theory of ionic thermoelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry plays a crucial role in shaping the theories of fundamental forces. For example, general covariance -- the equivalence of all possible coordinate systems of spacetime -- dictates the law of gravity. Here, we extend this concept to nonequilibrium thermodynamics by developing a theory of ionic thermoelectricity (thermoelectricity without electrons) in electronically gapped ionic conductors. Within the Green-Kubo formalism, we show that energy gauge invariance -- the equivalence of all possible ways of distributing energy among atoms -- primarily determines the expressions for ionic thermoelectric coefficients. This symmetry-dictated theory is generally applicable, regardless of specific ion transport mechanisms, and provides a rigorous conceptual and computational framework for describing ionic thermoelectricity from first principles.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of tortuosity: A radical tessellation-based method in porous spherical particle packing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the tortuosity of porous electrodes is important for understanding the performance of lithium-ion batteries and optimizing the design of electrode microstructures. In this work, a new method for estimating the tortuosity of porous electrodes is proposed based on radical tessellation, and the results agree well with those calculated by empirical formulas and finite element simulations. Compared with empirical formulas, the proposed method can estimate tortuosity for more complicated microstructures, regardless of particle distribution and size dispersity; compared with finite element simulations, the proposed method offers a significant advantage in computational efficiency. Based on the method, the influence of different microstructure characters on the tortuosity is discussed. It is found that in addition to the porosity, the particle size and particle aggregation morphology are all critical in influencing the tortuosity of the porous electrode. Finally, the tortuosity obtained by this method is integrated into the Pseudo-2-dimensional (P2D) model for the calculation of effective properties, and the results show that this method offers an efficient way in improving the prediction accuracy of P2D models.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the breathing-mode distortions in nickelate-ferroelectric heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In transition metal oxides electron-electron interaction and lattice degree of freedom are basic ingredients of emergent phenomena, such as metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) and superconductivity. Perovskite rare-earth nickelates are largely studied for their temperature-driven MIT which is accompanied by a breathing mode distortion, and associated to a bond-disproportionation of the expanded (3d8L0) and compressed (3d8L2) NiO6 octahedra. Steric effects control the onset temperature of the MIT, the latter being concomitant or not with a complex antiferromagnetic spin arrangement depending upon the choice of the rare earth ion (TMIT&gt;TNeel). Interface engineering of oxygen octahedra tilting, as imposed by the symmetry and orientation of the substrate, has resulted in an efficient pathway to modify both TMIT and TNeel, hence, suggesting a key role of the electron-phonon coupling for both transport and magnetic properties in nickelate thin films. Here, via a combination of resonant elastic X-ray scattering and transport experiments, we show a control over both TMIT and TNeel in heteroepitaxial PZT(d)/NNO(7 nm)//STO heterostructures, which are characterized by different strains and polarization states of the PZT layer grown at different thicknesses d. We found the expected NNO bulk behaviour, for a fully relaxed PZT layer showing a monodomain polarization state. On the other side, an almost 30 K difference, is found for a fully strained PZT characterized by a multidomain texture of the polarization state. We discuss our results in terms of an altered breathing distortion pattern of the underlying nickelate layer as supported by X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements. We infer that locally different polar distortions controlled by a combination of polarization direction and strength of the strain state play the main role in the observed TMIT and TNeel variations.</description>

      <title>Raman Forbidden Layer-Breathing Modes in Layered Semiconductor Materials Activated by Phonon and Optical Cavity Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report Raman forbidden layer-breathing modes (LBMs) in layered semiconductor materials (LSMs). The intensity distribution of all observed LBMs depends on layer number, incident light wavelength and refractive index mismatch between LSM and underlying substrate. These results are understood by a Raman scattering theory via the proposed spatial interference model, where the naturally occurring optical and phonon cavities in LSMs enable spatially coherent photon-phonon coupling mediated by the corresponding one-dimensional periodic electronic states. Our work reveals the spatial coherence of photon and phonon fields on the phonon excitation via photon/phonon cavity engineering.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of propagating spin waves in spin Hall oscillators: A micromagnetic study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the synchronization of propagating spin waves in a novel spin torque oscillator device layout using micromagnetic simulations. This design enables individual probing of the dc current in each oscillator, allowing precise control over the synchronization state and providing direct phase measurement. Our findings reveal that two adjacent oscillators achieve phase locking when they maintain a constant phase difference, either in phase or anti-phase, depending on their separation distance. This work offers new insights into STO synchronization mechanisms and paves the way for improved control and functionality in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Curvature-Controlled Polarization in Adaptive Ferroelectric Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the ferroelectric domain structure and mechanical properties of PbTiO$_3$-based membranes, which develops a well-ordered and crystallographic-oriented ripple pattern upon release from their growth substrate. The ferrolectric domain structure of the PbTiO$_3$ layer was examined at various length scales using optical second harmonic generation, piezoresponse force microscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy. These methods reveal the presence of purely in-plane domains organized into superdomains at the crest of the ripples, while an in-plane/out-of-plane domain structure was observed in the flat regions separating the ripples, in agreement with phase-field simulations. The mechanical properties of the membrane were assessed using contact resonance force microscopy, which identified distinct mechanical behaviors at the ripples compared to the flat regions. This study shows that the physical properties of the ferroelectric layer in membranes can be locally controlled within an ordered array of ripples, with well-defined geometric characteristics.</description>

      <title>Automatic determination of quasicrystalline patterns from microscopy images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasicrystals are aperiodically ordered solids that exhibit long-range order without translational periodicity, bridging the gap between crystalline and amorphous materials. Due to their lack of translational periodicity, information on atomic arrangements in quasicrystals cannot be extracted by current crystalline lattice recognition softwares. This work introduces a method to automatically detect quasicrystalline atomic arrangements and tiling using image feature recognition coupled with machine learning, tailored towards quasiperiodic tilings with 8-, 10- and 12-fold rotational symmetry. Atom positions are identified using clustering of feature descriptors. Subsequent nearest-neighbor analysis and border following on the interatomic connections deliver the tiling. Support vector machines further increase the quality of the results, reaching an accuracy consistent with those reported in the literature. A statistical analysis of the results is performed. The code is now part of the open-source package AiSurf.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Improved Density Functional Theory Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The predictive accuracy of density functional theory (DFT) for alloy formation enthalpies is often limited by intrinsic energy resolution errors, particularly in ternary phase stability calculations. In this work, we present a machine learning (ML) approach to systematically correct these errors, improving the reliability of first-principles predictions. A neural network model has been trained to predict the discrepancy between DFT-calculated and experimentally measured enthalpies for binary and ternary alloys and compounds. The model utilizes a structured feature set comprising elemental concentrations, atomic numbers, and interaction terms to capture key chemical and structural effects. By applying supervised learning and rigorous data curation we ensure a robust and physically meaningful correction. The model is implemented as a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) regressor with three hidden layers, optimized through leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) and k-fold cross-validation to prevent overfitting. We illustrate the effectiveness of this method by applying it to the Al-Ni-Pd and Al-Ni-Ti systems, which are of interest for high-temperature applications in aerospace and protective coatings.</description>

      <title>opXRD: Open Experimental Powder X-ray Diffraction Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Powder X-ray diffraction (pXRD) experiments are a cornerstone for materials structure characterization. Despite their widespread application, analyzing pXRD diffractograms still presents a significant challenge to automation and a bottleneck in high-throughput discovery in self-driving labs. Machine learning promises to resolve this bottleneck by enabling automated powder diffraction analysis. A notable difficulty in applying machine learning to this domain is the lack of sufficiently sized experimental datasets, which has constrained researchers to train primarily on simulated data. However, models trained on simulated pXRD patterns showed limited generalization to experimental patterns, particularly for low-quality experimental patterns with high noise levels and elevated backgrounds. With the Open Experimental Powder X-Ray Diffraction Database (opXRD), we provide an openly available and easily accessible dataset of labeled and unlabeled experimental powder diffractograms. Labeled opXRD data can be used to evaluate the performance of models on experimental data and unlabeled opXRD data can help improve the performance of models on experimental data, e.g. through transfer learning methods. We collected \numpatterns diffractograms, 2179 of them labeled, from a wide spectrum of materials classes. We hope this ongoing effort can guide machine learning research toward fully automated analysis of pXRD data and thus enable future self-driving materials labs.</description>

      <title>Properties of Electrodeposited Molybdenum Disulfide on Zinc Oxide and Zinc Oxide/Zinc Sulfide Nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a facile and scalable 3-step hydrothermal, electrodeposition, and annealing technique to synthesize a variety of nanowire heterostructures. The heterojunction catalysts of CP-ZnO-MoS2 and CP-ZnO-ZnS-MoS2 both saw an increase in catalytic activity in the acidic regime, with overpotentials to reach 10 mA/cm2 of 181 mV and 154 mV respectively, over their constituent materials. The CP-ZnO-ZnS-MoS2 catalysts also saw an increase in catalytic activity in the alkaline conditions, requiring only 209 mV to reach 10 mA/cm2. This has been attributed primarily to the synergistic properties of the band alignment structure and the increased surface area afforded by the nanowire structure. The 1T phase was also noted in the CP-ZnO-MoS2 sample, suggesting that this also played a role in increasing the catalytic activity of the sample. Overall, the synthesized nanowire heterostructures were found to be high-performing and gives insight into how the changing band alignment and morphology can play a significant role in increasing the catalytic performance towards HER.</description>

      <title>A high-throughput ab initio study of elemental segregation and cohesion at ferritic-iron grain boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segregation of alloying elements and impurities at grain boundaries (GBs) critically influences material behavior by affecting cohesion. In this study, we present an ab initio high-throughput evaluation of segregation energies and cohesive effects for all elements in the periodic table (Z: 1 to 92, H to U) across six model ferritic iron GBs using density functional theory (DFT). From these data, we construct comprehensive elemental maps for solute segregation tendencies and cohesion at GBs, providing guidance for segregation engineering. We systematically assess the cohesive effects of different elements in all segregating positions along multiple fracture paths with a quantum-chemistry bond-order method as well as a modified Rice-Wang theory of interfacial cohesion. The effects of segregants on the cohesion of GBs are shown to vary drastically as a function of site character, and hence their induced cohesive effects must be considered as a thermodynamic average over the spectral energy distribution. Thus, models that overlook these aspects may fail to accurately predict the impacts of varying alloying concentrations, thermal processing conditions, or GB types. The insights presented here, along with our accompanying dataset, are expected to advance our understanding of GB segregation in steels and other materials.</description>

      <title>Ion mobility and segregation in seed surfaces subjected to cold plasma treatments</title>

Abstract: Plasma treatment of seeds is an efficient procedure to accelerate germination, to improve initial stages of plant growth and for protection against pathogens infection. Most studies relate these beneficial effects with biochemical modifications affecting the metabolism and genetical growth factors of seeds and young plants. Using barley seeds, in this work we investigate the redistribution of ions in the seed surface upon their treatment with cold air plasmas. In addition, we investigate the effect of plasma in the lixiviation of ions through the seeds hull when they are immersed in water. Ions re-distribution in the outer layers of air plasma treated seeds has been experimentally determined through X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy analysis in combination with chemical in-depth profiling with gas cluster ion beams. The results show that in the shallowest layers of the seed hull (at least up to a depth of 100 nm) there is an enrichment of K+ and Ca2+ ions, in addition to changes in the O/C and N/C atomic ratios. These data have been confirmed with the electron microscopy/fluorescence analysis of seed cuts. Observations have been accounted for by a Monte Carlo model simulating the electrostatic interactions that develop between the negative charge accumulated at the seed surface due to the interaction with the plasma sheath and the positive ions existing in the interior of seeds. Furthermore, it is shown that upon water immersion of plasma treated seeds mobilized ions tend to lixiviate more efficiently than in pristine seeds. The detection of a significant concentration of NO3- anions in the water has been attributed to a secondary reaction of nitrogen species incorporated into the seeds during plasma exposure with reactive oxygen species formed on their surface during this treatment. The implications of these findings for the improvement of germination capacity of seeds are discussed.</description>

Abstract: Simulation-based approaches to microstructure generation can suffer from a variety of limitations, such as high memory usage, long computational times, and difficulties in generating complex geometries. Generative machine learning models present a way around these issues, but they have previously been limited by the fixed size of their generation area. We present a new microstructure generation methodology leveraging advances in inpainting using denoising diffusion models to overcome this generation area limitation. We show that microstructures generated with the presented methodology are statistically similar to grain structures generated with a kinetic Monte Carlo simulator, SPPARKS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the novel electron beam resist Medusa 84 SiH by Allresist GmbH (Germany) for nanostructuring of single crystal diamond and its effects on the spin properties of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in nanopillars as prototypes for photonic structures. We find contrast curves comparable to those of resists previously used for this task (Hydrogensilsequioxane FOx). We present a minimum selectivity for diamond etching of 6$\pm$1. Using an adhesion-promoting silicon interlayer enables fabrication yields of up to 98\%. We measure $T_2$ times of up to $\sim$25 $\mu$s before and after processing, demonstrating that the manufactured structures are usable for diamond-based quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models to Address Data Scarcity in Machine Learning: Applications in Graphene Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning in materials science faces challenges due to limited experimental data, as generating synthesis data is costly and time-consuming, especially with in-house experiments. Mining data from existing literature introduces issues like mixed data quality, inconsistent formats, and variations in reporting experimental parameters, complicating the creation of consistent features for the learning algorithm. Additionally, combining continuous and discrete features can hinder the learning process with limited data. Here, we propose strategies that utilize large language models (LLMs) to enhance machine learning performance on a limited, heterogeneous dataset of graphene chemical vapor deposition synthesis compiled from existing literature. These strategies include prompting modalities for imputing missing data points and leveraging large language model embeddings to encode the complex nomenclature of substrates reported in chemical vapor deposition experiments. The proposed strategies enhance graphene layer classification using a support vector machine (SVM) model, increasing binary classification accuracy from 39% to 65% and ternary accuracy from 52% to 72%. We compare the performance of the SVM and a GPT-4 model, both trained and fine-tuned on the same data. Our results demonstrate that the numerical classifier, when combined with LLM-driven data enhancements, outperforms the standalone LLM predictor, highlighting that in data-scarce scenarios, improving predictive learning with LLM strategies requires more than simple fine-tuning on datasets. Instead, it necessitates sophisticated approaches for data imputation and feature space homogenization to achieve optimal performance. The proposed strategies emphasize data enhancement techniques, offering a broadly applicable framework for improving machine learning performance on scarce, inhomogeneous datasets.</description>

      <title>Revealing Quantum Geometry in Nonlinear Quantum Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Berry curvature-related topological phenomena have been a central topic in condensed matter physics. Yet, until recently other quantum geometric quantities such as the metric and connection received only little attention due to the relatively few effects which have been documented for them. This review gives a modern perspective how quantum geometric quantities naturally enter the nonlinear responses of quantum materials and demonstrate their deep connection with excitation energy, lifetimes, symmetry, and corresponding physical processes. The multitude of nonlinear responses can be subdivided into nonlinear optical effects, subgap responses, and nonlinear transport phenomena. Such a distinction by energy scales facilitates an intuitive understanding of the underlying electronic transitions, giving rise to a unified picture of the electron motion beyond linear order. The well-known injection and shift currents constitute the main resonances in the optical regime. Exploiting their respective lifetime and symmetry dependencies, this review elucidates how these resonances can be distinguished by a corresponding quantum geometric quantity that shares the same symmetry. This is followed by a brief exposition of the role of quasiparticle lifetimes for nonlinear subgap responses, which presents a window into the microscopic short-term dynamics as well as the ground state correlation and localization. We conclude with an account of the anomalous motion due to the Berry curvature dipole and quantum metric dipole in nonlinear transport, clarifying the correspondence between physical observables and the underlying mechanisms. This review highlights the close relationship between quantum geometry and nonlinear response, showing the way towards promising probes of quantum geometry and enabling novel avenues to characterize complex materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Insulators containing chains of magnetic transition metal cations provide platforms for probing spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ dynamics and quantum critical behavior. Li$_2$CoCl$_4$ contains edge-sharing CoCl$_6$ octahedra that form chains along the crystallographic $c$ axis and orders antiferromagnetically at zero field, but questions remain about its applied-field magnetic structure and the Co$^{2+}$ spin state. Here, we show with neutron diffraction on a polycrystalline sample how the anti-aligned chains of cobalt moments undergo a spin-flop transition to a field-aligned ferromagnetic state above 1.6~T. Further, using magnetic resonance absorption measurements and paramagnetic spin models, we reveal the strongly anisotropic nature of the Co$^{2+}$ ion's $XY$-like magnetic behavior ($g_{\parallel}=2.77$ and $g_{\perp}=5.23$) and its $J=\frac{1}{2}$ ground state. We, therefore, supply the magnetic structures and anisotropic description needed to explore the dynamics of the field-driven magnetic phases, laying the foundation for further experimental and theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Centrifugation theory revisited: Understanding and modelling the centrifugation of 2D nanosheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Size selection of liquid-dispersed 2D nanomaterials is a prerequisite for size-dependent studies in earlier stage research and for their targeted application in commercial settings. Centrifugation is the most widespread method for reliably sorting suspensions of polydisperse 2D nanosheets according to size. However, whilst centrifugation is effective, no a priori models are available to predict the outcome of centrifugation, making time consuming iterative experiments necessary. Here we present a simple model for the behaviour of 2D nanosheets during centrifugation and benchmark its predictions against experiments. This model uses simple expressions, specific to 2D particles, for the hydrodynamic radius, effective density and viscous resistance to generate the equation of motion of individual nanosheet during centrifugation. Critically, the equation of motion is then used to predict nanosheet size distributions within centrifugation products. This in turn leads to equations for easily measurable properties such as mean and maximum nanosheet sizes obtained during centrifugation-based fractionation. Comparison with experimental data demonstrates the robustness of this model for a range of 2D materials and solvent systems, and its ability to describe quite subtle effects. These results will enable more tailored size selection of nanosheets for specific applications and offer new mechanistic insights to optimise exfoliation conditions.</description>

Abstract: Harmonic Hall measurements were conducted on a series of Ferromagnetic metal/Heavy metal (FM/HM) bilayers with beta-Tungsten (W) as the HM and in-plane magnetized permalloy (Py) as the FM and the efficiencies of the two orthogonal components of the spin orbit-torque were extracted. Two sets of Hall bar-shaped devices were considered where the HM resistivity systematically varied over a wide range (sim150-1000 muOmega-cm) while the FM layer remained the same and each set having a different aspect ratio of voltage pickup line width and Hall bar width. Using numerical simulations of current distribution at the region between voltage pickup lines we have normalised the SOT efficiencies and examined their dependence. The current-induced spin-orbit torque efficiency in ferromagnetic metal (FM)/heavy metal (HM) bilayers is quantitatively investigated in this study.beta-W, known for its high spin-orbit coupling, served as the HM layer, while Py, an FM with an in-plane magnetic anisotropy, comprised the other layer. We performed a thorough analysis of the second harmonic Hall resistance (R_{xy}^{2\omega}) obtained from Py/beta-W bilayer devices, systematically varying the resistivity (rho_W) of the beta-W layer within the range of 200 to 1000 \mu\Omega-cm by employing a fixed current density (J_W\sim0.8\times10^{11} A/m^2) through beta-W. Through this analysis, we derived the Slonczewski-like efficiency (xi_{SL}) and field-like efficiency (\xi_{FL}) as a function of rho_W. Notably, the device with a resistivity of 980 muOmega-cm exhibited the highest xi_{SL}, yielding a value of -0.42 0.09. These results highlight the promising potential of highly resistiv beta-W as a material of interest in spintronics research.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence of nitrogen-vacancy spin ensembles in a nitrogen spin bath in diamond under dynamical decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has emerged as a leading qubit platform for quantum technology applications. One of the key challenges for NV-based quantum applications is building an accurate model to predict its decoherence properties and their quantum nature. In this study, we combine theory and experiment to investigate NV decoherence dynamics in the presence of nitrogen donor (P1 center) baths, which is one of the dominant decoherence sources in diamond. We employ a cluster-correlation expansion (CCE) method to compute the NV decoherence under the Hahn-echo (HE) and Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) pulse sequences at various P1 concentrations from 1ppm to 300 ppm. We show that the coherence time (T2) increases with the number of pi pulses applied, indicating that the NV spin is decoupled from the P1 bath. Notably, we find that T2 scales quadratically as a function of the pulse number, on a logarithmic scale, as opposed to the linear scaling predicted by widely accepted semi-classical theories in the literature. In our experiment, we measure the CPMG signal for two diamond samples with high P1 concentrations of 0.8ppm and 13ppm. We demonstrate that the T2 scaling is indeed quadratic, thus confirming our theoretical predictions. Our results show that the quantum bath model combined with the CCE method can accurately capture the quantum nature of the P1-driven NV decoherence. Our study opens a new avenue for developing a complete noise model that could be used to optimize the performance of NV-based quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Localized necking under global compression in two-scale metallic hierarchical solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchically structured cellular solids have attracted increasing attention for their superior mass-specific mechanical properties. Using a remeshing-based continuum finite element (FE) framework, we reveal that two-scale metallic hierarchical solids exhibit a distinct, localized deformation mode that involves necking and fracture of microscale tension members even at small global compressive strains (3-5%). The tensile failure is always preceded by plastic buckling of a complementary compression member. This combined necking-buckling (NB) mode critically underlies the collapse of hexagon-triangle (HTH) hierarchical lattices over a wide range of relative densities and length-scale ratios and is also seen in diamond-triangle (DTH) lattices. In lattices with very slender microscale members, necking is prevented by a competing failure mode that involves coordinated buckling (CB) of multiple members. Our custom remeshing FE framework is critical to resolve the localized large plastic strains, ductile failure, and complex local modes of deformation (including cusp formation) that are characteristic of the NB mode. A theoretical buckling analysis supports the inevitability of the NB and CB modes in HTH lattices. The occurrence of the NB mode has consequences for energy absorption by two-scale hierarchical solids, and hence influences their design.</description>

      <title>Discovery of unconventional charge-spin-intertwined density wave in magnetic kagome metal GdTi3Bi4</title>

Abstract: The symmetry breaking and its interplay among spin, charge, and lattice degrees of freedom is crucial for understanding correlated quantum states such as charge density waves (CDWs) and unconventional superconductivity. Here, we report the discovery by low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy of unconventional charge-spin-intertwined density waves in magnetic kagome metal GdTi3Bi4, which exhibits the one-third magnetization plateau. We reveal the emergence of 3Q CDWs incommensurate with the crystalline lattice in both periodicity and orientation, breaking all mirror and rotation symmetries. The CDW exhibits incommensurate-commensurate transitions in an applied magnetic field and transitions between 3Q and 1Q CDWs as a function of field and temperature, accompanied by changes in the spatial symmetries. Remarkably, the quantum and classic melting of the CDWs exhibits a phase structure which is consistent with the magnetization phase diagram of bulk GdTi3Bi4, providing strong evidence for the intertwined charge-spin density wave order. The origin of the charge-spin intertwinement is further evidenced by the observed hybridization between itinerant electrons and Gd local moments. Our findings uncover an unconventional form of charge-spin orders and offer new insights into a broad class of multi-components density wave formation in kagome and other correlated quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Optical control of the spin-Hall effect in a two-dimensional hole gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic effects influence the motion of charged particles in solids by intertwining spin and momentum. The resulting phenomena exhibit rich and intriguing properties that can unveil radically new quantum devices. In this context, the two-dimensional hole gas formed in group IV heterostructures is a particularly promising platform, owning to a notable spin-orbit coupling. However, the exploitation of spin-momentum locking and precise manipulation of spin currents has remained elusive thus far. Here we use the modulation-doping technique to break inversion symmetry at novel Ge1-xSnx/Ge interfaces and explore spin-orbit phenomena in the emergent Rashba-coupled hole gases. Magneto-optical investigations demonstrate the unusual establishment of a staggered band alignment with carrier lifetime in the ns range. Optical spin orientation is then leveraged to directly inject spin-polarized currents in the Rashba-split 2D gas. Spin-to-charge conversion is shown to genuinely occur at the staggered gap through the inverse spin-Hall effect. This provides unprecedented access to low-order contributions of the spin-orbit Hamiltonian. Moreover, it leads to the startling demonstration that the spin Hall angle can be optically controlled by modifying the Rashba coupling through the photoexcitation density. Ge1-xSnx quantum wells thus offer innovative solutions and functionalities stemming from their unique spin-dependent properties and intriguing quantum phenomena at the crossroad between transport and photonic realms.</description>

Abstract: Herein, the structure and stability of double icosahedron Ag$_{17}$M$_2$ (M = Ni, Cu, Zn) clusters are investigated using density functional theory (DFT) computations. The results indicate that the clusters favor endohedral configurations in the doublet state, as confirmed with four different functionals: BP86, PBE0, B3PW91, and TPSSh. Additionally, the doped clusters exhibit higher ionization energies and electronegativities compared those of the bare Ag$_{19}$ cluster. After doping, the ELF function increases at the Ag sites, which reveals important implications for catalysis.</description>

      <title>A new nanometre resolution method for probing densification ratio at nanoindentation sites in glass: Unravelling discrepancies in the literature</title>

      <description>arXiv:1601.06492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The region of permanent densification beneath a Berkovich indentation imprint in silica glass is investigated using a novel chemical dissolution technique. The use of the similitude regime in sharp indentation testing allows one to record reliable data with a good spatial resolution that makes it possible to deal with low loads (typically below 10 mN) and, more importantly, crack-free imprints. The densified zone dissolves more quickly than the non densified regions. The analysis of the results, along the vertical axis, indicates that the densification zone is rather homogeneous with a steep transition to the non densified zone. The size of the densification zone, with respect to the initial free surface, is estimated to be around two times the maximum penetration depth of the instrumented indentation test. These findings are compared with those obtained by numerical simulations using different constitutive equations from the literature. A very good concordance between Raman spectroscopy and chemical probe results is found for imprints made with no or few cracking events during indentation testing.</description>

      <title>DFT+DMFT investigation of the magnetic phase transition in the itinerant ferromagnet Fe$_{3}$GaTe$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding and designing ferromagnets that operate above room temperature is crucial in advancing high-performance spintronic devices. The pioneering van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet Fe$_{3}$GaTe$_{2}$ has extended the way for spintronic applications by achieving a record-high Curie temperature among its analogues. However, the physical mechanism of increasing Curie temperature in this material still needs to be explored. Here, we systematically investigate the electronic structures and magnetic properties of Fe$_{3}$GaTe$_{2}$ as a function of temperature using strongly correlated calculations, reconciling the dual nature of $d$-electrons with both localization and itinerant characters. Significantly, our study reveals the emergence of quasi-particle flat bands driven by many-body interactions, which enhance magnetic stability through a positive feedback mechanism. Furthermore, our results demonstrate the hybridization of these flat bands at low temperatures, indicating the possible presence of heavy fermion behavior in this system. Our findings suggest that tunable flat bands near the Fermi level may serve as a key factor in realizing materials with high magnetic transition temperatures and strong magnetic anisotropy. This research provides a promising pathway for exploring next-generation spintronic devices utilizing vdW flat band systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamical nonlinear optical response in time-periodic quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for calculating the linear and nonlinear optical responses of time-periodic quantum systems. Using density matrix evolution in the Floquet basis and adopting the length gauge, our approach incorporates both interband and intraband contributions of the position operator, enabling detailed insights into photon-assisted transitions and their associated optical phenomena. Notably, we identify a divergent ac response to dc fields in Floquet systems, reminiscent of a Drude peak at finite frequencies. This framework generalizes to optical tensor conductivity calculations at arbitrary perturbation orders and captures various DC photocurrents, including shift current, injection current, and Berry dipole contributions, under specific limits. To demonstrate the versatility of our method, we compute linear and nonlinear optical conductivities for one- and two-dimensional systems, revealing phenomena such as band inversions, j-photon-assisted transitions, and high harmonic generation. These results highlight the interplay between periodic driving and nonlinear optical effects, offering different avenues for exploring dynamical topological properties and their applications in ultrafast spintronics, optoelectronics, and strongly correlated systems. Our findings provide a robust platform for analyzing the complex optical behavior of driven quantum systems and guiding experimental investigations in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Anomalous-Hall Neel textures in altermagnetic materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the altermagnets, a new kind of colinear antiferromagnet with zero net magnetization and momentum-dependent spin-splitting of bands, have sparked great interest. Despite simple magnetic structures, these altermagnets exhibit intriguing and intricate dependence of AHE on the N\'eel vector, in contrast to the conventional perpendicular configuration of Hall current with magnetization in ferromagnets. In spite of being a crucial aspect in AHE research, the relationship between the AHE and the N\'eel vector remains largely elusive. Here, we propose a powerful "extrinsic parameter" method and further reveal diverse unconventional anomalous Hall textures in the N\'eel vector space, dubbed anomalous-Hall N\'eel textures (AHNTs) for altermagnets. Notably, we find that AHNTs resemble the spin textures in momentum space, and further reveal their symmetry origin. We identify 10 types across four categories of AHNTs in altermagnets. Meanwhile, we examine our key discoveries in prototypical altermagnets. Our work offers a complete classification of AHNTs and a thorough understanding of AHE in altermagnets.</description>

      <title>CrystalGRW: Generative Modeling of Crystal Structures with Targeted Properties via Geodesic Random Walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining whether a candidate crystalline material is thermodynamically stable depends on identifying its true ground-state structure, a central challenge in computational materials science. We introduce CrystalGRW, a diffusion-based generative model on Riemannian manifolds that proposes novel crystal configurations and can predict stable phases validated by density functional theory. The crystal properties, such as fractional coordinates, atomic types, and lattice matrices, are represented on suitable Riemannian manifolds, ensuring that new predictions generated through the diffusion process preserve the periodicity of crystal structures. We incorporate an equivariant graph neural network to also account for rotational and translational symmetries during the generation process. CrystalGRW demonstrates the ability to generate realistic crystal structures that are close to their ground states with accuracy comparable to existing models, while also enabling conditional control, such as specifying a desired crystallographic point group. These features help accelerate materials discovery and inverse design by offering stable, symmetry-consistent crystal candidates for experimental validation.</description>

      <title>Elastic constants of single-crystalline NiTi studied by resonant ultrasound spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contactless, laser-based resonant ultrasound spectroscopy was utilized to monitor changes in elastic properties in single-crystalline NiTi shape memory alloy. It was observed that the elastic behavior of the temperature-induced B19$^\prime$ martensite, which is formed by a fine mixture of variants, adopts the symmetry elements of the parent austenite phase, and thus, the changes over the transformation temperature can be represented by the temperature evolution of three cubic elastic coefficients. The experiments confirm that the transition during the cooling run is preceded by pronounced softening of the $c_{44}$ elastic coefficient, which leads to nearly complete vanishing of elastic anisotropy prior to the transition. Below the transition, this coefficient remains soft, and the character of anisotropy switches from $c_{44}/c^\prime&gt;1$ to $c_{44}/c^\prime&lt;1$. We rationalize this behavior from the mechanical instability of the B19$^\prime$ lattice with respect to shears along the (001)$_{B19^\prime}$ plane, which is known from first-principles calculations.</description>

      <title>Cove-edged Chiral Graphene Nanoribbons with Chirality-Dependent Bandgap and Carrier Mobility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have garnered significant interest due to their highly customizable physicochemical properties and potential utility in nanoelectronics. Besides controlling widths and edge structures, the inclusion of chirality in GNRs brings another dimension for fine-tuning their optoelectronic properties, but related studies remain elusive owing to the absence of feasible synthetic strategies. Here, we demonstrate a novel class of cove-edged chiral GNRs (CcGNRs) with a tunable chiral vector (n,m). Notably, the bandgap and effective mass of (n,2)- CcGNR show a distinct positive correlation with the increasing value of n, as indicated by theory. Within this GNR family, two representative members, namely, (4,2)- CcGNR and (6,2)-CcGNR, are successfully synthesized. Both CcGNRs exhibit prominently curved geometries arising from the incorporated [4]helicene motifs along their peripheries, as also evidenced by the single-crystal structures of the two respective model compounds (1 and 2). The chemical identities and optoelectronic properties of (4,2)- and (6,2)-CcGNRs are comprehensively investigated via a combination of IR, Raman, solid-state NMR, UV-vis, and THz spectroscopies as well as theoretical calculations. In line with theoretical expectation, the obtained (6,2)-CcGNR possesses a low optical bandgap of 1.37 eV along with charge carrier mobility of 8 cm2/Vs, whereas (4,2)-CcGNR exhibits a narrower bandgap of 1.26 eV with increased mobility of 14 cm2/Vs. This work opens up a new avenue to precisely engineer the bandgap and carrier mobility of GNRs by manipulating their chiral vector.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Interfacial Reconstruction Mechanism Enabling Stable Growth of the Delafossite PdCoO2 on Al2O3 and LaAlO3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Delafossites, comprised of noble metal (A+) and strongly correlated sublayers (BO2-), form natural superlattices with highly anisotropic properties. These properties hold significant promise for various applications, but their exploitation hinges on the successful growth of high-quality thin films on suitable substrates. Unfortunately, the unique lattice geometry of delafossites presents a significant challenge to thin-film fabrication. Different delafossites grow differently, even when deposited on the same substrate, ranging from successful epitaxy to complete growth suppression. These variations often lack a clear correlation to obvious causes like lattice mismatch. Unidentified stabilization mechanisms appear to enable growth in certain cases, allowing these materials to form stable thin films or act as buffer layers for subsequent delafossite growth. This study employs advanced scanning transmission electron microscopy techniques to investigate the nucleation mechanism underlying the stable growth of PdCoO2 films on Al2O3 and LaAlO3 substrates, grown via molecular-beam epitaxy. Our findings reveal the presence of a secondary phase within the substrate surface that stabilizes the films. This mechanism deviates from the conventional understanding of strain relief mechanisms at oxide heterostructure interfaces and differs significantly from those observed for Cu-based delafossites.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials with an ultra-low temperature coefficient of resistivity are desired for the temperature and flow sensors in high-precision electronic measuring systems. In this work, the Kubo-Greenwood formula, implemented in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, is employed to predict the finite-temperature resistivity of multi-component alloys with severe lattice distortion. We observe a tiny change in resistivity over a wide temperature range in high-entropy alloys. The electronic resistivity invar effect in B2 Ni$_{25}$Co$_{25}$(HfTiZr)$_{50}$ Elinvar alloys results from a balance between intrinsic and residual resistivity. This effect is associated with atomic displacements from ideal lattice sites, which are caused by lattice thermal vibrations and chemical disorder-induced lattice distortions. It is further evidenced by a decrease in lattice distortion with temperature and changes in the electronic density of states.</description>

      <title>A novel spectroscopic probe of ultrafast magnetization dynamics in the extreme ultraviolet spectral range</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of spectroscopic techniques in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectral range has significantly advanced the understanding of ultrafast interactions in magnetic systems triggered by optical excitation. In this work, we introduce a previously missing geometry that facilitates the observation of the ultrafast magnetization dynamics of magnetic systems with an out-of-plane magnetization grown on XUV opaque substrates. This novel approach to probe ultrafast magnetization dynamics combines the magneto-optical Kerr effect with the strong dependence of a sample's reflectance near its Brewster angle. It therefore works with linearly polarized light and does not require any additional polarizing optics. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the technique by presenting both simulations and experimental data as a function of the energy and the polarization of the XUV probe radiation as well as of the delay time after optical excitation.</description>

      <title>Modulation of Spin-Orbit Coupling, Spin Textures, and Rashba-Edelstein Response in Chiral Tellurium: A First-Principles Study</title>

Abstract: Chiral semiconductors such as elemental tellurium (Te) exhibit unconventional spin textures and large charge-to-spin conversion efficiencies, yet the influence of introducing elements on these properties remains underexplored. Here, we address this gap by investigating how substituting Te with lighter (S, Se) or heavier (Sb) elements systematically modifies the spin-orbit-driven phenomena in chiral Te, including the band structure, spin Berry curvature, and Rashba-Edelstein response. The objective is to determine whether elemental substitution strategies can be leveraged to optimize collinear spin textures, enhance spin accumulation, and possibly extend spin lifetimes all crucial aspects for magnet-free spintronics. Using density functional theory calculations implemented in Quantum ESPRESSO, combined with tight-binding interpolation in PAOFLOW, we map out the element-dependent electronic states and quantify their associated spin transport coefficients. Our findings reveal that lighter elements shift the Fermi level to regions of pronounced spin splitting, thereby increasing the magnitude of spin-current conversion, whereas heavier elements can introduce or remove near-degenerate bands that strongly affect spin-orbit coupling. In both scenarios, the fundamental chirality of Te remains robust, preserving the radial or ''collinear'' spin-momentum locking. These results not only confirm that introducing elements is a potent and feasible route for tuning spin-orbit phenomena but also offer practical guidelines for experimental efforts aiming to engineer chiral semiconductors for spin devices. By correlating element identity with specific spin-texture enhancements, this study paves the way for rationally designing next-generation spintronic components free from external magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Wyckoff Transformer: Generation of Symmetric Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry rules that atoms obey when they bond together to form an ordered crystal play a fundamental role in determining their physical, chemical, and electronic properties such as electrical and thermal conductivity, optical and polarization behavior, and mechanical strength. Almost all known crystalline materials have internal symmetry. Consistently generating stable crystal structures is still an open challenge, specifically because such symmetry rules are not accounted for. To address this issue, we propose WyFormer, a generative model for materials conditioned on space group symmetry. We use Wyckoff positions as the basis for an elegant, compressed, and discrete structure representation. To model the distribution, we develop a permutation-invariant autoregressive model based on the Transformer and an absence of positional encoding. WyFormer has a unique and powerful synergy of attributes, proven by extensive experimentation: best-in-class symmetry-conditioned generation, physics-motivated inductive bias, competitive stability of the generated structures, competitive material property prediction quality, and unparalleled inference speed.</description>

      <title>Tuning Magnetism of Metal-Organic Framework by Different Types of Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The properties of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are expected to be sensitive to external pressures because of their inherently flexible structures. Although pressure-driven structural transitions have been intensively studied, the influence of pressure on magnetism has been less exploited for MOFs. Especially, the efficiency of applied pressure may strongly depend on the pressure-transmitting medium (PTM) which may have a complex interaction with MOFs. Here, we report the distinctive effects of different types of pressure, including isotropic hydrostatic pressure, quasi-hydrostatic pressure, and uniaxial pressure, on the anisotropic magnetism of the perovskite MOF, [CH3NH3][Co(COOH)3]. It is found that the hydrostatic pressure has the minimal effect whereas the uniaxial pressure has the highest efficiency in tuning magnetization and magnetic anisotropy of the MOF. First-principles calculations reveal that the applied low pressures (less than 11 kbar) do not induce notable lattice distortion in the framework or the superexchange path. Instead, the modulation of hydrogen bonds is identified as a critical factor for pressure tuning of magnetization and anisotropy. These findings underscore the potential applications of directional pressure in precisely controlling the magnetic and electronic properties of MOFs.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry Probed by Chiral Excitonic Optical Response of Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically derive the sum rule for the negative first moment of the absorptive optical conductivity with excitonic effects and establish its connection to the quantum weight $K$ and Chern number $C$ of the ground state. Applying this framework, we investigate the excitonic optical response of the Chern insulator at hole filling factor $\nu=1$ in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$. A single chiral exciton state, which selectively absorbs circularly polarized light of a specific handedness, dominates the optical sum rule. The chiral exciton state comprises two types of interlayer electron-hole transitions, which cancel out the total out-of-plane dipole moment. The absorption spectrum shows nearly perfect magnetic circular dichroism, which can be attributed to the nearly saturated bound $K \ge |C|$ of the Chern insulator under study. Our work illustrates the potential of using excitonic optical responses to probe quantum geometry encoded by $K$ and $C$ of Chern insulators in moir\'e superlattices.</description>

      <title>Harris-Luck criterion in the plateau transition of the Integer Quantum Hall Effect</title>

Abstract: The Harris criterion imposes a constraint on the critical behavior of a system upon introduction of new disorder, based on its dimension $d$ and localization length exponent $\nu$. It states that the new disorder can be relevant only if $d \nu &lt; 2$. We analyze the applicability of the Harris criterion to the GKNS network disorder formulated in the paper [I. A. Gruzberg, A. Kl\"umper, W. Nuding, and A. Sedrakyan, Phys. Rev. B 95, 125414 (2017)] and show that the fluctuations of the geometry are relevant despite $d \nu&gt; 2$, implying that Harris criterion should be modified. We have observed that the fluctuations of the critical point in different quenched configurations of disordered network blocks is of order $L^0$, i.e.~it does not depend on block size $L$ in contrast to the expectation based on the Harris criterion that they should decrease as $L^{-d/2}$ according to the central limit theorem. Since $L^0 &gt; (x-x_c)$ is always satisfied near the critical point, the mentioned network disorder is relevant and the critical indices of the system can be changed. We have also shown that the GKNS disordered network is fundamentally different from Voronoi-Delaunay and dynamically triangulated random lattices: the probability of higher connectivity in the GKNS network decreases in a power law as opposed to an exponential, indicating that we are dealing with a ``scale free" network, such as the Internet, protein-protein interactions, etc.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the phonon theory of liquid heat capacity: low-frequency shear modes and intramolecular vibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling the heat capacity of liquids present fundamental difficulties due to the strong intermolecular particle interactions and large diffusive-like displacements. Based on the experimental evidence that the microscopic dynamics of liquids closely resemble those of solids, a phonon theory of liquid thermodynamics has been developed. Despite its success, the phonon theory of liquids relies on the questionable assumption that low-frequency shear excitations are propagating in nature and follow a Debye density of states. Furthermore, the same framework does not capture the contribution of intramolecular vibrations, which play a significant role in molecular liquids. In this work, we revisit the phonon theory of liquid heat capacity, introducing alternative approaches to model low-frequency shear modes. In particular, we consider the recently proposed idea of treating such modes as pure kinetic and we propose a novel approach based on identifying those low-frequency excitations as overdamped liquid-like modes with linear in frequency density of states. Moreover, we complete the theory by incorporating the effects of intramolecular vibrations. By comparing the theoretical predictions from these different approaches with the available data for the heat capacity of several liquids, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the original model and the newly proposed extensions. Despite all approaches perform well at low-temperatures, our results indicate that modeling low-frequency modes as overdamped liquid-like excitations yields the most accurate agreement with the data in the whole temperature range. Conversely, we demonstrate that treating these excitations as purely gas-like leads to significant inaccuracies, particularly at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Surface-dominant transport in Weyl semimetal NbAs nanowires for next-generation interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ongoing demands for smaller and more energy efficient electronic devices necessitate alternative interconnect materials with lower electrical resistivity at reduced dimensions. Despite the emergence of many promising candidates, synthesizing high quality nanostructures remains a major bottleneck in evaluating their performance. Here, we report the successful synthesis of Weyl semimetal NbAs nanowires via thermomechanical nanomolding, achieving single crystallinity and controlled diameters as small as 40 nm. Our NbAs nanowires exhibit a remarkably low room-temperature resistivity of 9.7 +/- 1.6 microOhm-cm, which is three to four times lower than their bulk counterpart. Theoretical calculations corroborate the experimental observations, attributing this exceptional resistivity reduction to surface dominant conduction with long carrier lifetime at finite temperatures. Further characterization of NbAs nanowires and bulk single crystals reveals high breakdown current density, robust stability, and superior thermal conductivity. Collectively, these properties highlight the strong potential of NbAs nanowires as next-generation interconnects, which can surpass the limitations of current copper-based interconnects. Technologically, our findings present a practical application of topological materials, while scientifically showcasing the fundamental properties uniquely accessible in nanoscale platforms.</description>
