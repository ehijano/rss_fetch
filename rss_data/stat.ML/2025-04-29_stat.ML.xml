      <title>Statistical Inference for Clustering-based Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) is a fundamental problem in machine learning and statistics. A popular approach to unsupervised AD is clustering-based detection. However, this method lacks the ability to guarantee the reliability of the detected anomalies. In this paper, we propose SI-CLAD (Statistical Inference for CLustering-based Anomaly Detection), a novel statistical framework for testing the clustering-based AD results. The key strength of SI-CLAD lies in its ability to rigorously control the probability of falsely identifying anomalies, maintaining it below a pre-specified significance level $\alpha$ (e.g., $\alpha = 0.05$). By analyzing the selection mechanism inherent in clustering-based AD and leveraging the Selective Inference (SI) framework, we prove that false detection control is attainable. Moreover, we introduce a strategy to boost the true detection rate, enhancing the overall performance of SI-CLAD. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets provide strong empirical support for our theoretical findings, showcasing the superior performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Safe Online Reinforcement Learning in the Linear Quadratic Regulator: $\sqrt{T}$-Regret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how to efficiently learn while adhering to safety constraints is essential for using online reinforcement learning in practical applications. However, proving rigorous regret bounds for safety-constrained reinforcement learning is difficult due to the complex interaction between safety, exploration, and exploitation. In this work, we seek to establish foundations for safety-constrained reinforcement learning by studying the canonical problem of controlling a one-dimensional linear dynamical system with unknown dynamics. We study the safety-constrained version of this problem, where the state must with high probability stay within a safe region, and we provide the first safe algorithm that achieves regret of $\tilde{O}_T(\sqrt{T})$. Furthermore, the regret is with respect to the baseline of truncated linear controllers, a natural baseline of non-linear controllers that are well-suited for safety-constrained linear systems. In addition to introducing this new baseline, we also prove several desirable continuity properties of the optimal controller in this baseline. In showing our main result, we prove that whenever the constraints impact the optimal controller, the non-linearity of our controller class leads to a faster rate of learning than in the unconstrained setting.</description>

      <title>Local Polynomial Lp-norm Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local least squares estimator for a regression curve cannot provide optimal results when non-Gaussian noise is present. Both theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that residuals often exhibit distributional properties different from those of a normal distribution, making it worthwhile to consider estimation based on other norms. It is suggested that $L_p$-norm estimators be used to minimize the residuals when these exhibit non-normal kurtosis. In this paper, we propose a local polynomial $L_p$-norm regression that replaces weighted least squares estimation with weighted $L_p$-norm estimation for fitting the polynomial locally. We also introduce a new method for estimating the parameter $p$ from the residuals, enhancing the adaptability of the approach. Through numerical and theoretical investigation, we demonstrate our method's superiority over local least squares in one-dimensional data and show promising outcomes for higher dimensions, specifically in 2D.</description>

      <title>A Dictionary of Closed-Form Kernel Mean Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kernel mean embeddings -- integrals of a kernel with respect to a probability distribution -- are essential in Bayesian quadrature, but also widely used in other computational tools for numerical integration or for statistical inference based on the maximum mean discrepancy. These methods often require, or are enhanced by, the availability of a closed-form expression for the kernel mean embedding. However, deriving such expressions can be challenging, limiting the applicability of kernel-based techniques when practitioners do not have access to a closed-form embedding. This paper addresses this limitation by providing a comprehensive dictionary of known kernel mean embeddings, along with practical tools for deriving new embeddings from known ones. We also provide a Python library that includes minimal implementations of the embeddings.</description>

      <title>ReLU integral probability metric and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a parametric integral probability metric (IPM) to measure the discrepancy between two probability measures. The proposed IPM leverages a specific parametric family of discriminators, such as single-node neural networks with ReLU activation, to effectively distinguish between distributions, making it applicable in high-dimensional settings. By optimizing over the parameters of the chosen discriminator class, the proposed IPM demonstrates that its estimators have good convergence rates and can serve as a surrogate for other IPMs that use smooth nonparametric discriminator classes. We present an efficient algorithm for practical computation, offering a simple implementation and requiring fewer hyperparameters. Furthermore, we explore its applications in various tasks, such as covariate balancing for causal inference and fair representation learning. Across such diverse applications, we demonstrate that the proposed IPM provides strong theoretical guarantees, and empirical experiments show that it achieves comparable or even superior performance to other methods.</description>

      <title>Geometry-aware Active Learning of Spatiotemporal Dynamic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid developments in advanced sensing and imaging have significantly enhanced information visibility, opening opportunities for predictive modeling of complex dynamic systems. However, sensing signals acquired from such complex systems are often distributed across 3D geometries and rapidly evolving over time, posing significant challenges in spatiotemporal predictive modeling. This paper proposes a geometry-aware active learning framework for modeling spatiotemporal dynamic systems. Specifically, we propose a geometry-aware spatiotemporal Gaussian Process (G-ST-GP) to effectively integrate the temporal correlations and geometric manifold features for reliable prediction of high-dimensional dynamic behaviors. In addition, we develop an adaptive active learning strategy to strategically identify informative spatial locations for data collection and further maximize the prediction accuracy. This strategy achieves the adaptive trade-off between the prediction uncertainty in the G-ST-GP model and the space-filling design guided by the geodesic distance across the 3D geometry. We implement the proposed framework to model the spatiotemporal electrodynamics in a 3D heart geometry. Numerical experiments show that our framework outperforms traditional methods lacking the mechanism of geometric information incorporation or effective data collection.</description>

      <title>Test Set Sizing for the Ridge Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the ideal train/test split for the ridge regression to high accuracy in the limit that the number of training rows m becomes large. The split must depend on the ridge tuning parameter, alpha, but we find that the dependence is weak and can asymptotically be ignored; all parameters vanish except for m and the number of features, n. This is the first time that such a split is calculated mathematically for a machine learning model in the large data limit. The goal of the calculations is to maximize "integrity," so that the measured error in the trained model is as close as possible to what it theoretically should be. This paper's result for the ridge regression split matches prior art for the plain vanilla linear regression split to the first two terms asymptotically, and it appears that practically there is no difference.</description>

      <title>Contextual Online Uncertainty-Aware Preference Learning for Human Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a pivotal paradigm in artificial intelligence to align large models with human preferences. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical framework to simultaneously conduct the online decision-making and statistical inference on the optimal model using human preference data based on dynamic contextual information. Our approach introduces an efficient decision strategy that achieves both the optimal regret bound and the asymptotic distribution of the estimators. A key challenge in RLHF is handling the dependent online human preference outcomes with dynamic contexts. To address this, in the methodological aspect, we propose a two-stage algorithm starting with $\epsilon$-greedy followed by exploitations; in the theoretical aspect, we tailor anti-concentration inequalities and matrix martingale concentration techniques to derive the uniform estimation rate and asymptotic normality of the estimators using dependent samples from both stages. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art strategies. We apply the proposed framework to analyze the human preference data for ranking large language models on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding dataset, yielding insightful results on the performance of different large language models for medical anatomy knowledge.</description>

      <title>The Double Descent Behavior in Two Layer Neural Network for Binary Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies observed a surprising concept on model test error called the double descent phenomenon, where the increasing model complexity decreases the test error first and then the error increases and decreases again. To observe this, we work on a two layer neural network model with a ReLU activation function designed for binary classification under supervised learning. Our aim is to observe and investigate the mathematical theory behind the double descent behavior of model test error for varying model sizes. We quantify the model size by the ratio of number of training samples to the dimension of the model. Due to the complexity of the empirical risk minimization procedure, we use the Convex Gaussian Min Max Theorem to find a suitable candidate for the global training loss.</description>

      <title>Model uncertainty quantification using feature confidence sets for outcome excursions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When implementing prediction models for high-stakes real-world applications such as medicine, finance, and autonomous systems, quantifying prediction uncertainty is critical for effective risk management. Traditional approaches to uncertainty quantification, such as confidence and prediction intervals, provide probability coverage guarantees for the expected outcomes $f(\boldsymbol{x})$ or the realized outcomes $f(\boldsymbol{x})+\epsilon$. Instead, this paper introduces a novel, model-agnostic framework for quantifying uncertainty in continuous and binary outcomes using confidence sets for outcome excursions, where the goal is to identify a subset of the feature space where the expected or realized outcome exceeds a specific value. The proposed method constructs data-dependent inner and outer confidence sets that aim to contain the true feature subset for which the expected or realized outcomes of these features exceed a specified threshold. We establish theoretical guarantees for the probability that these confidence sets contain the true feature subset, both asymptotically and for finite sample sizes. The framework is validated through simulations and applied to real-world datasets, demonstrating its utility in contexts such as housing price prediction and time to sepsis diagnosis in healthcare. This approach provides a unified method for uncertainty quantification that is broadly applicable across various continuous and binary prediction models.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sequential Recommendations: Exploiting User and Item Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an online model for recommendation systems, with each user being recommended an item at each time-step and providing 'like' or 'dislike' feedback. A latent variable model specifies the user preferences: both users and items are clustered into types. The model captures structure in both the item and user spaces, as used by item-item and user-user collaborative filtering algorithms. We study the situation in which the type preference matrix has i.i.d. entries. Our main contribution is an algorithm that simultaneously uses both item and user structures, proved to be near-optimal via corresponding information-theoretic lower bounds. In particular, our analysis highlights the sub-optimality of using only one of item or user structure (as is done in most collaborative filtering algorithms).</description>

      <title>Training Large Language Models to Reason via EM Policy Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, foundation models such as OpenAI's O1 and O3, along with DeepSeek's R1, have demonstrated strong reasoning capacities and problem-solving skills acquired through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), with wide applications in mathematics, coding, science, intelligent agents, and virtual assistants. In this work, we introduce an off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm, EM Policy Gradient, aimed at enhancing LLM reasoning by optimizing expected return over reasoning trajectories. We frame the reasoning task as an Expectation-Maximization (EM) optimization problem, alternating between sampling diverse rationale trajectories and performing reward-guided fine-tuning. Unlike PPO and GRPO, which rely on complex importance weights and heuristic clipping, our method provides a simpler, more principled off-policy policy gradient approach, eliminating these complexities while maintaining strong performance. We evaluate the effectiveness of EM Policy Gradient on the GSM8K and MATH (HARD) datasets, where it achieves performance comparable to or slightly surpassing the state-of-the-art GRPO, while offering additional advantages in scalability, simplicity, and reasoning conciseness. Moreover, models fine-tuned with our method exhibit cognitive behaviors, such as sub-problem decomposition, self-verification, and backtracking, highlighting its potential to enhance both the interpretability and robustness of LLM reasoning.</description>

      <title>A Unified MDL-based Binning and Tensor Factorization Framework for PDF Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable density estimation is fundamental for numerous applications in statistics and machine learning. In many practical scenarios, data are best modeled as mixtures of component densities that capture complex and multimodal patterns. However, conventional density estimators based on uniform histograms often fail to capture local variations, especially when the underlying distribution is highly nonuniform. Furthermore, the inherent discontinuity of histograms poses challenges for tasks requiring smooth derivatives, such as gradient-based optimization, clustering, and nonparametric discriminant analysis. In this work, we present a novel non-parametric approach for multivariate probability density function (PDF) estimation that utilizes minimum description length (MDL)-based binning with quantile cuts. Our approach builds upon tensor factorization techniques, leveraging the canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) of a joint probability tensor. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on synthetic data and a challenging real dry bean classification dataset.</description>

      <title>Non-Asymptotic Guarantees for Average-Reward Q-Learning with Adaptive Stepsizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents the first finite-time analysis for the last-iterate convergence of average-reward Q-learning with an asynchronous implementation. A key feature of the algorithm we study is the use of adaptive stepsizes, which serve as local clocks for each state-action pair. We show that the iterates generated by this Q-learning algorithm converge at a rate of $O(1/k)$ (in the mean-square sense) to the optimal relative Q-function in the span seminorm. Moreover, by adding a centering step to the algorithm, we further establish pointwise mean-square convergence to a centered optimal relative Q-function, also at a rate of $O(1/k)$. To prove these results, we show that adaptive stepsizes are necessary, as without them, the algorithm fails to converge to the correct target. In addition, adaptive stepsizes can be interpreted as a form of implicit importance sampling that counteracts the effects of asynchronous updates.
  Technically, the use of adaptive stepsizes makes each Q-learning update depend on the entire sample history, introducing strong correlations and making the algorithm a non-Markovian stochastic approximation (SA) scheme. Our approach to overcoming this challenge involves (1) a time-inhomogeneous Markovian reformulation of non-Markovian SA, and (2) a combination of almost-sure time-varying bounds, conditioning arguments, and Markov chain concentration inequalities to break the strong correlations between the adaptive stepsizes and the iterates. The tools developed in this work are likely to be broadly applicable to the analysis of general SA algorithms with adaptive stepsizes.</description>

      <title>Nonconvex Linear System Identification with Minimal State Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-order linear System IDentification (SysID) addresses the challenge of estimating the parameters of a linear dynamical system from finite samples of observations and control inputs with minimal state representation. Traditional approaches often utilize Hankel-rank minimization, which relies on convex relaxations that can require numerous, costly singular value decompositions (SVDs) to optimize. In this work, we propose two nonconvex reformulations to tackle low-order SysID (i) Burer-Monterio (BM) factorization of the Hankel matrix for efficient nuclear norm minimization, and (ii) optimizing directly over system parameters for real, diagonalizable systems with an atomic norm style decomposition. These reformulations circumvent the need for repeated heavy SVD computations, significantly improving computational efficiency. Moreover, we prove that optimizing directly over the system parameters yields lower statistical error rates, and lower sample complexities that do not scale linearly with trajectory length like in Hankel-nuclear norm minimization. Additionally, while our proposed formulations are nonconvex, we provide theoretical guarantees of achieving global optimality in polynomial time. Finally, we demonstrate algorithms that solve these nonconvex programs and validate our theoretical claims on synthetic data.</description>

      <title>A Langevin sampling algorithm inspired by the Adam optimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for adaptive-stepsize MCMC sampling based on time-rescaled Langevin dynamics, in which the stepsize variation is dynamically driven by an additional degree of freedom. Our approach augments the phase space by an additional variable which in turn defines a time reparameterization. The use of an auxiliary relaxation equation allows accumulation of a moving average of a local monitor function and provides for precise control of the timestep while circumventing the need to modify the drift term in the physical system. Our algorithm is straightforward to implement and can be readily combined with any off-the-peg fixed-stepsize Langevin integrator. As a particular example, we consider control of the stepsize by monitoring the norm of the log-posterior gradient, which takes inspiration from the Adam optimizer, the stepsize being automatically reduced in regions of steep change of the log posterior and increased on plateaus, improving numerical stability and convergence speed. As in Adam, the stepsize variation depends on the recent history of the gradient norm, which enhances stability and improves accuracy compared to more immediate control approaches. We demonstrate the potential benefit of this method--both in accuracy and in stability--in numerical experiments including Neal's funnel and a Bayesian neural network for classification of MNIST data.</description>

      <title>Factor Analysis with Correlated Topic Model for Multi-Modal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating various data modalities brings valuable insights into underlying phenomena. Multimodal factor analysis (FA) uncovers shared axes of variation underlying different simple data modalities, where each sample is represented by a vector of features. However, FA is not suited for structured data modalities, such as text or single cell sequencing data, where multiple data points are measured per each sample and exhibit a clustering structure. To overcome this challenge, we introduce FACTM, a novel, multi-view and multi-structure Bayesian model that combines FA with correlated topic modeling and is optimized using variational inference. Additionally, we introduce a method for rotating latent factors to enhance interpretability with respect to binary features. On text and video benchmarks as well as real-world music and COVID-19 datasets, we demonstrate that FACTM outperforms other methods in identifying clusters in structured data, and integrating them with simple modalities via the inference of shared, interpretable factors.</description>

      <title>Learning Stochastic Thermodynamics Directly from Correlation and Trajectory-Fluctuation Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markedly increased computational power and data acquisition have led to growing interest in data-driven inverse dynamics problems. These seek to answer a fundamental question: What can we learn from time series measurements of a complex dynamical system? For small systems interacting with external environments, the effective dynamics are inherently stochastic, making it crucial to properly manage noise in data. Here, we explore this for systems obeying Langevin dynamics and, using currents, we construct a learning framework for stochastic modeling. Currents have recently gained increased attention for their role in bounding entropy production (EP) from thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). We introduce a fundamental relationship between the cumulant currents there and standard machine-learning loss functions. Using this, we derive loss functions for several key thermodynamic functions directly from the system dynamics without the (common) intermediate step of deriving a TUR. These loss functions reproduce results derived both from TURs and other methods. More significantly, they open a path to discover new loss functions for previously inaccessible quantities. Notably, this includes access to per-trajectory entropy production, even if the observed system is driven far from its steady-state. We also consider higher order estimation. Our method is straightforward and unifies dynamic inference with recent approaches to entropy production estimation. Taken altogether, this reveals a deep connection between diffusion models in machine learning and entropy production estimation in stochastic thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Towards minimax optimal algorithms for Active Simple Hypothesis Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Active Simple Hypothesis Testing (ASHT) problem, a simpler variant of the Fixed Budget Best Arm Identification problem. In this work, we provide novel game theoretic formulation of the upper bounds of the ASHT problem. This formulation allows us to leverage tools of differential games and Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) to propose an approximately optimal algorithm that is computationally tractable compared to prior work. However, the optimal algorithm still suffers from a curse of dimensionality and instead we use a novel link to Blackwell Approachability to propose an algorithm that is far more efficient computationally. We show that this new algorithm, although not proven to be optimal, is always better than static algorithms in all instances of ASHT and is numerically observed to attain the optimal exponent in various instances.</description>

      <title>On learning functions over biological sequence space: relating Gaussian process priors, regularization, and gauge fixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mappings from biological sequences (DNA, RNA, protein) to quantitative measures of sequence functionality play an important role in contemporary biology. We are interested in the related tasks of (i) inferring predictive sequence-to-function maps and (ii) decomposing sequence-function maps to elucidate the contributions of individual subsequences. Because each sequence-function map can be written as a weighted sum over subsequences in multiple ways, meaningfully interpreting these weights requires "gauge-fixing," i.e., defining a unique representation for each map. Recent work has established that most existing gauge-fixed representations arise as the unique solutions to $L_2$-regularized regression in an overparameterized "weight space" where the choice of regularizer defines the gauge. Here, we establish the relationship between regularized regression in overparameterized weight space and Gaussian process approaches that operate in "function space," i.e. the space of all real-valued functions on a finite set of sequences. We disentangle how weight space regularizers both impose an implicit prior on the learned function and restrict the optimal weights to a particular gauge. We also show how to construct regularizers that correspond to arbitrary explicit Gaussian process priors combined with a wide variety of gauges. Next, we derive the distribution of gauge-fixed weights implied by the Gaussian process posterior and demonstrate that even for long sequences this distribution can be efficiently computed for product-kernel priors using a kernel trick. Finally, we characterize the implicit function space priors associated with the most common weight space regularizers. Overall, our framework unifies and extends our ability to infer and interpret sequence-function relationships.</description>

      <title>Score-Debiased Kernel Density Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for density estimation that leverages an estimated score function to debias kernel density estimation (SD-KDE). In our approach, each data point is adjusted by taking a single step along the score function with a specific choice of step size, followed by standard KDE with a modified bandwidth. The step size and modified bandwidth are chosen to remove the leading order bias in the KDE. Our experiments on synthetic tasks in 1D, 2D and on MNIST, demonstrate that our proposed SD-KDE method significantly reduces the mean integrated squared error compared to the standard Silverman KDE, even with noisy estimates in the score function. These results underscore the potential of integrating score-based corrections into nonparametric density estimation.</description>

      <title>Fast and Robust: Task Sampling with Posterior and Diversity Synergies for Adaptive Decision-Makers in Randomized Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Task robust adaptation is a long-standing pursuit in sequential decision-making. Some risk-averse strategies, e.g., the conditional value-at-risk principle, are incorporated in domain randomization or meta reinforcement learning to prioritize difficult tasks in optimization, which demand costly intensive evaluations. The efficiency issue prompts the development of robust active task sampling to train adaptive policies, where risk-predictive models are used to surrogate policy evaluation. This work characterizes the optimization pipeline of robust active task sampling as a Markov decision process, posits theoretical and practical insights, and constitutes robustness concepts in risk-averse scenarios. Importantly, we propose an easy-to-implement method, referred to as Posterior and Diversity Synergized Task Sampling (PDTS), to accommodate fast and robust sequential decision-making. Extensive experiments show that PDTS unlocks the potential of robust active task sampling, significantly improves the zero-shot and few-shot adaptation robustness in challenging tasks, and even accelerates the learning process under certain scenarios.

      <title>Newton-Puiseux Analysis for Interpretability and Calibration of Complex-Valued Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) excel where phase matters, yet their multi-sheeted decision surfaces defy standard explainability and calibration tools. We propose a \emph{Newton-Puiseux} framework that fits a local polynomial surrogate to a high-uncertainty input and analytically decomposes this surrogate into fractional-power series. The resulting Puiseux expansions, dominant Puiseux coefficients, and phase-aligned curvature descriptors deliver closed-form estimates of robustness and over-confidence that gradient - or perturbation-based methods (saliency, LIME, SHAP) cannot provide. On a controlled $\mathbb{C}^2$ helix the surrogate attains RMSE $&lt; 0.09$ while recovering the number of decision sheets; quartic coefficients predict adversarial flip radii within $10^{-3}$. On the real-world MIT-BIH arrhythmia corpus, Puiseux-guided, phase-aware temperature scaling lowers expected calibration error from 0.087 to 0.034, contributing to the advancement of CVNNs. Full code, pre-trained weights, and scripts are at https://github.com/piotrmgs/puiseux-cvnn.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Bias in Facial Recognition Systems: Centroid Fairness Loss Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The urging societal demand for fair AI systems has put pressure on the research community to develop predictive models that are not only globally accurate but also meet new fairness criteria, reflecting the lack of disparate mistreatment with respect to sensitive attributes ($\textit{e.g.}$ gender, ethnicity, age). In particular, the variability of the errors made by certain Facial Recognition (FR) systems across specific segments of the population compromises the deployment of the latter, and was judged unacceptable by regulatory authorities. Designing fair FR systems is a very challenging problem, mainly due to the complex and functional nature of the performance measure used in this domain ($\textit{i.e.}$ ROC curves) and because of the huge heterogeneity of the face image datasets usually available for training. In this paper, we propose a novel post-processing approach to improve the fairness of pre-trained FR models by optimizing a regression loss which acts on centroid-based scores. Beyond the computational advantages of the method, we present numerical experiments providing strong empirical evidence of the gain in fairness and of the ability to preserve global accuracy.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Label-specific Features for Label Distribution Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) is an emerging learning paradigm designed to capture the relative importance of labels for each instance. Label-specific features (LSFs), constructed by LIFT, have proven effective for learning tasks with label ambiguity by leveraging clustering-based prototypes for each label to re-characterize instances. However, directly introducing LIFT into LDL tasks can be suboptimal, as the prototypes it collects primarily reflect intra-cluster relationships while neglecting interactions among distinct clusters. Additionally, constructing LSFs using multi-perspective information, rather than relying solely on Euclidean distance, provides a more robust and comprehensive representation of instances, mitigating noise and bias that may arise from a single distance perspective. To address these limitations, we introduce Structural Anchor Points (SAPs) to capture inter-cluster interactions. This leads to a novel LSFs construction strategy, LIFT-SAP, which enhances LIFT by integrating both distance and direction information of each instance relative to SAPs. Furthermore, we propose a novel LDL algorithm, Label Distribution Learning via Label-specifIc FeaTure with SAPs (LDL-LIFT-SAP), which unifies multiple label description degrees predicted from different LSF spaces into a cohesive label distribution. Extensive experiments on 15 real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of LIFT-SAP over LIFT, as well as the superiority of LDL-LIFT-SAP compared to seven other well-established algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-time-scale stochastic approximation is an algorithm with coupled iterations which has found broad applications in reinforcement learning, optimization and game control. While several prior works have obtained a mean square error bound of $O(1/k)$ for linear two-time-scale iterations, the best known bound in the non-linear contractive setting has been $O(1/k^{2/3})$. In this work, we obtain an improved bound of $O(1/k)$ for non-linear two-time-scale stochastic approximation. Our result applies to algorithms such as gradient descent-ascent and two-time-scale Lagrangian optimization. The key step in our analysis involves rewriting the original iteration in terms of an averaged noise sequence which decays sufficiently fast. Additionally, we use an induction-based approach to show that the iterates are bounded in expectation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variable selection in ultrahigh-dimensional linear regression is
  challenging due to its high computational cost. Therefore, a
  screening step is usually conducted before variable selection to
  significantly reduce the dimension. Here we propose a novel and
  simple screening method based on ordering the absolute sample ridge
  partial correlations. The proposed method takes into account not
  only the ridge regularized estimates of the regression coefficients
  but also the ridge regularized partial variances of the predictor
  variables providing sure screening property without strong
  assumptions on the marginal correlations. Simulation study and a
  real data analysis show that the proposed method has a competitive
  performance compared with the existing screening procedures. A
  publicly available software implementing the proposed screening
  accompanies the article.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local clustering aims to identify specific substructures within a large graph without requiring full knowledge of the entire graph. These substructures are typically small compared to the overall graph, enabling the problem to be approached by finding a sparse solution to a linear system associated with the graph Laplacian. In this work, we first propose a method for identifying specific local clusters when very few labeled data is given, which we term semi-supervised local clustering. We then extend this approach to the unsupervised setting when no prior information on labels is available. The proposed methods involve randomly sampling the graph, applying diffusion through local cluster extraction, then examining the overlap among the results to find each cluster. We establish the co-membership conditions for any pair of nodes and rigorously prove the correctness of our methods. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve state-of-the-arts results in the low-label rates regime.</description>

Abstract: We provide efficient algorithms for the problem of distribution learning from high-dimensional Gaussian data where in each sample, some of the variable values are missing. We suppose that the variables are missing not at random (MNAR). The missingness model, denoted by $S(y)$, is the function that maps any point $y$ in $R^d$ to the subsets of its coordinates that are seen. In this work, we assume that it is known. We study the following two settings:
  (i) Self-censoring: An observation $x$ is generated by first sampling the true value $y$ from a $d$-dimensional Gaussian $N(\mu*, \Sigma*)$ with unknown $\mu*$ and $\Sigma*$. For each coordinate $i$, there exists a set $S_i$ subseteq $R^d$ such that $x_i = y_i$ if and only if $y_i$ in $S_i$. Otherwise, $x_i$ is missing and takes a generic value (e.g., "?"). We design an algorithm that learns $N(\mu*, \Sigma*)$ up to total variation (TV) distance epsilon, using $poly(d, 1/\epsilon)$ samples, assuming only that each pair of coordinates is observed with sufficiently high probability.
  (ii) Linear thresholding: An observation $x$ is generated by first sampling $y$ from a $d$-dimensional Gaussian $N(\mu*, \Sigma)$ with unknown $\mu*$ and known $\Sigma$, and then applying the missingness model $S$ where $S(y) = {i in [d] : v_i^T y &lt;= b_i}$ for some $v_1, ..., v_d$ in $R^d$ and $b_1, ..., b_d$ in $R$. We design an efficient mean estimation algorithm, assuming that none of the possible missingness patterns is very rare conditioned on the values of the observed coordinates and that any small subset of coordinates is observed with sufficiently high probability.</description>

      <title>DISCO: learning to DISCover an evolution Operator for multi-physics-agnostic prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of predicting the next state of a dynamical system governed by unknown temporal partial differential equations (PDEs) using only a short trajectory. While standard transformers provide a natural black-box solution to this task, the presence of a well-structured evolution operator in the data suggests a more tailored and efficient approach. Specifically, when the PDE is fully known, classical numerical solvers can evolve the state accurately with only a few parameters. Building on this observation, we introduce DISCO, a model that uses a large hypernetwork to process a short trajectory and generate the parameters of a much smaller operator network, which then predicts the next state through time integration. Our framework decouples dynamics estimation (i.e., DISCovering an evolution operator from a short trajectory) from state prediction (i.e., evolving this operator). Experiments show that pretraining our model on diverse physics datasets achieves state-of-the-art performance while requiring significantly fewer epochs. Moreover, it generalizes well and remains competitive when fine-tuned on downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Identification and Estimation of Long-Term Treatment Effects with Monotone Missing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating long-term treatment effects has a wide range of applications in various domains. A key feature in this context is that collecting long-term outcomes typically involves a multi-stage process and is subject to monotone missing, where individuals missing at an earlier stage remain missing at subsequent stages. Despite its prevalence, monotone missing has been rarely explored in previous studies on estimating long-term treatment effects. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing the sequential missingness assumption for identification. We propose three novel estimation methods, including inverse probability weighting, sequential regression imputation, and sequential marginal structural model (SeqMSM). Considering that the SeqMSM method may suffer from high variance due to severe data sparsity caused by monotone missing, we further propose a novel balancing-enhanced approach, BalanceNet, to improve the stability and accuracy of the estimation methods. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Euclidean Distance Matrix Completion via Asymmetric Projected Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes and analyzes a gradient-type algorithm based on Burer-Monteiro factorization, called the Asymmetric Projected Gradient Descent (APGD), for reconstructing the point set configuration from partial Euclidean distance measurements, known as the Euclidean Distance Matrix Completion (EDMC) problem. By paralleling the incoherence matrix completion framework, we show for the first time that global convergence guarantee with exact recovery of this routine can be established given $\mathcal{O}(\mu^2 r^3 \kappa^2 n \log n)$ Bernoulli random observations without any sample splitting. Unlike leveraging the tangent space Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) and local curvature of the low-rank embedding manifold in some very recent works, our proof provides new upper bounds to replace the random graph lemma under EDMC setting. The APGD works surprisingly well and numerical experiments demonstrate exact linear convergence behavior in rich-sample regions yet deteriorates fast when compared with the performance obtained by optimizing the s-stress function, i.e., the standard but unexplained non-convex approach for EDMC, if the sample size is limited. While virtually matching our theoretical prediction, this unusual phenomenon might indicate that: (i) the power of implicit regularization is weakened when specified in the APGD case; (ii) the stabilization of such new gradient direction requires substantially more samples than the information-theoretic limit would suggest.</description>

      <title>AI Alignment in Medical Imaging: Unveiling Hidden Biases Through Counterfactual Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) systems for medical imaging have demonstrated remarkable diagnostic capabilities, but their susceptibility to biases poses significant risks, since biases may negatively impact generalization performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel statistical framework to evaluate the dependency of medical imaging ML models on sensitive attributes, such as demographics. Our method leverages the concept of counterfactual invariance, measuring the extent to which a model's predictions remain unchanged under hypothetical changes to sensitive attributes. We present a practical algorithm that combines conditional latent diffusion models with statistical hypothesis testing to identify and quantify such biases without requiring direct access to counterfactual data. Through experiments on synthetic datasets and large-scale real-world medical imaging datasets, including \textsc{cheXpert} and MIMIC-CXR, we demonstrate that our approach aligns closely with counterfactual fairness principles and outperforms standard baselines. This work provides a robust tool to ensure that ML diagnostic systems generalize well, e.g., across demographic groups, offering a critical step towards AI safety in healthcare.

      <title>Diffusion Stochastic Learning Over Adaptive Competing Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a stochastic dynamic game between two competing teams, each consisting of a network of collaborating agents. Unlike fully cooperative settings, where all agents share a common objective, each team in this game aims to minimize its own distinct objective. In the adversarial setting, their objectives could be conflicting as in zero-sum games. Throughout the competition, agents share strategic information within their own team while simultaneously inferring and adapting to the strategies of the opposing team. We propose diffusion learning algorithms to address two important classes of this network game: i) a zero-sum game characterized by weak cross-team subgraph interactions, and ii) a general non-zero-sum game exhibiting strong cross-team subgraph interactions. We analyze the stability performance of the proposed algorithms under reasonable assumptions and illustrate the theoretical results through experiments on Cournot team competition and decentralized GAN training.</description>

      <title>Contextures: The Mechanism of Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This dissertation establishes the contexture theory to mathematically characterize the mechanism of representation learning, or pretraining. Despite the remarkable empirical success of foundation models, it is not very clear what representations they learn, and why these representations are useful for various downstream tasks. A scientific understanding of representation learning is critical, especially at this point when scaling up the model size is producing diminishing returns, and designing new pretraining methods is imperative for further progress.
  Prior work treated different representation learning methods quite differently, whereas the contexture theory provides a unified framework for analyzing these methods. The central argument is that a representation is learned from the association between the input X and a context variable A. We prove that if an encoder captures the maximum information of this association, in which case we say that the encoder learns the contexture, then it will be optimal on the class of tasks that are compatible with the context. We also show that a context is the most useful when the association between X and A is neither too strong nor too weak. The important implication of the contexture theory is that increasing the model size alone will achieve diminishing returns, and further advancements require better contexts.
  We demonstrate that many pretraining objectives can learn the contexture, including supervised learning, self-supervised learning, generative models, etc. Then, we introduce two general objectives -- SVME and KISE, for learning the contexture. We also show how to mix multiple contexts together, an effortless way to create better contexts from existing ones. Then, we prove statistical learning bounds for representation learning. Finally, we discuss the effect of the data distribution shift from pretraining to the downstream task.</description>

      <title>Attention Mechanism, Max-Affine Partition, and Universal Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the universal approximation capability of single-layer, single-head self- and cross-attention mechanisms with minimal attached structures. Our key insight is to interpret single-head attention as an input domain-partition mechanism that assigns distinct values to subregions. This allows us to engineer the attention weights such that this assignment imitates the target function. Building on this, we prove that a single self-attention layer, preceded by sum-of-linear transformations, is capable of approximating any continuous function on a compact domain under the $L_\infty$-norm. Furthermore, we extend this construction to approximate any Lebesgue integrable function under $L_p$-norm for $1\leq p &lt;\infty$. Lastly, we also extend our techniques and show that, for the first time, single-head cross-attention achieves the same universal approximation guarantees.</description>

      <title>On Stopping Times of Power-one Sequential Tests: Tight Lower and Upper Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove two lower bounds for stopping times of sequential tests between general composite nulls and alternatives. The first lower bound is for the setting where the type-1 error level $\alpha$ approaches zero, and equals $\log(1/\alpha)$ divided by a certain infimum KL divergence, termed $\operatorname{KL_{inf}}$. The second lower bound applies to the setting where $\alpha$ is fixed and $\operatorname{KL_{inf}}$ approaches 0 (meaning that the null and alternative sets are not separated) and equals $c \operatorname{KL_{inf}}^{-1} \log \log \operatorname{KL_{inf}}^{-1}$ for a universal constant $c &gt; 0$. We also provide a sufficient condition for matching the upper bounds and show that this condition is met in several special cases. Given past work, these upper and lower bounds are unsurprising in their form; our main contribution is the generality in which they hold, for example, not requiring reference measures or compactness of the classes.</description>

      <title>Emergence and scaling laws in SGD learning of shallow neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of online stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for learning a two-layer neural network with $P$ neurons on isotropic Gaussian data: $f_*(\boldsymbol{x}) = \sum_{p=1}^P a_p\cdot \sigma(\langle\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{v}_p^*\rangle)$, $\boldsymbol{x} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\boldsymbol{I}_d)$, where the activation $\sigma:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is an even function with information exponent $k_*&gt;2$ (defined as the lowest degree in the Hermite expansion), $\{\boldsymbol{v}^*_p\}_{p\in[P]}\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ are orthonormal signal directions, and the non-negative second-layer coefficients satisfy $\sum_{p} a_p^2=1$. We focus on the challenging ``extensive-width'' regime $P\gg 1$ and permit diverging condition number in the second-layer, covering as a special case the power-law scaling $a_p\asymp p^{-\beta}$ where $\beta\in\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$. We provide a precise analysis of SGD dynamics for the training of a student two-layer network to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) objective, and explicitly identify sharp transition times to recover each signal direction. In the power-law setting, we characterize scaling law exponents for the MSE loss with respect to the number of training samples and SGD steps, as well as the number of parameters in the student neural network. Our analysis entails that while the learning of individual teacher neurons exhibits abrupt transitions, the juxtaposition of $P\gg 1$ emergent learning curves at different timescales leads to a smooth scaling law in the cumulative objective.</description>

      <title>Precise High-Dimensional Asymptotics for Quantifying Heterogeneous Transfers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.11750v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of learning one task with samples from another task is central to transfer learning (TL). In this paper, we examine a fundamental question: When does combining the data samples from a source task and a target task perform better than single-task learning with the target task alone? This question is motivated by an intriguing phenomenon known as negative transfer often observed in the TL literature. Precise quantification of TL effects -- even within simple statistical models -- has remained elusive in the statistical learning literature. A critical challenge is that to compare TL to single-task learning, we would need to compare the risks between two different estimators in a very precise way. In particular, the comparative advantage of one estimator over another would depend on the specific distribution shifts between the two tasks. This paper applies recent developments in the random matrix theory literature to tackle this challenge in a high-dimensional linear regression setting with two tasks. We provide precise high-dimensional asymptotics for the bias and variance of hard parameter sharing (HPS) estimators in the proportional limit, when the sample sizes of both tasks increase proportionally with dimension at fixed ratios. The precise asymptotics are expressed as a function of the sample sizes of both tasks, the covariate shift between their feature population covariate matrices, and the model shift. We provide illustrative examples of our results in a random-effects model to determine positive and negative transfers. For example, we can identify a phase transition in the high-dimensional linear regression setting from positive transfer to negative transfer under a model shift between the source and target tasks. The finding regarding phase transition can be extended to a multiple-task learning setting where the feature covariates are shared across all tasks.</description>

      <title>Causal Q-Aggregation for CATE Model Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16945v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of conditional average treatment effects (CATE) is at the core of personalized decision making. While there is a plethora of models for CATE estimation, model selection is a nontrivial task, due to the fundamental problem of causal inference. Recent empirical work provides evidence in favor of proxy loss metrics with double robust properties and in favor of model ensembling. However, theoretical understanding is lacking. Direct application of prior theoretical work leads to suboptimal oracle model selection rates due to the non-convexity of the model selection problem. We provide regret rates for the major existing CATE ensembling approaches and propose a new CATE model ensembling approach based on Q-aggregation using the doubly robust loss. Our main result shows that causal Q-aggregation achieves statistically optimal oracle model selection regret rates of $\frac{\log(M)}{n}$ (with $M$ models and $n$ samples), with the addition of higher-order estimation error terms related to products of errors in the nuisance functions. Crucially, our regret rate does not require that any of the candidate CATE models be close to the truth. We validate our new method on many semi-synthetic datasets and also provide extensions of our work to CATE model selection with instrumental variables and unobserved confounding.</description>

      <title>Building a stable classifier with the inflated argmax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new framework for algorithmic stability in the context of multiclass classification. In practice, classification algorithms often operate by first assigning a continuous score (for instance, an estimated probability) to each possible label, then taking the maximizer -- i.e., selecting the class that has the highest score. A drawback of this type of approach is that it is inherently unstable, meaning that it is very sensitive to slight perturbations of the training data, since taking the maximizer is discontinuous. Motivated by this challenge, we propose a pipeline for constructing stable classifiers from data, using bagging (i.e., resampling and averaging) to produce stable continuous scores, and then using a stable relaxation of argmax, which we call the "inflated argmax," to convert these scores to a set of candidate labels. The resulting stability guarantee places no distributional assumptions on the data, does not depend on the number of classes or dimensionality of the covariates, and holds for any base classifier. Using a common benchmark data set, we demonstrate that the inflated argmax provides necessary protection against unstable classifiers, without loss of accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18176v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces the Supervised Expectation-Maximization Framework (SEMF), a versatile and model-agnostic approach for generating prediction intervals with any ML model. SEMF extends the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, traditionally used in unsupervised learning, to a supervised context, leveraging latent variable modeling for uncertainty estimation. Through extensive empirical evaluation of diverse simulated distributions and 11 real-world tabular datasets, SEMF consistently produces narrower prediction intervals while maintaining the desired coverage probability, outperforming traditional quantile regression methods. Furthermore, without using the quantile (pinball) loss, SEMF allows point predictors, including gradient-boosted trees and neural networks, to be calibrated with conformal quantile regression. The results indicate that SEMF enhances uncertainty quantification under diverse data distributions and is particularly effective for models that otherwise struggle with inherent uncertainty representation.</description>

Abstract: Transfer Learning aims to optimally aggregate samples from a target distribution, with related samples from a so-called source distribution to improve target risk. Multiple procedures have been proposed over the last two decades to address this problem, each driven by one of a multitude of possible divergence measures between source and target distributions. A first question asked in this work is whether there exist unified algorithmic approaches that automatically adapt to many of these divergence measures simultaneously.
  We show that this is indeed the case for a large family of divergences proposed across classification and regression tasks, as they all happen to upper-bound the same measure of continuity between source and target risks, which we refer to as a weak modulus of transfer. This more unified view allows us, first, to identify algorithmic approaches that are simultaneously adaptive to these various divergence measures via a reduction to particular confidence sets. Second, it allows for a more refined understanding of the statistical limits of transfer under such divergences, and in particular, reveals regimes with faster rates than might be expected under coarser lenses.
  We then turn to situations that are not well captured by the weak modulus and corresponding divergences: these are situations where the aggregate of source and target data can improve target performance significantly beyond what's possible with either source or target data alone. We show that common such situations -- as may arise, e.g., under certain causal models with spurious correlations -- are well described by a so-called strong modulus of transfer which supersedes the weak modulus. We finally show that the strong modulus also admits adaptive procedures, which achieve near optimal rates in terms of the unknown strong modulus, and therefore apply in more general settings.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical mixtures of Unigram models for short text clustering: The role of Beta-Liouville priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21862v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a variant of the Multinomial mixture model tailored to the unsupervised classification of short text data. While the Multinomial probability vector is traditionally assigned a Dirichlet prior distribution, this work explores an alternative formulation based on the Beta-Liouville distribution, which offers a more flexible correlation structure than the Dirichlet. We examine the theoretical properties of the Beta-Liouville distribution, with particular focus on its conjugacy with the Multinomial likelihood. This property enables the derivation of update equations for a CAVI (Coordinate Ascent Variational Inference) algorithm, facilitating approximate posterior inference of the model parameters. In addition, we introduce a stochastic variant of the CAVI algorithm to enhance scalability. The paper concludes with empirical examples demonstrating effective strategies for selecting the Beta-Liouville hyperparameters.</description>

      <title>Causal-discovery-based root-cause analysis and its application in time-series prediction error diagnosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent rapid advancements of machine learning have greatly enhanced the accuracy of prediction models, but most models remain "black boxes", making prediction error diagnosis challenging, especially with outliers. This lack of transparency hinders trust and reliability in industrial applications. Heuristic attribution methods, while helpful, often fail to capture true causal relationships, leading to inaccurate error attributions. Various root-cause analysis methods have been developed using Shapley values, yet they typically require predefined causal graphs, limiting their applicability for prediction errors in machine learning models. To address these limitations, we introduce the Causal-Discovery-based Root-Cause Analysis (CD-RCA) method that estimates causal relationships between the prediction error and the explanatory variables, without needing a pre-defined causal graph. By simulating synthetic error data, CD-RCA can identify variable contributions to outliers in prediction errors by Shapley values. Extensive experiments show CD-RCA outperforms current heuristic attribution methods.</description>

      <title>GeoConformal prediction: a model-agnostic framework of measuring the uncertainty of spatial prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08661v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial prediction is a fundamental task in geography. In recent years, with advances in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI), numerous models have been developed to improve the accuracy of geographic variable predictions. Beyond achieving higher accuracy, it is equally important to obtain predictions with uncertainty measures to enhance model credibility and support responsible spatial prediction. Although geostatistic methods like Kriging offer some level of uncertainty assessment, such as Kriging variance, these measurements are not always accurate and lack general applicability to other spatial models. To address this issue, we propose a model-agnostic uncertainty assessment method called GeoConformal Prediction, which incorporates geographical weighting into conformal prediction. We applied it to two classic spatial prediction cases, spatial regression and spatial interpolation, to evaluate its reliability. First, in the spatial regression case, we used XGBoost to predict housing prices, followed by GeoConformal to calculate uncertainty. Our results show that GeoConformal achieved a coverage rate of 93.67%, while Bootstrap methods only reached a maximum coverage of 81.00% after 2000 runs. Next, we applied GeoConformal to spatial interpolation models. We found that the uncertainty obtained from GeoConformal aligned closely with the variance in Kriging. Finally, using GeoConformal, we analyzed the sources of uncertainty in spatial prediction. We found that explicitly including local features in AI models can significantly reduce prediction uncertainty, especially in areas with strong local dependence. Our findings suggest that GeoConformal holds potential not only for geographic knowledge discovery but also for guiding the design of future GeoAI models, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable spatial prediction frameworks.</description>

      <title>From Point to probabilistic gradient boosting for claim frequency and severity prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gradient boosting for decision tree algorithms are increasingly used in actuarial applications as they show superior predictive performance over traditional generalised linear models. Many enhancements to the first gradient boosting machine algorithm exist. We present in a unified notation, and contrast, all the existing point and probabilistic gradient boosting for decision tree algorithms: GBM, XGBoost, DART, LightGBM, CatBoost, EGBM, PGBM, XGBoostLSS, cyclic GBM, and NGBoost. In this comprehensive numerical study, we compare their performance on five publicly available datasets for claim frequency and severity, of various sizes and comprising different numbers of (high cardinality) categorical variables. We explain how varying exposure-to-risk can be handled with boosting in frequency models. We compare the algorithms on the basis of computational efficiency, predictive performance, and model adequacy. LightGBM and XGBoostLSS win in terms of computational efficiency. CatBoost sometimes improves predictive performance, especially in the presence of high cardinality categorical variables, common in actuarial science. The fully interpretable EGBM achieves competitive predictive performance compared to the black box algorithms considered. We find that there is no trade-off between model adequacy and predictive accuracy: both are achievable simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Automatic Double Reinforcement Learning in Semiparametric Markov Decision Processes with Applications to Long-Term Causal Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating long-term causal effects from short-term data is essential for decision-making in healthcare, economics, and industry, where long-term follow-up is often infeasible. Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) offer a principled framework for modeling outcomes as sequences of states, actions, and rewards over time. We introduce a semiparametric extension of Double Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for statistically efficient, model-robust inference on linear functionals of the Q-function, such as policy values, in infinite-horizon, time-homogeneous MDPs. By imposing semiparametric structure on the Q-function, our method relaxes the strong state overlap assumptions required by fully nonparametric approaches, improving efficiency and stability. To address computational and robustness challenges of minimax nuisance estimation, we develop a novel debiased plug-in estimator based on isotonic Bellman calibration, which integrates fitted Q-iteration with an isotonic regression step. This procedure leverages the Q-function as a data-driven dimension reduction, debiases all linear functionals of interest simultaneously, and enables nonparametric inference without explicit nuisance function estimation. Bellman calibration generalizes isotonic calibration to MDPs and may be of independent interest for prediction in reinforcement learning. Finally, we show that model selection for the Q-function incurs only second-order bias and extend the adaptive debiased machine learning (ADML) framework to MDPs for data-driven learning of semiparametric structure.</description>

      <title>A Meta-learner for Heterogeneous Effects in Difference-in-Differences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in panel data, adopting the popular Difference-in-Differences (DiD) framework under the conditional parallel trends assumption. We propose a novel doubly robust meta-learner for the Conditional Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (CATT), reducing the estimation to a convex risk minimization problem involving a set of auxiliary models. Our framework allows for the flexible estimation of the CATT, when conditioning on any subset of variables of interest using generic machine learning. Leveraging Neyman orthogonality, our proposed approach is robust to estimation errors in the auxiliary models. As a generalization to our main result, we develop a meta-learning approach for the estimation of general conditional functionals under covariate shift. We also provide an extension to the instrumented DiD setting with non-compliance. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Thinning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12063v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal in thinning is to summarize a dataset using a small set of representative points. Remarkably, sub-Gaussian thinning algorithms like Kernel Halving and Compress can match the quality of uniform subsampling while substantially reducing the number of summary points. However, existing guarantees cover only a restricted range of distributions and kernel-based quality measures and suffer from pessimistic dimension dependence. To address these deficiencies, we introduce a new low-rank analysis of sub-Gaussian thinning that applies to any distribution and any kernel, guaranteeing high-quality compression whenever the kernel or data matrix is approximately low-rank. To demonstrate the broad applicability of the techniques, we design practical sub-Gaussian thinning approaches that improve upon the best known guarantees for approximating attention in transformers, accelerating stochastic gradient training through reordering, and distinguishing distributions in near-linear time.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-Free Variational Autoencoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) typically rely on a probabilistic decoder with a predefined likelihood, most commonly an isotropic Gaussian, to model the data conditional on latent variables. While convenient for optimization, this choice often leads to likelihood misspecification, resulting in blurry reconstructions and poor data fidelity, especially for high-dimensional data such as images. In this work, we propose EnVAE, a novel likelihood-free generative framework that has a deterministic decoder and employs the energy score--a proper scoring rule--to build the reconstruction loss. This enables likelihood-free inference without requiring explicit parametric density functions. To address the computational inefficiency of the energy score, we introduce a fast variant, FEnVAE, based on the local smoothness of the decoder and the sharpness of the posterior distribution of latent variables. This yields an efficient single-sample training objective that integrates seamlessly into existing VAE pipelines with minimal overhead. Empirical results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that EnVAE achieves superior reconstruction and generation quality compared to likelihood-based baselines. Our framework offers a general, scalable, and statistically principled alternative for flexible and nonparametric distribution learning in generative modeling.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian approach to modeling topic-metadata relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.02496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The objective of advanced topic modeling is not only to explore latent topical structures, but also to estimate relationships between the discovered topics and theoretically relevant metadata. Methods used to estimate such relationships must take into account that the topical structure is not directly observed, but instead being estimated itself in an unsupervised fashion, usually by common topic models. A frequently used procedure to achieve this is the method of composition, a Monte Carlo sampling technique performing multiple repeated linear regressions of sampled topic proportions on metadata covariates. In this paper, we propose two modifications of this approach: First, we substantially refine the existing implementation of the method of composition from the R package stm by replacing linear regression with the more appropriate Beta regression. Second, we provide a fundamental enhancement of the entire estimation framework by substituting the current blending of frequentist and Bayesian methods with a fully Bayesian approach. This allows for a more appropriate quantification of uncertainty. We illustrate our improved methodology by investigating relationships between Twitter posts by German parliamentarians and different metadata covariates related to their electoral districts, using the Structural Topic Model to estimate topic proportions.</description>

Abstract: Extracting low-dimensional summary statistics from large datasets is essential for efficient (likelihood-free) inference. We characterize different classes of summaries and demonstrate their importance for correctly analysing dimensionality reduction algorithms. We demonstrate that minimizing the expected posterior entropy (EPE) under the prior predictive distribution of the model subsumes many existing methods. They are equivalent to or are special or limiting cases of minimizing the EPE. We offer a unifying framework for obtaining informative summaries, provide concrete recommendations for practitioners, and propose a practical method to obtain high-fidelity summaries whose utility we demonstrate for both benchmark and practical examples.</description>

      <title>Sampling and estimation on manifolds using the Langevin diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14882v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Error bounds are derived for sampling and estimation using a discretization of an intrinsically defined Langevin diffusion with invariant measure $\text{d}\mu_\phi \propto e^{-\phi} \mathrm{dvol}_g $ on a compact Riemannian manifold. Two estimators of linear functionals of $\mu_\phi $ based on the discretized Markov process are considered: a time-averaging estimator based on a single trajectory and an ensemble-averaging estimator based on multiple independent trajectories. Imposing no restrictions beyond a nominal level of smoothness on $\phi$, first-order error bounds, in discretization step size, on the bias and variance/mean-square error of both estimators are derived. The order of error matches the optimal rate in Euclidean and flat spaces, and leads to a first-order bound on distance between the invariant measure $\mu_\phi$ and a stationary measure of the discretized Markov process. This order is preserved even upon using retractions when exponential maps are unavailable in closed form, thus enhancing practicality of the proposed algorithms. Generality of the proof techniques, which exploit links between two partial differential equations and the semigroup of operators corresponding to the Langevin diffusion, renders them amenable for the study of a more general class of sampling algorithms related to the Langevin diffusion. Conditions for extending analysis to the case of non-compact manifolds are discussed. Numerical illustrations with distributions, log-concave and otherwise, on the manifolds of positive and negative curvature elucidate on the derived bounds and demonstrate practical utility of the sampling algorithm.</description>

      <title>Variational Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design with Normalizing Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimal experimental design (OED) seeks experiments that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) in model parameters. Directly estimating the EIG using nested Monte Carlo is computationally expensive and requires an explicit likelihood. Variational OED (vOED), in contrast, estimates a lower bound of the EIG without likelihood evaluations by approximating the posterior distributions with variational forms, and then tightens the bound by optimizing its variational parameters. We introduce the use of normalizing flows (NFs) for representing variational distributions in vOED; we call this approach vOED-NFs. Specifically, we adopt NFs with a conditional invertible neural network architecture built from compositions of coupling layers, and enhanced with a summary network for data dimension reduction. We present Monte Carlo estimators to the lower bound along with gradient expressions to enable a gradient-based simultaneous optimization of the variational parameters and the design variables. The vOED-NFs algorithm is then validated in two benchmark problems, and demonstrated on a partial differential equation-governed application of cathodic electrophoretic deposition and an implicit likelihood case with stochastic modeling of aphid population. The findings suggest that a composition of 4--5 coupling layers is able to achieve lower EIG estimation bias, under a fixed budget of forward model runs, compared to previous approaches. The resulting NFs produce approximate posteriors that agree well with the true posteriors, able to capture non-Gaussian and multi-modal features effectively.</description>

      <title>Adaptive RKHS Fourier Features for Compositional Gaussian Process Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs) leverage a compositional structure to model non-stationary processes. DGPs typically rely on local inducing point approximations across intermediate GP layers. Recent advances in DGP inference have shown that incorporating global Fourier features from the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) can enhance the DGPs' capability to capture complex non-stationary patterns. This paper extends the use of these features to compositional GPs involving linear transformations. In particular, we introduce Ordinary Differential Equation(ODE)--based RKHS Fourier features that allow for adaptive amplitude and phase modulation through convolution operations. This convolutional formulation relates our work to recently proposed deep latent force models, a multi-layer structure designed for modelling nonlinear dynamical systems. By embedding these adjustable RKHS Fourier features within a doubly stochastic variational inference framework, our model exhibits improved predictive performance across various regression tasks.</description>

Abstract: We propose a combination of machine learning and flux limiting for property-preserving subgrid scale modeling in the context of flux-limited finite volume methods for the one-dimensional shallow-water equations. The numerical fluxes of a conservative target scheme are fitted to the coarse-mesh averages of a monotone fine-grid discretization using a neural network to parametrize the subgrid scale components. To ensure positivity preservation and the validity of local maximum principles, we use a flux limiter that constrains the intermediate states of an equivalent fluctuation form to stay in a convex admissible set. The results of our numerical studies confirm that the proposed combination of machine learning with monolithic convex limiting produces meaningful closures even in scenarios for which the network was not trained.</description>

      <title>On the choice of the non-trainable internal weights in random feature maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computationally cheap machine learning architecture of random feature maps can be viewed as a single-layer feedforward network in which the weights of the hidden layer are random but fixed and only the outer weights are learned via linear regression. The internal weights are typically chosen from a prescribed distribution. The choice of the internal weights significantly impacts the accuracy of random feature maps. We address here the task of how to best select the internal weights. In particular, we consider the forecasting problem whereby random feature maps are used to learn a one-step propagator map for a dynamical system. We provide a computationally cheap hit-and-run algorithm to select good internal weights which lead to good forecasting skill. We show that the number of good features is the main factor controlling the forecasting skill of random feature maps and acts as an effective feature dimension. Lastly, we compare random feature maps with single-layer feedforward neural networks in which the internal weights are now learned using gradient descent. We find that random feature maps have superior forecasting capabilities whilst having several orders of magnitude lower computational cost.</description>

      <title>Unintentional Unalignment: Likelihood Displacement in Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08847v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants are increasingly used for aligning language models with human preferences. Although these methods are designed to teach a model to generate preferred responses more frequently relative to dispreferred responses, prior work has observed that the likelihood of preferred responses often decreases during training. The current work sheds light on the causes and implications of this counter-intuitive phenomenon, which we term likelihood displacement. We demonstrate that likelihood displacement can be catastrophic, shifting probability mass from preferred responses to responses with an opposite meaning. As a simple example, training a model to prefer $\texttt{No}$ over $\texttt{Never}$ can sharply increase the probability of $\texttt{Yes}$. Moreover, when aligning the model to refuse unsafe prompts, we show that such displacement can unintentionally lead to unalignment, by shifting probability mass from preferred refusal responses to harmful responses (e.g., reducing the refusal rate of Llama-3-8B-Instruct from 74.4% to 33.4%). We theoretically characterize that likelihood displacement is driven by preferences that induce similar embeddings, as measured by a centered hidden embedding similarity (CHES) score. Empirically, the CHES score enables identifying which training samples contribute most to likelihood displacement in a given dataset. Filtering out these samples effectively mitigated unintentional unalignment in our experiments. More broadly, our results highlight the importance of curating data with sufficiently distinct preferences, for which we believe the CHES score may prove valuable.</description>

      <title>Measurability in the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning states that a hypothesis space is PAC learnable if and only if its VC dimension is finite. For the agnostic model of PAC learning, the literature so far presents proofs of this theorem that often tacitly impose several measurability assumptions on the involved sets and functions. We scrutinize these proofs from a measure-theoretic perspective in order to explicitly extract the assumptions needed for a rigorous argument. This leads to a sound statement as well as a detailed and self-contained proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning in the agnostic setting, showcasing the minimal measurability requirements needed. As the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning underpins a wide range of further theoretical developments, our results are of foundational importance: A careful analysis of measurability aspects is essential, especially when the theorem is used in settings where measure-theoretic subtleties play a role. We particularly discuss applications in Model Theory, considering NIP and o-minimal structures. Our main theorem presents sufficient conditions for the PAC learnability of hypothesis spaces defined over o-minimal expansions of the reals. This class of hypothesis spaces covers all artificial neural networks for binary classification that use commonly employed activation functions like ReLU and the sigmoid function.</description>

      <title>Achieving Group Fairness through Independence in Predictive Process Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04914v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predictive process monitoring focuses on forecasting future states of ongoing process executions, such as predicting the outcome of a particular case. In recent years, the application of machine learning models in this domain has garnered significant scientific attention. When using historical execution data, which may contain biases or exhibit unfair behavior, these biases may be encoded into the trained models. Consequently, when such models are deployed to make decisions or guide interventions for new cases, they risk perpetuating this unwanted behavior. This work addresses group fairness in predictive process monitoring by investigating independence, i.e. ensuring predictions are unaffected by sensitive group membership. We explore independence through metrics for demographic parity such as $\Delta$DP, as well as recently introduced, threshold-independent distribution-based alternatives. Additionally, we propose a composite loss function existing of binary cross-entropy and a distribution-based loss (Wasserstein) to train models that balance predictive performance and fairness, and allow for customizable trade-offs. The effectiveness of both the fairness metrics and the composite loss functions is validated through a controlled experimental setup.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Learning for k-SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a $k$-SAT formula $\Phi$ where every variable appears at most $d$ times, and let $\sigma$ be a satisfying assignment of $\Phi$ sampled proportionally to $e^{\beta m(\sigma)}$ where $m(\sigma)$ is the number of variables set to true and $\beta$ is a real parameter. Given $\Phi$ and $\sigma$, can we learn the value of $\beta$ efficiently?
  This problem falls into a recent line of works about single-sample ("one-shot") learning of Markov random fields. The $k$-SAT setting we consider here was recently studied by Galanis, Kandiros, and Kalavasis (SODA'24) where they showed that single-sample learning is possible when roughly $d\leq 2^{k/6.45}$ and impossible when $d\geq (k+1) 2^{k-1}$. Crucially, for their impossibility results they used the existence of unsatisfiable instances which, aside from the gap in $d$, left open the question of whether the feasibility threshold for one-shot learning is dictated by the satisfiability threshold of $k$-SAT formulas of bounded degree.
  Our main contribution is to answer this question negatively. We show that one-shot learning for $k$-SAT is infeasible well below the satisfiability threshold; in fact, we obtain impossibility results for degrees $d$ as low as $k^2$ when $\beta$ is sufficiently large, and bootstrap this to small values of $\beta$ when $d$ scales exponentially with $k$, via a probabilistic construction. On the positive side, we simplify the analysis of the learning algorithm and obtain significantly stronger bounds on $d$ in terms of $\beta$. In particular, for the uniform case $\beta\rightarrow 0$ that has been studied extensively in the sampling literature, our analysis shows that learning is possible under the condition $d\lesssim 2^{k/2}$. This is nearly optimal (up to constant factors) in the sense that it is known that sampling a uniformly-distributed satisfying assignment is NP-hard for $d\gtrsim 2^{k/2}$.</description>

      <title>Heterogenous graph neural networks for species distribution modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs) are necessary for measuring and predicting occurrences and habitat suitability of species and their relationship with environmental factors. We introduce a novel presence-only SDM with graph neural networks (GNN). In our model, species and locations are treated as two distinct node sets, and the learning task is predicting detection records as the edges that connect locations to species. Using GNN for SDM allows us to model fine-grained interactions between species and the environment. We evaluate the potential of this methodology on the six-region dataset compiled by National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) for benchmarking SDMs. For each of the regions, the heterogeneous GNN model is comparable to or outperforms previously-benchmarked single-species SDMs as well as a feed-forward neural network baseline model.</description>

      <title>Permutation Learning with Only N Parameters: From SoftSort to Self-Organizing Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sorting and permutation learning are key concepts in optimization and machine learning, especially when organizing high-dimensional data into meaningful spatial layouts. The Gumbel-Sinkhorn method, while effective, requires N*N parameters to determine a full permutation matrix, making it computationally expensive for large datasets. Low-rank matrix factorization approximations reduce memory requirements to 2NM (with M &lt;&lt; N), but they still struggle with very large problems. SoftSort, by providing a continuous relaxation of the argsort operator, allows differentiable 1D sorting, but it faces challenges with multidimensional data and complex permutations. In this paper, we present a novel method for learning permutations using only N parameters, which dramatically reduces storage costs. Our method extends SoftSort by iteratively shuffling the N indices of the elements and applying a few SoftSort optimization steps per iteration. This modification significantly improves sorting quality, especially for multidimensional data and complex optimization criteria, and outperforms pure SoftSort. Our method offers improved memory efficiency and scalability compared to existing approaches, while maintaining high-quality permutation learning. Its dramatically reduced memory requirements make it particularly well-suited for large-scale optimization tasks, such as "Self-Organizing Gaussians", where efficient and scalable permutation learning is critical.</description>

      <title>Towards Optimal Differentially Private Regret Bounds in Linear MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study regret minimization under privacy constraints in episodic inhomogeneous linear Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), motivated by the growing use of reinforcement learning (RL) in personalized decision-making systems that rely on sensitive user data. In this setting, both transition probabilities and reward functions are assumed to be linear in a feature mapping $\phi(s, a)$, and we aim to ensure privacy through joint differential privacy (JDP), a relaxation of differential privacy suited to online learning. Prior work has established suboptimal regret bounds by privatizing the LSVI-UCB algorithm, which achieves $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d^3 H^4 K})$ regret in the non-private setting. Building on recent advances that improve this to near minimax optimal regret $\widetilde{O}(d\sqrt{H^{3}K})$ via LSVI-UCB++ with Bernstein-style bonuses, we design a new differentially private algorithm by privatizing LSVI-UCB++ and adapting techniques for variance-aware analysis from offline RL. Our algorithm achieves a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(d \sqrt{H^3 K} + H^{15/4} d^{7/6} K^{1/2} / \epsilon)$, improving over previous private methods. Empirical results show that our algorithm retains near-optimal utility compared to non-private baselines, indicating that privacy can be achieved with minimal performance degradation in this setting.</description>

      <title>Support is All You Need for Certified VAE Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have become increasingly popular and deployed in safety-critical applications. In such applications, we want to give certified probabilistic guarantees on performance under adversarial attacks. We propose a novel method, CIVET, for certified training of VAEs. CIVET depends on the key insight that we can bound worst-case VAE error by bounding the error on carefully chosen support sets at the latent layer. We show this point mathematically and present a novel training algorithm utilizing this insight. We show in an extensive evaluation across different datasets (in both the wireless and vision application areas), architectures, and perturbation magnitudes that our method outperforms SOTA methods achieving good standard performance with strong robustness guarantees.</description>

      <title>Data Selection for ERMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning theory has traditionally followed a model-centric approach, focusing on designing optimal algorithms for a fixed natural learning task (e.g., linear classification or regression). In this paper, we adopt a complementary data-centric perspective, whereby we fix a natural learning rule and focus on optimizing the training data. Specifically, we study the following question: given a learning rule $\mathcal{A}$ and a data selection budget $n$, how well can $\mathcal{A}$ perform when trained on at most $n$ data points selected from a population of $N$ points? We investigate when it is possible to select $n \ll N$ points and achieve performance comparable to training on the entire population.
  We address this question across a variety of empirical risk minimizers. Our results include optimal data-selection bounds for mean estimation, linear classification, and linear regression. Additionally, we establish two general results: a taxonomy of error rates in binary classification and in stochastic convex optimization. Finally, we propose several open questions and directions for future research.</description>
