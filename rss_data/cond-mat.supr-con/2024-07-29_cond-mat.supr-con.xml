      <title>Kondo versus Fano in superconducting artificial high-Tc heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the quest for high-Tc superconductivity has evolved from the trial-and-error methodology to the growth of nanostructured artificial high-Tc superlattices (AHTS) with tailor-made superconducting functional properties by quantum design. Superlattices are composed of nanoscale superconducting units of modulation doped Mott insulator La2CuO4 with thickness L intercalated by metallic overdoped La1.55Sr0.45CuO4 and period d. Quantum design based on the multi-gap Bogoliubov theory including spin-orbit coupling (SOC). has been employed for prediction of the amplification of the critical temperature as a function of the conformational parameter L/d. At the top of the superconducting dome, at the magic ratio L/d=2/3, the heterostructures are tuned at the Fano-Feshbach resonance and the normal phase exhibits the Planckian T-linear resistivity. Here, we report experimental evidence that the Kondo proximity effect competes with the Fano-Feshbach resonance suppressing Tc on both sides of the superconducting dome. The Kondo proximity effect is expected in electrical resistance of AHTS nanoscale heterostructures following a Kondo universal scaling obtained by numerical renormalization group theory. We show the vanishing Kondo temperature TK and Kondo scattering amplitude R0K at L/d=2/3, while TK and R0K increase on the underdoped (L/d&gt;2/3) and overdoped (L/d&lt;2/3) side of the superconducting dome.</description>

      <title>High-Tc superconducting dome in artificial heterostructures made of nanoscale quantum building blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the search of high Tc superconductivity was driven mostly by trial and error methodology searching for novel materials, here we provide a quasi-first-principle quantum theory for engineering superconductivity in artificial high-Tc superlattices (AHTS) with period d, ranging from 5.28 down to 3 nanometers, made of superconducting quantum wells of variable thickness L. An important feature of our quantum design is the key role of the interface internal electric field giving Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the nanoscale quantum superconducting building blocks. By tuning the geometrical conformational parameter L/d around its magic ratio 2/3 we predict the superconducting dome of Tc versus doping characteristic of unconventional superconductors. Quantum size effects, controlled by L/d, change the energy width and splitting of two quantum subbands formed by the electronic space charge confined in superconducting nano-layers. The theoretical superconducting dome Tc versus charge density controlled by the Fano-Feshbach resonance between two superconducting gaps has been able to predict experimental results on cuprate AHTS by tuning the geometry of superlattices of quantum wells made of superconducting layers (S) of thickness L of modulation doped stoichiometric Mott insulator La2CuO4 with no chemical dopants, with interface space charge confined within normal metal (N) overdoped cuprate layers</description>

      <title>Field-Enhanced Critical Current and Tunable Skewness in Altermagnetic Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the influence of external electric and Zeeman fields on the Josephson response of a planar superconductor/altermagnet/superconductor junction. We show that the critical Josephson current across the junction oscillates as the altermagnetic field strength increases. The current-phase relation can be forward- or backward-skewed due to significant second-order Josephson response. It decisively depends on the altermagnetic field strength. We discover that the skewness can be manipulated by electric gating. We reveal two additional impacts of external fields on the Josephson current: (i) Fields can induce 0-$\pi$ transitions. (ii) Fields can substantially enhance the critical current.</description>

      <title>Reduced decay in Josephson coupling across ferromagnetic junctions with spin-orbit coupling layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of $S=1$ triplet Cooper pairs has been predicted theoretically in superconducting-ferromagnetic hybrid heterostructures in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. In this study, we experimentally investigate vertical Josephson junctions where the weak link is formed from a ferromagnetic layer with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy sandwiched by two non-magnetic layers with weak or strong spin-orbit coupling. We find that the decay of the Josephson coupling is reduced in the latter case, possibly indicating the presence of $S=1$ spin-triplet correlations. We speculate that the canted magnetization required for these correlations is provided by the interaction of magnetization with Meissner effect in the superconducting layers.</description>

      <title>Fermi-surface diagnosis for $s$-wave-like topological superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical prediction of topological superconductivity is key to their discovery. Recently, it is proved that in 199 out of 230 space groups, topological superconductivity coexists with an $s$-wave-like pairing symmetry, raising the hope of finding more candidates for this exotic phase. However, a comprehensive and efficient method for diagnosing topological superconductivity in realistic materials remains elusive. Here, we derive Fermi-surface formulas for gapped and gapless topological phases of time-reversal symmetric superconductors with $s$-wave-like pairing symmetries in all layer and space groups, applicable to thin-film and bulk materials. Our diagnosis uses only the sign of the pairing and the Fermi velocity at several Fermi points, and yields complete (partial) diagnosis for gapped topological superconductivity in 159 (40) out of the 199 space groups. This provides a fundamental basis for the first-principles prediction of new topological superconductors.</description>

      <title>Modified Martin-Puplett interferometer for magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements at sub-THz frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) spectrometer based on a modified Martin-Puplett interferometer, utilizing continuous wave sub-THz low-power radiation in broad frequency range. This spectrometer is capable of measuring the frequency dependence of the MOKE response function, both the Kerr rotation and ellipticity, simultaneously with sub-milliradian accuracy without the need for reference measurement. The instrument's versatility allow it to be coupled to a cryostat with optical windows enabling studies of a variety of quantum materials such as unconventional superconductors, two-dimensional electron gas systems, quantum magnets, and other system showing optical Hall response, at sub-Kelvin temperatures and in high magnetic fields. We demonstrate the functionality of the MOKE spectrometer using an undoped InSb wafer as a test sample.</description>

      <title>Ambipolar doping of a charge-transfer insulator in the Emery model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the similarities and differences between adding or removing electrons from a charge-transfer insulator may provide insights about the origin of the electron-hole asymmetry found in cuprates. Here we study with cellular dynamical mean-field theory the Emery model set in the charge-transfer insulator regime, and dope it with either electrons or holes. We consider the normal state only and focus on the doping evolution of the orbital character of the dopants and on the nature of the doping driven transition. Regarding the orbital character of the dopants, we found an electron-hole asymmetry: doped electrons mostly enter the copper orbitals, whereas doped holes mostly enter the oxygen orbitals. Regarding the nature of the doping driven transition, we found no qualitative electron-hole asymmetry: upon either electron or hole doping, there is a two-stage transition from a charge-transfer insulator to a strongly correlated pseudogap and then to a metal. This shows that a strongly correlated pseudogap is an emergent feature of doped correlated insulators in two dimensions, in qualitative agreement with recent experiments on ambipolar Sr$_{1-x}$La$_{x}$CuO$_{2+y}$ cuprate films. Our results indicate that merely doping with holes or electrons a charge-transfer insulator is not sufficient for explaining the electron-hole asymmetry observed in the normal state phase diagram of cuprates. Our work reinforces the view that actual hole-doped cuprates are more correlated than their electron-doped counterparts.</description>

      <title>Crystal-symmetry-paired spin-valley locking in a layered room-temperature antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent theoretical efforts predicted a type of unconventional antiferromagnet characterized by the crystal symmetry C (rotation or mirror), which connects antiferromagnet sublattices in real space and simultaneously couples spin and momentum in reciprocal space. This results in a unique C-paired spin-valley locking (SVL) and corresponding novel properties such as piezomagnetism and noncollinear spin current even without spin-orbit coupling. However, the unconventional antiferromagnets reported thus far are not layered materials, limiting their potential in spintronic applications. Additionally, they do not meet the necessary symmetry requirements for nonrelativistic spin current. Here, we report the realization of C-paired SVL in a layered room-temperature antiferromagnetic compound, Rb1-{\delta}V2Te2O. Spin resolved photoemission measurements directly demonstrate the opposite spin splitting between C-paired valleys. Quasi-particle interference patterns reveal the suppression of inter-valley scattering due to the spin selection rules, as a direct consequence of C-paired SVL. All these experiments are well consistent with the results obtained from first-principles calculations. Our observations represent the first realization of layered antiferromagnets with C-paired SVL, enabling both the advantages of layered materials and possible control through crystal symmetry manipulation. These results hold significant promise and broad implications for advancements in magnetism, electronics, and information technology.</description>

      <title>A pair of small Fermi surfaces, chiral charge-density-wave quantum criticality, and BEC-type finite-momentum pairing instabilities in TiSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SC near CDW quantum criticality in materials with small Fermi surfaces suggests a novel mechanism of SC such as PDW SC and BEC beyond the conventional BCS mechanism of SC. Recent research by Kim $\textit{et al}$. [arXiv:2312.11979] proposes how chiral CDW ordering arises in TiSe$_2$, characterized by a pair of small Fermi surfaces. Interaction-driven electronic quantum fluctuations described by a polarization bubble between the pair of small Fermi surfaces give rise to UV symmetry forbidden but dynamically generated linear electron-lattice couplings at IR, resulting in a chiral symmetry breaking without chiral instability in either the charge or the lattice sector. This mechanism has been substantiated through Raman spectroscopy, inelastic x-ray scattering, group theory, and many-body calculations in the random phase approximation. The emergence of SC in this material, induced by pressure or doping, particularly, combined with the pair of small Fermi surfaces and the possible chiral CDW quantum criticality, indicates that conventional interpretations on thermodynamics and magnetic responses based on the BCS theory may not be sufficient. In this study, we propose that BEC-type SC appears, driven by chiral CDW quantum critical fluctuations, which provides a robust explanatory framework for this phenomenon. As an inevitable consequence, we demonstrate that electrons in the $p$ and $d$ orbitals form interorbital Cooper pairs with finite center-of-mass momentum, reminiscent of FFLO or PDW state. Employing a group theoretical and tight-binding approach to the interorbital pairing, we find that the possibility of unconventional pairing symmetries is restricted, except for the orbital-selective $s$-wave pairing symmetry. These findings suggest that a distinct superconducting mechanism, behaving conventionally, may operate in materials exhibiting exotic CDW with small Fermi surfaces.</description>

      <title>Anomalous symmetry protected blockade of skin effect in one-dimensional non-Hermitian lattice systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), an anomalous localization behavior of the bulk states, is an inherently non-Hermitian phenomenon, which can not find a counterpart in Hermitian systems. However, the fragility of NHSE has been revealed recently, such as the boundary sensitivity, and it stimulates a lot of studies on discussing the fate of that. Here we present a theorem which shows that the combined spatial reflection symmetry can be considered as a criterion in one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems to determine whether the NHSE can exist or not. Distinct from previous studies, our proposed criterion only relies on analyzing the symmetry of the system, freeing out other requirements, such as the information of the energy spectrum. Furthermore, by taking the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain as an example, we verify our theorem through both a mathematical proof via the non-Bloch band theory and the exact diagonalization numerical studies. Our results reveal a profound connection between the symmetry and the fate of NHSE.</description>

      <title>Gapped quantum spin liquid in a triangular-lattice Ising-type antiferromagnet PrMgAl11O19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the search of quantum spin liquid (QSLs), spin-1/2 triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnets (TLHAFs) have always been viewed as fertile soils. Despite the true magnetically-ordered ground state, anisotropy has been considered to play a significant role in stabilizing a QSL state. However, the nature and ground state of the most anisotropic case, the triangular-lattice Ising antiferromagnet (TLIAF), remains elusive and controversial. Here, we report specific heat and thermal conductivity measurements on a newly-discovered Ising-type QSL candidate PrMgAl11O19. At zero field, the magnetic specific heat shows a quadratic temperature dependence. On the contrary, no direct positive magnetic contribution to thermal conductivity was detected, ruling out the presence of mobile gapless fermionic excitations. Further analysis of phonon thermal conductivity reveals that the phonons are strongly scattered by thermally-activated magnetic excitations out of a gap, which exhibits a linear dependence with magnetic field. These results demonstrate that the spin-1/2 TLIAF PrMgAl11O19 has a gapped Z2 QSL ground state.</description>

      <title>Universal corrections to the superfluid gap in a cold Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A framework for computing the superfluid gap in an effective field theory (EFT) of fermions interacting via momentum-independent contact forces is developed. The leading universal corrections in the EFT are one-loop in-medium effects at the Fermi surface, and reproduce the well-known Gor'kov-Melik-Barkhudarov result. The complete subleading universal corrections are presented here, and include one-loop effects away from the Fermi surface, two-loop in-medium effects, as well as modifications to the fermion propagator. Together, these effects are found to reduce the gap at low densities. Applications to neutron superfluidity in neutron stars are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: Topological superconductors are an exciting class of quantum materials from the point of view of the fundamental sciences and potential technological applications. Here, we report on the successful introduction of superconductivity in a ferromagnetic layered skyrmion system Cr$_3$Te$_4$, obtained by the Sn intercalation, below a transition temperature of $T_c$$\approx$3.5 K. We observe several interesting physical properties, such as superconductivity, magnetism, and the topological Hall effect, simultaneously in this system. Despite the magnetism and Meissner effects being anisotropic, the superconductivity observed from the in-plane electrical resistivity ($\rho_{\it{bc}}$) is nearly isotropic between $H\parallel \it{bc}$ and $H\parallel \it{a}$, suggesting separate channels of conduction electrons responsible for the superconductivity and magnetism of this system, which is also supported by our spin-resolved DFT calculations. We identify two orders of higher carrier density in superconducting Sn$_{0.06}$Cr$_{3}$Te$_4$ than the parent Cr$_3$Te$_4$. A jump in the specific heat is noticed around the $T_c$ with a volume fraction of 33\%, confirming the bulk superconductivity in Sn$_{0.06}$Cr$_{3}$Te$_4$. In addition to the introduction of superconductivity, tuning of topological Hall properties is noticed with Sn intercalation. Our observation of superconductivity in a skyrmion lattice brings up a new class of topological quantum materials.</description>

Abstract: We present a framework that allows us to clearly identify the geometric features underlying the phenomenon of superconductivity in two dimensional materials. In particular, we show that any such medium whose response to an externally applied electromagnetic field is a geodesically flowing induced current, must be a superconductor. In this manner, we conclude that the underlying geometry of this type of media is that of a Lorentzian contact manifold. Moreover, we show that the macroscopic hallmark of their superconducting state is a purely topological condition equivalent to the geodesic nature of the induced current: the non-vanishing of its helicity.</description>

      <title>Quenched pair breaking by interlayer correlations as a key to superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17465v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with $T_\mathrm{c} \simeq 80~\mathrm{K}$ under high pressure opens up a new route to high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductivity. This material realizes a bilayer square lattice model featuring a strong interlayer hybridization unlike many unconventional superconductors. A key question in this regard concerns how electronic correlations driven by the interlayer hybridization affect the low-energy electronic structure and the concomitant superconductivity. Here, we demonstrate using a cluster dynamical mean-field theory that the interlayer electronic correlations (IECs) induce a Lifshitz transition resulting in a change of Fermi surface topology. By solving an appropriate gap equation, we further show that the leading pairing instability, $s \pm$-wave, is enhanced by the IECs. The underlying mechanism is the quenching of a strong ferromagnetic channel, resulting from the Lifshitz transition driven by the IECs. Based on this picture, we provide a possible reason of why superconductivity emerges only under high pressure.</description>

      <title>Pressure-induced superconductivity in La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10+\delta}$ ($\delta$ = 0.04 and -0.01)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superconducting transition temperatures, $T_{\mathrm{c}}$, of La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10+\delta}$($\delta$ = 0.04 and -0.01) were determined under various pressures up to 124.9 GPa by electrical resistance measurements with a diamond anvil cell. $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ exhibits a strong dependence on oxygen content within the pressure range of approximately 20 GPa and 80 GPa. At 48.0 GPa, $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10.04}$ peaks at 36 K, marking the highest $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ reported thus far.</description>

      <title>Inherently dissipative normal currents during thermodynamic changes of state in superconductors: Joule heating vs. magnetocaloric cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A thermodynamic change of state in the Meissner phase of a superconductor at finite temperature, such as the cooling or the heating it in a constant external magnetic field, inevitably generates normal currents of unpaired electrons. These currents are induced by the time-dependent variations in the local magnetic-flux density associated with the imposed change of state. They may not only lead to certain deviations of the magnetic-field distribution from textbook Meissner profiles, but also cause dissipative Joule heating, which appears to be at odds with the expected reversibility in a truly thermodynamic superconducting state. We show that these normal currents also produce a magnetocaloric cooling, which in total instantaneously and precisely compensates for the dissipated heat, thus ensuring overall energy conservation and reversibility in terms of energy. However, the time-dependent Joule heating and magnetocaloric cooling processes are spatially distinct and therefore must result in small temperature inhomogeneities that will only fade away towards thermodynamic equilibrium after the thermodynamic change of state has halted.</description>

      <title>Signature of Orbital Driven Finite Momentum Pairing in a 3D Ising Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The finite momentum superconducting pairing states (FMPs), where Cooper pairs carry non-zero momentum, are believed to give rise to exotic physical phenomena including the pseudogap phase of cuprate high-Tc superconductors and Majorana fermions in topological superconductivity. FMPs can emerge in intertwined electronic liquids with strong spin-spin interactions or be induced by lifting the spin degeneracy under magnetic field as originally proposed by Fulde-Ferrell and Larkin-Ovchinnikov. In quantum materials with strong Ising-type spin-orbit coupling, such as the 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), the spin degree of freedom is frozen enabling novel orbital driven FMPs via magnetoelectric effect. While evidence of orbital driven FMPs has been revealed in bilayer TMDs, its realization in 3D bulk materials remains an unresolved challenge. Here we report experimental signatures of FMP in a locally noncentrosymmetric bulk superconductor 4Hb-TaS2. Using hard X-ray diffraction and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we reveal unusual 2D chiral charge density wave (CDW) and weak interlayer hopping in 4Hb-TaS2. Below the superconducting transition temperature, the upper critical field, Hc2, linearly increases via decreasing temperature, and well exceeds the Pauli limit, thus establishing the dominant orbital pair-breaking mechanism. Remarkably, we discover a field-induced superconductivity-to-superconductivity transition that breaks continuous rotational symmetry of the s-wave uniform pairing in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory down to the six-fold rotation symmetry. Combining with a Ginzburg-Landau free energy analysis that incorporates magnetoelectric effect, our observations provide strong evidence of orbital driven FMP in the 3D quantum heterostructure 4Hb-TaS2.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of quantum vortex fractionalization in multiband superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic field is expelled from a superconductor, unless it forms quantum vortices, consisting of a core singularity with current circulating around it. The London quantization condition implies that there is one core singularity per quantum of magnetic flux in single-component superconductors, while in multiband materials fractional vortices are possible. Here, we report the first observation of quantum vortex core fractionalization on the potassium terminated surface of multiband superconductor KFe2As2 by scanning tunneling microscopy. We observe splitting of an integer-flux vortex into several fractional vortices, leading to disparity between numbers of flux quanta and vortex cores. Our findings demonstrate that fractionalized core singularities are possible in a multiband superconductor, opening avenue for new experimental platforms with quasiparticles with fractional statistics.</description>

      <title>Illuminating the Bragg intersections as roots of Dirac nodal lines and high-order van Hove singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically reexamine nearly uniform electron models with weak crystalline potentials. In particular, we theorize the modulation of the plane-wave branches at linear regions where multiple Bragg planes intersect. Any such linear intersections involve three or more plane-wave branches diffracted by the periodic potential. Small inter-branch interactions can yield various crossing and anticrossing singularities with promised breakdown of the quadratic approximation, extending alongside the intersection lines. Most of the intersections run in low-symmetric paths in the Brillouin zone and therefore we cannot completely characterize their electronic states with standard band structure plotting methods. The present theory reveals a general mechanism in nearly uniform systems to induce the Dirac nodal lines and van-Hove singularities with broken quadratic band approximation in three dimensions, which may host a variety of anomalous low-energy electronic properties. We apply the theory to a recently discovered high temperature superconductor H$_{3}$S to interpret the enigmatic density-of-state (DOS) peaking therein. The results show how and {\it why there} the continuous saddle points--the source of the peaked DOS--emerge, as well as reveal the companion Dirac nodal lines hidden in the conduction bands.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic microwave link for quantum local area networks</title>

Abstract: Scalable quantum information processing with superconducting circuits is expected to advance from individual processors located in single dilution refrigerators to more powerful distributed quantum computing systems. The realization of hardware platforms for quantum local area networks (QLANs) compatible with superconducting technology is of high importance in order to achieve a practical quantum advantage. Here, we present a fundamental prototype platform for a microwave QLAN based on a cryogenic link connecting two separate dilution cryostats over a distance of $6.6$ m with a base temperature of $52$ mK in the center. Superconducting microwave coaxial cables are employed to form a quantum communication channel between the distributed network nodes. We demonstrate the continuous-variable entanglement distribution between the remote dilution refrigerators in the form of two-mode squeezed microwave states, reaching squeezing of $2.10 \pm 0.02$ dB and negativity of $0.501 \pm 0.011$. Furthermore, we show that quantum entanglement is preserved at channel center temperatures up to $1$ K, paving the way towards microwave quantum communication at elevated temperatures. Consequently, such a QLAN system can form the backbone for future distributed quantum computing with superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuit refrigerator based on quantum dots coupled to normal-metal and superconducting electrodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum dot junctions capacitively coupled to a resonator, electron tunneling through the quantum dot can be used to transfer heat between different parts of the system. This includes cooling or heating the electrons in electrodes and absorbing or emitting photons in the resonator mode. Such systems can be driven into a nonequilibrium state by applying either a voltage bias or a temperature gradient across the electrodes coupled to the quantum dot, or by employing an external coherent pump to excite the resonator. In this study, we present a semiclassical theory to describe the steady state of these structures. We employ a combination of the Floquet-nonequilibrium Green's functions method and semiclassical laser theory to analyze a normal metal-quantum dot-superconductor junction coupled to a resonator. Our investigation focuses on key parameters such as the average photon number and phase shift in the resonator, the charge current in the quantum dot, and the heat fluxes among different components of the system. We explore how photon-assisted Andreev reflection and quasiparticle tunneling in the quantum dot can refrigerate the resonator mode and the normal metal electrode. We also examine the influence of finite voltage and thermal biases on these processes.</description>
