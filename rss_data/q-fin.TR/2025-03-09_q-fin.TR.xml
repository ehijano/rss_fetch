      <title>Modeling metaorder impact with a Non-Markovian Zero Intelligence model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Devising models of the limit order book that realistically reproduce the market response to exogenous trades is extremely challenging and fundamental in order to test trading strategies. We propose a novel explainable model for small tick assets, the Non-Markovian Zero Intelligence, which is a variant of the well-known Zero Intelligence model. The main modification is that the probability of limit orders' signs (buy/sell) is not constant but is a function of the exponentially weighted mid-price return, representing the past price dynamics, and can be interpreted as the reaction of traders with reservation prices to the price trend. With numerical simulations and analytical arguments, we show that the model predicts a concave price path during a metaorder execution and to a price reversion after the executions ends, as empirically observed. We analyze in-depth the mechanism at the root of the arising concavity, the components which constitute the price impact in our model, and the dependence of the results on the two main parameters, namely the time scale and the strength of the reaction of traders to the price trend.</description>

      <title>Multi-asset optimal trade execution with stochastic cross-effects: An Obizhaeva-Wang-type framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a continuous-time optimal trade execution problem in multiple assets where the price impact and the resilience can be matrix-valued stochastic processes that incorporate cross-impact effects. In addition, we allow for stochastic terminal and running targets. Initially, we formulate the optimal trade execution task as a stochastic control problem with a finite-variation control process that acts as an integrator both in the state dynamics and in the cost functional. We then extend this problem continuously to a stochastic control problem with progressively measurable controls. By identifying this extended problem as equivalent to a certain linear-quadratic stochastic control problem, we can use established results in linear-quadratic stochastic control to solve the extended problem. This work generalizes [Ackermann, Kruse, Urusov; FinancStoch'24] from the single-asset setting to the multi-asset case. In particular, we reveal cross-hedging effects, showing that it can be optimal to trade in an asset despite having no initial position. Moreover, as a subsetting we discuss a multi-asset variant of the model in [Obizhaeva, Wang; JFinancMark'13].</description>
