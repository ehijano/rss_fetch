      <title>Perturbative diagonalization and spectral gaps of quasiperiodic operators on $\ell^2(\Z^d)$ with monotone potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a perturbative proof of localization for quasiperiodic operators on $\ell^2(\Z^d)$ with one-dimensional phase space and monotone sampling functions, in the regime of small hopping. The proof is based on an iterative scheme which can be considered as a local (in the energy and the phase) and convergent version of KAM-type diagonalization, whose result is a covariant family of uniformly localized eigenvalues and eigenvectors. We also proof that the spectra of such operators contain infinitely many gaps.</description>

      <title>Negative eigenvalue estimates for the 1D Schr{\"o}dinger operator with measure-potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the negative part of the spectrum of the operator $-\partial^2 - \mu$ on $L^2(\mathbb R)$, where a locally finite Radon measure $\mu \geq 0$ is serving as a potential. We obtain estimates for the eigenvalue counting function, for individual eigenvalues and estimates of the Lieb-Thirring type. A crucial tool for our estimates is Otelbaev's function, a certain average of the measure potential $\mu$, which is used both in the proofs and the formulation of many of the results.</description>

      <title>Transfer and entanglement stability of property ($UW${\normalsize\it{E}})</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An operator $T\in B(H)$ is said to satisfy property ($UW${\scriptsize \it{E}}) if the complement in the approximate point spectrum of the essential approximate point spectrum coincides with the isolated eigenvalues of the spectrum. Via the CI spectrum induced by consistent invertibility property of operators, we explore property ($UW${\scriptsize \it{E}}) for $T$ and $T^\ast$ simultaneously. Furthermore, the transfer of property ($UW${\scriptsize \it{E}}) from $T$ to $f(T)$ and $f(T^{\ast})$ is obtained, where $f$ is a function which is analytic in a neighborhood of the spectrum of $T$. At last, with the help of the so-called $(A,B)$ entanglement stable spectra, the entanglement stability of property ($UW${\scriptsize \it{E}}) for $2\times 2$ upper triangular operator matrices is investigated.</description>

      <title>Circle Foliations Revisited: Periods of Flows whose Orbits are all Closed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06056v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our purpose here is to adapt the results of Geodesic circle foliations for Reeb flows or Hamiltonian flows on contact manifolds. Consequently, all periods are exactly the same if the contact manifold is connected and all orbits on the contact manifold are closed. We also present concrete examples of periodic flows, all of whose orbits are closed, such as Harmonic oscillators, Lotka-Volterra systems, and others. Lotka-Volterra systems, Reeb flows, and some geodesic flows have non-trivial periods, whereas the periods of Harmonic oscillators and similar systems can be easily obtained through direct calculations. As an application to quantum mechanics, we examine the spectrum of semiclassical Shr\"odinger operators. Then we have one of the semiclassical analogies of the Helton-Guillemin theorem.</description>

      <title>On the First Eigenvalue of the $p$-Laplace Operator with Robin Boundary Conditions in the Complement of a Compact Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the first eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ of the $p$-Laplace operator subject to Robin boundary conditions in the exterior of a compact set. We discuss the conditions for the existence of a variational $\lambda_1$, depending on the boundary parameter, the space dimension, and $p$. Our analysis involves the first $p$-harmonic Steklov eigenvalue in exterior domains. We establish properties of $\lambda_1$ for the exterior of a ball, including general inequalities, the asymptotic behavior as the boundary parameter approaches zero, and a monotonicity result with respect to a special type of domain inclusion. In two dimensions, we generalized to $p\neq 2$ some known shape optimization results.</description>

      <title>Gaussian fluctuations for the two urn model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a modification of the generalized P\'olya urn model containing two urns and we study the number of balls $B_j(n)$ of a given color $j\in\{1,\ldots,J\}$, $J\in\mathbb{N}$ added to the urns after $n$ draws. We provide sufficient conditions under which the random variables $(B_j(n))_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ properly normalized and centered converge weakly to a limiting random variable. The result reveals a similar trichotomy as in the classical case with one urn, one of the main differences being that in the scaling we encounter 1-periodic continuous functions. Another difference in our results compared to the classical urn models is that the phase transition of the second order behavior occurs at $\sqrt{\rho}$ and not at $\rho/2$, where $\rho$ is the dominant eigenvalue of the mean replacement matrix.</description>
