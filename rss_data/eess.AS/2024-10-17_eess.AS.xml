      <title>Automatic Screening for Children with Speech Disorder using Automatic Speech Recognition: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech is a fundamental aspect of human life, crucial not only for communication but also for cognitive, social, and academic development. Children with speech disorders (SD) face significant challenges that, if unaddressed, can result in lasting negative impacts. Traditionally, speech and language assessments (SLA) have been conducted by skilled speech-language pathologists (SLPs), but there is a growing need for efficient and scalable SLA methods powered by artificial intelligence. This position paper presents a survey of existing techniques suitable for automating SLA pipelines, with an emphasis on adapting automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for children's speech, an overview of current SLAs and their automated counterparts to demonstrate the feasibility of AI-enhanced SLA pipelines, and a discussion of practical considerations, including accessibility and privacy concerns, associated with the deployment of AI-powered SLAs.</description>

      <title>Guided Speaker Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a guided speaker embedding extraction system, which extracts speaker embeddings of the target speaker using speech activities of target and interference speakers as clues. Several methods for long-form overlapped multi-speaker audio processing are typically two-staged: i) segment-level processing and ii) inter-segment speaker matching. Speaker embeddings are often used for the latter purpose. Typical speaker embedding extraction approaches only use single-speaker intervals to avoid corrupting the embeddings with speech from interference speakers. However, this often makes speaker embeddings impossible to extract because sufficiently long non-overlapping intervals are not always available. In this paper, we propose using speaker activities as clues to extract the embedding of the speaker-of-interest directly from overlapping speech. Specifically, we concatenate the activity of target and non-target speakers to acoustic features before being fed to the model. We also condition the attention weights used for pooling so that the attention weights of the intervals in which the target speaker is inactive are zero. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in speaker verification and speaker diarization.</description>

      <title>FlashAudio: Rectified Flows for Fast and High-Fidelity Text-to-Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in latent diffusion models (LDMs) have markedly enhanced text-to-audio generation, yet their iterative sampling processes impose substantial computational demands, limiting practical deployment. While recent methods utilizing consistency-based distillation aim to achieve few-step or single-step inference, their one-step performance is constrained by curved trajectories, preventing them from surpassing traditional diffusion models. In this work, we introduce FlashAudio with rectified flows to learn straight flow for fast simulation. To alleviate the inefficient timesteps allocation and suboptimal distribution of noise, FlashAudio optimizes the time distribution of rectified flow with Bifocal Samplers and proposes immiscible flow to minimize the total distance of data-noise pairs in a batch vias assignment. Furthermore, to address the amplified accumulation error caused by the classifier-free guidance (CFG), we propose Anchored Optimization, which refines the guidance scale by anchoring it to a reference trajectory. Experimental results on text-to-audio generation demonstrate that FlashAudio's one-step generation performance surpasses the diffusion-based models with hundreds of sampling steps on audio quality and enables a sampling speed of 400x faster than real-time on a single NVIDIA 4090Ti GPU.</description>

      <title>Beyond Oversmoothing: Evaluating DDPM and MSE for Scalable Speech Synthesis in ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetically generated speech has rapidly approached human levels of naturalness. However, the paradox remains that ASR systems, when trained on TTS output that is judged as natural by humans, continue to perform badly on real speech. In this work, we explore whether this phenomenon is due to the oversmoothing behaviour of models commonly used in TTS, with a particular focus on the behaviour of TTS-for-ASR as the amount of TTS training data is scaled up. We systematically compare Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) to Mean Squared Error (MSE) based models for TTS, when used for ASR model training. We test the scalability of the two approaches, varying both the number hours, and the number of different speakers. We find that for a given model size, DDPM can make better use of more data, and a more diverse set of speakers, than MSE models. We achieve the best reported ratio between real and synthetic speech WER to date (1.46), but also find that a large gap remains.</description>

      <title>ERVQ: Enhanced Residual Vector Quantization with Intra-and-Inter-Codebook Optimization for Neural Audio Codecs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current neural audio codecs typically use residual vector quantization (RVQ) to discretize speech signals. However, they often experience codebook collapse, which reduces the effective codebook size and leads to suboptimal performance. To address this problem, we introduce ERVQ, Enhanced Residual Vector Quantization, a novel enhancement strategy for the RVQ framework in neural audio codecs. ERVQ mitigates codebook collapse and boosts codec performance through both intra- and inter-codebook optimization. Intra-codebook optimization incorporates an online clustering strategy and a code balancing loss to ensure balanced and efficient codebook utilization. Inter-codebook optimization improves the diversity of quantized features by minimizing the similarity between successive quantizations. Our experiments show that ERVQ significantly enhances audio codec performance across different models, sampling rates, and bitrates, achieving superior quality and generalization capabilities. It also achieves 100% codebook utilization on one of the most advanced neural audio codecs. Further experiments indicate that audio codecs improved by the ERVQ strategy can improve unified speech-and-text large language models (LLMs). Specifically, there is a notable improvement in the naturalness of generated speech in downstream zero-shot text-to-speech tasks. Audio samples are available here.</description>

      <title>SiFiSinger: A High-Fidelity End-to-End Singing Voice Synthesizer based on Source-filter Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an advanced end-to-end singing voice synthesis (SVS) system based on the source-filter mechanism that directly translates lyrical and melodic cues into expressive and high-fidelity human-like singing. Similarly to VISinger 2, the proposed system also utilizes training paradigms evolved from VITS and incorporates elements like the fundamental pitch (F0) predictor and waveform generation decoder. To address the issue that the coupling of mel-spectrogram features with F0 information may introduce errors during F0 prediction, we consider two strategies. Firstly, we leverage mel-cepstrum (mcep) features to decouple the intertwined mel-spectrogram and F0 characteristics. Secondly, inspired by the neural source-filter models, we introduce source excitation signals as the representation of F0 in the SVS system, aiming to capture pitch nuances more accurately. Meanwhile, differentiable mcep and F0 losses are employed as the waveform decoder supervision to fortify the prediction accuracy of speech envelope and pitch in the generated speech. Experiments on the Opencpop dataset demonstrate efficacy of the proposed model in synthesis quality and intonation accuracy.</description>

      <title>SeQuiFi: Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Speech Emotion Recognition with Sequential Class-Finetuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce SeQuiFi, a novel approach for mitigating catastrophic forgetting (CF) in speech emotion recognition (SER). SeQuiFi adopts a sequential class-finetuning strategy, where the model is fine-tuned incrementally on one emotion class at a time, preserving and enhancing retention for each class. While various state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, such as regularization-based, memory-based, and weight-averaging techniques, have been proposed to address CF, it still remains a challenge, particularly with diverse and multilingual datasets. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that SeQuiFi significantly outperforms both vanilla fine-tuning and SOTA continual learning techniques in terms of accuracy and F1 scores on multiple benchmark SER datasets, including CREMA-D, RAVDESS, Emo-DB, MESD, and SHEMO, covering different languages.</description>

      <title>Beyond Speech and More: Investigating the Emergent Ability of Speech Foundation Models for Classifying Physiological Time-Series Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite being trained exclusively on speech data, speech foundation models (SFMs) like Whisper have shown impressive performance in non-speech tasks such as audio classification. This is partly because speech shares some common traits with audio, enabling SFMs to transfer effectively. In this study, we push the boundaries by evaluating SFMs on a more challenging out-of-domain (OOD) task: classifying physiological time-series signals. We test two key hypotheses: first, that SFMs can generalize to physiological signals by capturing shared temporal patterns; second, that multilingual SFMs will outperform others due to their exposure to greater variability during pre-training, leading to more robust, generalized representations. Our experiments, conducted for stress recognition using ECG (Electrocardiogram), EMG (Electromyography), and EDA (Electrodermal Activity) signals, reveal that models trained on SFM-derived representations outperform those trained on raw physiological signals. Among all models, multilingual SFMs achieve the highest accuracy, supporting our hypothesis and demonstrating their OOD capabilities. This work positions SFMs as promising tools for new uncharted domains beyond speech.</description>

      <title>SWIM: An Attention-Only Model for Speech Quality Assessment Under Subjective Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech quality is best evaluated by human feedback using mean opinion scores (MOS). However, variance in ratings between listeners can introduce noise in the true quality label of an utterance. Currently, deep learning networks including convolutional, recurrent, and attention-based architectures have been explored for quality estimation. This paper proposes an exclusively attention-based model involving a Swin Transformer for MOS estimation (SWIM). Our network captures local and global dependencies that reflect the acoustic properties of an utterance. To counteract subjective variance in MOS labels, we propose a normal distance-based objective that accounts for standard deviation in each label, and we avail a multistage self-teaching strategy to improve generalization further. Our model is significantly more compact than existing attention-based networks for quality estimation. Finally, our experiments on the Samsung Open Mean Opinion Score (SOMOS) dataset show improvement over existing baseline models when trained from scratch.</description>

      <title>EmotionCaps: Enhancing Audio Captioning Through Emotion-Augmented Data Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in audio-language modeling, such as automated audio captioning, has benefited from training on synthetic data generated with the aid of large-language models. However, such approaches for environmental sound captioning have primarily focused on audio event tags and have not explored leveraging emotional information that may be present in recordings. In this work, we explore the benefit of generating emotion-augmented synthetic audio caption data by instructing ChatGPT with additional acoustic information in the form of estimated soundscape emotion. To do so, we introduce EmotionCaps, an audio captioning dataset comprised of approximately 120,000 audio clips with paired synthetic descriptions enriched with soundscape emotion recognition (SER) information. We hypothesize that this additional information will result in higher-quality captions that match the emotional tone of the audio recording, which will, in turn, improve the performance of captioning models trained with this data. We test this hypothesis through both objective and subjective evaluation, comparing models trained with the EmotionCaps dataset to multiple baseline models. Our findings challenge current approaches to captioning and suggest new directions for developing and assessing captioning models.</description>

      <title>Learning to rumble: Automated elephant call classification, detection and endpointing using deep architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of detecting, isolating and classifying elephant calls in continuously recorded audio. Such automatic call characterisation can assist conservation efforts and inform environmental management strategies. In contrast to previous work in which call detection was performed at a segment level, we perform call detection at a frame level which implicitly also allows call endpointing, the isolation of a call in a longer recording. For experimentation, we employ two annotated datasets, one containing Asian and the other African elephant vocalisations. We evaluate several shallow and deep classifier models, and show that the current best performance can be improved by using an audio spectrogram transformer (AST), a neural architecture which has not been used for this purpose before, and which we have configured in a novel sequence-to-sequence manner. We also show that using transfer learning by pre-training leads to further improvements both in terms of computational complexity and performance. Finally, we consider sub-call classification using an accepted taxonomy of call types, a task which has not previously been considered. We show that also in this case the transformer architectures provide the best performance. Our best classifiers achieve an average precision (AP) of 0.962 for framewise binary call classification, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 0.957 and 0.979 for call classification with 5 classes and sub-call classification with 7 classes respectively. All of these represent either new benchmarks (sub-call classifications) or improvements on previously best systems. We conclude that a fully-automated elephant call detection and subcall classification system is within reach. Such a system would provide valuable information on the behaviour and state of elephant herds for the purposes of conservation and management.</description>

      <title>SF-Speech: Straightened Flow for Zero-Shot Voice Clone on Small-Scale Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale speech generation models have achieved impressive performance in the zero-shot voice clone tasks relying on large-scale datasets. However, exploring how to achieve zero-shot voice clone with small-scale datasets is also essential. This paper proposes SF-Speech, a novel state-of-the-art voice clone model based on ordinary differential equations and contextual learning. Unlike the previous works, SF-Speech employs a multi-stage generation strategy to obtain the coarse acoustic feature and utilizes this feature to straighten the curved reverse trajectories caused by training the ordinary differential equation model with flow matching. In addition, we find the difference between the local correlations of different types of acoustic features and demonstrate the potential role of 2D convolution in modeling mel-spectrogram features. After training with less than 1000 hours of speech, SF-Speech significantly outperforms those methods based on global speaker embedding or autoregressive large language models. In particular, SF-Speech also shows a significant advantage over VoiceBox, the best-performing ordinary differential equation model, in speech intelligibility (a relative decrease of 22.4\% on word error rate) and timbre similarity (a relative improvement of 5.6\% on cosine distance) at a similar scale of parameters, and even keep a slight advantage when the parameters of VoiceBox are tripled.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Speech Emotion Recognition through Segmental Average Pooling of Self-Supervised Learning Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) analyzes human emotions expressed through speech. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising approach to SER by learning meaningful representations from a large amount of unlabeled audio data. However, existing SSL-based methods rely on Global Average Pooling (GAP) to represent audio signals, treating speech and non-speech segments equally. This can lead to dilution of informative speech features by irrelevant non-speech information. To address this, the paper proposes Segmental Average Pooling (SAP), which selectively focuses on informative speech segments while ignoring non-speech segments. By applying both GAP and SAP to SSL features, our approach utilizes overall speech signal information from GAP and specific information from SAP, leading to improved SER performance. Experiments show state-of-the-art results on the IEMOCAP for English and superior performance on KEMDy19 for Korean datasets in both unweighted and weighted accuracies.</description>

      <title>HeightCeleb -- an enrichment of VoxCeleb dataset with speaker height information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prediction of speaker's height is of interest for voice forensics, surveillance, and automatic speaker profiling. Until now, TIMIT has been the most popular dataset for training and evaluation of the height estimation methods. In this paper, we introduce HeightCeleb, an extension to VoxCeleb, which is the dataset commonly used in speaker recognition tasks. This enrichment consists in adding information about the height of all 1251 speakers from VoxCeleb that has been extracted with an automated method from publicly available sources. Such annotated data will enable the research community to utilize freely available speaker embedding extractors, pre-trained on VoxCeleb, to build more efficient speaker height estimators. In this work, we describe the creation of the HeightCeleb dataset and show that using it enables to achieve state-of-the-art results on the TIMIT test set by using simple statistical regression methods and embeddings obtained with a popular speaker model (without any additional fine-tuning).</description>

      <title>High Fidelity Text-Guided Music Editing via Single-Stage Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce MelodyFlow, an efficient text-controllable high-fidelity music generation and editing model. It operates on continuous latent representations from a low frame rate 48 kHz stereo variational auto encoder codec. Based on a diffusion transformer architecture trained on a flow-matching objective the model can edit diverse high quality stereo samples of variable duration, with simple text descriptions. We adapt the ReNoise latent inversion method to flow matching and compare it with the original implementation and naive denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) inversion on a variety of music editing prompts. Our results indicate that our latent inversion outperforms both ReNoise and DDIM for zero-shot test-time text-guided editing on several objective metrics. Subjective evaluations exhibit a substantial improvement over previous state of the art for music editing. Code and model weights will be publicly made available. Samples are available at https://melodyflow.github.io.</description>

      <title>MEDIC: Zero-shot Music Editing with Disentangled Inversion Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13220v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models make a paradigm shift in audio generation, facilitating the adaptability of source audio to conform to specific textual prompts. Recent works introduce inversion techniques, like DDIM inversion, to zero-shot editing, exploiting pretrained diffusion models for audio modification. Nonetheless, our investigation exposes that DDIM inversion suffers from an accumulation of errors across each diffusion step, undermining its efficacy. Moreover, existing editing methods fail to achieve effective complex non-rigid music editing while maintaining essential content preservation and high editing fidelity. To counteract these issues, we introduce the Disentangled Inversion technique to disentangle the diffusion process into triple branches, rectifying the deviated path of the source branch caused by DDIM inversion. In addition, we propose the Harmonized Attention Control framework, which unifies the mutual self-attention control and cross-attention control with an intermediate Harmonic Branch to progressively achieve the desired harmonic and melodic information in the target music. Collectively, these innovations comprise the Disentangled Inversion Control (DIC) framework, enabling accurate music editing while safeguarding content integrity. To benchmark audio editing efficacy, we introduce ZoME-Bench, a comprehensive music editing benchmark hosting 1,100 samples spread across ten distinct editing categories. This facilitates both zero-shot and instruction-based music editing tasks. Our method achieves unparalleled performance in edit fidelity and essential content preservation, outperforming contemporary state-of-the-art inversion techniques.</description>

      <title>Multi-Source Music Generation with Latent Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06190v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most music generation models directly generate a single music mixture. To allow for more flexible and controllable generation, the Multi-Source Diffusion Model (MSDM) has been proposed to model music as a mixture of multiple instrumental sources (e.g. piano, drums, bass, and guitar). Its goal is to use one single diffusion model to generate mutually-coherent music sources, that are then mixed to form the music. Despite its capabilities, MSDM is unable to generate music with rich melodies and often generates empty sounds. Its waveform diffusion approach also introduces significant Gaussian noise artifacts that compromise audio quality. In response, we introduce a Multi-Source Latent Diffusion Model (MSLDM) that employs Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to encode each instrumental source into a distinct latent representation. By training a VAE on all music sources, we efficiently capture each source's unique characteristics in a "source latent." The source latents are concatenated and our diffusion model learns this joint latent space. This approach significantly enhances the total and partial generation of music by leveraging the VAE's latent compression and noise-robustness. The compressed source latent also facilitates more efficient generation. Subjective listening tests and Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) scores confirm that our model outperforms MSDM, showcasing its practical and enhanced applicability in music generation systems. We also emphasize that modeling sources is more effective than direct music mixture modeling. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/XZWY/MSLDM. Demos are available at https://xzwy.github.io/MSLDMDemo/.</description>

      <title>GTSinger: A Global Multi-Technique Singing Corpus with Realistic Music Scores for All Singing Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13832v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality and multi-task singing datasets significantly hinders the development of diverse controllable and personalized singing tasks, as existing singing datasets suffer from low quality, limited diversity of languages and singers, absence of multi-technique information and realistic music scores, and poor task suitability. To tackle these problems, we present GTSinger, a large global, multi-technique, free-to-use, high-quality singing corpus with realistic music scores, designed for all singing tasks, along with its benchmarks. Particularly, (1) we collect 80.59 hours of high-quality singing voices, forming the largest recorded singing dataset; (2) 20 professional singers across nine widely spoken languages offer diverse timbres and styles; (3) we provide controlled comparison and phoneme-level annotations of six commonly used singing techniques, helping technique modeling and control; (4) GTSinger offers realistic music scores, assisting real-world musical composition; (5) singing voices are accompanied by manual phoneme-to-audio alignments, global style labels, and 16.16 hours of paired speech for various singing tasks. Moreover, to facilitate the use of GTSinger, we conduct four benchmark experiments: technique-controllable singing voice synthesis, technique recognition, style transfer, and speech-to-singing conversion. The corpus and demos can be found at http://gtsinger.github.io. We provide the dataset and the code for processing data and conducting benchmarks at https://huggingface.co/datasets/GTSinger/GTSinger and https://github.com/GTSinger/GTSinger.</description>

      <title>Mini-Omni2: Towards Open-source GPT-4o with Vision, Speech and Duplex Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GPT-4o, an all-encompassing model, represents a milestone in the development of large multi-modal language models. It can understand visual, auditory, and textual modalities, directly output audio, and support flexible duplex interaction. Models from the open-source community often achieve some functionalities of GPT-4o, such as visual understanding and voice chat. Nevertheless, training a unified model that incorporates all modalities is challenging due to the complexities of multi-modal data, intricate model architectures, and training processes. In this paper, we introduce Mini-Omni2, a visual-audio assistant capable of providing real-time, end-to-end voice responses to visoin and audio queries. By integrating pretrained visual and auditory encoders, Mini-Omni2 maintains performance in individual modalities. We propose a three-stage training process to align modalities, allowing the language model to handle multi-modal inputs and outputs after training on a limited dataset. For interaction, we introduce a command-based interruption mechanism, enabling more flexible interaction with users. To the best of our knowledge, Mini-Omni2 is one of the closest reproductions of GPT-4o, which have similar form of functionality, and we hope it can offer valuable insights for subsequent research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating semantically and temporally aligned audio content in accordance with video input has become a focal point for researchers, particularly following the remarkable breakthrough in text-to-video generation. In this work, we aim to offer insights into the video-to-audio generation paradigm, focusing on three crucial aspects: vision encoders, auxiliary embeddings, and data augmentation techniques. Beginning with a foundational model built on a simple yet surprisingly effective intuition, we explore various vision encoders and auxiliary embeddings through ablation studies. Employing a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that emphasizes generation quality and video-audio synchronization alignment, we demonstrate that our model exhibits state-of-the-art video-to-audio generation capabilities. Furthermore, we provide critical insights into the impact of different data augmentation methods on enhancing the generation framework's overall capacity. We showcase possibilities to advance the challenge of generating synchronized audio from semantic and temporal perspectives. We hope these insights will serve as a stepping stone toward developing more realistic and accurate audio-visual generation models.</description>

      <title>Robust ASR Error Correction with Conservative Data Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Error correction (EC) based on large language models is an emerging technology to enhance the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Generally, training data for EC are collected by automatically pairing a large set of ASR hypotheses (as sources) and their gold references (as targets). However, the quality of such pairs is not guaranteed, and we observed various types of noise which can make the EC models brittle, e.g. inducing overcorrection in out-of-domain (OOD) settings. In this work, we propose two fundamental criteria that EC training data should satisfy: namely, EC targets should (1) improve linguistic acceptability over sources and (2) be inferable from the available context (e.g. source phonemes). Through these criteria, we identify low-quality EC pairs and train the models not to make any correction in such cases, the process we refer to as conservative data filtering. In our experiments, we focus on Japanese ASR using a strong Conformer-CTC as the baseline and finetune Japanese LLMs for EC. Through our evaluation on a suite of 21 internal benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach can significantly reduce overcorrection and improve both the accuracy and quality of ASR results in the challenging OOD settings.</description>

      <title>A corpus-based investigation of pitch contours of monosyllabic words in conversational Taiwan Mandarin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Mandarin, the tonal contours of monosyllabic words produced in isolation or in careful speech are characterized by four lexical tones: a high-level tone (T1), a rising tone (T2), a dipping tone (T3) and a falling tone (T4). However, in spontaneous speech, the actual tonal realization of monosyllabic words can deviate significantly from these canonical tones due to intra-syllabic co-articulation and inter-syllabic co-articulation with adjacent tones. In addition, Chuang et al. (2024) recently reported that the tonal contours of disyllabic Mandarin words with T2-T4 tone pattern are co-determined by their meanings. Following up on their research, we present a corpus-based investigation of how the pitch contours of monosyllabic words are realized in spontaneous conversational Mandarin, focusing on the effects of contextual predictors on the one hand, and the way in words' meanings co-determine pitch contours on the other hand. We analyze the F0 contours of 3824 tokens of 63 different word types in a spontaneous Taiwan Mandarin corpus, using the generalized additive (mixed) model to decompose a given observed pitch contour into a set of component pitch contours. We show that the tonal context substantially modify a word's canonical tone. Once the effect of tonal context is controlled for, T2 and T3 emerge as low flat tones, contrasting with T1 as a high tone, and with T4 as a high-to-mid falling tone. The neutral tone (T0), which in standard descriptions, is realized based on the preceding tone, emerges as a low tone in its own right, modified by the other predictors in the same way as the standard tones T1, T2, T3, and T4. We also show that word, and even more so, word sense, co-determine words' F0 contours. Analyses of variable importance using random forests further supported the substantial effect of tonal context and an effect of word sense.</description>
