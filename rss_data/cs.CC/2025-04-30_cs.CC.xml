      <title>On closure properties of TotP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The class TotP consists of functions that count the number of all paths of a nondeterministic polynomial-time Turing machine. In this paper, we give a second definition of the class TotP in terms of certificates and verifiers, and present a few natural closure properties of this class. We also prove that the closure of TotP under left composition with the class FP+ is equivalent to TotP = FP+ and P = PP, and give examples of FP+-functions such that if TotP is closed under composition with them, then it is closed under composition with FP+.</description>

      <title>Improved Bounds on the Space Complexity of Circuit Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Williams (STOC 2025) recently proved that time-$t$ multitape Turing machines can be simulated using $O(\sqrt{t \log t})$ space using the Cook-Mertz (STOC 2024) tree evaluation procedure. As Williams notes, applying this result to fast algorithms for the circuit value problem implies an $O(\sqrt{s} \cdot \mathrm{polylog}\; s)$ algorithm for evaluating size $s$ circuits.
  In this work, we provide a direct reduction from circuit value to tree evaluation without passing through Turing machines, simultaneously improving the bound to $O(\sqrt{s \log s})$ space and providing a proof with fewer abstraction layers.
  This result can be thought of as a "sibling" result to Williams' for circuit complexity instead of time; in particular, using the fact that time-$t$ Turing machines have size $O(t \log t)$ circuits, we can recover a slightly weakened version of Williams' result, simulating time-$t$ machines in space $O(\sqrt{t} \log t)$.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Matrix Approximation for Neural Network Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are often constrained by their large memories and computational restrictions. In this paper, we introduce a novel adaptive-rank Singular Value Decomposition (ARSVD) that dynamically chooses the rank increase of the fully connected layers below a certain threshold in energy expenditure. Unlike conventional SVD compression methods that apply a fixed rank reduction in all layers, our ARSVD method uses energy distribution to adaptively select rank per layer while retaining accuracy. This is done for each layer in an effort to use as much energy as possible while maintaining the lowest accuracy loss. Such accuracy-adaptive approaches outperform traditional static rank reduction methods by providing an improved balance between compression and model performance. We first train a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 dataset and evaluate its performance using accuracy and F1-score. After applying ARSVD, our results demonstrate that the technique can achieve substantial model compression without compromising classification accuracy. These results illustrate the usefulness of ARSVD in computing scenarios where both computational and memory resources are scarce.</description>

      <title>List Decoding Expander-Based Codes up to Capacity in Near-Linear Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new framework based on graph regularity lemmas, for list decoding and list recovery of codes based on spectral expanders. Using existing algorithms for computing regularity decompositions of sparse graphs in (randomized) near-linear time, and appropriate choices for the constant-sized inner/base codes, we prove the following:
  - Expander-based codes constructed using the distance amplification technique of Alon, Edmonds and Luby [FOCS 1995] with rate $\rho$, can be list decoded to a radius $1 - \rho - \epsilon$ in near-linear time. By known results, the output list has size $O(1/\epsilon)$.
  - The above codes of Alon, Edmonds and Luby, with rate $\rho$, can also be list recovered to radius $1 - \rho - \epsilon$ in near-linear time, with constant-sized output lists.
  - The Tanner code construction of Sipser and Spielman [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 1996] with distance $\delta$, can be list decoded to radius $\delta - \epsilon$ in near-linear time, with constant-sized output lists.
  Our results imply novel combinatorial as well as algorithmic bounds for each of the above explicit constructions. All of these bounds are obtained via combinatorial rigidity phenomena, proved using (weak) graph regularity. The regularity framework allows us to lift the list decoding and list recovery properties for the local base codes, to the global codes obtained via the above constructions.</description>
