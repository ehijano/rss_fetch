      <title>Sensitivity Assessing to Data Volume for forecasting: introducing similarity methods as a suitable one in Feature selection methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In predictive modeling, overfitting poses a significant risk, particularly when the feature count surpasses the number of observations, a common scenario in high-dimensional data sets. To mitigate this risk, feature selection is employed to enhance model generalizability by reducing the dimensionality of the data. This study focuses on evaluating the stability of feature selection techniques with respect to varying data volumes, particularly employing time series similarity methods. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset that includes the closing, opening, high, and low prices of stocks from 100 high-income companies listed in the Fortune Global 500, this research compares several feature selection methods including variance thresholds, edit distance, and Hausdorff distance metrics. The aim is to identify methods that show minimal sensitivity to the quantity of data, ensuring robustness and reliability in predictions, which is crucial for financial forecasting. Results indicate that among the tested feature selection strategies, the variance method, edit distance, and Hausdorff methods exhibit the least sensitivity to changes in data volume. These methods therefore provide a dependable approach to reducing feature space without significantly compromising the predictive accuracy. This study not only highlights the effectiveness of time series similarity methods in feature selection but also underlines their potential in applications involving fluctuating datasets, such as financial markets or dynamic economic conditions. The findings advocate for their use as principal methods for robust feature selection in predictive analytics frameworks.</description>

      <title>A simulation-optimization framework for food supply chain network design to ensure food accessibility under uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How to ensure accessibility to food and nutrition while food supply chains suffer from demand and supply uncertainties caused by disruptive forces such as the COVID-19 pandemic and natural disasters is an emerging and critical issue. Unstable access to food influences the level of nutrition that weakens the health and well-being of citizens. Therefore, a food accessibility evaluation index is proposed in this work to quantify how well nutrition needs are met. The proposed index is then embedded in a stochastic multi-objective mixed-integer optimization problem to determine the optimal supply chain design to maximize food accessibility and minimize cost. Considering uncertainty in demand and supply, the multi-objective problem is solved in a two-phase simulation-optimization framework in which Green Field Analysis is applied to determine the long-term, tactical decisions such as supply chain configuration, and then Monte Carlo simulation is performed iteratively to determine the short-term supply chain operations by solving a stochastic programming problem. A case study is conducted on the beef supply chain in Qatar. Pareto efficient solutions are validated in discrete event simulation to evaluate the performance of the designed supply chain in various realistic scenarios and provide recommendations for different decision-makers.</description>

      <title>The Unelected Hand? Bureaucratic Influence and Electoral Accountability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What role do non-elected bureaucrats play when elections provide imperfect accountability and create incentives for pandering? We develop a model where politicians and bureaucrats interact to implement policy. Both can either be good, sharing the voters' preferences over policies, or bad, intent on enacting policies that favor private interests. Our analysis identifies the conditions under which good bureaucrats choose to support or oppose political pandering. When bureaucrats wield significant influence over policy decisions, good politicians lose their incentives to pander, a shift that ultimately benefits voters. An intermediate level of bureaucratic influence over policymaking can be voter-optimal: large enough to prevent pandering but small enough to avoid granting excessive influence to potentially bad bureaucrats.</description>

      <title>How Inductive Bias in Machine Learning Aligns with Optimality in Economic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the alignment of inductive biases in machine learning (ML) with structural models of economic dynamics. Unlike dynamical systems found in physical and life sciences, economics models are often specified by differential equations with a mixture of easy-to-enforce initial conditions and hard-to-enforce infinite horizon boundary conditions (e.g. transversality and no-ponzi-scheme conditions). Traditional methods for enforcing these constraints are computationally expensive and unstable. We investigate algorithms where those infinite horizon constraints are ignored, simply training unregularized kernel machines and neural networks to obey the differential equations. Despite the inherent underspecification of this approach, our findings reveal that the inductive biases of these ML models innately enforce the infinite-horizon conditions necessary for the well-posedness. We theoretically demonstrate that (approximate or exact) min-norm ML solutions to interpolation problems are sufficient conditions for these infinite-horizon boundary conditions in a wide class of problems. We then provide empirical evidence that deep learning and ridgeless kernel methods are not only theoretically sound with respect to economic assumptions, but may even dominate classic algorithms in low to medium dimensions. More importantly, these results give confidence that, despite solving seemingly ill-posed problems, there are reasons to trust the plethora of black-box ML algorithms used by economists to solve previously intractable, high-dimensional dynamical systems -- paving the way for future work on estimation of inverse problems with embedded optimal control problems.</description>

      <title>"Generate" the Future of Work through AI: Empirical Evidence from Online Labor Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based generative AI, such as ChatGPT, is considered the first generation of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), exhibiting zero-shot learning abilities for a wide variety of downstream tasks. Due to its general-purpose and emergent nature, its impact on labor dynamics becomes complex and difficult to anticipate. Leveraging an extensive dataset from a prominent online labor market, we uncover a post-ChatGPT decline in labor demand, supply, and transactions for submarkets pertaining to text-related and programming-related jobs, in comparison to those not directly exposed to ChatGPT's core functionalities. Meanwhile, these affected submarkets exhibit a discernible increase in the complexity of the remaining jobs and a heightened level of competition among freelancers. Intriguingly, our findings indicate that the diminution in the labor supply pertaining to programming is comparatively less pronounced, a phenomenon ascribed to the transition of freelancers previously engaged in text-related tasks now bidding for programming-related opportunities. Although the per-period job diversity freelancers apply for tends to be more limited, those who successfully navigate skill transitions from text to programming demonstrate greater resilience to ChatGPT's overall market contraction impact. As AI becomes increasingly versatile and potent, our paper offers crucial insights into AI's influence on labor markets and individuals' reactions, underscoring the necessity for proactive interventions to address the challenges and opportunities presented by this transformative technology.</description>
