      <title>Tidal Disruption of a Star on a Nearly Circular Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Roche lobe overflow (RLO) from a low-mass star on a nearly circular orbit, onto a supermassive black hole (SMBH). If mass transfer is unstable, its rate accelerates in a runaway process, resulting in highly super-Eddington mass accretion rates, accompanied by an optically-thick outflow emanating from the SMBH vicinity. This produces a week-month long, bright optical/Ultraviolet flare, accompanied by a year-decade long X-ray precursor and post-cursor emitted from the accretion flow onto the SMBH. Such ``Circular Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs)" represent a new class of nuclear transients, occurring at up to $1-10\%$ of the canonical parabolic tidal disruption event rate. Near breakup rotation and strong tidal deformation of the star prior to disruption could lead to strong magnetic fields, making circular-TDEs possible progenitors of jetted TDEs. Outflows prior to the final stellar disruption produce a circum-nuclear environment (CNM) with $\sim \rm 10^{-2} \, M_\odot$ at distances of $\sim 0.01-0.1 \, \rm pc$, likely leading to bright radio emission, and also similar to the CNM inferred for jetted TDEs. We discuss broader connections between circular TDEs and other recently identified classes of transients associated with galactic nuclei, such as repeating-TDEs and Quasi-Periodic X-ray Eruptions, as well as possible connections to luminous fast blue optical transients such as AT2018cow. We also discuss observational signatures of the analogous RLO of a white dwarf around an intermediate mass BH, which may be a multi-messenger source in the LISA era.</description>

      <title>The restless population of bright X-ray sources of NCG 3621</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the multi-year evolution of the population of X-ray sources in the nuclear region of NGC 3621 based on Chandra, XMM-Newton and Swift observations. Among these, two sources, X1 and X5, after their first detection in 2008, seem to have faded below the detectability threshold, a most interesting fact as X1 is associated with the AGN of the galaxy. Two other sources, X3 and X6 are presented for the first time, the former showing a peculiar short-term variability in the latest available dataset, suggesting an egress from eclipse, hence belonging to the handful of known eclipsing ultra-luminous X-ray sources. One source, X4, previously known for its "heart-beat", i.e. a characteristic modulation in its signal with a period of $\approx1$ h, shows a steady behaviour in the latest observation. Finally, the brightest X-ray source in NGC 3621, here labelled X2, shows steady levels of flux across all the available datasets but a change in its spectral shape, reminiscent of the behaviours of Galactic disk-fed X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>Neutron star mountains supported by crustal lattice pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin frequencies of neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries may be limited by the emission of gravitational waves. A candidate for producing such steady emission is a mass asymmetry, or "mountain", sourced by temperature asymmetries in the star's crust. A number of studies have examined temperature-induced shifts in the crustal capture layers between one nuclear species and another to produce this asymmetry, with the presence of capture layers in the deep crust being needed to produce the required mass asymmetries. However, modern equation of state calculations cast doubt on the existence of such deep capture layers. Motivated by this, we investigated an alternative source of temperature dependence in the equation of state, coming from the pressure supplied by the solid crustal lattice itself. We show that temperature-induced perturbations in this pressure, while small, may be significant. We therefore advocate for more detailed calculations, self-consistently calculating both the temperature asymmetries, the perturbations in crustal lattice pressure, and the consequent mass asymmetries, to establish if this is a viable mechanism for explaining the observed distribution of low-mass X-ray binary spin frequencies. Furthermore, the crustal lattice pressure mechanism does not require accretion, extending the possibility for such thermoelastic mountains to include both accreting and isolated neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Super-Eddington Magnetized Neutron Star Accretion Flows: a Self-similar Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of super-Eddington accretion disks exhibit substantial distinctions from the sub- Eddington ones. In this paper, we investigate the accretion process of a magnetized neutron star (NS) surrounded by a super-Eddington disk. By constructing self-similar solutions for the disk structure, we study in detail an interaction between the NS magnetosphere and the inner region of the disk, revealing that this interaction takes place within a thin boundary layer. The magnetosphere truncation radius is found to be approximately proportional to the Alfv\'en radius, with a coefficient ranging between 0.34-0.71, influenced by the advection and twisting of a magnetic field, NS rotation, and radiation emitted from an NS accretion column. Under super-Eddington accretion, the NS can readily spin up to become a rapid rotator. The proposed model can be employed to explore the accretion and evolution of NSs in diverse astrophysical contexts, such as ultraluminous X-ray binaries or active galactic nucleus disks.</description>

      <title>Fast X-ray/IR observations of the black hole transient Swift~J1753.5--0127: from an IR lead to a very long jet lag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on two epochs of simultaneous near-infrared (IR) and X-ray observations with a sub-second time resolution of the low mass X-ray binary black hole candidate Swift J1753.5--0127 during its long 2005--2016 outburst. Data were collected strictly simultaneously with VLT/ISAAC (K$_{S}$ band, 2.2 $\mu m$) and RXTE (2-15 keV) or \textit{XMM-Newton} (0.7-10 keV). A clear correlation between the X-ray and the IR variable emission is found during both epochs but with very different properties. In the first epoch, the near-IR variability leads the X-ray by $ \sim 130 \, ms$. This is the opposite of what is usually observed in similar systems. The correlation is more complex in the second epoch, with both anti-correlation and correlations at negative and positive lags. Frequency-resolved Fourier analysis allows us to identify two main components in the complex structure of the phase lags: the first component, characterised by a few seconds near-IR lag at low frequencies, is consistent with a combination of disc reprocessing and a magnetised hot flow; the second component is identified at high frequencies by a near-IR lag of $\approx$0.7 s. Given the similarities of this second component with the well-known constant optical/near-IR jet lag observed in other black hole transients, we tentatively interpret this feature as a signature of a longer-than-usual jet lag. We discuss the possible implications of measuring such a long jet lag in a radio-quiet black hole transient.</description>

      <title>Formation of Wind-Fed Black Hole High-mass X-ray Binaries: The Role of Roche-lobe-Overflow Post Black-Hole Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The three dynamically confirmed wind-fed black hole high-mass X-ray binaries (BH-HMXBs) are suggested to all contain a highly spinning black hole (BH). However, based on the theories of efficient angular momentum transport inside the stars, we expect that the first-born BHs in binary systems should have low spins, which is consistent with gravitational-wave observations. As a result, the origin of the high BH spins measured in wind-fed BH-HMXBs remains a mystery. In this paper, we conduct a binary population synthesis study on wind-fed BH-HMXBs at solar metallicity with the use of the newly developed code POSYDON, considering three scenarios for BH accretion: Eddington-limited, moderately super-Eddington, and fully conservative accretion. Taking into account the conditions for accretion-disk formation, we find that regardless of the accretion model, these systems are more likely to have already experienced a phase of Roche-lobe overflow after the BH formation. To account for the extreme BH spins, highly conservative accretion onto BHs is required, when assuming the accreted material carries the specific angular momentum at the innermost stable orbit. Besides, in our simulations we found that the systems with donor stars within the mass range of $10-20\,M_{\odot}$ are prevalent, posing a challenge in explaining simultaneously all observed properties of the BH-HMXB in our Galaxy, Cygnus X-1, and potentially hinting that the accretion efficiency onto non-degenerate stars, before the formation of the BH, is also more conservative than assumed in our simulations.</description>

      <title>Spectro-photometric follow up of the outbursting AM CVn system ASASSN-21br</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on spectroscopic and photometric observations of the AM CVn system ASASSN-21br, which was discovered in outburst by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae in February 2021. The outburst lasted for around three weeks, and exhibited a pronounced brightness dip for $\approx$ 4 days, during which the spectra showed a sudden transition from emission- to absorption-line dominated. Only $\approx$ 60 AM CVn systems with derived orbital periods are found in the Galaxy, therefore increasing the sample of AM CVn systems with known orbital periods is of tremendous importance to (1) constrain the physical mechanisms of their outbursts and (2) establish a better understanding of the low-frequency background noise of future gravitational wave surveys. Time-resolved photometry taken during the outburst of ASASSN-21br showed modulation with a period of around 36.65 minutes, which is likely the superhump or orbital period of the system. Time-resolved spectroscopy taken with the Southern African Large Telescope did not show any sign of periodicity in the He I absorption lines. This is possibly due to the origin of these lines in the outbursting accretion disc, which makes it challenging to retrieve periodicity from the spectral lines. Future follow up spectral observations during quiescence might allow us better constrain the orbital period of ASASSN-21br.</description>

      <title>Prospects for the detection of very-high-energy pulsars with LHAASO and SWGO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsations from the Crab pulsar have been detected by the MAGIC telescopes at energies up to 1.5 TeV, and the pulsed emission from the Vela pulsar was detected by H.E.S.S., reaching tens of TeV. These discoveries, along with the proposed additional emission due to inverse Compton scattering at TeV energies, lead us to consider suitable candidates for detection with current and future extensive air show (EAS) experiments at very-high-energy (VHE; 0.1 $-$ 100 TeV) ranges. Leveraging energy spectrum data from pulsars as observed by Fermi and Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) and considering the sensitivities of both LHAASO and SWGO, this study evaluates their detectability and estimates the time required for their significant detection. Our results indicate that LHAASO could detect the Crab's pulsed signal within six years, while SWGO might detect Vela's signal within one year. Observations of the most energetic Fermi pulsars with EAS experiments will provide insight into the nature of VHE pulsar emissions, helping to clarify the primary characteristics of VHE pulsars.</description>

      <title>The Magnificent Seven X-ray Isolated Neutron Stars Revisited. I. Improved Timing Solutions and Pulse Profile Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first systematic X-ray pulse timing analysis of the six members of the so-called "Magnificent Seven" nearby thermally-emitting isolated neutron stars (XINS) with detected pulsations. Using the extensive collection of archival XMM-Newton, Chandra, and NICER observations spanning over two decades, we obtain the first firm measurement of the spin-down rate for RX J2143.0+0654, while for the rest we improve upon previously published spin ephemerides and extend them by up to an additional decade. Five of the XINS follow steady spin-down with no indication of major anomalies in their long-term timing behavior; the notable exception is RX J0720.4-3125, for which, in addition to confirming the previously identified glitch, we detect a second spin derivative. The high quality folded X-ray pulse profiles produced with the updated timing solutions exhibit diverse and complex morphologies, as well as striking energy dependence. These peculiarities cannot be readily explained by blackbody-like isotropic emission and simple hot spot configurations, hinting at the presence of complex multi-temperature surface heat distributions and highly anisotropic radiation patterns, such as may arise from a strongly magnetized atmospheric layer.</description>

      <title>X-ray Observations of Two Type Ia Supernovae with an H$\alpha$ Line in their Optical Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on Chandra X-ray observations of SN 2016jae and SN 2018cqj, both low luminosity Type Ia supernova that showed the presence of a H line in their early optical spectrum. No X-ray emission is detected at the location of either SN. Upper limits to the luminosity of up to 2 $\times 10^{40}\,$ erg s$^{-1}$ are calculated for each SN, depending on the assumed spectral model, temperature and column density. This luminosity is comparable to that of another low-luminosity Type Ia SN, SN 2018fhw, that was observed with Chandra. It is generally lower than upper limits calculated for Type Ia-CSM SNe observed in X-rays, and also below that of SN 2012ca, the only Type Ia-CSM SN to have been detected in X-rays. Comparisons are made to other Type Ia SN with a H line observed in X-rays. The observations suggest that while the density into which the SN is expanding may have been high at the time the H$\alpha$ line was detected, it had decreased considerably by the time of X-ray observations.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the energy spectrum of the diffuse cosmic neutrino flux from the ANTARES neutrino telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-significance evidences of the existence of a high-energy diffuse flux of cosmic neutrinos have emerged in the last decade from several observations by the IceCube Collaboration. The ANTARES neutrino telescope took data for 15 years in the Mediterranean Sea, from 2007 to 2022, and collected a high-purity all-flavour neutrino sample. The search for a diffuse cosmic neutrino signal using this dataset is presented in this article. This final analysis did not provide a statistically significant observation of the cosmic diffuse flux: this is converted into limits on the properties of the cosmic neutrino spectrum. In particular, given the sensitivity of the ANTARES neutrino telescope between 1 and 50 TeV, constraints on single-power-law hypotheses are derived for the cosmic diffuse flux below 20 TeV.</description>

      <title>Particle acceleration at the bow shock of runaway star LS 2355: non-thermal radio emission but no $\gamma$-ray counterpart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars that travel at supersonic speeds can create bow shocks as their stellar winds interact with the surrounding interstellar medium. These bow shocks - prominent sites for mechanical feedback of individual massive stars - are predominantly observed in the infrared band. Confirmed high-energy emission from stellar bow shocks has remained elusive and confirmed radio counterparts, while rising in recent years, remain rare. Here, we present an in-depth multi-wavelength exploration of the bow shock driven by LS 2355, focusing on its non-thermal properties. Using the most-recent Fermi source catalogue, we rule out its previously-proposed association with an unidentified $\gamma$-ray source. Furthermore, we use deep ASKAP observations from the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey and the Evolutionary Map of the Universe survey to identify a non-thermal radio counterpart: the third spectrally confirmed non-thermal bow shock counterpart after BD +43$^{\rm o}$ 3654 and BD +60$^{\rm o}$ 2522. We finally use WISE IR data and Gaia to study the surrounding ISM and update the motion of LS 2355. Specifically, we derive a substantially reduced stellar velocity, $v_* = 7.0\pm2.5$ km/s, compared to previous estimates. The observed non-thermal properties of the bow shock can be explained by an interaction between the wind of LS 2355 and a dense HII region, at a magnetic field close to the maximum magnetic field strength allowed by the compressibility of the ISM. Similar to earlier works, we find that the thermal radio emission of the shocked ISM is likely to be substantially suppressed for it to be consistent with the observed radio spectrum.</description>

Abstract: Powerful supermassive black hole (SMBH) winds in the form of ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) are detected in the X-ray spectra of several active galactic nuclei (AGN) seemingly independently of their radio classification between radio quiet (RQ) and radio loud (RL). In this work we explore the physical parameters of SMBH winds through a uniform analysis of a sample of X-ray bright RQ and RL AGN. We explored several correlations between different wind parameters and with respect to the AGN bolometric and Eddington luminosities. Our analysis shows that SMBH winds are not only a common trait of both AGN classes but also that they are most likely produced by the same physical mechanism. Consequently, we find that SMBH winds do not follow the radio-loudness dichotomy seen in jets. On average, a comparable amount of material accreted by the SMBH is ejected through such winds. The average wind power corresponds to about 3 per cent of the Eddington luminosity, confirming that they can drive AGN feedback. Moreover, the most energetic outflows are found in the most luminous sources. We find a possible positive correlation of the wind energetics, renormalized to the Eddington limit, with respect to $\lambda_{Edd}$, consistent with the correlation found with bolometric luminosity. We also observe a possible positive correlation between the energetics of the outflow and the X-ray radio-loudness parameter. In general, these results suggest an underlying relation between the acceleration mechanisms of accretion disc winds and jets.</description>

      <title>Evidence for particle acceleration approaching PeV energies in the W51 complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\gamma$-ray emission from the W51 complex is widely acknowledged to be attributed to the interaction between the cosmic rays (CRs) accelerated by the shock of supernova remnant (SNR) W51C and the dense molecular clouds in the adjacent star-forming region, W51B. However, the maximum acceleration capability of W51C for CRs remains elusive. Based on observations conducted with the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), we report a significant detection of $\gamma$ rays emanating from the W51 complex, with energies from 2 TeV to 200 TeV. The LHAASO measurements, for the first time, extend the $\gamma$-ray emission from the W51 complex beyond 100 TeV and reveal a significant spectrum bending at tens of TeV. By combining the ``$\pi^0$-decay bump" featured data from Fermi-LAT, the broadband $\gamma$-ray spectrum of the W51 region can be well-characterized by a simple pp-collision model. The observed spectral bending feature suggests an exponential cutoff at $\sim400$~TeV or a power-law break at $\sim200$~TeV in the CR proton spectrum, most likely providing the first evidence of SNRs serving as CR accelerators approaching the PeV regime. Additionally, two young star clusters within W51B could also be theoretically viable to produce the most energetic $\gamma$ rays observed by LHAASO. Our findings strongly support the presence of extreme CR accelerators within the W51 complex and provide new insights into the origin of Galactic CRs.</description>

      <title>GRB 221009A/SN 2022xiw: A Supernova Obscured by a Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglow?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present optical photometry for the afterglow of GRB 221009A, in some respects the most extraordinary gamma-ray burst (GRB) ever observed. Good quality in the R-band light curve is obtained, covering 0.32-19.57 days since the Fermi-GBM trigger. We find that a weak bump emerges fromthe declining afterglow at $t \approx 11$ days; a supernova (SN) may be responsible. We use a smooth broken power-law and $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ model to fit the light curve. The best-fitting results reveal that the SN ejected a total mass of $M_\mathrm{ej} = 3.70 M_\odot$, a $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ mass of $M_\mathrm{Ni} = 0.23 M_\odot$, and a kinetic energy of $E_\mathrm{SN,K} = 2.35 \times 10^{52} \mathrm{erg}$. We also compare GRB 221009A with other GRB-SN events based on a GRB-associated SN sample, and find that only SN 2003lw and SN 2011kl can be obviously revealed in the afterglow of GRB 221009A by setting these objects at its distance. This suggests that a supernova (SN 2022xiw) is possibly obscured by the brighter afterglow emission from GRB 221009A.</description>

      <title>Unveiling frequency-dependent eclipsing in spider millisecond pulsars using broadband polarization observations with the Parkes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an orbital phase-dependent analysis of three black widow spider millisecond pulsars (BW MSPs), aiming to investigate the magnetic field within the eclipse environment. The ultra-wide-bandwidth low-frequency receiver (UWL) of the Parkes 'Murriyang' radio telescope is utilised for full polarisation observations covering frequencies from 704-4032 MHz. Depolarisation of pulsed emission is observed during the eclipse phase of three BW MSPs namely, J0024-7204J, J1431-4715 and PSR J1959+2048, consistent with previous studies of other BW MSPs. We estimated orbital phase dependent RM values for these MSPs. The wide bandwidth observations also provided the constraints on eclipse cutoff frequency for these BW MSPs. For PSR J0024-7204J, we report temporal variation of the eclipse cutoff frequency coupled with changes in the electron column density within the eclipse medium across six observed eclipses. Moreover, the eclipse cutoff frequency for PSR J1431-4715 is determined to be 1251 $\pm$ 80 MHz, leading to the conclusion that synchrotron absorption is the primary mechanism responsible for the eclipsing. Additionally, for PSR J1959+2048, the estimated cutoff frequency exceeded 1400 MHz, consistent with previous studies. With this investigation, we have doubled the sample size of BW MSPs with orbital phase-resolved studies allowing a better probe to the eclipse environment.</description>

      <title>Flaires: A Comprehensive Catalog of Dust-Echo-like Infrared Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Observations of transient emission from extreme accretion events onto supermassive black holes can reveal conditions in the center of galaxies and the black hole itself. Most recently, they have been suggested to be emitters of high-energy neutrinos. If it is suddenly rejuvenated accretion or a tidal disruption event (TDE) is not clear in most cases. Aims: We expanded on existing samples of infrared flares to compile the largest and most complete list available. A large sample size is necessary to provide high enough statistics for far away and faint objects to estimate their rate. Our catalog is large enough to facilitate a preliminary study of the rate evolution with redshift for the first time. Methods: We compiled a sample of 40 million galaxies, and, using a custom, publicly available pipeline, analyzed the WISE light curves for these 40 million objects using the Bayesian Blocks algorithm. We selected promising candidates for dust echos of transient accretion events and inferred the luminosity, extension, and temperature of the hot dust by fitting a blackbody spectrum. Results: We established a clean sample of 823 dust-echo-like infrared flares, of which we can estimate the dust properties for 568. After removing 70 objects with possible contribution by synchrotron emission, the luminosity, extension, and temperature are consistent with dust echos. Estimating the dust extension from the light curve shape revealed that the duration of the incident flare is broadly compatible with the duration of TDEs. The resulting rate per galaxy is consistent with the latest measurements of infrared-detected TDEs and appears to decline at increasing redshift. Conclusions: Although systematic uncertainties may impact the calculation of the rate evolution, this catalog will enable further research in phenomena related to dust-echos from TDEs and extreme accretion flares.</description>

      <title>Search for MeV Gamma-ray emission from TeV bright red dwarfs with COMPTEL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SHALON atmospheric Cherenkov telescope has detected very high energy gamma-ray emission at TeV energies from eight red dwarfs, namely, V388 Cas, V547 Cas, V780 Tau, V962 Tau, V1589 Cyg, GJ 1078, GJ 3684 and GL 851.1. Consequently, these red dwarfs have been suggested as sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. In this work, we search for soft gamma-ray emission from these TeV bright red dwarfs between 0.75-30 MeV using archival data from the COMPTEL gamma-ray imaging telescope, as a follow-up to a similar search for GeV gamma-ray emission using the Fermi-LAT telescope. Although, prima-facie, we detect non-zero photon flux from three red dwarfs with high significance, these signals can attributed to contamination from nearby sources such as Crab and Cygnus, which are within the angular resolution of COMPTEL, and have been previously detected as very bright point sources at MeV energies. Therefore, we could not detect any statistically significant signal ($&gt;3\sigma$) from any of these eight red dwarfs from 0.75-30 MeV. We then report the 95% confidence level upper limits on the differential photon flux (at 30 MeV), integral photon flux and integral energy flux for all of the eight red dwarfs. The integral energy flux limits range between $10^{-11}-10^{-10} \rm{ergs/cm^2/s}$.</description>

      <title>Energetic particles and high-energy processes in cosmological filaments and their astronomical implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale cosmic filaments connect galaxies, clusters and voids. They are permeated by magnetic fields with a variety of topologies. Cosmic rays with energies up to $10^{20}\;\!{\rm eV}$ can be produced in astrophysical environments associated with star-formation and AGN activities. The fate of these cosmic rays in filaments, which cannot be directly observed on Earth, are rarely studied. We investigate the high-energy processes associated with energetic particles (cosmic rays) in filaments, adopting an ecological approach that includes galaxies, clusters/superclusters and voids as key cosmological structures in the filament ecosystem. We derive the phenomenology for modelling interfaces between filaments and these structures, and investigate how the transfer and fate of energetic cosmic ray protons are affected by the magnetism of the interfaces. We consider different magnetic field configurations in filaments and assess the implications for cosmic ray confinement and survival against hadronic pion-producing and photo-pair interactions. Our analysis shows that the fate of the particles depends on the location of their origin within a filament ecosystem, and that filaments act as `highways', channelling cosmic rays between galaxies, galaxy clusters and superclusters. Filaments can also operate as cosmic `fly paper', capturing cosmic ray protons with energies up to $10^{18}\;\!{\rm eV}$ from cosmic voids. Our analysis predicts the presence of a population of $\sim 10^{12}-10^{16}\;\!{\rm eV}$ cosmic ray protons in filaments and voids accumulated continually over cosmic time. These protons do not suffer significant energy losses through photo-pair or pion-production, nor can they be cooled efficiently. Instead, they form a cosmic ray fossil record of the power generation history of the Universe.</description>

Abstract: The search for rotating radio transients (RRAT) was done at a frequency of 111 MHz, in daily observations carried out on the radio telescope, a Large Phased Array (LPA) at declinations -9o &lt; decj &lt; +42o. 19 new RRATs were discovered for dispersion measures (DM) from 2.5 to 72.6 pc cm^{-3}. Estimates of the periods were obtained for three RRATs. Two of them (J0408+28; J0440+35) are located at distances of 134 and 136 pc from Sun and are among the closest of all known RRATs.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric signal separation in very-high-energy gamma ray observations with probabilistic neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An intriguing challenge in observational astronomy is the separation signals in areas where multiple signals intersect. A typical instance of this in very-high-energy (VHE, E$\gtrsim$100 GeV) gamma-ray astronomy is the issue of residual background in observations. This background arises when cosmic-ray protons are mistakenly identified as gamma-rays from sources of interest, thereby blending with signals from astrophysical sources of interest. We introduce a deep ensemble approach to determine a non-parametric estimation of source and background signals in VHE gamma observations, as well as a likelihood-derived epistemic uncertainty on these estimations. We rely on minimal assumptions, exploiting the separability of space and energy components in the signals, and defining a small region in coordinate space where the source signal is assumed to be negligible compared to background signal. The model is applied both on mock observations, including a simple toy case and a realistic simulation of dark matter annihilation in the Galactic center, as well as true observations from the public H.E.S.S. data release, specifically datasets of the Crab nebula and the pulsar wind nebula MSH 15-52. Our method performs well in mock cases, where the ground truth is known, and compares favorably against conventional physical analysis approaches when applied to true observations. In the case of the mock dark matter signal in the Galactic center, our work opens new avenues for component separation in this complex region of the VHE sky.</description>

      <title>Probing the connection between IceCube neutrinos and MOJAVE AGN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are prime candidate sources of the high-energy, astrophysical neutrinos detected by IceCube. This is demonstrated by the real-time multi-messenger detection of the blazar TXS 0506+056 and the recent evidence of neutrino emission from NGC 1068 from a separate time-averaged study. However, the production mechanism of the astrophysical neutrinos in AGN is not well established which can be resolved via correlation studies with photon observations. For neutrinos produced due to photohadronic interactions in AGN, in addition to a correlation of neutrinos with high-energy photons, there would also be a correlation of neutrinos with photons emitted at radio wavelengths. In this work, we perform an in-depth stacking study of the correlation between 15 GHz radio observations of AGN reported in the MOJAVE XV catalog, and ten years of neutrino data from IceCube. We also use a time-dependent approach which improves the statistical power of the stacking analysis. No significant correlation was found for both analyses and upper limits are reported. When compared to the IceCube diffuse flux, at 100 TeV and for a spectral index of 2.5, the upper limits derived are $\sim3\%$ and $\sim9\%$ for the time-averaged and time-dependent case, respectively.</description>

      <title>3U Transat: a cubesat constellation to boost the multi-messenger astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to the advent of sensitive gravitational wave (GW) and neutrino detectors, multi-messenger (MM) astronomy will deeply transform our understanding of the Universe contents and evolution over cosmological times. To fully exploit the forthcoming GW and neutrino discoveries, it is crucial to detect as many electromagnetic (EM) counterparts as possible, but up to now, only one event has been detected by both GW detectors (Ligo/Virgo) and electromagnetic detectors (Fermi/GBM (Gamma ray Burst Monitor) and Integral), the short gamma-ray burst GRB 170817A/GW 170817 associated with the merger of a binary neutron star. To help improving the rate of joint MM events, it is crucial for the EM detectors in particular at high-energy in space to observe all the sky with a decent sensitivity. To do so, we propose the development of 3U Transat (TRANsient sky SATellites) project. 3U Transat is a constellation of nano-satellites offering a full sky coverage with a limited investment. The goal of this article is to present the 3U Transat project and its main scientific drivers as well as its current status. We will also describe our dynamic simulator used to optimise the scientific performances of the constellation. We will show highlights of the expected performances in term of detection and localisation capabilities as a function of the number of satellites in the constellation.</description>

      <title>New Radiative and Collisional Atomic Data for Sr {\sc ii} and Y {\sc ii} with application to Kilonova modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectra of singly ionised Strontium and Yttrium (Sr {\sc ii} and Y {\sc ii}) have been proposed as identifications of certain spectral features in the AT2017gfo spectrum. With the growing demand for NLTE simulations of Kilonovae, there is a increasing need for atomic data for these and other $r$-process elements. Our goal is to expand upon the current set of atomic data for $r$-process elements, by presenting transition probabilities and Maxwellian-averaged effective collision strengths for Sr {\sc ii} and Y {\sc ii}. The Breit-Pauli and DARC $R$-matrix codes are employed to calculate the appropriate collision strengths, which are thermally averaged according to a Maxwellian distribution to calculate excitation and de-excitation rates. The {\sc tardis} and {\sc ColRadPy} packages are subsequently used to perform LTE and NLTE modelling respectively. A complete set of transition probabilities and effective collision strengths involving levels for Sr {\sc ii} and Y {\sc ii} have been calculated for temperature ranges compatible with kilonova plasma conditions. Forbidden transitions were found to disagree heavily with the Axelrod approximation, an approximation which is currently employed by other models within the literature. Theoretically important spectral lines are identified with both LTE and NLTE modelling codes. LTE simulations in {\sc tardis} reveal no new significant changes to the full synthetic spectra. NLTE simulations in {\sc ColRadPy} provide indications of which features are expected to be strong for a range of regimes, and we include luminosity estimates. Synthetic emission spectra over KNe densities and temperatures reveal potentially interesting spectral lines in the NIR.</description>

      <title>Detection, sky localization and early warning for binary neutron star mergers by detectors located in China of different configurations in third generation detector network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work shows the results of an evaluation of the impact that a detector located in China, with a noise budget comparable to that of a proposed high-frequency detector with a 20 km arm length, an Einstein Telescope (ET) or a Cosmic Explorer (CE), could have on the network of ET-CE in terms of detection rate, localization, and providing early warning alert for simulated binary neutron star (BNS)s. The results indicate that a three-detector network including a Chinese detector could identify at least 4.4% more BNS mergers than an ET-CE network alone. The localization uncertainty could be reduced by a factor of more than 5 on average compared to the ET-CE network. With a three-detector network involving a Chinese detector, up to 89% of BNS mergers could be located within 10 square degrees of the sky 10 minutes prior to the merger. The assessment suggests that the potential for early warning signals is highest when the Chinese detector is similar to ET, whereas the sources are detected with the highest signal-to-noise ratio and localized to the smallest regions when the detector is more akin to CE. Interestingly, the C20N network (comprising ET+CE+C20) can achieve comparable localization performance as the ET network while outperforming the ETCN network (featuring the ET+CE+ an ET-like detector in China) in terms of detection capabilities, especially at large distances, indicating that adding a 20 km kilohertz detector in China to ET-CE network would make significant contributions at least as adding an ET-like detector in China to multi-messenger astronomy for almost all BNS observations.</description>

      <title>Multi-Phase Thermal Structure &amp; The Origin of the Broad-Line Region, Torus, and Corona in Magnetically-Dominated Accretion Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent simulations have demonstrated the formation of 'flux-frozen' and hyper-magnetized disks, qualitatively distinct from both classical $\alpha$ disks and magnetically-arrested disks, as a natural consequence of fueling gas to supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei. We previously showed that the dynamical structure of said disks can be approximated by simple analytic similarity models. Here we study the thermal properties of these models over a wide range of physical scales and accretion rates. We show there are several characteristic zones: a dusty 'torus'-like region, a multi-phase neutral and then multi-phase ionized, broad line-emitting region interior to the sublimation radius, before finally a transition to a thermal accretion disk with a warm Comptonizing layer. The disks are strongly-flared with large scale heights, and reprocess and/or scatter an order-one fraction of the central disk emission. As a result, this simple accretion disk model predicts phenomena including the existence of a dusty torus and its covering factor, geometry, clumpiness, and dust temperatures; a broad-line-region (BLR) with its characteristic sizes and luminosities and ionization properties; extended scattering/reprocessing surfaces producing cooler disk continuum and apparently large observed disk sizes; and existence of warm Comptonizing layers and hard coronal gas. Remarkably, these properties emerge without our having to introduce new components or parameters: they are all part of the accretion flow if the disks are in the hyper-magnetized limit.</description>

      <title>Estimating the possible QPOs of M87* from the parameters of a hairy Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the dynamics of the shock cone formed around the hairy Kerr black hole due to BHL accretion and investigate the QPO behaviors resulting from the black hole-cone interaction, aiming to predict the QPO frequencies that may occur around the M87* black hole. To achieve this, we use the hairy Kerr black hole parameters consistent with the observed shadow parameters of M87* as initial conditions in numerical simulations, revealing the structure of the resulting shock cone and QPOs in a strong gravitational field. Numerical calculations show that the deviation of the hairy Kerr black hole from the Kerr metric and the hair parameters significantly influence the complex behavior of the resulting QPOs. It is found that the Lense-Thirring effect and the pressure modes trapped within the cone lead to the excitation of QPOs. The hair parameter has been observed to suppress the resulting QPO frequencies. The Lense-Thirring effect, in a strong gravitational field with a black hole spin parameter of a/M &gt; 0.7, also suppresses other modes and generates high-frequency QPOs. It is predicted that the QPO frequencies observed around the M87* black hole could span a wide range from nHz to mHz. Using both Kerr and hairy Kerr gravities, the QPO frequencies formed around the M87* black hole can be explained. Especially in cases where the black hole is spinning rapidly, PSD analyses have shown very distinct low-frequency QPOs and resonance conditions in both gravities. By comparing the results obtained from numerical calculations with observational and analytical results, we discuss the observability of the QPO frequencies that may occur around the M87* black hole.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Parameter Inference on Accreting White Dwarf Binaries using Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accreting binary white dwarf systems are among the sources expected to emanate gravitational waves that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect. We investigate how accurately the binary parameters may be measured from LISA observations. We complement previous studies by performing our parameter estimation on binaries containing a low-mass donor with a thick, hydrogen-rich envelope. The evolution is followed from the early, pre-period minimum stage, in which the donor is non-degenerate, to a later, post-period minimum stage with a largely degenerate donor. We present expressions for the gravitational wave amplitude, frequency, and frequency derivative in terms of white dwarf parameters (masses, donor radius, etc.), where binary evolution is driven by gravitational wave radiation and accretion torques, and the donor radius and logarithmic change in radius ($\eta_{\rm d}$) due to mass loss are treated as model parameters. We then perform a Fisher analysis to reveal the accuracy of parameter measurements, using models from Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) to estimate realistic fiducial values at which we evaluate the measurement errors. We find that the donor radius can be measured relatively well with LISA observations alone, while we can further measure the individual masses if we have an independent measurement of the luminosity distance from electromagnetic observations. When applied to the parameters of the recently-discovered white dwarf binary ZTF J0127+5258, our Fisher analysis suggests that we will be able to constrain the system's individual masses and donor radius using LISA's observations, given ZTF's measurement of the luminosity distance.</description>

      <title>Chandra X-ray Observations of PSR J1849-0001, its Pulsar Wind Nebula, and the TeV Source HESS J1849-000</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtained a 108 ks Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO) observation of PSR J1849-0001 and its pulsar wind nebula (PWN), coincident with the TeV source HESS J1849-000. By analyzing the new and archival CXO data, we resolved the pulsar from the PWN, explored the PWN morphology on arcsecond and arcminute scales, and measured the spectra of different regions of the PWN. Both the pulsar and the compact inner PWN spectra are hard with power-law photon indices of $1.20 \pm 0.07$ and $1.49 \pm 0.20$, respectively. The jet-dominiated PWN has a relatively low luminosity, lack of gamma-ray pulsations, relatively hard and nonthermal spectrum of the pulsar, and sine-like pulse profile, which indicates a relatively small angle between the pulsar's spin and magnetic dipole axis. In this respect, it shares similar properties with a few other so-called MeV pulsars. Although the joint X-ray and TeV spectral energy distribution can be roughly described by a single-zone model, the obtained magnetic field value is unrealistically low. A more realistic scenario is the presence of a relic PWN, no longer emitting synchrotron X-rays but still radiating in TeV via inverse-Compton upscattering. We calso serendipitously detected surprisingly bright X-ray emission from a very wide binary whose components should not be interacting.</description>

Abstract: Observations of the high-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by the hot and massive remnant of a binary neutron star merger will provide new probes of the dense-matter equation of state (EoS). We show that current uncertainties in the thermal physics can cause the emergent GW spectum to differ by a degree comparable to changing the cold EoS by $\pm\sim120$ m in the characteristic radius of a neutron star. Unless a very close binary neutron star merger takes place, these effects are unlikely to be measurable with current GW detectors. However, with proposed next-generation detectors such as Cosmic Explorer or Einstein Telescope, the effects can be distinguished for events at distances of up to ~80-200 Mpc, if the cold EoS is sufficiently well constrained.</description>

      <title>Gray Two-moment Neutrino Transport: Comprehensive Tests and Improvements for Supernova Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we extended an energy-integrated neutrino transport method to facilitate efficient, yet precise, modeling of compact astrophysical objects. We particularly focus on core-collapse supernovae. We implemented a gray neutrino-transport framework from the literature into FLASH and performed a detailed evaluation of its accuracy in core-collapse supernova simulations. Based on comparisons with results from simulations using energy-dependent neutrino transport, we incorporated several improvements to the original scheme. Our analysis shows that our gray neutrino transport method successfully reproduces key aspects from more complex energy-dependent transport across a variety of progenitors and equations of state. We find both qualitative and reasonable quantitative agreement with multi-group M1 transport simulations. However, the gray scheme tends to slightly favor shock revival. In terms of gravitational wave and neutrino signals, there is a good alignment with the energy-dependent transport, although we find 15-30% discrepancies in the average energy and luminosity of heavy-lepton neutrinos. Simulations using the gray transport are around four times faster than those using energy-dependent transport.</description>

      <title>Repeating Nuclear Transients as Candidate Electromagnetic Counterparts of LISA Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are one of the primary targets for the recently adopted millihertz gravitational-wave (GW) observatory LISA. Some previous studies have argued that a fraction of all EMRIs form in matter-rich environments, and can potentially explain the dozens of soft X-ray band ($\sim 10^{-1} \rm keV$), low-frequency ($\sim 0.1$ mHz) periodic phenomena known as quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). Here, using a representative EMRI population retrofitted with cutoffs on LISA-band SNRs and luminosity distances to account for the sensitivity of current instruments, we estimate the mean frequency band in which QPEs and QPOs originating from detectable LISA EMRIs may be emitting an X-ray signal ``today'' (i.e., in 2024) to be $0.46 \pm 0.22$ mHz. We also model the well-known QPO source, RE J1034+396, which falls in this frequency band, as an EMRI assuming its primary black hole mass to be $10^6-10^7 M_\odot$. Through a prior-predictive analysis, we estimate the orbiting compact object's mass to be $46^{+ 10}_{-40} M_\odot$ and the source's LISA-band SNR as $\approx 14$, highlighting it as a candidate multi-messenger EMRI target. We also highlight the role of current and near-future X-ray and UV observatories in enabling multi-messenger observations of EMRIs in conjunction with LISA, and conclude with a discussion of caveats of the current analysis, such as the exclusion of eccentricity and inclination from the model, and the measurability of sub-solar mass compact object EMRIs.</description>

      <title>Choked precessing jets in tidal disruption events and high-energy neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been suggested that relativistic jets might have been commonly formed in tidal disruption events (TDEs), but those with relatively weak power could be choked by the surrounding envelope. The discovery of high-energy neutrinos possibly associated with some normal TDEs may support this picture in the hypothesis that the neutrinos are produced by choked jets. Recently, it was noted that disrupted stars generally have misaligned orbits with respect to the supermassive black hole spin axis and highly misaligned precessing jets are more likely to be choked. Here we revisit the jet break-out condition for misaligned precessing jets by considering the jet could be collimated by the cocoon pressure while propagating in the disk wind envelope. The jet head opening angle decreases as the jet propagates in the envelope, but the minimum power of a successful jet remains unchanged in terms of the physical jet power. We further calculate the neutrino flux from choked precessing jets, assuming that the cocoon energy does not exceed the kinetic energy of the disk wind. We find that neutrino flux from highly misaligned choked jets is sufficient to explain the neutrinos from AT2019aalc, while it is marginal to explain the neutrinos from AT2019dsg and AT2019fdr. The latter could be produced by weakly misaligned choked jets, since the duty cycle that the jet sweeps across increases as the misaligned angle decreases. We also show that the population of choked TDE jets could contribute to ~10% of the observed diffuse neutrino flux measured by IceCube.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Galactic supernova remnants and their environment in 26.6{\deg} &lt; l &lt; 30.6{\deg}, $\vert b \vert \leq$ 1.25{\deg} using radio surveys</title>

Abstract: The problem of missing Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) refers to the issue that the currently known Galactic SNRs are significantly incomplete compared to the theoretical prediction. To expand the sample of Galactic SNRs, we use GLEAM and THOR+VGPS data across four wavebands ranging from 118 to 1420 MHz to drive a spectral index map covering the region within 26.6{\deg} &lt; l &lt; 30.6{\deg}, $\vert b \vert \leq$ 1.25{\deg}, where numerous SNR candidates were recently found. By using the spectral index map of the sky region and detailed analysis of the spectral indices of individual sources, we confirmed four SNR candidates, namely G26.75+0.73, G27.06+0.04, G28.36+0.21, and G28.78$-$0.44, as SNRs. Additionally, we discovered an expanding molecular superbubble located in this region, discussed pulsars associated with SNR candidates, and discovered a long H$\alpha$ filament that spatially overlaps with the candidate G29.38+0.10. We suggest that the problem of missing Galactic SNRs not only arises from observation limitations, but also could be due to the low-density environments of some SNRs, and the different SN explosion properties.</description>

      <title>Performance of the HAWC Observatory and TeV Gamma-Ray Measurements of the Crab Nebula with Improved Extensive Air Shower Reconstruction Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Gamma-Ray Observatory located on the side of the Sierra Negra volcano in Mexico, has been fully operational since 2015. The HAWC collaboration has recently significantly improved their extensive-air-shower reconstruction algorithms, which has notably advanced the observatory performance. The energy resolution for primary gamma rays with energies below 1~TeV was improved by including a noise-suppression algorithm. Corrections have also been made to systematic errors in direction fitting related to the detector and shower plane inclinations, $\mathcal{O}(0.1^{\circ})$ biases in highly inclined showers, as well as enhancements to the core reconstruction. The angular resolution for gamma rays approaching the HAWC array from large zenith angles ($&gt; 37^{\circ}$) has improved by a factor of four at the highest energies ($&gt; 70$~TeV) as compared to previous reconstructions. The inclusion of a lateral distribution function fit to the extensive air shower footprint on the array to separate gamma-ray primaries from cosmic-ray ones, based on the resulting $\chi^{2}$ values, improved the background rejection performance at all inclinations. At large zenith angles, the improvement in significance is a factor of four compared to previous HAWC publications. These enhancements have been verified by observing the Crab Nebula, which is an overhead source for the HAWC Observatory. We show that the sensitivity to Crab-like point sources ($E^{-2.63}$) with locations overhead to 30$^{\circ}$ zenith is comparable or less than 10\% of the Crab Nebula's flux between 2 and 50~TeV. Thanks to these improvements, HAWC can now detect more sources, including the Galactic Center.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulation of Radiatively driven Transonic Relativistic Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform the numerical simulations of axisymmetric, relativistic, optically thin jets under the influence of the radiation field of an accretion disk. We show that starting from a very low injection velocity at the base, jets can be accelerated to relativistic terminal speeds when traveling through the radiation field. The jet gains momentum through the interaction with the radiation field. We use a relativistic equation of state for multi-species plasma, which self-consistently calculates the adiabatic index for the jet material. All the jet solutions obtained are transonic in nature. In addition to the acceleration of the jet to relativistic speeds, our results show that the radiation field also acts as a collimating agent. The jets remain well collimated under the effect of radiation pressure. We also show that if the jet starts with a rotational velocity, the radiation field will reduce the angular momentum of the jet beam.</description>

      <title>Probing the Shock Breakout Signal of SN 2024ggi from the Transformation of Early Flash Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present early-time, hour-to-day cadence spectroscopy of the nearby type II supernova (SN II) 2024ggi, which was discovered at a phase when the SN shock just emerged from the red-supergiant (RSG) progenitor star. Over the first few days after the first light, SN 2024ggi exhibited prominent narrow emission lines formed through intense and persistent photoionization of the nearby circumstellar material (CSM). In the first 63 hours, spectral lines of He, C, N, and O revealed a rapid rise in ionization, as a result of the progressive sweeping-up of the CSM by the shock. The duration of the IIn-like spectra indicates a dense and relatively confined CSM distribution extending up to $\sim 4 \times 10^{14}$ cm. Spectral modeling reveals a CSM mass loss rate at this region exceeding $5 \times\, 10^{-3}${\rm M}_{\odot} yr$^{-1}$ is required to reproduce low-ionization emissions, which dramatically exceeds that of an RSG. Analyzing H$\alpha$ emission shift implies the velocity of the unshocked outer CSM to be between 20 and 40 km s$^{-1}$, matching the typical wind velocity of an RSG. The differences between the inner and outer layers of the CSM and an RSG progenitor highlight a complex mass loss history before the explosion of SN 2024ggi.</description>

      <title>A More Precise Measurement of the Radius of PSR J0740+6620 Using Updated NICER Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PSR J0740+6620 is the neutron star with the highest precisely determined mass, inferred from radio observations to be $2.08\pm0.07\,\rm M_\odot$. Measurements of its radius therefore hold promise to constrain the properties of the cold, catalyzed, high-density matter in neutron star cores. Previously, Miller et al. (2021) and Riley et al. (2021) reported measurements of the radius of PSR J0740+6620 based on Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) observations accumulated through 17 April 2020, and an exploratory analysis utilizing NICER background estimates and a data set accumulated through 28 December 2021 was presented in Salmi et al. (2022). Here we report an updated radius measurement, derived by fitting models of X-ray emission from the neutron star surface to NICER data accumulated through 21 April 2022, totaling $\sim1.1$ Ms additional exposure compared to the data set analyzed in Miller et al. (2021) and Riley et al. (2021), and to data from X-ray Multi-Mirror (XMM-Newton) observations. We find that the equatorial circumferential radius of PSR J0740+6620 is $12.92_{-1.13}^{+2.09}$ km (68% credibility), a fractional uncertainty $\sim83\%$ the width of that reported in Miller et al. (2021), in line with statistical expectations given the additional data. If we were to require the radius to be less than 16 km, as was done in Salmi et al. (2024), then our 68% credible region would become $R=12.76^{+1.49}_{-1.02}$ km, which is close to the headline result of Salmi et al. (2024). Our updated measurements, along with other laboratory and astrophysical constraints, imply a slightly softer equation of state than that inferred from our previous measurements.</description>

      <title>Combined Pre-Supernova Alert System with Kamland and Super-Kamiokande</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09920v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preceding a core-collapse supernova, various processes produce an increasing amount of neutrinos of all flavors characterized by mounting energies from the interior of massive stars. Among them, the electron antineutrinos are potentially detectable by terrestrial neutrino experiments such as KamLAND and Super-Kamiokande via inverse beta decay interactions. Once these pre-supernova neutrinos are observed, an early warning of the upcoming core-collapse supernova can be provided. In light of this, KamLAND and Super-Kamiokande, both located in the Kamioka mine in Japan, have been monitoring pre-supernova neutrinos since 2015 and 2021, respectively. Recently, we performed a joint study between KamLAND and Super-Kamiokande on pre-supernova neutrino detection. A pre-supernova alert system combining the KamLAND detector and the Super-Kamiokande detector was developed and put into operation, which can provide a supernova alert to the astrophysics community. Fully leveraging the complementary properties of these two detectors, the combined alert is expected to resolve a pre-supernova neutrino signal from a 15 M$_{\odot}$ star within 510 pc of the Earth, at a significance level corresponding to a false alarm rate of no more than 1 per century. For a Betelgeuse-like model with optimistic parameters, it can provide early warnings up to 12 hours in advance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10287v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we discuss the effect of light, non-gauge, bosonic degrees of freedom on the exterior spacetime of an exotic compact object. We show that such fields generically introduce large deviations from black hole spacetimes of General Relativity near and outside the surfaces of ultra-compact exotic objects unless one assumes they totally decouple from the standard model or new heavy fields. Hence, using black hole spacetimes of General Relativity to model ultra-compact exotic objects and their perturbations relies implicitly on this assumption or on the absence of such fields.</description>

      <title>The role of the irreducible mass in repetitive Penrose energy extraction processes in a Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of the irreducible mass ($M_{\rm irr}$) has led to the mass-energy ($M$) formula of a Kerr-Newman black hole (BH), in turn leading to an expression for its surface area $S=16\pi M_{\rm irr}^2$. This allowed as well the coeval identification of the reversible and irreversible transformations. The concepts of \textit{extracted} and \textit{extractable} energy soon followed. This new conceptual framework avoids inconsistencies recently evidenced in a repetitive Penrose process. We consider repetitive decays in the ergosphere of an initially extreme Kerr BH and show that these processes are highly irreversible. For each decay, including the BH capture of the particle falling into the horizon, the increase of the irreducible mass is much larger than the extracted energy. Correspondingly, the horizon radius increases. The energy extraction process saturates and stops when the horizon reaches the decay radius. Thus, reaching a final non-rotating Schwarzschild BH state by this accretion process is impossible. We have assessed such processes for three selected decay radii, $r= 1.2 M$, $1.5 M$, and $1.9 M$. The energy extracted until saturation is only $2.75\%$, $4.54\%$, and $2.45\%$ of the BH initial mass, while the extractable energy is reduced by $25\%$, $56\%$, and $92\%$. The BH rotational energy is mostly converted into irreducible mass, which increases to $75\%$, $83\%$, and $95\%$ of the initial BH mass. Therefore, evaluating the effect of the irreducible mass increase in the energy extraction processes in the Kerr BH ergosphere is now mandatory.</description>

      <title>Lunar antineutrinos and heat: fluxes from primordial radioactivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We estimate the fluxes of heat and antineutrinos due to primordial radioactivity within the moon. We use a radial density profile, specifying an inner core and a model-averaged crust. Thickness, density, and elevation of the lunar crust are from remote measurements of the gravitational field. Lateral and vertical variations of thorium, uranium, and potassium abundances in the crust follow from a prediction of the lunar bulk chemical composition. We constrain the total contents of thorium, uranium, and potassium using estimates for the earth's primitive mantle. These contents produce $311\pm37$ GW of radiogenic heating and a surface-averaged heat flux of $8.19\pm0.97$ mW/m$^2$. Our lunar model estimates an antineutrino flux of $(1.83\pm0.32)\times10^6$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and an antineutrino inverse beta decay rate of $5.8\pm1.0$ per $10^{32}$ free proton targets per year, both averaged over the surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have searched for anomalous events using 2,520 hours of archival observations from Murriyang, CSIRO's Parkes radio telescope. These observations were originally undertaken to search for pulsars. We used a machine-learning algorithm based on ResNet and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) in order to identify parts of the data stream that potentially contain anomalous signals. Many of these anomalous events are radio frequency interference, which were subsequently filtered using multibeam information. We detected 202 anomalous events and provide their positions and event times. We discuss the possibility that one of the events comes from radio emission from a white dwarf star.The other events are currently of unknown type.</description>
