      <title>CNN-Based Automated Parameter Extraction Framework for Modeling Memristive Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resistive random access memory (RRAM) is a promising candidate for next-generation nonvolatile memory (NVM) and in-memory computing applications. Compact models are essential for analyzing the circuit and system-level performance of experimental RRAM devices. However, most existing RRAM compact models rely on multiple fitting parameters to reproduce the device I-V characteristics, and in most cases, as the parameters are not directly related to measurable quantities, their extraction requires extensive manual tuning, making the process time-consuming and limiting adaptability across different devices. This work presents an automated framework for extracting the fitting parameters of the widely used Stanford RRAM model directly from the device I-V characteristics. The framework employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a synthetic dataset to generate initial parameter estimates, which are then refined through three heuristic optimization blocks that minimize errors via adaptive binary search in the parameter space. We evaluated the framework using four key NVM metrics: set voltage, reset voltage, hysteresis loop area, and low resistance state (LRS) slope. Benchmarking against RRAM device characteristics derived from previously reported Stanford model fits, other analytical models, and experimental data shows that the framework achieves low error across diverse device characteristics, offering a fast, reliable, and robust solution for RRAM modeling.</description>

      <title>Feature Importance Guided Random Forest Learning with Simulated Annealing Based Hyperparameter Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for enhancing Random Forest classifiers by integrating probabilistic feature sampling and hyperparameter tuning via Simulated Annealing. The proposed framework exhibits substantial advancements in predictive accuracy and generalization, adeptly tackling the multifaceted challenges of robust classification across diverse domains, including credit risk evaluation, anomaly detection in IoT ecosystems, early-stage medical diagnostics, and high-dimensional biological data analysis. To overcome the limitations of conventional Random Forests, we present an approach that places stronger emphasis on capturing the most relevant signals from data while enabling adaptive hyperparameter configuration. The model is guided towards features that contribute more meaningfully to classification and optimizing this with dynamic parameter tuning. The results demonstrate consistent accuracy improvements and meaningful insights into feature relevance, showcasing the efficacy of combining importance aware sampling and metaheuristic optimization.</description>

      <title>Introducing Nylon Face Mask Attacks: A Dataset for Evaluating Generalised Face Presentation Attack Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Face recognition systems are increasingly deployed across a wide range of applications, including smartphone authentication, access control, and border security. However, these systems remain vulnerable to presentation attacks (PAs), which can significantly compromise their reliability. In this work, we introduce a new dataset focused on a novel and realistic presentation attack instrument called Nylon Face Masks (NFMs), designed to simulate advanced 3D spoofing scenarios. NFMs are particularly concerning due to their elastic structure and photorealistic appearance, which enable them to closely mimic the victim's facial geometry when worn by an attacker. To reflect real-world smartphone-based usage conditions, we collected the dataset using an iPhone 11 Pro, capturing 3,760 bona fide samples from 100 subjects and 51,281 NFM attack samples across four distinct presentation scenarios involving both humans and mannequins. We benchmark the dataset using five state-of-the-art PAD methods to evaluate their robustness under unseen attack conditions. The results demonstrate significant performance variability across methods, highlighting the challenges posed by NFMs and underscoring the importance of developing PAD techniques that generalise effectively to emerging spoofing threats.</description>

      <title>SRE-Llama -- Fine-Tuned Meta's Llama LLM, Federated Learning, Blockchain and NFT Enabled Site Reliability Engineering(SRE) Platform for Communication and Networking Software Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software services are crucial for reliable communication and networking; therefore, Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is important to ensure these systems stay reliable and perform well in cloud-native environments. SRE leverages tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor system metrics, defining critical Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for maintaining high service standards. However, a significant challenge arises as many developers often lack in-depth understanding of these tools and the intricacies involved in defining appropriate SLIs and SLOs. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel SRE platform, called SRE-Llama, enhanced by Generative-AI, Federated Learning, Blockchain, and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This platform aims to automate and simplify the process of monitoring, SLI/SLO generation, and alert management, offering ease in accessibility and efficy for developers. The system operates by capturing metrics from cloud-native services and storing them in a time-series database, like Prometheus and Mimir. Utilizing this stored data, our platform employs Federated Learning models to identify the most relevant and impactful SLI metrics for different services and SLOs, addressing concerns around data privacy. Subsequently, fine-tuned Meta's Llama-3 LLM is adopted to intelligently generate SLIs, SLOs, error budgets, and associated alerting mechanisms based on these identified SLI metrics. A unique aspect of our platform is the encoding of generated SLIs and SLOs as NFT objects, which are then stored on a Blockchain. This feature provides immutable record-keeping and facilitates easy verification and auditing of the SRE metrics and objectives. The automation of the proposed platform is governed by the blockchain smart contracts. The proposed SRE-Llama platform prototype has been implemented with a use case featuring a customized Open5GS 5G Core.</description>

      <title>A CODECO Case Study and Initial Validation for Edge Orchestration of Autonomous Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) increasingly adopt containerized micro-services across the Edge-Cloud continuum. While Kubernetes is the de-facto orchestrator for such systems, its assumptions of stable networks, homogeneous resources, and ample compute capacity do not fully hold in mobile, resource-constrained robotic environments.
  This paper describes a case study on smart-manufacturing AMRs and performs an initial comparison between CODECO orchestration and standard Kubernetes using a controlled KinD environment. Metrics include pod deployment and deletion times, CPU and memory usage, and inter-pod data rates. The observed results indicate that CODECO offers reduced CPU consumption and more stable communication patterns, at the cost of modest memory overhead (10-15%) and slightly increased pod lifecycle latency due to secure overlay initialization.</description>

      <title>Clustering Guided Residual Neural Networks for Multi-Tx Localization in Molecular Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transmitter localization in Molecular Communication via Diffusion is a critical topic with many applications. However, accurate localization of multiple transmitters is a challenging problem due to the stochastic nature of diffusion and overlapping molecule distributions at the receiver surface. To address these issues, we introduce clustering-based centroid correction methods that enhance robustness against density variations, and outliers. In addition, we propose two clusteringguided Residual Neural Networks, namely AngleNN for direction refinement and SizeNN for cluster size estimation. Experimental results show that both approaches provide significant improvements with reducing localization error between 69% (2-Tx) and 43% (4-Tx) compared to the K-means.</description>

      <title>Quantum Generative Modeling of Single-Cell Transcriptomics: Capturing Gene-Gene and Cell-Cell Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data simulation is limited by classical methods that rely on linear correlations, failing to capture the intrinsic, nonlinear dependencies. No existing simulator jointly models gene-gene and cell-cell interactions. We introduce qSimCells, a novel quantum computing-based simulator that employs entanglement to model intra- and inter-cellular interactions, generating realistic single-cell transcriptomes with cellular heterogeneity. The core innovation is a quantum kernel that uses a parameterized quantum circuit with CNOT gates to encode complex, nonlinear gene regulatory network (GRN) as well as cell-cell communication topologies with explicit causal directionality. The resulting synthetic data exhibits non-classical dependencies: standard correlation-based analyses (Pearson and Spearman) fail to recover the programmed causal pathways and instead report spurious associations driven by high baseline gene-expression probabilities. Furthermore, applying cell-cell communication detection to the simulated data validates the true mechanistic links, revealing a robust, up to 75-fold relative increase in inferred communication probability only when quantum entanglement is active. These results demonstrate that the quantum kernel is essential for producing high-fidelity ground-truth datasets and highlight the need for advanced inference techniques to capture the complex, non-classical dependencies inherent in gene regulation.</description>

      <title>AcousTools: A 'Full-Stack', Python-Based, Acoustic Holography Library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Acoustic Holography is an emerging field where mid-air ultrasound is controlled and manipulated for novel and exciting applications. These range from mid-air haptics, volumetric displays, contactless fabrication, and even chemical and biomedical applications such as drug delivery. To develop these applications, a software framework to predict acoustic behaviour and simulating resulting effects, such as applied forces or scattering patterns is desirable. There have been various software libraries and platforms that attempt to fill this role, but there is yet to be a single piece of software that acts as a 'full-stack' solution. We define this full-stack as the process from abstraction to physicalisation starting with setup, modelling acoustic propagation, transducer phase retrieval, sound field analysis, and control of the acoustic holographic hardware itself. Existing methods fail to fulfil one or more of these categories. To address this, we present AcousTools, a Python-based acoustic holography library, designed to support the full suite of acoustic holographic applications and we show AcousTools's ability to meet each step of the full-stack's requirements. AcousTools has the potential to become the standard code library for acoustic holography, with the uniquely complete suite of features wrapped in a language that is known to be easy to use, AcousTools will increase the ability for researchers to develop novel applications as well as accurately review other's work. The full-stack, aside from software, will also be useful for researchers - providing a way to view and compare methodologies by understanding where they fit into the stack.</description>
