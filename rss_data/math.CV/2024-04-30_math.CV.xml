      <title>Stable properties under weakly geometrically flat maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we show that a weakly geometrically flat map $\pi$ : M $\rightarrow$ N between pure dimensional complex spaces has the local lifting property for cycles. From this result we also deduce that, under these hypotheses, several properties of M are transferred to N.</description>

      <title>Constrained maximization of conformal capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider constellations of disks which are unions of disjoint hyperbolic disks in the unit disk with fixed radii and unfixed centers. We study the problem of maximizing the conformal capacity of a constellation under constraints on the centers in two cases. In the first case the constraint is that the centers are at most at distance $R \in(0,1)$ from the origin and in the second case it is required that the centers are on the subsegment $[-R,R]$ of a diameter of the unit disk. We study also similar types of constellations with hyperbolic segments instead of the hyperbolic disks. Our computational experiments suggest that a dispersion phenomenon occurs: the disks/segments go as close to the unit circle as possible under these constraints and stay as far as possible from each other. The computation of capacity reduces to the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace equation which we solve with a fast boundary integral equation method. The results are double-checked with the $hp$-FEM method.</description>

      <title>On the derivatives of the Liouville currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Liouville map, introduced by Bonahon, assigns to each point in the Teichm\"uller space a natural Radon measure on the space of geodesics of the base surface. The Liouville map is real analytic and it even extends to a holomorphic map of a neighborhood of the Teichm\"uller space in the Quasi-Fuchsian space of an arbitrary conformally hyperbolic Riemann surface. The earthquake paths and by their extension quake-bends, introduced by Thurston, are particularly nice real-analytic and holomorphic paths in the Teichm\"uller and the Quasi-Fuchsian space, respectively. We find a geometric expression for the derivative of the Liouville map along earthquake paths.</description>
