      <title>Switchable Exchange Bias Resulting from Correlated Domain Structures in Orthogonally Coupled Antiferromagnet/Ferromagnet van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) magnetic heterostructures offer a versatile platform for engineering interfacial spin interactions with atomic precision, enabling nontrivial spin textures and dynamic behaviors. In this work, we report robust asymmetric magnetization reversal and exchange bias in Fe3GeTe2 (FGT), driven by interlayer exchange coupling with the A-type antiferromagnet CrSBr. Despite the orthogonal magnetic anisotropies out-of-plane easy axis in FGT and in-plane in CrSBr, we observe a strong interfacial exchange interaction that gives rise to pronounced and switchable exchange bias and asymmetric switching in FGT, persisting up to the N\'eel temperature of CrSBr (132 K) as revealed by anomalous Hall effect measurements.
  We uncover the microscopic origin of this behavior through cross-sectional magnetic imaging of the domain structure using off-axis electron holography. The results reveal that the asymmetric switching and exchange bias arise from the influence of CrSBr on the domain configuration of FGT, where the in-plane antiferromagnetic state of CrSBr promotes the formation of stripe-like domain structures in FGT with circular rotation of magnetization in the cross-sectional bc plane defined by the easy axes of both FGT and CrSBr. These findings elucidate the mechanism of exchange bias in orthogonally coupled van der Waals systems and demonstrate a pathway for stabilizing three-dimensional domain structures in ferromagnets through interfacial exchange interactions.</description>

      <title>Impact of Metal Cation on Chiral Properties of 2D Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites are formed by embedding chiral organic cations in a perovskite crystal structure. The chirality arises from distortions of the 2D metal halide layers induced by the packing of these organic cations. Sn-based octahedra spontaneously distort, but it remains unclear whether this intrinsic structural instability enhances the chirality. We investigate the effect of the metal cation on structural and phonon chirality in MBA$_{2}$Sn$_{\mathrm{x}}$Pb$_{1-\mathrm{x}}$I$_{4}$ (x = 0, 1/2, and 1). Incorporating Sn does distort the metal halide octehedra, yet it only has a minor impact on the structural chirality. In contrast, the phonons in MBA$_{2}$SnI$_{4}$ are substantially more chiral than in MBA$_{2}$PbI$_{4}$, especially the in-plane acoustic modes. However, this enhanced phonon chirality does not lead to a generation of a larger angular momentum under a temperature gradient, because the contributions of different chiral phonons tend to compensate one another.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Simulations Reveal the Need to Reassess Standard Thermodynamic Models of Coherent Precipitates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate models of precipitation kinetics are essential to control and design structural materials. These models are highly sensitive to the thermodynamic description of precipitates. We use atomistic simulations of a model Fe-Cr system to assess two commonly used assumptions in the thermodynamic modeling of coherent precipitates: that elastic effects can be neglected for systems with a small lattice misfit and that size effects can be neglected for low levels of supersaturation. We find that these assumptions cannot be maintained for an accurate description of interfacial equilibrium, even when lattice misfits are below 1 % and supersaturation values are below 1 %. Additionally, we find a surprising trend at large precipitate radii that suggests the importance of higher-order effects that are commonly neglected. The results and insights from this study highlight the need to revisit current approaches in modeling solid-state precipitation.</description>

      <title>Atomic Interface Engineering of Battery Current Collectors via Ion Implantation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic interface engineering (AIE) is critical for advancing technologies in energy storage, catalysis, and microelectronics. In anode-less lithium metal batteries (ALLMBs), AIE is essential for controlling interfacial chemistry governing lithium deposition and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation on copper current collectors. However, native copper surfaces readily oxidize, forming electronically insulating oxides that degrade performance and obscure failure mechanisms. Here, we report a scalable ion implantation strategy to create an atomically clean and robust copper interface. By implanting copper ions into commercial foils, we simultaneously remove the native oxide and introduce subsurface vacancy clusters that act as oxygen traps, yielding an oxidation-resistant and conductive surface. Experimental characterization and multiscale simulations reveal that these engineered vacancies suppress reoxidation and guide the formation of an ultrathin Li2O-enriched solid electrolyte interphase. When applied in ALLMBs, the current collectors enable uniform lithium deposition, suppress parasitic reactions, and deliver a Coulombic efficiency of 99.0% over 400 cycles under lean electrolyte conditions. This work presents a generalizable and industry-compatible approach for stabilizing electrochemical interfaces.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity electronic structure and properties of InSb: $G_0W_0$ and Bayesian-optimized hybrid functionals and DFT+$U$ approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a refined approach to computing the electronic structure of indium antimonide (InSb) using advanced \textit{ab initio} techniques with the In and Sb $4d^{10}$ semicore electrons included in the valence states. These states are modeled using fully relativistic projector augmented waves (PAW) and optimized norm-conserving Vanderbilt (ONCV) pseudopotentials. However, standard Kohn-Sham density-functional theory (DFT) calculations with these pseudopotentials often produce non-physical band inversions and incorrect band gaps at the $\Gamma$-point due to $5p$-$4d$ repulsion and self-interaction errors (SIE). To resolve these issues, we apply a combination of hybrid Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) exchange-correlation (XC) functionals, many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) via quasiparticle $G_0W_0$, and DFT+$U$, significantly improving the accuracy of the band structure over previous studies. A Bayesian optimization framework is used to refine key parameters, including the inverse screening length ($\mu$) and Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange fraction ($\alpha$) in HSE-based XC functionals, as well as the Hubbard $U$ parameters in DFT+$U$, leading to significantly improved band structure predictions. This approach yields highly precise band gaps, bulk moduli, effective masses, Luttinger parameters, valence bandwidth, and $4d$ band positions, achieving unprecedented agreement with experimental data. The resulting model resolves the long-standing incomplete description of InSb's electronic band structure and provides a transferable computational framework for accurate electronic structure predictions across diverse material systems, offering valuable insights for future electronic, optoelectronic, energy, and quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Large phonon-drag thermopower polarity reversal in Ba-doped KTaO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study reports the observation of phonon-drag thermopower polarity reversal in Ba-doped KTaO3 thin films, mediated by electron-phonon Umklapp scattering. Epitaxial films with distinct carrier concentrations (3.7 x 10^20 cm^-3 and 4.9 x 10^19 cm^-3) were grown via molecular-beam epitaxy. In heavily doped samples, where the Fermi surface spans 80% of the Brillouin zone, the Umklapp condition is satisfied, reversing electron momentum. This manifests as a sign-reversal in the thermopower around 80 K upon cooling despite the sample having only n-type carriers. On the other hand, the lightly doped sample (4.9 x 10^19 cm^-3) exhibits only a negative thermopower down to 2 K. These results advance the understanding of Umklapp electron-phonon drag in oxides and highlight KTaO3's potential for engineering unconventional thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Etching-to-deposition transition in SiO$_2$/Si$_3$N$_4$ using CH$_x$F$_y$ ion-based plasma etching: An atomistic study with neural network potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma etching, a critical process in semiconductor fabrication, utilizes hydrofluorocarbons both as etchants and as precursors for carbon film formation, where precise control over film growth is essential for achieving high SiO$_2$/Si$_3$N$_4$ selectivity and enabling atomic layer etching. In this work, we develop neural network potentials (NNPs) to gain atomistic insights into the surface evolution of SiO$_2$ and Si$_3$N$_4$ under hydrofluorocarbon ion bombardment. To efficiently sample diverse local configurations without exhaustive enumeration of ion-substrate combinations, we propose a vapor-to-surface sampling approach using high-temperature, low-density molecular dynamics simulations, supplemented with baseline reference structures. The NNPs, refined through iterative training, yield etching characteristics in MD simulations that show good agreement with experimental results. Further analysis reveals distinct mechanisms of carbon layer formation in SiO$_2$ and Si$_3$N$_4$, driven by the higher volatility of carbon-oxygen byproducts in SiO$_2$ and the suppressed formation of volatile carbon-nitrogen species in Si$_3$N$_4$. This computational framework enables quantitative predictions of atomistic surface modifications under plasma exposure and provides a foundation for integration with multiscale process modeling, offering insights into semiconductor fabrication processes.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic nature of the polarization in hafnia ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hafnia and related fluorites defy our understanding of ferroelectricity, even if we restrict ourselves to the intrinsic properties of ideal crystals. Here we focus on a critical puzzle, namely, the sign of the electric polarization. Using first-principles simulations, we show that a polar hafnia layer with a fixed atomic configuration can give rise to depolarizing fields of either positive or negative sign, depending on the environment. This implies that (the sign of) the polarization in hafnia is extrinsic in nature. We explain this result and discuss its relevance to other ferroelectric families.</description>

      <title>Observation and control of potential-dependent surface state formation at a semiconductor-electrolyte interface via the optical anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interface between semiconductors and ion-conducting electrolytes is characterised by charge distributions and potential drops that vary substantially with the evolution of surface states. These surface states at the very interface to the liquid can form or be passivated, depending on the applied potential between electrode and electrolyte, and hereby fundamentally impact properties such as charge transfer. Characterisation and understanding of such potential-dependent surface states with high spatial and temporal resolution is a significant challenge for the understanding and control of semiconductor-electrolyte interfaces. Here, we show that the optical anisotropy of InP(100) can be used to detect the potential-dependent formation of highly ordered surface states under operating conditions. Upon formation of a surface state in the bandgap of the semiconductor, the potential drop and hence the electric field is shifted away from the semiconductor to the Helmholtz-layer of the electrolyte. This modifies the instantaneous response of the optical anisotropy to disturbances of the applied potential. We propose an electrochemical variant of the linear electro-optical effect and our findings open a novel route for understanding these interfaces. The results show how surface states from surface reconstructions at this reactive interface can be switched on or off with the applied potential.</description>

      <title>The effect of dephasing and spin-lattice relaxation during the switching processes in quantum antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The control of antiferromagnetic order can pave the way to large storage capacity as well as fast manipulation of stored data. Here achieving a steady-state of sublattice magnetization after switching is crucial to prevent loss of stored data. The present theoretical approach aims to obtain instantaneous stable states of the order after reorienting the N\'eel vector in open quantum antiferromagnets using time-dependent Schwinger boson mean-field theory. The Lindblad formalism is employed to couple the system to the environment. The quantum theoretical approach comprises differences in the effects of dephasing, originating from destructive interference of different wave vectors, and spin-lattice relaxation. We show that the spin-lattice relaxation results in an exponentially fast convergence to the steady-state after full ultrafast switching.</description>

      <title>Lippmann-Schwinger Approach for Accurate Photoelectron Wavefunctions and Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectra from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a conceptually simple and technically straightforward method for calculating photoelectron wavefunctions that is easily integrable with standard wavefunction-based density-functional-theory packages. Our method is based on the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, naturally incorporating the boundary condition that the final photoelectron state must satisfy. The calculated results are in good agreement with the measured photon-energy- and polarization-dependence of the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) of graphene, the photon-energy-dependent evolution of the so-called dark corridor arising from the pseudospin, and WSe\textsubscript{2}, the circular dichroism reflecting the hidden orbital polarization. Our study opens doors to do-it-yourself simulations of ARPES with standard density-functional-theory packages, of crucial importance in the era of ``quantum materials,'' whose key experimental tool is ARPES.</description>

      <title>XANES absorption spectra of penta-graphene and penta-SiC2 with different terminations: a computational study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent research, penta-graphene and penta-SiC2 have emerged as innovative 2D materials consisting exclusively of pentagons. However, there is still a significant gap in the theoretical characterization of these materials, which hinders progress in their synthesis and potential technological applications. This study aims to close this gap by investigating the X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) of these materials through ab initio calculations. In particular, we analyze the XANES spectra of penta-graphene in its pristine, hydrogenated, and hydroxylated states, and we investigate the effects of substitution by a single silicon in both penta-graphene and pentagraphane. In addition, we calculate the XANES spectra for pristine and hydrogenated penta-SiC2. This work sets the stage for the possible identification of penta-graphene and penta-SiC2 phases by X-ray spectroscopy at the experimental level and lays the foundation for the future engineering of the absorption properties of these materials in optical devices.</description>

      <title>Persistent spin textures, altermagnetism and charge-to-spin conversion in metallic chiral crystals TM$_{3}$X$_{6}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral crystals, due to the lack of inversion and mirror symmetries, exhibit unique spin responses to external fields, enabling physical effects rarely observed in high-symmetry systems. Here, we show that materials from the chiral dichalcogenide family TM$_3$X$_6$ (T = 3d, M = 4d/5d, X = S) exhibit persistent spin texture (PST) - unidirectional spin polarization of states across large regions of the reciprocal space - in their nonmagnetic metallic phase. Using the example of NiTa$_{3}$S$_{6}$ and NiNb$_{3}$S$_{6}$, we show that PSTs cover the full Fermi surface, a rare and desirable feature that enables efficient charge-to-spin conversion and suggests long spin lifetimes and coherent spin transport above magnetic ordering temperatures. At low temperatures, the materials that order antiferromagnetically become chiral altermagnets, where spin textures originating from spin-orbit coupling and altermagnetism combine in a way that sensitively depends on the orientation of the Neel vector. Using symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we classify magnetic ground states across the family, identify cases with weak ferromagnetism, and track the evolution of spin textures and charge-to-spin conversion across magnetic phases and different Neel vector orientations, revealing spin transport signatures that allow one to distinguish Neel vector directions. These findings establish TM$_3$X$_6$ as a tunable platform for efficient charge-to-spin conversion and spin transport, combining structural chirality, persistent spin textures, and altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Octupole Hall Effect in d-Wave Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Order parameters not only characterize symmetry-broken equilibrium phases but also govern transport phenomena in the nonequilibrium regime. Altermagnets, a class of magnetic systems integrating ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic features, host multipolar orders in addition to dipolar Neel order. In this work, we demonstrate the multipole Hall effect in d-wave altermagnets--a transverse flow of multipole moments induced by an electric field. Using symmetry analysis and linear response theory, we show that the magnetic octupole Hall effect persists even in symmetries where the spin-splitter effect is forbidden and thus provides a robust experimental signature. In addition, we identify a sizable electric quadrupole Hall effect, originating from quadrupole splittings in the band structure.

      <title>Spin Quenching and Transport by Hidden Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06690v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explicit interactions, \textit{e.g.}, dipolar and exchange couplings, usually govern magnetization dynamics. Some interactions may be hidden from the global crystal symmetry. We report that in a large class of \textit{uniaxial} antiferromagnets, a \textit{hidden} Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction with retaining global inversion symmetry quenches the spin of magnon along the N\'eel vector ${\bf n}$, thus forbidding its angular-momentum flow. Some magnon spins, termed ``nodal" and ``corner" spins, survive when they distribute \textit{singularly} at the hot spots, i.e., high-symmetric degeneracy points in the Brillouin zone, and are protected by crystal symmetries. The biased magnetic field along ${\bf n}$ broadens such distributions, allowing bulk spin transport with unique signatures in the magnetic field and temperature dependencies. This explains recent experiments and highlights the role of hidden interaction.</description>

      <title>Core binding energies of solids with periodic EOM-CCSD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the core binding energies of K-edge and L-edge transitions in simple semiconducting and insulating solids using periodic equation-of-motion coupled-cluster theory with single and double excitations (EOM-CCSD). In our all-electron calculations, we use triple zeta basis sets with core correlation, and we sample the Brillouin zone using up to 4x4x4 k-points. Our final numbers, which are obtained through composite corrections and extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit, exhibit errors of about 2 eV when compared to experimental values. This level of accuracy from CCSD is about the same as it is for molecules. A low-scaling approximation to EOM-CCSD performs marginally worse at lower cost, with errors of about 3 eV.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Scandium Aluminum Nitride/Silicon Nitride Integrated Photonic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scandium-doped aluminum nitride has recently emerged as a promising material for quantum photonic integrated circuits (PICs) due to its unique combination of strong second-order nonlinearity, ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity, and complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatibility. However, the relatively high optical loss reported to date-typically above 2.4 dB/cm-remains a key challenge that limits its widespread application in low-loss PICs. Here, we present a monolithically integrated $\mathrm{Si}_3\mathrm{N}_4$-ScAlN waveguide platform that overcomes this limitation. By confining light within an etched $\mathrm{Si}_3\mathrm{N}_4$ waveguide while preserving the functional properties of the underlying ScAlN layer, we achieve an intrinsic quality factor of $Q_{\mathrm{i}} = 3.35 \times 10^5$, corresponding to a propagation loss of 1.03 dB/cm-comparable to that of commercial single-mode silicon-on-insulator (SOI) waveguides. This hybrid architecture enables low-loss and scalable fabrication while retaining the advanced functionalities offered by ScAlN, such as ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity. Our results establish a new pathway for ScAlN-based PICs with potential applications in high-speed optical communication, modulation, sensing, nonlinear optics, and quantum optics within CMOS-compatible platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-entropy compounds, where multiple elements occupy a single crystallographic site in a highly disordered manner, challenge conventional understandings of electronic structure based on periodicity and well-defined band dispersion. Here, we report a detailed nuclear magnetic resonance study of the high-entropy superconductor (RuRhPdIr)$_{0.6}$Pt$_{0.4}$Sb, revealing a spatially homogeneous electronic environment in the normal state, in stark contrast to its crystallographically disordered lattice. The superconducting state exhibits a small but solid Hebel-Slichter coherence peak followed by a significant decrease in the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate, providing compelling evidence for fully gapped $s$-wave pairing. Our findings not only deepen the understanding of superconductivity in highly disordered quantum materials but also open a new pathway for exploring novel superconducting states in entropy-stabilized systems.</description>

      <title>Self-strain suppression of the metal-to-insulator transition in phase-change oxide devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum materials exhibiting phase transitions which can be controlled through external stimuli, such as electric fields, are promising for future computing technologies beyond conventional semiconductor transistors. Devices that take advantage of structural phase transitions have inherent built-in memory, reminiscent of synapses and neurons, and are thus natural candidates for neuromorphic computing. Of particular interest are phase-change oxides, which allow for control over the metal-to-insulator transition. Here, we report X-ray nano-diffraction structural imaging of micro-devices fabricated with the archetypal phase-change material vanadium sesquioxide (V$_2$O$_3$). The devices contain a Ga ion-irradiated region where the metal-to-insulator transition critical temperature is lowered, a useful feature for controlling neuron-like spiking behavior. Results show that strain, induced by crystal lattice mismatch between the pristine and irradiated material, leads to a suppression of the metal-to-insulator-transition. Suppression occurs within the irradiated region or along its edges, depending on the defect-distribution and the size of the region. The observed self-straining effect could extend to other phase-change oxides and dominate as device dimensions are reduced and become too small to dissipate strain within the irradiated region. The findings are important for phase engineering in phase-change devices and highlight the necessity to study phase transitions at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Gapless superconductivity from extremely dilute magnetic disorder in 2H-NbSe2-xSx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most superconducting materials exhibit a vanishing density of states at the Fermi level and Anderson's theorem posits that the superconducting gap is robust against nonmagnetic disorder. Although dilute magnetic impurities lead to localized in-gap states, these states typically have no bearing on the material's bulk superconducting properties. However, numerous experiments reveal a finite density of states at the Fermi level in systems with an apparently negligible number of magnetic impurities. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy and self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes calculations, we find that gapless superconductivity emerges in 2H-NbSe2-xSx at remarkably low magnetic impurity concentrations. Furthermore, our density functional theory calculations and in-gap quasiparticle interference measurements demonstrate that the Se-S substitution significantly modifies the band structure. This modification favours nesting and dictates the in-gap scattering for x&gt;0, in stark contrast to the dominant charge density wave interactions in pure 2H-NbSe2. Our findings reveal an unusual superconducting response to disorder and highlight the importance of incorporating material-specific band structures in the understanding of a superconductor's response to even very low concentrations of magnetic impurities.</description>

      <title>Learning Potential Energy Surfaces of Hydrogen Atom Transfer Reactions in Peptides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions are essential in many biological processes, such as radical migration in damaged proteins, but their mechanistic pathways remain incompletely understood. Simulating HAT is challenging due to the need for quantum chemical accuracy at biologically relevant scales; thus, neither classical force fields nor DFT-based molecular dynamics are applicable. Machine-learned potentials offer an alternative, able to learn potential energy surfaces (PESs) with near-quantum accuracy. However, training these models to generalize across diverse HAT configurations, especially at radical positions in proteins, requires tailored data generation and careful model selection. Here, we systematically generate HAT configurations in peptides to build large datasets using semiempirical methods and DFT. We benchmark three graph neural network architectures (SchNet, Allegro, and MACE) on their ability to learn HAT PESs and indirectly predict reaction barriers from energy predictions. MACE consistently outperforms the others in energy, force, and barrier prediction, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.13 kcal/mol on out-of-distribution DFT barrier predictions. This accuracy enables integration of ML potentials into large-scale collagen simulations to compute reaction rates from predicted barriers, advancing mechanistic understanding of HAT and radical migration in peptides. We analyze scaling laws, model transferability, and cost-performance trade-offs, and outline strategies for improvement by combining ML potentials with transition state search algorithms and active learning. Our approach is generalizable to other biomolecular systems, enabling quantum-accurate simulations of chemical reactivity in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Electrical and Thermal Conductivity of Earth's Iron-enriched Basal Magma Ocean</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Earth's earliest magnetic field may have originated in a basal magma ocean, a layer of silicate melt surround the core that could have persisted for billions of years. Recent studies show that the electrical conductivity of liquid with a bulk silicate Earth composition exceeds 10000 S/m at basal magma ocean conditions, potentially surprising the threshold for dynamo activity. Over most of its history however, the basal magma ocean is more enriched in iron than the bulk silicate Earth, due to iron's incompatibility in the mineral assemblages of the lower mantle. Using ab-initio molecular dynamics calculations, we examine how iron content affects the silicate dynamo hypothesis. We investigate how the electrical conductivity of silicate liquid changes with iron enrichment, at pressures and temperatures relevant for Earth's basal magma ocean. We also compute the electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity , to evaluate convective instability of basal magma oceans. Finally, we apply our results to model the thermal and magnetic evolution of Earth's basal magma ocean over time.</description>

      <title>Imaging Ultrafast Dynamical Diffraction wavefronts of femtosecond laser-induced lattice distortions inside crystalline semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Material processing with femtosecond lasers has attracted enormous attention because of its potential for technology and industrial applications. In parallel, time-resolved x-ray diffraction has been successfully used to study ultrafast structural distortion dynamics in semiconductor thin films or surface layers. However, real-world processing applications mostly are concerned with bulk materials, which prevents the use of x-ray surface based techniques. For processing applications, a fast and depth-sensitive probe is needed. To address this, we present a novel technique based on ultrafast x-ray dynamical diffraction (UDD) capable of imaging transient strain distributions inside bulk crystals upon laser excitation. This pump-probe technique provides a complete picture of thetemporal evolution of ultrafast distorted lattice depth profiles. We demonstrate the potential of UDD by studying a thin Si single crystal upon single pulse femtosecond optical excitation. Our study reveals that below the melting threshold strong lattice distortions not only longitudinal, but also transversal to the propagation of the strain wave appear on picosecond time scales along the single crystal. The observation of this transversal deformation after laser excitation contradicts previous work that were not able to observed it, what could be related to the high sensitivity of dynamical diffraction with respect to the lattice distortions. The speed of propagation of this ultrafast transversal strain deformation is observed to be slower to the longitudinal sound speed for Si as described in the bibliography.</description>

      <title>Explicit core-hole single-particle methods for L- and M- edge X-ray absorption and electron energy-loss spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-particle methods based on Kohn-Sham unoccupied states to describe near-edge X-ray absorption (XAS) spectra are routinely applied for the description of K-edge spectra, as there is no complication due to spin-orbit (SO) coupling. L- and M-edge spectra are often addressed via variants of time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) based on SO calculations. Here, we present a computationally efficient implementation based on single-particle calculations with core holes within the frozen-core approximation. Combined with a semiempirical energy shift and a fixed spin-orbit splitting for each core level, this allows for a computationally cheap, while overall accurate prediction of experimental spectra on the absolute energy scale. The spectra are compared to about 40 times slower linear-response TDDFT calculations for molecules and show similar or even better match with experiment. An exception are multiplet effects that we analyze in detail and show that they cannot be covered by a single-particle approximation. A similar picture emerges for solids, where good qualitative and sometimes even quantitative agreement to experimental XAS and electron energy-loss spectra is achieved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transverse thermoelectric generation and cooling performances in a thermopile module composed of recently developed SmCo$_5$/Bi$_{0.2}$Sb$_{1.8}$Te$_3$ artificially tilted multilayers are evaluated quantitatively. When a large temperature difference of 405 $^\circ$C is applied to the SmCo$_5$/Bi$_{0.2}$Sb$_{1.8}$Te$_3$-based module, the open-circuit voltage and output power reach 0.51 V and 0.80 W, respectively. The corresponding maximum power density is 0.16 W/cm$^2$, even if the power is normalized by the device area including areas that do not contribute to the power generation, such as epoxy resin, electrodes, and insulating layers. The maximum energy conversion efficiency for our module in this condition is experimentally determined to be 0.92%. Under the cooling operation, the same module exhibits the maximum temperature difference of 9.0 $^\circ$C and heat flow at the cold side of 1.6 W. Although these values are lower than the ideal thermoelectric performance expected from the material parameters due to the imperfections associated with modularization, the systematic investigations reported here clarify a potential of the SmCo$_5$/Bi$_{0.2}$Sb$_{1.8}$Te$_3$ artificially tilted multilayers as thermoelectric generators and cooling devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19798v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the non-equilibrium behavior of stainless steel under extreme electronic excitation remains a critical challenge for laser processing and radiation science. We employ a hybrid framework integrating density-functional tight binding, transport Monte Carlo, and Boltzmann equations to model austenitic stainless steel (Fe$_{0.5875}$Cr$_{0.25}$Mn$_{0.09}$Ni$_{0.07}$C$_{0.0025}$) under ultrafast irradiation. The developed approach uniquely bridges atomic-scale electronic dynamics and mesoscale material responses, enabling the quantitative mapping of electron-temperature-dependent properties (electronic heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and electron-phonon coupling) up to the electronic temperatures Te~25,000 K. Two distinct lattice disordering mechanisms are identified: nonthermal melting at Te~10,000 K (the dose ~1.4 eV/atom), where the lattice collapses on sub-picosecond timescales without atomic heating driven by electronic excitation modifying the interatomic potential; and thermal melting (at ~0.45 eV/atom), induced by electron-phonon coupling on picosecond timescales. The derived parameters enable predictive modeling of stainless steel under extreme conditions, with implications for laser machining and radiation-resistant material design.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure and exchange interactions in altermagnetic MnGeP$_2$ in the quasiparticle-self-consistent $GW$ approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The QS$GW$ method is used to study the electronic band structure, optical dielectric function, and exchange interactions in chalcopyrite, $I\bar{4}2d$, structure MnGeP$_2$. The material is found to be an antiferromagnetic semiconductor with the lowest direct gap of 2.44 eV at the $\Gamma$ point and an indirect gap of 1.87 eV. The material is an altermagnet, with the two magnetic atoms of opposite spin related by a two-fold rotation operation perpendicular to the main 4-fold rotation inversion axis. The spin splittings along a low symmetry line like $PN$ are sizable, while at k-points on the diagonal mirror planes or on the twofold symmetry axes, the spin splitting is zero. The exchange interactions are calculated using a linear response approach. The antiferromagnetic exchange-interaction between nearest neighbors in the primitive unit cell is dominating and found to be slightly decreasing upon carrier doping. The transverse spin susceptibilities, which provide interatomic site exchange interactions after averaging over the muffin-tin spheres, are calculated from the $GW$ band structure and wave functions. From these exchange interactions, the spin wave spectra are obtained along the high symmetry lines and the N\'{e}el temperature is calculated using the mean-field and Tyablikov (RPA) estimations. The dielectric function and the optical absorption spectra are calculated, including excitonic effects, using the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The exchange interactions around Mn$_{\rm Ge}$ defect sites are also studied. While we find it can generate ferromagnetic interactions with neighboring spins, we did not find evidence of producing an overall ferromagnetic phase. If Mn antisites are introduced by exchanging Mn with a nearby Ge, the interactions stay largely antiferromagnetic. Adding Mn antisites leads to a metallic band structure.</description>

      <title>Mapping of Microstructure Transitions during Rapid Alloy Solidification Using Bayesian-Guided Phase-Field Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07752v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study addresses microstructure selection mechanisms in rapid solidification, specifically targeting the transition from cellular/dendritic to planar interface morphologies under conditions relevant to additive manufacturing. We use a phase-field model that quantitatively captures solute trapping, kinetic undercooling, and morphological instabilities across a broad range of growth velocities ($V$) and thermal gradients ($G$), and apply it to a binary Fe-Cr alloy, as a surrogate for 316L stainless steel. By combining high-fidelity phase-field simulations with a Gaussian Process-based Bayesian active learning approach, we efficiently map the microstructure transitions in the multi-dimensional space of composition, growth velocity, and temperature gradient. We compare our PF results to classical theories for rapid solidification. The classical KGT model yields an accurate prediction of the value of $G$ above which the interface is planar for any growth velocity. Microstructures transition from dendrites to cells as the temperature gradient increases close to this value of $G$. We also identify the occurrence of unstable "intermediate" microstructures at the border between dendritic and planar at low $G$, in the absence of banding instability in this Fe-Cr alloy. Our results highlight the capabilities of Bayesian-guided PF approaches in exploring complex microstructural transitions in multidimensional parameters spaces, thereby providing a robust computational tool for designing process parameters to achieve targeted microstructures and properties in rapidly solidified metallic alloys.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic properties of CrMnFeCoNi high entropy alloy at elevated electronic temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cantor alloy (equiatomic CrMnFeCoNi) is a high-entropy alloy with unique physical properties and radiation resistance. To model its response to intense laser pulses, the parameters of the electronic ensemble are required. In this work, the electronic heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and electron-phonon coupling strength at elevated electronic temperatures are evaluated using a combined approach that incorporates tight-binding molecular dynamics and the Boltzmann equation. The damage threshold fluence is estimated for a wide range of photon energies, from XUV to hard X-rays. It is found that at the electronic temperatures ~24,000 K (absorbed dose ~6 eV/atom), the Cantor alloy experiences nonthermal melting due to modification of the interatomic potential induced by electronic excitation, even without the increase of the atomic temperature. This effect must be included in reliable models of CrMnFeCoNi ablation under ultrafast laser irradiation.</description>

      <title>Broadband ferromagnetic resonance in Ni-Mn-Ga single crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a broadband ferromagnetic resonance study in single crystalline Ni$_{50}$Mn$_{28.1}$Ga$_{21.9}$ in the temperature range from room temperature to 120 {\deg}C in which the transformation from martensite to austenite phase takes place. Our measurements demonstrate that a large change (an order of magnitude) in the magnetocrystalline anisotropy at the martensitic phase transformation results in a sharp change of the resonance magnetic field. In a single variant martensite phase, the resonance fields satisfy the Kittel's resonance condition for a thin film with the gyromagnetic factor g = 2.0. With the magnetic field parallel to the easy c-axis of the single variant martensite, the resonance is observed only for frequencies larger than 22 GHz. For the multivariant martensite case, the magnetic coupling between the twin variants can be taken into account for the satisfactory Kittel's fit. We observe a weak magnetocrystalline anisotropy in the austenite phase, just above the reverse martensite transformation, comparable to the previous reports based on different magnetic measurements.</description>

      <title>Effect of Doping on the phase stability and Superconductivity in LaH10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a computational investigation into the effects of chemical doping with 15 different elements on phase stability and superconductivity in the LaH10 structure. Most doping elements were found to induce softening of phonon modes, enhancing electron-phonon coupling and improving critical superconducting temperature while weakening dynamical stability. Unlike these dopants, Ce was found to extend the range of dynamical stability for LaH10 by eliminating the van Hove singularity near the Fermi level. The doped compound, La0.75Ce0.25H10, maintains high-temperature superconductivity. We also demonstrate that different Ce doping configurations in the LaH10 structure have a minimal effect on energetic stability and electron-phonon coupling strength. Our findings suggest that Ce is a promising dopant to stabilize LaH10 at lower pressures while preserving its high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Theory of Valley Splitting in Si/SiGe Spin-Qubits: Interplay of Strain, Resonances and Random Alloy Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron spin-qubits in silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures are a major candidate for the realization of scalable quantum computers. A critical challenge in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs) is the existence of two nearly degenerate valley states at the conduction band minimum that can lead to leakage of quantum information. To address this issue, various strategies have been explored to enhance the valley splitting (i.e., the energy gap between the two low-energy conduction band minima), such as sharp interfaces, oscillating germanium concentrations in the QW (known as wiggle wells) and shear strain engineering. In this work, we develop a comprehensive envelope-function theory augmented by an empirical nonlocal pseudopotential model to incorporate the effects of alloy disorder, strain, and non-trivial resonances arising from interactions between valley states across neighboring Brillouin zones. We apply our model to analyze common epitaxial profiles studied in the literature with a focus on wiggle well type structures and compare our results with previous work. Our framework provides an efficient tool for quantifying the interplay of these effects on the valley splitting, enabling complex epitaxial profile optimization in future work.</description>

      <title>Strongly correlated altermagnet CaCrO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a newly discovered magnetic phase, has spurred growing research activity. Studies from a perspective of dynamical electronic correlation still remain scarce. Employing density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) that incorporates dynamical electronic correlation, we demonstrate that CaCrO$_3$ is a strongly correlated altermagnet. Our DFT+DMFT calculations successfully reproduce the correlated metallic behavior of CaCrO$_3$ and quantitatively capture the incoherent state observed experimentally. We also identify that the altermagnetic CaCrO$_3$ is a Hund's metal. The incoherent state is attributed to Hund's coupling, which gives rise to a non-Fermi liquid behavior. Moreover, we find that altermagnetism can induce flat bands, and these incipient flat bands are further promoted by the strong renormalization from Hundness, which further drives a heavy-fermion behavior. Hence, we establish CaCrO$_3$ as a strongly correlated altermagnet and propose that Hund's metals provide an ideal platform for investigating the interplay between electronic correlation and altermagnetism. Our work will promote the study of strongly correlated altermagnetism physics.</description>
