      <title>Domain coarsening in fractonic systems: a cascade of critical exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of domain growth when multipole moments of the order parameter are conserved. Following a quench into the ordered phase of the Ising model, the typical size of domains grows with time as $R(t) \sim t^{1/2}$ in the absence of conserved quantities. When the order parameter is conserved, the domain growth slows to $R(t) \sim t^{1/3}$. Conservation of higher moments of the order parameter fundamentally modifies this behavior: coarsening proceeds via anomalously slow growth. We analytically and numerically show that conservation of the $m$-th multipole moment causes domains to grow as $R(t) \sim t^{1/(2m+3)}$. This cascade of dynamical critical exponents characterizes a new family of non-equilibrium universality classes for fractonic systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring the variational method for thermodynamic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the possibilities of the Gibbs-Bogoliubov-Feynman variational method, aiming at finding room for designing various drawing schemes. For example, mean-field approximation can be viewed as a result of using site-independent drawing in the variational method. In subsequent sections, progressively complex drawing procedures are presented, starting from site-independent drawing in the $k$-space. In the next, each site in the real-space is again drawn independently, which is followed by an adjustable linear transformation $T$. Both approaches are presented on the discrete Ginzburg-Landau model. Subsequently, a percolation-based procedure for the Ising model is developed. It shows a general way of handling multi-stage drawing schemes. Critical inverse temperatures are obtained in two and three dimensions with a few percent discrepancy from exact values. Finally, it is shown that results in the style of the real-space renormalization group can be achieved by suitable fractal-like drawing. This facilitates a new straight-forward approach to establishing the renormalization transformation, but primarily provides a new view on the method. While the first two approaches are capable of capturing long-range correlations, they are not able to reproduce the critical behavior accurately. The main findings of the paper are developing the method of handling intricate drawing procedures and identifying the need of fractality in these schemes to grasp the critical behavior.</description>

      <title>Stochastic processes with multiple temporal scales: timescale separation and information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex systems are often characterized by the interplay of multiple interconnected dynamical processes operating across a range of temporal scales. This phenomenon is widespread in both biological and artificial scenarios, making it crucial to understand how such multiscale dynamics influence the overall functioning and behavior of these systems. Here, we present a general timescale separation approach that is valid for any set of stochastic differential equations coupled across multiple timescales. We show two alternative derivations, one based on an iterative procedure, and the other grounded on an a priori expansion in relevant small parameters associated with faster timescales. We provide an explicit expression for the conditional structure of the joint probability distribution of the whole set of processes that is solely determined by the multiscale interactions. This result has important consequences in determining how information is generated in the system and how it propagates across different timescales. To demonstrate that our findings are valid independently of the specific dynamical model, we test them against four different (linear and non-linear) dynamics. Then, we focus on the scenario in which two degrees of freedom are reciprocally coupled across their timescales. In this case, we show that the statistics of the fastest dynamics is captured by an effective self-interaction term in the slowest one, creating a regulatory loop. Finally, a connection with analogous previous results obtained for discrete-state systems with higher-order interactions is drawn, elucidating similarities and differences in the physical interpretation of the system. The presented framework might open the avenue for a clearer understanding of the interplay between the underlying multiscale structure and emergent functional behavior of biological and artificial systems.</description>

      <title>Cheaper access to universal fluctuations in integrable spin chains from boundary effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observing super-diffusive fluctuations from Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality in isotropic integrable spin chains is usually challenging as it requires a fairly large number of spins in interaction. We demonstrate in this paper, in the context of classical spins, that accounting for boundary effects lowers the bar, down to a few dozen spins in some cases. Additionally, boundaries control the relaxation to stationarity, which leads to many new universal scaling functions to explore, both in periodic spin chains and for open chains with magnetization imposed by reservoirs at the ends.</description>

      <title>Constraint effective action and critical correlation functions at fixed magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extension of the functional renormalization group (FRG) framework developed to compute critical probability distributions of the order parameter to momentum-dependent observables. Focusing on the constraint effective action at fixed magnetization for the Ising universality class, we derive its exact flow equations and solve them at the second-order of the derivative expansion (DE2). We solve these flow equations numerically for two- and three-dimensional systems, extract universal rate functions and momentum-dependent correlation functions, and benchmark them against Monte Carlo simulations. In three dimensions, we recover the rate function and accurately reproduce the first few Fourier modes of the constrained correlation function, and demonstrate the convergence of the method. In two dimensions, the lowest order approximations such as local potential approximation (LPA) fail, and it is required to consider at least the DE2 to describe the critical point. Our results are in qualitative agreement with the numerics. We confirm the robustness of the FRG approach for calculating both zero- and finite-momentum critical observables at fixed magnetization.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal random networks and their percolation properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of nonreciprocity and network structure on percolation. To this end, we investigate nonreciprocal random networks - directed networks for which the probability of a link occurring from node i to node j differs from the probability of the reverse link occurring from node j to node i. We analytically determine the degree and percolation properties of such networks with exactly two types of link probability, demonstrating that whether the networks are structured such that the nodes are not statistically indistinguishable has profound effects on these measures, both quantitively and in how such networks need to be approached. In particular, we develop a technique for solving the percolation problem which can be applied to both structured and unstructured networks. The method entails writing self-consistent integral and differential equations for the probability that each node will belong to the network's giant component. Exact solutions to these equations are obtained and simulations which confirm our analytic predictions are presented.</description>

      <title>Existence and bounds of growth constants for restricted walks, surfaces, and generalisations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce classes of restricted walks, surfaces and their generalisations. For example, self-osculating walks (SOWs) are supersets of self-avoiding walks (SAWs) where edges are still not allowed to cross but may 'kiss' at a vertex. They are analogous to osculating polygons introduced in (Jensen and Guttmann, 1998) except that they are not required to be closed. The 'automata' method of (P\"onitz and Tittmann, 2000) can be adapted to such restricted walks. For example, we prove upper bounds for the connective constant for SOWs on the square and triangular lattices to be $\mu^{\mathrm{SOW}}_\square \leq 2.73911$ and $\mu^{\mathrm{SOW}}_\triangle \leq 4.44931$, respectively. In analogy, we also introduce self-osculating surfaces (SOSs), a superset of self-avoiding surfaces (SASs) which can be generated from fixed polyominoids (XDs). We further generalise and define self-avoiding $k$-manifolds (SAMs) and its supersets, self-osculating $k$-manifolds (SOMs) in the $d$-dim hypercubic lattice and $(d, k)$-XDs. By adapting the concatenation procedure procedure (van Rensburg and Whittington, 1989), we prove that their growth constants exist, and prove an explicit form for their upper and lower bounds. The upper bounds can be improved by adapting the 'twig' method, originally developed for polyominoes (Eden, 1961, Klarner and Rivest, 1973). For the cubic lattice, we find improved upper bounds for the growth constant of SASs as $\mu^{\mathrm{SAS}}_{\mathbb{Z}^3} \leq 17.11728$.</description>

      <title>A systematic search for conformal field theories in very small spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Groundstates of 1+1d conformal field theories (CFTs) satisfy a local entropic condition called the vector fixed point equation. This condition is surprisingly well satisfied by groundstates of quantum critical lattice models even at small system sizes. We perform a search in the space of states of very small systems (four qubits and four qutrits) and examine the states that satisfy this condition. By reconstructing a local Hamiltonian from each state, we are able to identify many of these solutions with known CFTs; others are gapped fixed points, or involve large relevant perturbations, and others are CFTs we have not yet identified. These ideas are also useful for identifying continuous quantum phase transitions in a given family of Hamiltonians, and for identifying the nature of the critical theory in small systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent odd viscoelasticity in chiral soft glassy materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rheological properties of chiral active materials have been an important area of research in the recent past, in particular regarding odd terms in their mechanical response. While much progress has been made in the study of odd viscous fluids and odd elastic solids, there is still a lack of understanding of odd viscoelastic responses. We introduce a chiral soft glassy rheology model to understand the emergence and nature of such odd viscoelastic responses in a class of amorphous solids. We use this model, which effectively considers an ensemble of actively rotating inclusions in a glassy matrix, to study the linear stress response to steady and oscillatory shear flows. For steady shear we find an odd viscosity that, non-trivially, grows as the active rotation frequency {\Omega} decreases. In oscillatory shear we find an odd viscoelastic spectrum with a non-trivial dependence on the driving frequency {\omega}, combining resonance effects around {\omega} = 2{\Omega} with glassy power laws at larger {\omega}.</description>

      <title>Glassy interphases reinforce elastomeric nanocomposites by enhancing percolation-driven volume expansion under strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For nearly a century, introduction of nanoparticles to elastomers has yielded extraordinarily tough nanocomposites that are critical to technologies from actuators to tires. The mechanisms by which this reinforcement occurs have nevertheless remained a central open question in material science. One widely debated hypothesis posits that strong interactions between polymer and particles induce "glassy bridges" that cement particles into a cohesive percolating network that resists elongation. Here, molecular dynamics simulations show that glassy particle shells do not primarily provide elongational cohesion. Instead, they amplify an underlying mechanism wherein competition between filler and elastomer networks causes the elastomer's volume to increase on deformation. This induces contributions from the elastomer's bulk modulus, which is of order 1000 times larger than its Young's modulus. These findings establish a unified understanding of low-strain reinforcement in filled elastomers as emanating from volumetric competition between coexisting particulate and elastomeric networks. This reframes and unifies our understanding of low-strain reinforcement, provides a clear-cut diagnostic for the presence of glassy bridging, and offers a new design principle for tough elastomeric nanocomposites.</description>

      <title>Universal properties and dynamical bosonization of strongly interacting one-dimensional $p$-wave anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional system of strongly interacting anyons with short-range interactions under external confinement. This system, referred to as $p$-wave anyons, interpolates continuously between spin-polarized fermions with $p$-wave interactions and free bosons. At zero temperature, the correlation functions decay exponentially with distance, with oscillations governed by the statistics parameter. The decay rate is maximal for $p$-wave fermions and decreases monotonically as the statistics parameter approaches the bosonic limit, where it vanishes. The momentum distribution is asymmetric, a hallmark of one-dimensional anyons, and takes the form of a shifted Lorentzian with universal power-law tails, $\lim_{k \to \pm \infty} n(k)\sim C/k^2$. We prove analytically that, following release from a harmonic trap, the asymptotic momentum distribution converges to that of free bosons in the same trap, a phenomenon known as dynamical bosonization. We also establish the universality of the groundstate $n$-particle reduced density matrices: their natural occupations are independent of the confining potential, while the associated natural $n$-functions for different confinements are related through a simple analytical transformation. In particular, for the one-particle reduced density matrix, we derive exact expressions for both the natural occupations and the natural orbitals at arbitrary particle number. These results extend and unify earlier partial findings for $p$-wave fermions, and they provide a clear conceptual explanation of the double degeneracy observed in their spectrum.</description>

Abstract: Efficiency and power are two central measures of the performance of thermal machines. We here study the power-efficiency-stability trade-off in a finite-time quantum Carnot information engine, in which an information reservoir replaces the usual cold bath of a quantum Carnot engine. We analytically evaluate mean and variance of the work output, and demonstrate that maximum efficiency can be reached at both finite work output and finite work output fluctuations. We additionally show that the relative work output fluctuations may be smaller than those of the corresponding Carnot heat engine. This result implies that the finite-time quantum Carnot information engine can be more stable than the quantum Carnot heat engine, an important property for practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most fundamental quests in the physics of active matter concerns the existence of a comprehensive theory for its macroscopic properties, i.e. an ``active thermodynamics''. Here, we derive and experimentally verify key elements of the active thermodynamics of ideal chiral active gases, unveiling edge currents and odd diffusivity as their peculiar features. Our main results are the derivation of an equation of state relating density and pressure via a chirality-dependent effective temperature, the derivation of Fick's law including the full diffusion matrix predicting odd diffusion, and the exact prediction of edge currents at container walls that nonmonotonically depend on chirality.</description>

Abstract: Natural flocks (aligned) and swarms (non-aligned) both exhibit features of criticality, challenging their treatment as two ends of the same phase transition. We present a model for the cohesion of active individuals, who spontaneously self-assemble into a near-critical state, whether aligned or not. In our framework, these individuals move in open space and possess differing self-propelling velocities. The emerging velocity fluctuations, shown to be correlated and scale-invariant, are triggered by inherent noise rooted in individual imperfections. Using the finite-size scaling theory, we show that our system exhibits criticality features observed in groups of midges and starlings.</description>

      <title>A strong-weak duality for the 1d long-range Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the one-dimensional Ising model with long-range interactions decaying as $1/r^{1+s}$. In the critical regime, for $1/2 \leq s \leq 1$, this system realizes a family of nontrivial one-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs), whose data vary continuously with $s$. For $s&gt;1$ the model has instead no phase transition at finite temperature, as in the short-range case. In the standard field-theoretic description, involving a generalized free field with quartic interactions, the critical model is weakly coupled near $s=1/2$ but strongly coupled in the vicinity of the short-range crossover at $s=1$. We introduce a dual formulation that becomes weakly coupled as $s \to 1$. Precisely at $s=1$, the dual description becomes an exactly solvable conformal boundary condition of the two-dimensional free scalar. We present a detailed study of the dual model and demonstrate its effectiveness by computing perturbatively the CFT data near $s=1$, up to next-to-next-to-leading order in $1-s$, by two independent approaches: (i) standard renormalization of our dual field-theoretic description and (ii) the analytic conformal bootstrap. The two methods yield complete agreement.</description>

      <title>Universal scale-free decay of tracer-bath correlations in $d$-dimensional interacting particle systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09326v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantifying the correlations between the position of a tagged tracer and the density of surrounding bath particles is crucial for understanding tracer diffusion in interacting particle systems, and for characterizing the response properties of the bath. We address this problem analytically for both hard-core and soft-core interactions, using minimal yet paradigmatic models in $d$ spatial dimensions. In both cases, we derive analytical expressions for the spatial correlation profiles in the reference frame of the tracer. We reveal unexpected universal features in their large-distance behavior, characterized by power-law tails with exponents that depend solely on the spatial dimensionality of the system. Beyond these simple models, we demonstrate the robustness of our results across different regimes using particle-based numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an analytic approach for the steady-state dynamics of Markov processes on locally tree-like graphs. It is based on time-translation invariant probability distributions for edge trajectories, which we encode in terms of infinite matrix products. For homogeneous ensembles on regular graphs, the distribution is parametrized by a single $d\times d\times r^2$ tensor, where $r$ is the number of states per variable, and $d$ is the matrix-product bond dimension. While the method becomes exact in the large-$d$ limit, it typically provides highly accurate results even for small bond dimensions $d$. The $d^2r^2$ parameters are determined by solving a fixed point equation, for which we provide an efficient belief-propagation procedure. We apply this approach to a variety of models, including Ising-Glauber dynamics with symmetric and asymmetric couplings, as well as the SIS model. Even for small $d$, the results are compatible with Monte Carlo estimates and accurately reproduce known exact solutions. The method provides access to precise temporal correlations, which, in some regimes, would be virtually impossible to estimate by sampling.</description>

      <title>Quantum fluctuations can enhance or reduce positional uncertainty at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16822v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The uncertainty principle guarantees a non-zero value for the positional uncertainty, $\left\langle \Delta x^2\right\rangle &gt; 0$, even without thermal fluctuations. This implies that quantum fluctuations inherently enhance positional uncertainty at zero temperature. A natural question then arises: what happens at finite temperatures, where the interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations may give rise to complex and intriguing behaviors? To address this question, we systematically investigate the positional uncertainty, $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle$, of a particle in equilibrium confined within a nonlinear potential of the form $V(x) \propto x^n$, where $n = 2, 4, 6, \dots$ represents an even exponent. Using path integral Monte Carlo simulations, we calculate $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle$ in equilibrium as a function of the thermal de Broglie wavelength $\Lambda$. Interestingly, for large values of $n$, $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle$ exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on $\Lambda$: it initially decreases with increasing $\Lambda$ at small $\Lambda$ but increases at larger $\Lambda$. To further understand this behavior, we employ a semiclassical approximation, which reveals that quantum fluctuations can reduce positional uncertainty for small $\Lambda$ when the nonlinearity of the potential is sufficiently strong. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of this result for many-body phenomena driven by strong nonlinear interactions, such as glass transitions, where the transition densities exhibit a similar non-monotonic dependence on $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching at Scale: A Machine Learning Framework for Efficient Large-Size Sampling of Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15318v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a machine learning framework based on Flow Matching to overcome the scaling limitations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We demonstrate its capability in the 2D XY model, where a single network, trained only on configurations from a small ($32\times 32$) lattice at sparse temperature points, generates reliable samples for a significantly larger system ($128\times 128$) across a continuous temperature range without retraining. The generated configurations show strong agreement with key thermodynamic observables and correctly capture the signatures of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. This dual generalization is enabled by the Flow Matching framework, which allows us to learn a continuous, temperature-conditioned mapping. At the same time, the inductive biases of the underlying CNN architecture ensure that the learned local physical rules are scale-invariant. This "train-small, generate-large" capability offers a powerful and efficient alternative for studying critical phenomena. The method can be directly applied to other classical or quantum many-body systems described by continuous fields on a lattice. Furthermore, this framework can serve as a powerful proposal generator in a hybrid scheme with MCMC, dramatically accelerating high-precision studies of the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Aging of glass-forming materials following a temperature jump</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physical aging is one of the non-equilibrium phenomena where physical properties change over time due to structural relaxation. Aging in spin glass systems has been explained by a trap model on the temperature-independent energy landscape. Meanwhile, in the free energy landscape (FEL) approach to aging phenomena, it is assumed that the FEL responds to temperature changes with a time delay. In this paper, aging in a glass forming model in which both the trapping effect and the delayed response of the FEL exist is studied after the temperature is changed. It is confirmed that the trapping effect gives rise to Type-I aging where the relaxation time increases with waiting time regardless of the direction of temperature change, and that the delayed response of the FEL produces Type-II aging where the waiting-time dependence of the relaxation time depends on the direction of temperature change. When both effects exist and the response time of the FEL is appropriate, these effects can be differentiated in the short-time behavior of the temporal relaxation time. It is argued that the material time or the internal clock and the fictive temperature introduced phenomenologically are understood as the concepts describing the delayed response of the FEL to temperature change.</description>

Abstract: We analytically study isothermal spheres in the light of nonextensive statistical mechanics. The equations for the isothermal spheres are derived from the grand partition function of the gravitating particle system in the Tsallis statistical mechanics. The effect of nonextensive statistics appears in relatively dense state, which appears at the center of the isothermal sphere. The stability of the isothermal sphere in the general relativistic system is found to be sensitive to the parameter q in the Tsallis statistics.</description>

      <title>Fractal decompositions and tensor network representations of Bethe wavefunctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00923v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement structure of a generic $M$-particle Bethe wavefunction (not necessarily an eigenstate of an integrable model) on a 1d lattice by dividing the lattice into $L$ parts and decomposing the wavefunction into a sum of products of $L$ local wavefunctions. Using the fact that a Bethe wavefunction accepts a \textit{fractal} multipartite decomposition -- it can always be written as a linear combination of $L^M$ products of $L$ local wavefunctions, where each local wavefunction is in turn also a Bethe wavefunction -- we then build \textit{exact, analytical} tensor network representations with finite bond dimension $\chi=2^M$, for a generic planar tree tensor network (TTN), which includes a matrix product states (MPS) and a regular binary TTN as prominent particular cases. For a regular binary tree, the network has depth $\log_{2}(N/M)$ and can be transformed into an adaptive quantum circuit of the same depth, composed of unitary gates acting on $2^M$-dimensional qudits and mid-circuit measurements, that deterministically prepares the Bethe wavefunction. Finally, we put forward a much larger class of \textit{generalized} Bethe wavefunctions, for which the above decompositions, tensor network and quantum circuit representations are also possible.</description>

      <title>System-environmental entanglement in critical spin systems under $ZZ$-decoherence and its relation to strong and weak symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open quantum many-body systems exhibit nontrivial behavior under decoherence. In particular, system-environmental entanglement (SEE) is one of the efficient quantities for classifying mixed states subject to decoherence. In this work, we investigate the SEE of critical spin chains under nearest-neighbor $ZZ$-decoherence. We numerically show that the SEE exhibits a specific scaling law, in particular, its system-size-independent term (``$g$-function'') changes drastically its behavior in the vicinity of phase transition caused by decoherence. For the XXZ model in its gapless regime, a transition diagnosed by strong R\'{e}nyi-2 correlations occurs as the strength of the decoherence increases. We determine the location of the phase transition by investigating the $g$-function that exhibits a sharp change in the critical region of the transition. Furthermore, we find that the value of the SEE is twice that of the system under single-site $Z$-decoherence, which was recently studied by conformal field theory. From the viewpoint of R\'{e}nyi-2 Shannon entropy}, which is closely related to the SEE at the maximal decoherence, we clarify the origin of this $g$-function behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the different degrees of freedom underlying far-from-equilibrium scaling behaviour in a relativistic, single-component $\mathrm{O}(1)$ scalar field theory in two and three spatial dimensions. In such a strongly correlated many-body system, identifying the respective roles of nonlinear wave excitations and defect dynamics is a prerequisite for understanding the universal character of time evolution far from equilibrium and thus the different possible universality classes of nonthermal fixed points. Using unequal-time two-point correlation functions, we extract information about the dominant infrared excitations and study their connections to the turbulent dynamics of topological defects created in the system. In three dimensions, the primary excitations are identified as kelvon quasiparticles, which are quantised Kelvin waves propagating along vortex lines, while in two dimensions, vortices are point defects, and the infrared dynamics is dominated by bound-state like excitations similar to Kelvin waves. In both cases, the kelvon excitations are found to be characterised by distinct time-evolving dispersion relations, subject to the coarsening dynamics close to the respective nonthermal fixed point and, thus, to the decay of superfluid turbulence in the system. Our results underline the role of topological defects and their influence on the universal dynamics of strongly correlated systems near nonthermal fixed points, complementing the analysis of large-$N$ models in $\mathrm{O}(N)$ systems.</description>

Abstract: Feedback cooling plays a critical role in stabilizing quantum systems and achieving low temperatures, where a key question is to determine the fundamental thermodynamic limits on cooling performance. We establish a fundamental bound on quantum feedback cooling in Gaussian systems, by deriving a generalized second law of thermodynamics involving the kinetic temperatures of the system and a measure of quantum information flow obtained by continuous measurement. In contrast to previously known bounds, the obtained bound can be saturated by experimentally feasible situations using the quantum Kalman filter with a large feedback gain, where the cooling efficiency approaches its maximum. Our theoretical result is numerically demonstrated using parameters from an experiment of levitated nanoparticles. Our theory provides a general framework for understanding the thermodynamic constraints on quantum feedback cooling.</description>

Abstract: We propose a general necessary condition for a spin chain with SO(3) spin-rotation symmetry to be gapped. Specifically, we prove that the ground state(s) of an SO(3)-symmetric gapped spin chain must be spin singlet(s), and the expectation value of a twisting operator asymptotically approaches unity in the thermodynamic limit, where finite-size corrections are inversely proportional to the system size. This theorem provides (i) supporting evidence for various conjectured gapped phases, and (ii) a sufficient criterion for identifying gapless spin chains. We verify our theorem by numerical simulations for a variety of spin models and show that it offers a novel efficient way to identify gapless phases in spin chains with spin-rotation symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brownian motion near soft surfaces is a situation widely encountered in nanoscale and biological physics. However, a complete theoretical description is lacking to date. Here, we theoretically investigate the dynamics of a two-dimensional colloid in an arbitrary external potential and near a soft surface. The latter is minimally modelled by a Winkler's foundation, and we restrict the study to the colloidal motion in the direction perpendicular to the surface. We start from deterministic hydrodynamic considerations, by invoking the already-established leading-order soft-lubrication forces acting on the particle. Importantly, a negative softness-induced and position-dependent added mass is identified. We then incorporate thermal fluctuations in the description. In particular, an effective Hamiltonian formulation is introduced and a temperature-dependent generalized potential is constructed in order to ensure equilibrium properties for the colloidal position. From these considerations and the Fokker-Planck equation, we then derive the relevant Langevin equation, which self-consistently allows to recover the deterministic equation of motion at zero temperature. Interestingly, besides an expected multiplicative-noise feature, the noise correlator appears to be modified by the surface softness. Moreover, a softness-induced temperature-dependent spurious drift term has to be incorporated within the Ito prescription. Finally, using numerical simulations with various initial conditions and parameter values, we statistically analyze the trajectories of the particle when placed within a harmonic trap and in presence of the soft surface. This allows us to: i) quantify further the influence of surface softness, through the added mass, which enhances the velocity fluctuations; and ii) show that intermediate-time diffusion is unaffected by softness, within the assumptions of the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum Fisher information, the quantum analogue of the classical Fisher information, is a central quantity in quantum metrology and quantum sensing due to its connection to parameter estimation and fidelity susceptibility. Using numerically exact methods applied to a paradigmatic open quantum system, the spin-boson model, we calculate both static and dynamical quantum Fisher information matrix elements with respect to spin-bath couplings and magnetic field strengths. As the spin-bath interaction increases, we first show that the coupling-coupling matrix elements relative to the ground state of the Hamiltonian are linked to the entanglement growth and signal the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition through their non-monotonic behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the time-dependent matrix elements can reveal non-Markovian effects as well as the transition from the coherent to incoherent regime at the Toulouse point, remaining robust under pure dephasing noise. Non-monotonic signatures of the quantum Fisher information matrix reflect changes in quantum resources such as entanglement and coherence, quantify non-Markovian behavior, and enable criticality-enhanced quantum sensing, thereby shedding light on key features of open quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: We derive the asymptotic expansion of the partition function of a Coulomb gas system in the determinantal case on compact Riemann surfaces of any genus g. Our main tool is the bosonization formula relating the analytic torsion and geometric quantities including the Green functions appearing in the definition of this partition function. As a result, we prove the geometric version of the Zabrodin-Wiegmann conjecture in the determinantal case.</description>

      <title>Finite-time consensus in a compromise process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01024</link>

Abstract: A compromise process describes the evolution of opinions through binary interactions. Opinions are real numbers, and in each step, two randomly selected agents reach a compromise by acquiring the average of their pre-interaction opinions. We prove that if the number $N$ of agents is a power of two, then consensus emerges after a finite number of compromise events with probability one; otherwise, consensus cannot be reached in a finite number of steps, provided the initial opinions are in a general position. Furthermore, the number of steps required to reach consensus is random for $N=2^k$ with $k\geq 2$. We prove that typically, the smallest number of steps to reach consensus is $k\cdot 2^{k-1}$. For $N=4$, we determine the distribution of the number of steps: we show that it has a purely exponential tail and compute all cumulants.</description>

      <title>Unilateral Criticality and Phase Transition in the Cavity-Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superradiant phase transitions from cavity light-matter coupling have been widely explored across platforms. Here, we report a unilateral critical endpoint (UCEP) and a tricritical point (TCP) in the phase diagram of the cavity-coupled transverse Ising model with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. At zero temperature, we demonstrate that this model hosts three phases separated by two second-order and one first-order transitions. These lines intersect at a TCP and a UCEP, the latter not captured by existing phase-transition paradigms. The UCEP displays one-sided criticality: approaching the point from one side, the system behaves as a second-order transition, while from the other side it is first-order. Correspondingly, two order parameters, respectively, undergo the first- and the second-order phase transitions at the same point. We construct a minimal description of UCEP with the density of the free energy $f = c_{1}(\tilde{\alpha}^{2}+c_{2})+(\tilde{\alpha}^{2}+c_{2})^{2}\ln{\vert\tilde{\alpha}^{2}+c_{2}\vert}$, with the UCEP at $(c_{1},c_{2})=(1/e,0)$ and $\tilde{\alpha}$ being the order parameter. We further map the finite-temperature phase diagram and perform a symmetry analysis. By unifying first- and second-order signatures in a single, direction-dependent endpoint, the UCEP introduces a qualitatively new class of phase transition and may have applications in fields such as quantum measurement and quantum sensing. This work also provides an intriguing platform for exploring novel critical phenomena in cavity-coupled many-body systems with or without dissipation.</description>
