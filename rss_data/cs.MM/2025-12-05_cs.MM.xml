      <title>MindFuse: Towards GenAI Explainability in Marketing Strategy Co-Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The future of digital marketing lies in the convergence of human creativity and generative AI, where insight, strategy, and storytelling are co-authored by intelligent systems. We present MindFuse, a brave new explainable generative AI framework designed to act as a strategic partner in the marketing process. Unlike conventional LLM applications that stop at content generation, MindFuse fuses CTR-based content AI-guided co-creation with large language models to extract, interpret, and iterate on communication narratives grounded in real advertising data. MindFuse operates across the full marketing lifecycle: from distilling content pillars and customer personas from competitor campaigns to recommending in-flight optimizations based on live performance telemetry. It uses attention-based explainability to diagnose ad effectiveness and guide content iteration, while aligning messaging with strategic goals through dynamic narrative construction and storytelling. We introduce a new paradigm in GenAI for marketing, where LLMs not only generate content but reason through it, adapt campaigns in real time, and learn from audience engagement patterns. Our results, validated in agency deployments, demonstrate up to 12 times efficiency gains, setting the stage for future integration with empirical audience data (e.g., GWI, Nielsen) and full-funnel attribution modeling. MindFuse redefines AI not just as a tool, but as a collaborative agent in the creative and strategic fabric of modern marketing.</description>

      <title>What is Beyond Presence? Dimensionality, Control, and Information Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What is after presence? Spatial presence, the sense of "being there", is becoming less of a primary objective and more of a baseline expectation of virtual reality. More than six decades after its invention, VR is shifting from a technical system into a cultural, social, and phenomenological medium, offering experiences that function as distinct modes of reality. Existing theories that focus primarily on perceptual illusions are no longer sufficient to account for these emerging forms of experience. A new framework is needed to guide the design and evaluation of immersive environments by identifying the key technical and abstract dimensions afforded by virtual worlds. These dimensions include spatial, placeness, temporal, social, cultural, cognitive, and psychological parameters. The central argument is that immersive environments must move beyond the technical dimension to leverage richer information channels that shape user experience. This shift from presence to experience orchestration invites creators across disciplines to contribute to the design and assessment of meaningful immersive worlds.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Markup Document Models for Graphic Design Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce MarkupDM, a multimodal markup document model that represents graphic design as an interleaved multimodal document consisting of both markup language and images. Unlike existing holistic approaches that rely on an element-by-attribute grid representation, our representation accommodates variable-length elements, type-dependent attributes, and text content. Inspired by fill-in-the-middle training in code generation, we train the model to complete the missing part of a design document from its surrounding context, allowing it to treat various design tasks in a unified manner. Our model also supports image generation by predicting discrete image tokens through a specialized tokenizer with support for image transparency. We evaluate MarkupDM on three tasks, attribute value, image, and text completion, and demonstrate that it can produce plausible designs consistent with the given context. To further illustrate the flexibility of our approach, we evaluate our approach on a new instruction-guided design completion task where our instruction-tuned MarkupDM compares favorably to state-of-the-art image editing models, especially in textual completion. These findings suggest that multimodal language models with our document representation can serve as a versatile foundation for broad design automation.</description>

      <title>"I Can See Forever!": Evaluating Real-time VideoLLMs for Assisting Individuals with Visual Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The visually impaired population faces significant challenges in daily activities. While prior works employ vision language models for assistance, most focus on static content and cannot address real-time perception needs in complex environments. Recent VideoLLMs enable real-time vision and speech interaction, offering promising potential for assistive tasks. In this work, we conduct the first study evaluating their effectiveness in supporting daily life for visually impaired individuals. We first conducted a user survey with visually impaired participants to design the benchmark VisAssistDaily for daily life evaluation. Using VisAssistDaily, we evaluate popular VideoLLMs and find GPT-4o achieves the highest task success rate. We further conduct a user study to reveal concerns about hazard perception. To address this, we propose SafeVid, an environment-awareness dataset, and fine-tune VITA-1.5, improving risk recognition accuracy from 25.00% to 76.00%.We hope this work provides valuable insights and inspiration for future research in this field.</description>
