      <title>Metal pollution in Sun-like stars from destruction of ultra-short-period planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical evidence indicates that an appreciable fraction of Sun-like stars have engulfed rocky planets during their main-sequence lifetimes. We investigate whether the tidal evolution and destruction of ultra-short-period planets (USPs) can explain this phenomenon. We develop a simple parameterized model for the formation and engulfment of USPs in a population of MS stars. With this model, it is possible to reproduce both the observed occurrence rate of USPs and the frequency of planet-engulfing Sun-like stars for a reasonable range of USP formation rates and tidal decay lifetimes. Our results support a theory of USP formation through gradual inward migration over many Gyr and suggest that engulfment occurs $\sim 0.1$-$1 \, {\rm Gyr}$ after formation. This lifetime is set by tidal dissipation in the USP itself instead of the host star, due to the perturbing influence of external companions. If USP engulfment is the main source of pollution among Sun-like stars, we predict a correlation between pollution and compact multi-planet systems; some $5$-$10\%$ of polluted stars should have a transiting planet of mass $\gtrsim 5 M_{\oplus}$ and period $\sim 4$-$12$ days.</description>

      <title>SCExAO/CHARIS Near-Infrared Scattered-Light Imaging and Integral Field Spectropolarimetry of the AB Aurigae Protoplanetary System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze near-infrared integral field spectropolarimetry of the AB Aurigae protoplanetary disk and protoplanet (AB Aur b), obtained with SCExAO/CHARIS in 22 wavelength channels covering the J, H, and K passbands ($\lambda_{\rm o}$ = 1.1--2.4 $\mu m$) over angular separations of $\rho$ $\approx$ 0.13" to 1.1" ($\sim$20--175 au). Our images resolve spiral structures in the disk in each CHARIS channel. At the longest wavelengths, the data may reveal an extension of the western spiral seen in previous polarimetric data at $\rho$ $&lt;$ 0.3" out to larger distances clockwise from the protoplanet AB Aur b, coincident with the ALMA-detected $CO$ gas spiral. While AB Aur b is detectable in complementary total intensity data, it is a non-detection in polarized light at $\lambda$ $&gt;$ 1.3 $\mu $m. While the observed disk color is extremely red across $JHK$, the disk has a blue intrinsic scattering color consistent with small dust grains. The disk's polarization spectrum is redder than AB Aur b's total intensity spectrum. The polarization fraction peaks at $\sim$ 0.6 along the major disk axis. Radiative transfer modeling of the CHARIS data shows that small, porous dust grains with a porosity of $p$ = 0.6--0.8 better reproduce the scattered-light appearance of the disk than more compact spheres ($p$ = 0.3), especially the polarization fraction. This work demonstrates the utility of integral field spectropolarimetry to characterize structures in protoplanetary disks and elucidate the properties of the disks' dust.</description>

      <title>TESS Hunt for Young and Maturing Exoplanets (THYME) XII: A Young Mini-Neptune on the Upper Edge of the Radius Valley in the Hyades Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11990v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery and characterization of TOI-4364\,b, a young mini-Neptune in the tidal tails of the Hyades cluster, identified through TESS transit observations and ground-based follow-up photometry. The planet orbits a bright M dwarf ($K=9.1$\,mag) at a distance of 44\,pc, with an orbital period of 5.42\,days and an equilibrium temperature of $488^{+4}_{-4}$\,K. The host star's well-constrained age of 710\,Myr makes TOI-4364\,b an exceptional target for studying early planetary evolution around low-mass stars. We determined a planetary radius of $2.01^{+0.1}_{-0.08}$\,Earth radii, indicating that this planet is situated near the upper edge of the radius valley. This suggests that the planet retains a modest H/He envelope. As a result, TOI-4364\,b provides a unique opportunity to explore the transition between rocky super-Earths and gas-rich mini-Neptunes at the early stages of evolution. Its radius, which may still evolve as a result of ongoing atmospheric cooling, contraction, and photoevaporation, further enhances its significance for understanding planetary development. Furthermore, TOI-4364\,b possesses a moderately high Transmission Spectroscopy Metric of 44.2, positioning it as a viable candidate for atmospheric characterization with instruments such as JWST. This target has the potential to offer crucial insights into atmospheric retention and loss in young planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Global Simulations of Gravitational Instability in Protostellar Disks with Full Radiation Transport. I. Stochastic Fragmentation with Optical-depth-dependent Rate and Universal Fragment Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fragmentation in a gravitationally unstable accretion disk can be an important pathway for forming stellar/planetary companions. To characterize quantitatively the condition for and outcome of fragmentation under realistic thermodynamics, we perform global 3D simulations of gravitationally unstable disks at various cooling rates and cooling types, including the first global simulations of gravitational instability that employ full radiation transport. We find that fragmentation is a stochastic process, with the fragment generation rate per disk area $p_{\rm frag}$ showing an exponential dependence on the parameter $\beta\equiv\Omega_K t_{cool}$, where $\Omega_K$ is the Keplerian rotation frequency and $t_{cool}$ is the average cooling timescale. Compared to a prescribed constant $\beta$, radiative cooling in the optically thin/thick regime makes $p_{\rm frag}$ decrease slower/faster in $\beta$; the critical $\beta$ corresponding to $\sim 1$ fragment per orbit is $\approx$3, 5, 2 for constant $\beta$, optically thin, and optically thick cooling, respectively. The distribution function of the initial fragment mass is remarkably insensitive to disk thermodynamics. Regardless of cooling rate and optical depth, the typical initial fragment mass is $m_{frag} \approx 40 M_{tot}h^3$, with $M_{tot}$ being the total (star+disk) mass and $h=H/R$ being the disk aspect ratio. Applying this result to typical Class 0/I protostellar disks, we find $m_{frag}\sim 20 M_J$, suggesting that fragmentation more likely forms brown dwarfs. Given the finite width of the $m_{frag}$ distribution, forming massive planets is also possible.</description>

      <title>Most High-density Exoplanets Are Unlikely to Be Remnant Giant-planet Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some exoplanets have much higher densities than expected from stellar abundances of planet-forming elements. There are two theories - metal-rich formation hypothesis and naked core hypothesis - that explain how formation and evolution can alter the compositions and structures of rocky planets to diverge from their primordial building blocks. Here, we revisit the naked core hypothesis, which states that high-density planets are remnant cores of giant planets that remain in a fossil-compressed state, even after envelope loss. Using a planetary interior model and assuming energy-limited atmospheric escape, we show that a large fraction, if not all, of the iron-silicate core of a giant planet is molten during the planet's early evolution. Upon envelope loss, molten part of the planets can rapidly rebound due to low viscosity, resulting in a decrease in radius by at most 0.06%, if they had hydrogen/helium envelopes, or by at most 7%, if they had H$_2$O envelopes, compared to self-compressed counterparts with the same core mass fraction. Based on our findings, we reject the hypothesis that all high-density exoplanets are naked cores with Kolmogorov-Smirnov p-value $\ll$ 0.05 for both envelope compositions. We find that some high-density exoplanets can still possibly be naked cores, but the probabilities are lower than $\sim$1/2 and $\sim$1/3 for the ice giant and gas giant scenario, respectively, in 95% of the cases. We conclude that most high-density exoplanets are unlikely to be remnant giant-planets cores.</description>

      <title>A Gaussian process model for stellar activity in 2-D line profile time-series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar active regions like spots and faculae can distort the shapes of spectral lines, inducing variations in the radial velocities that are often orders of magnitude larger than the signals from Earth-like planets. Efforts to mitigate these activity signals have hitherto focused on either the time or the velocity (wavelength) domains. We present a physics-driven Gaussian process (GP) framework to model activity signals directly in time series of line profiles or Cross-Correlation Functions (CCFs). Unlike existing methods which correct activity signals in line profile time series, our approach exploits the time correlation between velocity (wavelength) bins in the line profile variations, and is based on a simplified but physically motivated model for the origin of these variations. When tested on both synthetic and real data sets with signal-to-noise ratios down to $\sim$ 100, our method was able to separate the planetary signal from the activity signal, even when their periods were identical. We also conducted injection/recovery tests using two years of realistically sampled HARPS-N solar data, demonstrating the ability of the method to accurately recover a signal induced by a 1.5-Earth mass planet with a semi-amplitude of 0.3 m/s and a period of 33 days during high solar activity.</description>

      <title>Signature of Vertical Mixing in Hydrogen-dominated Exoplanet Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertical mixing is a crucial disequilibrium process in exoplanet atmospheres, significantly impacting chemical abundance and observed spectra. While current state-of-the-art observations have detected its signatures, the effect of vertical mixing on atmospheric spectra varies widely based on planetary parameters. In this study, we explore the influence of disequilibrium chemistry across a parameter space that includes eddy diffusion, surface gravity, internal and equilibrium temperature, and metallicity. We also assess the effectiveness of retrieval models in constraining the eddy diffusion coefficient. By running numerous 1D chemical kinetics models, we investigate the impact of vertical mixing on the transmission spectrum. We also built a custom fast-forward disequilibrium model, which includes vertical mixing using the quenching approximation and calculates the model abundance orders of magnitude faster than the chemical kinetics model. We coupled this forward model with an open source atmospheric retrieval code and used it on the JWST simulated output data of our chemical kinetics model and retrieved eddy diffusion coefficient, internal temperature and atmospheric metallicity. We find that there is a narrow region in the parameters space in which vertical mixing has a large effect on the atmospheric transmission spectrum. In this region of the parameter space, the retrieval model can put high constraints on the transport strength and provide optimal exoplanets to study vertical mixing. Also, the NH3 abundance can be used to constrain the internal temperature for equilibrium temperature T_equi &gt; 1400 K.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Stability of the Laplace Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the stability of the de Sitter equilibria in multi-resonant planetary systems. The de Sitter equilibrium is the dynamical state of the Laplace resonance in which all resonant arguments are librating. The sequence of equilibria exists all along the possible states balancing resonance offsets and forced eccentricities. Possible additional new-de Sitter equilibria may exist when at least one of the forced eccentricities is large (the paradigmatic case is Gliese-876). In the present work, these families of equilibria are traced up to crossing exact commensurability, where approximate first-order solutions diverge. Explicit exact location of the equilibria are determined allowing us to verify the Lyapunov stability of the standard de Sitter equilibrium and of the stable branches of the additional ones.</description>

      <title>The cool brown dwarf Gliese 229 B is a close binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Owing to their similarities with giant exoplanets, brown dwarf companions of stars provide insights into the fundamental processes of planet formation and evolution. From their orbits, several brown dwarf companions are found to be more massive than theoretical predictions given their luminosities and the ages of their host stars (e.g. Brandt et al. 2021, Cheetham et al. 2018, Li et al. 2023). Either the theory is incomplete or these objects are not single entities. For example, they could be two brown dwarfs each with a lower mass and intrinsic luminosity (Brandt et al. 2021, Howe et al. 2024). The most problematic example is Gliese 229 B (Nakajima et al. 1995, Oppenheimer et al. 1995), which is at least 2-6 times less luminous than model predictions given its dynamical mass of $71.4\pm0.6$ Jupiter masses ($M_{\rm Jup}$) (Brandt et al. 2021). We observed Gliese 229 B with the GRAVITY interferometer and, separately, the CRIRES+ spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope. Both sets of observations independently resolve Gliese 229 B into two components, Gliese 229 Ba and Bb, settling the conflict between theory and observations. The two objects have a flux ratio of $0.47\pm0.03$ at a wavelength of 2 $\mu$m and masses of $38.1\pm1.0$ and $34.4\pm1.5$ $M_{\rm Jup}$, respectively. They orbit each other every 12.1 days with a semimajor axis of 0.042 astronomical units (AU). The discovery of Gliese 229 BaBb, each only a few times more massive than the most massive planets, and separated by 16 times the Earth-moon distance, raises new questions about the formation and prevalence of tight binary brown dwarfs around stars.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the Binarity of Gliese 229B, and Constraints on the System's Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present two epochs of radial velocities of the first imaged T dwarf Gliese 229B obtained with Keck/NIRSPEC. The two radial velocities are discrepant with one another, and with the radial velocity of the host star, at $\approx$$11\sigma$ significance. This points to the existence of a previously postulated, but as-yet undetected, massive companion to Gl 229B; we denote the two components as Gl 229Ba and Gl 229Bb. We compute the joint likelihood of the radial velocities to constrain the period and mass of the secondary companion. Our radial velocities are consistent with an orbital period between a few days and $\approx$60 days, and a secondary mass of at least $\approx$15\,$M_{\rm Jup}$ and up to nearly half the total system mass of Gl 229B. With a significant fraction of the system mass in a faint companion, the strong tension between Gl 229B's dynamical mass and the predictions of evolutionary models is resolved.</description>

      <title>Nearby Supernova and Cloud Crossing Effects on the Orbits of Small Bodies in the Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supernova blasts envelop many surrounding stellar systems, transferring kinetic energy to small bodies in the systems. Geologic evidence from $^{60}\rm Fe$ points to recent nearby supernova activity within the past several Myr. Here, we model the transfer of energy and resulting orbital changes from these supernova blasts to the Oort Cloud, the Kuiper belt, and Saturn's Phoebe ring. For the Oort Cloud, an impulse approximation shows that a 50 pc supernova can eject approximately half of all objects less than 1 cm while altering the trajectories of larger ones, depending on their orbital parameters. For stars closest to supernovae, objects up to $\sim$100 m can be ejected. Turning to the explored solar system, we find that supernovae closer than 50 pc may affect Saturn's Phoebe ring and can sweep away Kuiper belt dust. It is also possible that the passage of the solar system through a dense interstellar cloud could have a similar effect; a numerical trajectory simulation shows that the location of the dust grains and the direction of the wind (from a supernova or interstellar cloud) has a significant impact on whether or not the grains will become unbound from their orbit in the Kuiper belt. Overall, nearby supernovae sweep micron-sized dust from the solar system, though whether the grains are ultimately cast towards the Sun or altogether ejected depends on various factors. Evidence of supernova-modified dust grain trajectories may be observed by New Horizons, though further modeling efforts are required.</description>

Abstract: Accreting in the first few million years (Ma) of the Solar System, planetesimals record conditions in the protoplanetary disc and are the remnants of planetary formation processes. The meteorite paleomagnetic record carries key insights into the thermal history of planetesimals and their extent of differentiation. The current paradigm splits the meteorite paleomagnetic record into three magnetic field generation epochs: an early nebula field ($\lesssim$5 Ma after CAI formation), followed by thermal dynamos ($\sim$5-34 Ma after CAI formation), then a gap in dynamo generation, before the onset of core solidification and compositional dynamos. These epochs have been defined using current thermal evolution and dynamo generation models of planetesimals. Here, we demonstrate these epochs are not as distinct as previously thought based on refined thermal evolution models that include more realistic parametrisations for mantle convection, non-eutectic core solidification, and radiogenic $^{60}Fe$ in the core. We find thermal dynamos can start earlier and last longer. Inclusion of appreciable $^{60}Fe$ in the core brings forward the onset of dynamo generation to $\sim$1-2 Ma after CAI formation, which overlaps with the existence of the nebula field. The second epoch of dynamo generation begins prior to the onset of core solidification, suggesting this epoch is not purely compositionally driven. Planetesimal radius is the dominant control on the strength and duration of dynamo generation, and the choice of reference viscosity can widen the gap between epochs of dynamo generation from 0-200 Ma. Overall, variations in planetesimal properties lead to more variable timings of different planetesimal magnetic field generation mechanisms than previously thought. This alters the information we can glean from the meteorite paleomagnetic record about the early Solar System.</description>

      <title>Searching for small primordial black holes in planets, asteroids and here on Earth</title>

Abstract: Small primordial black holes could be captured by rocky planets or asteroids, consume their liquid cores from inside and leave hollow structures. We calculate the surface density and surface tension of a hollow structure around a black hole and compare them with the density and compressive strength of various materials that appear in nature to find the allowed parameter space. For example, granite or iron can support a hollow asteroid/planetoid/moon of the size of up to $0.1 R_\oplus$. Along the same lines, future civilizations might build spherical structures around black holes to harvest their energy. Using the strongest material that we currently know how to make (multiwall carbon nanotube), to withstand gravity of one solar mass black hole, the shell must be constructed at distances larger than $10^4 R_\odot$. Alternatively, a fast black hole can leave a narrow tunnel in a solid object while passing through it. For example, a $10^{22}$g black hole should leave a tunnel with a radius of $0.1$ micron, which is large enough to be seen by an optical microscope. We could look for such micro-tunnels here on Earth in very old rocks, or even glass or other solid structures in very old buildings. While our estimate gives a very small probability of finding such tunnels, looking for them does not require expensive equipment and long preparation, and the payoff might be significant.</description>

      <title>A network of cooler white dwarfs as infrared standards for flux calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06754</link>

Abstract: The accurate flux calibration of observational data is vital for astrophysics and cosmology because absolute flux uncertainties of stellar standards propagate into scientific results. With the ever higher precision achieved by telescopic missions (e.g. JWST) in the infrared (IR), suitable calibrators are required for this regime. The basis of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) flux scale is defined by model fits of three hot (Teff &gt; 30000 K) hydrogen-atmosphere (DA) white dwarfs, which achieve an accuracy better than 1 per cent at optical wavelengths but falls below this level in the IR range. We present a network of 17 cooler DA white dwarfs with Teff &lt; 20000 K as spectrophotometric flux standards that are equally, if not more, accurate at IR wavelengths. Cooler white dwarfs do not suffer from non-local thermal equilibrium (NLTE) effects in continuum flux or from UV metal line blanketing, have a larger sky density, are generally closer to Earth with little or negligible interstellar reddening, and have energy distributions peaking in the optical or near-IR. Using the latest grid of DA LTE atmosphere models with three-dimensional (3D) convection, the observed Space Telescope Imaging Spectrometer (STIS) and Wide Field Camera three (WFC3) fluxes of our network are accurate to 3 per cent over most of the range 1450 - 16000 AA, with a median standard deviation of 1.41 per cent. Fitting the HST STIS and WFC3 white dwarf SEDs and Balmer lines independently yields SEDs that agree within 3$\sigma$, which demonstrates the precision of the models for our network.</description>
