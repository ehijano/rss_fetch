      <title>Helium Range Viability for Online Range Probing in Mixed Carbon-Helium Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Recently, mixed carbon-helium beams were proposed for range verification in carbon ion therapy: Helium, with three times the range of carbon, serves as an on-line range probe, and is mixed into a therapeutic carbon beam. Purpose: Treatment monitoring is of special interest for lung cancer therapy, however the helium range might not always be sufficient to exit the patient distally. Therefore mixed beam use cases of several patient sites are considered. Methods: An extension to the open-source planning toolkit, matRad allows for calculation and optimization of mixed beam treatment plans. The use of the mixed beam method in 15 patients with lung cancer, as well as in a prostate and liver case, for various potential beam configurations was investigated. Planning strategies to optimize the residual helium range considering the sensitive energy range of the imaging detector were developed. A strategy involves adding helium to energies whose range is sufficient. Another one is to use range shifters to increase the helium energy and thus range. Results: In most patient cases, the residual helium range of at least one spot is too low. All investigated planning strategies can be used to ensure a high enough helium range while still keeping a low helium dose and a satisfactory total mixed carbon-helium beam dose. The use of range shifters allows for the detection of more spots. Conclusion: The mixed beam method shows promising results for online motioning. The use of range shifters ensures a high enough helium range and more detectable spots, allowing for a wider-spread application.</description>

      <title>Large speed-up of quantum emitter detection via extended Hong-Ou-Mandel interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum emitters are a key resource in quantum technologies, microscopy, and other applications. The ability to rapidly detect them is useful both for quality control in engineered emitter arrays and for high-contrast imaging of naturally occurring emitters. Using full photon-counting statistics and optimal Bayesian hypothesis testing, we show that extended Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between quantum emission and a coherent field enables orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in emitter detection under realistic noise and loss. Strikingly, the performance advantage improves as loss and background noise increase, and persists for incoherent emission. Our work offers a new approach to fast, low-intensity imaging and for emitter characterization in large-scale quantum systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital Twins hold great potential to personalize clinical patient care, provided the concept is translated to meet specific requirements dictated by established clinical workflows. We present a generalizable Digital Twin design combining knowledge graphs and ensemble learning to reflect the entire patient's clinical journey and assist clinicians in their decision-making. Such Digital Twins can be predictive, modular, evolving, informed, interpretable and explainable with applications ranging from oncology to epidemiology.</description>

      <title>Secondary spectrum after shieldings in x-ray rooms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10592v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Calculating the characteristics of radiation emerging from radiation shielding to determine the level of safety in protected areas has been a widely studied topic in Radiation Protection due to its importance for the protection of the public and professionals. Methods: This work provides spatial distributions of energy spectra of emergent photons after shielding barriers. These distributions are obtained through Monte Carlo simulations using monoenergetic pencil photon beams incident on shielding barriers of different materials and thicknesses. The obtained results are applied to calculate the spectra of transmitted radiation in cases of polyenergetic beams similar to those encountered in clinical practice. Results: The significant contribution of secondary radiation in the radiation found behind shields is demonstrated across a wide range of energies, barrier thicknesses and barrier materials. Conclusion: It is shown that characterizing shields using their response to monoenergetic pencil beams provides a useful tool for characterizing radiation behind shields in a wide range of practical situations.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Computational Feasibility of Direct Pseudoinversion of the Encoding Matrix for MR Image Reconstruction (Pinv-Recon)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image reconstruction in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is fundamentally a linear inverse problem, such that the image can be recovered via explicit pseudoinversion of the encoding matrix by solving $\textbf{data} = \textbf{Encode} \times \textbf{image}$ - a method referred to here as Pinv-Recon. While the benefits of this approach were acknowledged in early studies, the field has historically favored fast Fourier transforms (FFT) and iterative techniques due to perceived computational limitations of the pseudoinversion approach. This work revisits Pinv-Recon in the context of modern hardware, software, and optimized linear algebra routines. We compare various matrix inversion strategies, assess regularization effects, and demonstrate incorporation of advanced encoding physics into a unified reconstruction framework.
  While hardware advances have already significantly reduced computation time compared to earlier studies, our work further demonstrates that leveraging Cholesky decomposition and block-wise inversion leads to a two-order-of-magnitude improvement in computational efficiency over previous Singular Value Decomposition-based implementations. Moreover, we demonstrate the versatility of Pinv-Recon on diverse \textit{in vivo} datasets encompassing a range of encoding schemes, starting with low- to medium-resolution functional and metabolic imaging and extending to high-resolution cases. Our findings establish Pinv-Recon as a practical and adaptable reconstruction method that aligns with the increasing emphasis on open-source and reproducible MRI research.</description>

      <title>The Foundation for Developing an Exoskeleton for the Rehabilitation of Temporomandibular Disorders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporomandibular disorders affect a significant portion of the population, often causing pain and restricted jaw movement. Physiotherapy with active jaw exoskeletons seems to be a promising treatment approach. However, there has been limited progress in this area, with only a few studies published. The lack of detailed simulations and biomechanical jaw models in these papers impedes the design and validation of such devices. Thus, this work presents an open-source and extendable jaw model framework to support the development of jaw exoskeletons for TMD rehabilitation. The framework includes three model variants with varying complexity: a rigid body model with point-on-surface constraints, a rigid body model with mesh geometry constraints, and a hybrid model combining rigid dynamics with finite element methods. Model customization is facilitated through JSON configuration files, requiring minimal programming expertise. The framework was evaluated using experimental kinematic data from a single participant, with muscle excitations computed via PID controllers tuned through global optimization. The models successfully reproduced jaw movements without prior individualization, demonstrating their suitability for prototyping and studying exoskeleton behavior. The basic models are ideal for rapid prototyping, while the hybrid model provides insights into the effects of exoskeletons on the masticatory system. This framework establishes a foundation for advancing jaw exoskeleton development, with future work focusing on patient-specific modeling, improved anatomical detail, and tools for exoskeleton control and design. The framework code is publicly available and can be found at https://github.com/paulotto/exosim.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Efficient Cardiac Digital Twin from surface ECGs: Insights into Identifiability of Ventricular Conduction System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00165v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital twins for cardiac electrophysiology are an enabling technology for precision cardiology. Current forward models are advanced enough to simulate the cardiac electric activity under different pathophysiological conditions and accurately replicate clinical signals like torso electrocardiograms (ECGs). In this work, we address the challenge of matching subject-specific QRS complexes using anatomically accurate, physiologically grounded cardiac digital twins. By fitting the initial conditions of a cardiac propagation model, our non-invasive method predicts activation patterns during sinus rhythm. For the first time, we demonstrate that distinct activation maps can generate identical surface ECGs. To address this non-uniqueness, we introduce a physiological prior based on the distribution of Purkinje-muscle junctions. Additionally, we develop a digital twin ensemble for probabilistic inference of cardiac activation. Our approach marks a significant advancement in the calibration of cardiac digital twins and enhances their credibility for clinical application.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Imaging of Plant Delayed Luminescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Delayed luminescence (DL) is a quantized signal that is characteristic of photoexcited molecules entering a relaxed state. Studying DL provides critical insight into photophysical mechanisms via analysis of specific spatiotemporal dynamics. In this study, we developed a high-sensitivity DL imaging system using a quantitative scientific complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (qCMOS) camera and a single-photon counting resolution. By optimizing the optical architecture and signal processing algorithms together, we achieved full-field spatiotemporal DL imaging at megapixel resolution (i.e., 2304 $\times$ 4096 pixels). Key findings include the following: (1) we observed spatial heterogeneity in DL intensity across the leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana, with stronger signals detected in veins and at sites of mechanical injury; (2) species-specific DL responses occurred in response to oxidative stress, with Hydrocotyle vulgaris and Ginkgo biloba showing enhanced central DL activity; (3) Excitation using white light induced maximum DL intensity, while red and blue light differentially modulated decay kinetics. Finally, we develop a two-level quantum model that links DL dynamics to the populations of excited-state electrons, thereby developing a theoretical framework for future photophysical research. Overall, this work may help future studies of plant phenotyping under stress and light environment optimization.</description>
