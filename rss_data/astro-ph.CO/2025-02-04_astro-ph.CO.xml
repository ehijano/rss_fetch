      <title>The Velocity Field Olympics: Assessing velocity field reconstructions with direct distance tracers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The peculiar velocity field of the local Universe provides direct insights into its matter distribution and the underlying theory of gravity, and is essential in cosmological analyses for modelling deviations from the Hubble flow. Numerous methods have been developed to reconstruct the density and velocity fields at $z \lesssim 0.05$, typically constrained by redshift-space galaxy positions or by direct distance tracers such as the Tully-Fisher relation, the fundamental plane, or Type Ia supernovae. We introduce a validation framework to evaluate the accuracy of these reconstructions against catalogues of direct distance tracers. Our framework assesses the goodness-of-fit of each reconstruction using Bayesian evidence, residual redshift discrepancies, velocity scaling, and the need for external bulk flows. Applying this framework to a suite of reconstructions -- including those derived from the Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies (BORG) algorithm and from linear theory -- we find that the non-linear BORG reconstruction consistently outperforms others. We highlight the utility of such a comparative approach for supernova or gravitational wave cosmological studies, where selecting an optimal peculiar velocity model is essential. Additionally, we present calibrated bulk flow curves predicted by the reconstructions and perform a density-velocity cross-correlation using a linear theory reconstruction to constrain the growth factor, yielding $S_8 = 0.69 \pm 0.034$. This result is in significant tension with Planck but agrees with other peculiar velocity studies.</description>

      <title>Conservative limits on primordial black holes from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBH) may constitute a considerable fraction of dark matter. In this work we use the recent observations by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaborations to set direct limits on stellar-mass range PBHs. We evaluate the merger rates of PBH binaries. Those type of interactions contribute to what is a minimum of PBH merger rates at low redshifts detectable by LVK. Thus, they allow us to derive what is the most conservative upper limits on the presence of merging PBH binaries in the gravitational-wave observations. We study the cases where PBHs have a monochromatic mass-distribution and the case case with a distribution described by a log-normal function. To derive limits on PBHs, we simulate binaries with masses following the relevant mass-distributions and merger rates as a function of redshift, up to $z\sim 0.8$, relevant for the current LVK observations. In those simulations we also take into account that the LVK observatories measure the detected black hole binaries' masses with a finite resolution. In comparing to the LVK observations, we combine the simulated PBH binaries with the binaries following a power-law mass- and redshift-distribution. The latter binaries dominate the observed population of LVK detections. Our derived limits on the mass fraction of dark matter composed of PBHs is in the range of $10^{-3}$ to O(1), depending on the exact assumptions relating to the PBH binaries properties. For reasonable assumptions on those PBH binaries' properties before their evolution inside dark matter halos, we get that fraction to be in the range of $5\times 10^{-3} - 0.1$, for PBH masses of 5-80 $M_{\odot}$. Our limits even with a conservative choice on evaluating the low-redshift merger rates provide some of the most competitive limits in the mass range of 5-40 $M_{\odot}$. [abridged]</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since their first detection in 2015, gravitational wave observations have enabled a variety of studies, ranging from stellar evolution to fundamental physics. In this chapter, we focus on their use as "standard sirens", describing the different methodologies that can be adopted to measure cosmological parameters with compact object binaries from ground-based gravitational wave detectors. We cover the three main classes of standard siren measurements, showing how the expansion of the Universe can be constrained through Bayesian statistics both with gravitational wave observations alone and with the aid of electromagnetic emission from the electromagnetic counterpart of gravitational wave events and from galaxies. Finally, we summarize the existing measurements and prospects for future constraints on cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Reheating chiral dynamos with spin-0 and massive spin-1 torsions via chiral asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Syderenko et al. (JCAP, 10: 018, 2016) investigated magnetogenesis and chiral asymmetry in the early hot universe. This study explores the impact of minimally coupling a constant torsion in their cosmological model, suggesting new chiral physics. Physically, this means that if torsion is right chiral, the difference between the number of right and left chiralities does not change. Moreover, the decay of chiral asymmetry depends on torsion chirality. We solve the chiral torsionful dynamo equation for magnetic field seeds. Magnetic helical fields are considered important for chiral fermion asymmetry. Even in $(3+1)$ dimensional spacetime, torsion is highly suppressed beyond inflation (Eur Phys J C 82: 291, 2022). However, torsion of $1\,\mathrm{MeV}$ appears in the early universe. Equations for correlated magnetic field coefficients are solved in terms of torsion. Weak magnetic fields of the order of $10^{-42}$ Gauss are boosted by powerful torsionful dynamo amplification, generating a much stronger magnetic field of the order of $10^{-9}$ Gauss in the present universe. A galactic magnetic field of $10^{-6}$ Gauss in the present universe, with torsion of $10^{-15}$ Gauss, leads us to a galactic dynamo seed of $10^{-9}$ Gauss. We also discuss reheating dynamo regeneration of decaying cosmic magnetic fields during the hadronization era. The relation between the reheating contribution to e-folds and the connection between CMF and temperature squared allows us to obtain dynamo amplification in terms of N-folds of inflation. The main innovation of this work is the exploration of constant torsion in a cosmological model, revealing new chiral physics. This study offers a new perspective on the origin and evolution of magnetic fields in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Predicting the number density of heavy seed massive black holes due to an intense Lyman-Werner field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent detections of a large number of candidate active galactic nuclei at high redshift (i.e. $z \gtrsim 4$) has increased speculation that heavy seed massive black hole formation may be a required pathway. Here we re-implement the so-called Lyman-Werner (LW) channel model of Dijkstra et al. (2014) to calculate the expected number density of massive black holes formed through this channel. We further enhance this model by extracting information relevant to the model from the $\texttt{Renaissance}$ simulation suite. $\texttt{Renaissance}$ is a high-resolution suite of simulations ideally positioned to probe the high-$z$ universe. Finally, we compare the LW-only channel against other models in the literature. We find that the LW-only channel results in a peak number density of massive black holes of approximately $\rm{10^{-4} \ cMpc^{-3}}$ at $z \sim 10$. Given the growth requirements and the duty cycle of active galactic nuclei, this means that the LW-only is likely incompatible with recent JWST measurements and can, at most, be responsible for only a small subset of high-$z$ active galactic nuclei. Other models from the literature seem therefore better positioned, at present, to explain the high frequency of massive black holes at high $z$.</description>

      <title>Machine learning based Photometric Redshifts for Galaxies in the North Ecliptic Pole Wide field: catalogs of spectroscopic and photometric redshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform an MMT/Hectospec redshift survey of the North Ecliptic Pole Wide (NEPW) field covering 5.4 square degrees, and use it to estimate the photometric redshifts for the sources without spectroscopic redshifts. By combining 2572 newly measured redshifts from our survey with existing data from the literature, we create a large sample of 4421 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the NEPW field. Using this sample, we estimate photometric redshifts of 77755 sources in the band-merged catalog of the NEPW field with a random forest model. The estimated photometric redshifts are generally consistent with the spectroscopic redshifts, with a dispersion of 0.028, an outlier fraction of 7.3%, and a bias of -0.01. We find that the standard deviation of the prediction from each decision tree in the random forest model can be used to infer the fraction of catastrophic outliers and the measurement uncertainties. We test various combinations of input observables, including colors and magnitude uncertainties, and find that the details of these various combinations do not change the prediction accuracy much. As a result, we provide a catalog of 77755 sources in the NEPW field, which includes both spectroscopic and photometric redshifts up to z~2. This dataset has significant legacy value for studies in the NEPW region, especially with upcoming space missions such as JWST, Euclid, and SPHEREx.</description>

      <title>Cosmological super-resolution of the 21-cm signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we train score-based diffusion models to super-resolve gigaparsec-scale cosmological simulations of the 21-cm signal. We examine the impact of network and training dataset size on model performance, demonstrating that a single simulation is sufficient for a model to learn the super-resolution task regardless of the initial conditions. Our best-performing model achieves pixelwise $\mathrm{RMSE}\sim0.57\ \mathrm{mK}$ and dimensionless power spectrum residuals ranging from $10^{-2}-10^{-1}\ \mathrm{mK^2}$ for $128^3$, $256^3$ and $512^3$ voxel simulation volumes at redshift $10$. The super-resolution network ultimately allows us to utilize all spatial scales covered by the SKA1-Low instrument, and could in future be employed to help constrain the astrophysics of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Ultradense Dark Matter Halos with Poisson Noise from Stellar-Mass Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effect of Poisson noise, originating from the discrete distribution of stellar-mass primordial black holes (PBHs), on the abundance of ultradense dark matter halos (UDMHs). We incorporate the contribution of PBH shot noise into the power spectrum and modify the primordial power spectrum to calculate the differential mass function of UDMHs across various models, while accounting for crucial physical and geometrical factors. We further compare our results with observational constraints on the abundance of compact dark matter and the mass distribution of PBHs derived from the thermal history of the early Universe. Our findings demonstrate that the mass of PBHs contributing to Poisson noise plays a pivotal role in determining the abundance of UDMHs. Moreover, we show that Poisson noise from lighter PBHs strengthens the single-component dark matter scenario, whereas the corresponding effect from heavier PBHs supports the multi-component dark matter scenario.</description>

      <title>Dark energy and cosmic acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery that we live in an accelerating universe changed drastically the paradigm of physics and introduced the concept of \textit{dark energy}. In this work, we present a brief historical description of the main events related to the discovery of cosmic acceleration and the basic elements of theoretical and observational aspects of dark energy. Regarding the historical perspective, we outline some of the key milestones for tracing the journey from Einstein's proposal of the cosmological constant to the type Ia supernovae results. Conversely, on the theoretical/observational side, we begin by analyzing cosmic acceleration within the context of the standard cosmological model, i.e., in terms of the cosmological constant. In this case, we show how a positive cosmological constant drives accelerated expansion and discuss the main observational aspects, such as updated results and current cosmological tensions. We also explore alternative descriptions of dark energy, encompassing dynamic and interacting dark energy models.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: Validation of reconstructed power spectra from simulated filtered maps for the Small Aperture Telescope survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a transfer function-based method to estimate angular power spectra from filtered maps for cosmic microwave background (CMB) surveys. This is especially relevant for experiments targeting the faint primordial gravitational wave signatures in CMB polarisation at large scales, such as the Simons Observatory (SO) small aperture telescopes. While timestreams can be filtered to mitigate the contamination from low-frequency noise, usual methods that calculate the mode coupling at individual multipoles can be challenging for experiments covering large sky areas or reaching few-arcminute resolution. The method we present here, although approximate, is more practical and faster for larger data volumes. We validate it through the use of simulated observations approximating the first year of SO data, going from half-wave plate-modulated timestreams to maps, and using simulations to estimate the mixing of polarisation modes induced by an example of time-domain filtering. We show its performance through an example null test and with an end-to-end pipeline that performs inference on cosmological parameters, including the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. The performance demonstration uses simulated observations at multiple frequency bands. We find that the method can recover unbiased parameters for our simulated noise levels.</description>

      <title>In search for the Local Universe dynamical homogeneity scale with CF4++ peculiar velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores a groundbreaking update to the cosmography of the local Universe within z = 0.1, incorporating galaxy peculiar velocity datasets from the first data releases of WALLABY, FAST and DESI surveys. The galaxies with peculiar velocities currently selected in each survey is 655, 4796 and 4191 respectively. The new CF4++ compendium enables a more comprehensive study of the nearby Universe bulk flow dynamics. This analysis reveals that the dynamical scale of homogeneity is not yet reached in the interval [200-300] Mpc/h from the observer. This new data also refines the structure of local superclusters, revealing more spherical shapes and more clearly defined boundaries for key regions such as Great Attractor (Laniakea) and Coma. Very few measurements make a big difference in revealing the hidden Vela supercluster.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Foreground Galaxies on the Estimation of the Hubble Constant from Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae are the established `standard candle' in the construction of the Hubble diagram out to high luminosity distances. Since the Hubble constant that best fits observations of these supernovae often turns out to be high compared to fits to other data, they are currently being investigated for possible systematic effects, with many studies focusing on the calibration of the distance ladder in the local Universe. Here we present a simulation-based assessment of another type of systematic effect, related to the chance that the line of sight to a distant supernova passes close to a foreground galaxy. We consider two cases separately: First, the foreground galaxy may block the line of sight so that the supernova is not observed. Since foreground galaxies are correlated with overdensities that typically magnify the flux of background sources, this effect leads to a systematic removal of lensed supernovae from the sample, biasing the high-redshift Hubble diagram towards demagnified (fainter) supernovae. Second, if the supernova can be observed, its proximity to the foreground galaxy can lead to an incorrect host assignment, especially if the true host has a low surface brightness. Since foreground galaxies are typically found at lower redshifts, this effect introduces another systematic bias. The probability of line-of-sight alignments with foreground galaxies increases with redshift and therefore affects distant supernovae more strongly. We find that both effects are small, but the effect of host misidentification should be included in the systematic error budget at current levels of measurement precision.</description>

      <title>The Irrelevance of Primordial Black Hole Clustering in the LVK mass range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that in realistic models where primordial black holes are formed due to the collapse of sizeable inflationary perturbations, their initial spatial clustering beyond Poisson distribution does not play any role in the binary mergers, including sub-solar primordial black holes, responsible for the gravitational waves detectable by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. This is a consequence of the existing FIRAS CMB distortion constraints on the relevant scales. This conclusion might not hold for lighter masses potentially accessible by future gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Curvature perturbations from vacuum transition during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that in the presence of a light scalar spectator field, vacuum transitions taking place during inflation can produce large, potentially detectable non-Gaussian signatures in the primordial curvature perturbation. Such transitions are common in theories with multiple scalar fields when the potential has several minima. Our computation proceeds by numerically finding the instanton solution that describes quantum tunnelling between vacuum states in a de Sitter background, calculating its dependence on the spectator field and, thereby, its effect on the expansion of space. For a scenario with Higgs inflation, we obtain the non-Gaussianity parameter $f_\mathrm{NL} \sim O(10)$ and study its parameter dependence.</description>

Abstract: Pulsar timing, i.e. the analysis of the arrival times of pulses from a pulsar, is a powerful tool in modern astrophysics. It allows us to measure the time delays of an electromagnetic signal caused by a number of physical processes as the signal propagates from the source to the observer. Joint analysis of an ensemble of pulsars (Pulsar Timing Arrays, PTAs) can be used to address a variety of astrophysical challenges, including the problem of direct detection of space-time metric perturbations, in particular those induced by gravitational waves. Here we present a comprehensive review of the current state of research in the field of pulsar timing, with particular emphasis on recent advancements in the detection of stochastic background of nHz gravitational waves, reported by a number of international collaborations such as NANOGrav (North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves), European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA), Chinese Pulsar Timing Array (CPTA) and Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA), which are joining their efforts within the International PTA (IPTA). Additionally, this paper reviews contemporary constraints on scalar ultralight matter (pseudoscalar bosons), obtained from timing and polarimetry data of pulsars. The prospects for applying these tools to other problems in fundamental physics and cosmology are explored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the general conditions under which evolution in the laws of physics and matter creation or destruction are closely intertwined. They make use of global time variables canonically dual to the constants of Nature. Such times flow at a rate determined by what can be interpret as the chemical potential of the fundamental constants (in analogy with phenomenological clocks based on isentropic fluids). The general condition for violations of energy conservation is then that a matter parameter evolves as a function of a gravity clock or vice-versa. This framework can be envisaged as the environment within which a natural selection scenario operates, powered by random mutations in the values of the constants of nature (or indeed any other variability in the laws in terms of the times defined above). The prize function is the creation of matter, followed by its preservation. This can be accomplished in an environment where diffeomorphism invariance is among the possible theories, with mutations modelled, for example, on the absorbing Markov chain. In such a set-up the diffeormorphism invariant state with fixed constants (or any nearby state) should be the absorbing state. John Wheeler's ``higgledy-piggledy'' chaotic cosmic start therefore finds a realization in this model, where its own demise and the establishment of order and seemingly immutable laws is also a predection of the model.</description>

      <title>Using Neural Networks to Automate the Identification of Brightest Cluster Galaxies in Large Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) lie deep within the largest gravitationally bound structures in existence. Though some cluster finding techniques identify the position of the BCG and use it as the cluster center, other techniques may not automatically include these coordinates. This can make studying BCGs in such surveys difficult, forcing researchers to either adopt oversimplified algorithms or perform cumbersome visual identification. For large surveys, there is a need for a fast and reliable way of obtaining BCG coordinates. We propose machine learning to accomplish this task and train a neural network to identify positions of candidate BCGs given no more information than multiband photometric images. We use both mock observations from The Three Hundred project and real ones from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and we quantify the performance. Training on simulations yields a squared correlation coefficient, R$^2$, between predictions and ground truth of R$^2 \approx 0.94$ when testing on simulations, which decreases to R$^2 \approx 0.60$ when testing on real data due to discrepancies between datasets. Limiting the application of this method to real clusters more representative of the training data, such those with a BCG r-band magnitude $r_{\text{BCG}} \leq 16.5$, yields R$^2 \approx 0.99$. The method performs well up to a redshift of at least $z\approx 0.6$. We find this technique to be a promising method to automate and accelerate the identification of BCGs in large datasets.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing FHDE with Scalar and Gauge Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the Fractional Holographic Dark Energy (FHDE) model to reconstruct it by means of dynamic candidates such as ($i$) Quintessence, ($ii$) K-essence, ($iii$) Dilaton, ($iv$) Yang-Mills condensate, ($v$) DBI-essence, and ($vi$) Tachyonic fields in a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) Universe. In particular, the dark-energy possibilities ($i$)-($vi$) are formulated through suitable field descriptions. Being concrete, we establish a comprehensive correspondence between FHDE and suitable scalar and gauge field frameworks that co-substantiate our investigation and subsequent discussion. In more detail, we methodically compute the corresponding Equation of State (EoS) parameters and field (kinetic and potential) features for the fractional parameter ($\alpha$) range, viz. $1&lt;\alpha\leq2$. Conclusively, our results show that the modifications brought by the fractional features satisfactorily enable late-time cosmic acceleration, together with avoiding quantum instabilities by preventing the EoS from entering the phantom divide i.e., $\omega(z)\rightarrow-\infty$, which is a common issue in standard scalar field models without fractional dynamics (e.g., K-essence field). Our findings further indicate that fractional calculus attributes can be significant in addressing the challenges of dark-energy models by offering a robust framework to prospect late-time acceleration and properly fitting observational constraints. Notably, we find that as the fractional features start to dominate, the EoS parameter of all the effective field configurations asymptotically approaches a $\Lambda$CDM behaviour in the far-future limit $z\rightarrow-1$. In summary, the recent perspective introduced by FHDE \citep{Trivedi:2024inb} can indeed be cast as a promising aspirant through the use of prominent field frameworks.</description>

      <title>One-loop corrections to the E-type $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation and primordial black hole production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The one-loop corrections (1LC) to the power spectrum of scalar perturbations, arising from cubic interactions in the single-field E-type $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation and primordial black hole (PBH) production, are numerically calculated. The results demonstrate the 1LC contributes merely a few percent to the tree-level power spectrum. The model parameters are chosen to predict the PBH masses in the asteroid-mass range, while maintaining consistency with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations within 1$\sigma$ confidence levels, and obeying the upper limits on $\mu$-distortions. The PBH formed on scales smaller than the inflation scale can constitute a significant fraction of the present dark matter (DM). The PBH-induced gravitational waves (GW) may be detectable by the future space-based gravitational interferometers. We also consider a reconstruction of the scalar potential from possible GW observations and present a numerical approach tested in the parameter space of the model.</description>

      <title>Starobinsky Inflation with T-Model Kahler Geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present novel implementations of Starobisky-like inflation within Supergravity adopting Kahler potentials for the inflaton which parameterize hyperbolic geometries known from the T-model inflation. The associated superpotentials are consistent with an R and a global or gauge U(1)_X symmetries. The inflaton is represented by a gauge singlet or non-singlet superfield and is accompanied by a gauge-singlet superfield successfully stabilized thanks to its compact contribution into the total Kahler potential. Keeping the Kahler manifold intact, a conveniently violated shift symmetry is introduced which allows for a slight variation of the predictions of Starobinsky inflation: The (scalar) spectral index exhibits an upper bound which lies close to its central observational value whereas the constant scalar curvature of the inflaton-sector Kahler manifold increases with the tensor-to-scalar ratio.</description>

      <title>Can Q-balls describe cosmological and galactic dark matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cold Dark Matter (CDM) hypothesis accurately predicts large-scale structure formation and fits the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature fluctuations (CMB). However, observations of the inner regions of dark matter halos and dwarf galaxy satellites have consistently posed challenges to CDM. On the other hand, the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) hypothesis can explain galactic phenomena but fails to account for the complex shape of the CMB and matter power spectra. CDM and MOND are effective in nearly mutually exclusive regimes, prompting the question: Is there a physical mechanism where CDM and MOND share a common origin? Q-balls, which are localized, non-topological solitons, can be a bridge between the two hypotheses. Q-balls formed in the early Universe can mimic CDM at cosmological scales. Interestingly, Q-balls can exhibit MOND-like behavior in the late Universe at galactic scales, providing a unified framework. Specifically, we demonstrate that millicharged composite Q-balls formed from complex scalar fields, decoupled from the background radiation, can naturally arise during the radiation-dominated epoch. From the matter-radiation equality, we also obtain the mass of Q-balls to be $1~{eV}$, which are much smaller than the electron mass. Using the constraints from the invisible decay mode of ortho-positronium, we obtain $Q &lt; 3.4 \times 10^{-5}$. We also establish an upper bound on the number density of Q-balls, which depends on the charge of the Q-ball and the small initial charge asymmetry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the MOND naturally emerges at the galactic scale within the framework of our Q-ball model.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductivity with bells and whistlers: suppression of the magnetothermal instability in galaxy clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the hot intracluster medium (ICM) in galaxy clusters, plasma microinstabilities may play an important role in the transport of heat and momentum on the large scales. In this paper, we continue our investigation of the effect of whistler suppression of thermal conductivity on the magneto-thermal instability (MTI), which may be active in the periphery of galaxy clusters and contribute to the observed turbulence. We use a closure for the heat flux inspired by kinetic simulations and show that MTI turbulence with whistler suppression exhibits a critical transition: for modest suppression of the conductivity, the MTI turbulent velocities decrease in agreement with previous MTI scaling laws. However, for suppression above a critical threshold, the MTI loses its ability to maintain equipartition-level magnetic fields through a small-scale dynamo, and the system enters a ``death-spiral''. We propose a model to explain this critical transition, and speculate that conditions in the hot ICM are favourable to the upkeep of the dynamo. Additionaly, with whistler suppression high-$\beta$ regions are brought out of thermal equilibrium while the efficiency of MTI turbulent driving is reduced. Finally, we show that external turbulence interferes with the MTI and leads to lower levels of turbulence. While individually both external turbulence and whistler suppression weaken the MTI, we find that they can exhibit a complex interplay when acting in conjunction, with external turbulence boosting the whistler-suppressed thermal conductivity and even reviving a ``dead'' MTI. Our study illustrates how extending magnetohydrodynamics with a simple prescription for microscale plasma physics can lead to the formation of a complicated dynamical system and demonstrates that further work is needed in order to bridge the gap between micro- and macro scales in galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Foreground removal and angular power spectrum estimation of 21 cm signal using harmonic space ILC method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mapping the distribution of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) in the Universe through its 21 cm emission line provides a powerful cosmological probe to map the large-scale structures and shed light on various cosmological phenomena. The Baryon Acoustic Oscillations at low redshifts can potentially be probed by sensitive HI intensity mapping experiments and constrain the properties of dark energy. However, the 21 cm signal detection faces formidable challenges due to the dominance of various astrophysical foregrounds, which can be several orders of magnitude stronger. Our current work introduces a novel and model-independent Internal Linear Combination (ILC) method in harmonic space using the principal components of the 21 cm signal for accurate foreground removal and power spectrum estimation. We estimate the principal components by incorporating prior knowledge of the theoretical 21 cm covariance matrix. We test our methodology by detailed simulations of radio observations, incorporating synchrotron emission, free-free radiation, extragalactic point sources, and thermal noise. We estimate the full sky 21 cm angular power spectrum after application of a mask on the full sky cleaned 21 cm signal by using the mode-mode coupling matrix. These full sky estimates of angular spectra can be directly used to measure the cosmological parameters. For the first time, we demonstrate the effectiveness of a foreground model-independent ILC method in harmonic space to reconstruct the 21 cm signal.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: DR6 Gravitational Lensing and SDSS BOSS cross-correlation measurement and constraints on gravity with the $E_G$ statistic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive new constraints on the $E_G$ statistic as a test of gravity, combining the CMB lensing map estimated from Data Release 6 (DR6) of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope with SDSS BOSS CMASS and LOWZ galaxy data. We develop an analysis pipeline to measure the cross-correlation between CMB lensing maps and galaxy data, following a blinding policy and testing the approach through null and consistency checks. By testing the equivalence of the spatial and temporal gravitational potentials, the $E_G$ statistic can distinguish $\Lambda$CDM from alternative models of gravity. We find $E_G= 0.31^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$ for ACT and CMASS data at 68.28\% confidence level, and $E_G = 0.49^{+0.14}_{-0.11}$ for ACT and LOWZ. Systematic errors are estimated to be 3\% and 4\% respectively. Including CMB lensing information from Planck PR4 results in $E_G = 0.34^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ with CMASS and $E_G= 0.43^{+0.11}_{-0.09}$ with LOWZ. These are consistent with predictions for the $\Lambda$CDM model that best fits the Planck CMB anisotropy and SDSS BOSS BAO, where $E_G^{\rm GR} (z_{\rm eff} = 0.555) = 0.401\pm 0.005$ for CMB lensing combined with CMASS and $E_G^{\rm GR} (z_{\rm eff} = 0.316) = 0.452\pm0.005$ combined with LOWZ. We also find $E_G$ to be scale independent, with PTE $&gt;5\%$, as predicted by general relativity. The methods developed in this work are also applicable to improved future analyses with upcoming spectroscopic galaxy samples and CMB lensing measurements.</description>

      <title>Impact and mitigation of spectroscopic systematics on DESI DR1 clustering measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The large scale structure catalogs within DESI Data Release 1 (DR1) use nearly 6 million galaxies and quasars as tracers of the large-scale structure of the universe to measure the expansion history with baryon acoustic oscillations and the growth of structure with redshift-space distortions. In order to take advantage of DESI's unprecedented statistical power, we must ensure that the galaxy clustering measurements are unaffected by non-cosmological density fluctuations. One source of spurious fluctuations comes from variation in galaxy density with spectroscopic observing conditions, lowering the redshift efficiency (and thus galaxy density) in certain areas of the sky. We measure the uniformity of the redshift success rate for DESI luminous red galaxies (LRG), bright galaxies (BGS) and quasars (QSO), complementing the detailed discussion of emission line galaxy (ELG) systematics in a companion paper (Yu et al., 2024). We find small but significant fluctuations of up to 3% in redshift success rate with the effective spectroscopic signal-to-noise, and create and describe weights that remove these fluctuations. We also describe the process to identify and remove data from certain poorly performing fibers from DESI DR1, and measure the stability of the redshift success rate with time. Finally, we find small but significant correlations of redshift success rate with position on the focal plane, survey speed, and number of exposures required, and show the impact of weights correcting these trends on the power spectrum multipoles and on cosmological parameters from BAO and RSD fits. These corrections change the best-fit parameters by $&lt;15\%$ of their statistical errors, and thus contribute negligibly to the overall DESI error budget.</description>

      <title>Mitigation of DESI fiber assignment incompleteness effect on two-point clustering with small angular scale truncated estimators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04804v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method to mitigate the effects of fiber assignment incompleteness in two-point power spectrum and correlation function measurements from galaxy spectroscopic surveys, by truncating small angular scales from estimators. We derive the corresponding modified correlation function and power spectrum windows to account for the small angular scale truncation in the theory prediction. We validate this approach on simulations reproducing the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1 (DR1) with and without fiber assignment. We show that we recover unbiased cosmological constraints using small angular scale truncated estimators from simulations with fiber assignment incompleteness, with respect to standard estimators from complete simulations. Additionally, we present an approach to remove the sensitivity of the fits to high $k$ modes in the theoretical power spectrum, by applying a transformation to the data vector and window matrix. We find that our method efficiently mitigates the effect of fiber assignment incompleteness in two-point correlation function and power spectrum measurements, at low computational cost and with little statistical loss.</description>

      <title>Ray-tracing vs. Born approximation in full-sky weak lensing simulations of the MillenniumTNG project</title>

Abstract: Weak gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for precision tests of cosmology. As the expected deflection angles are small, predictions based on non-linear N-body simulations are commonly computed with the Born approximation. Here we examine this assumption using ${\small DORIAN}$, a newly developed full-sky ray-tracing scheme applied to high-resolution mass-shell outputs of the two largest simulations in the MillenniumTNG suite, each with a 3000 Mpc box containing almost 1.1 trillion cold dark matter particles in addition to 16.7 billion particles representing massive neutrinos. We examine simple two-point statistics like the angular power spectrum of the convergence field, as well as statistics sensitive to higher order correlations such as peak and minimum statistics, void statistics, and Minkowski functionals of the convergence maps. Overall, we find only small differences between the Born approximation and a full ray-tracing treatment. While these are negligibly small at power-spectrum level, some higher order statistics show more sizable effects; ray-tracing is necessary to achieve percent level precision. At the resolution reached here, full-sky maps with 0.8 billion pixels and an angular resolution of 0.43 arcmin, we find that interpolation accuracy can introduce appreciable errors in ray-tracing results. We therefore implemented an interpolation method based on nonuniform fast Fourier transforms (NUFFT) along with more traditional methods. Bilinear interpolation introduces significant smoothing, while nearest grid point sampling agrees well with NUFFT, at least for our fiducial source redshift, $z_s=1.0$, and for the 1 arcmin smoothing we use for higher-order statistics.</description>

      <title>Effect of Ly$\alpha$ Radiative Transfer on Intensity Mapping Power Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clustering of Ly$\alpha$-emitting galaxies (LAEs) and Ly$\alpha$ line intensity mapping (LIM) are useful probes of cosmology. However, Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer (RT) effects, such as absorption, line shift, and line broadening, and their dependence on the large-scale density and velocity fields can modify the measured LAE clustering and LIM statistics. We explore the effects of RT on the Ly$\alpha$ LIM power spectrum in two ways: using an analytic description based on linear approximations, and using lognormal mocks. The qualitative effects of intergalactic Ly$\alpha$ absorption on the LIM auto- and cross-power spectrum include a scale-dependent, reduced effective bias, reduced mean intensity, and modified redshift-space distortions. The linear absorption model does not describe the results of the lognormal simulations well. The random line shift suppresses the redshift-space power spectrum similar to the Fingers-of-God effect. In cross-correlation of LAEs or Ly$\alpha$ intensity with a non-Ly$\alpha$ tracer, the Ly$\alpha$ line shift leads to a phase shift of the complex power spectrum, i.e. a cosine damping of the real part. We study the impact of Ly$\alpha$ RT effects on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) LAE and LIM power spectra using lognormal mocks. We find that even small amounts of IGM absorption will significantly change the measured LAE auto-power spectrum. The LAE-intensity cross-power spectrum stays within the measurement uncertainty. Therefore, HETDEX will be able to constrain Ly$\alpha$ RT effects.</description>

      <title>Evolving Dark Energy or Supernovae Systematics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07175v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration have been interpreted as evidence for evolving dark energy. However, this interpretation is strongly dependent on which Type Ia supernova (SN) sample is combined with DESI measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. The strength of the evidence for evolving dark energy ranges from ~3.9 sigma for the Dark Energy 5 year (DES5Y) SN sample to ~2.5 sigma for the Pantheon+ sample. The cosmology inferred from Pantheon+ sample alone is consistent with the Planck LCDM model and shows no preference for evolving dark energy. In contrast, the the DES5Y SN sample favours evolving dark energy and is discrepant with the Planck LCDM model at about the 3 sigma level. Given these difference, it is important to question whether they are caused by systematics in the SN compilations. A comparison of SN common to both the DES5Y and Pantheon+ compilations shows evidence for an offset of ~0.04 mag. between low and high redshifts. Systematics of this order can bring the DES5Y sample into good agreement with the Planck LCDM cosmology and Pantheon+. I comment on a recent paper by the DES collaboration that rejects this possibility.</description>

      <title>Absence of one-loop effects on large scales from small scales in non-slow-roll dynamics II: Quartic interactions and consistency relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove explicitly the absence of one-loop corrections to large scales from small scales in transient non-slow-roll dynamics. Specifically, we address loop corrections to the primordial power spectrum, relative to tree-level, that are independent of the ratio between the two scales. We review all the necessary components, adapted to our context, to express one-loop diagrams as three-point functions, emphasizing the crucial role played by quartic interactions. Notably, we include the quartic Hamiltonian induced by the cubic Lagrangian and quartic interactions that are ensured by diffeomorphism invariance. We then explicitly prove consistency relations for an arbitrary transient non-slow-roll phase involving operators with (time) derivatives. Finally, we calculate one-loop corrections by including contributions from the relevant cubic and quartic interactions, and express the final result as a total derivative term over comoving momenta, utilizing the consistency relations we established. This leads us to conclude that one-loop corrections to long-wavelength modes are unaffected by the physics of short and enhanced modes in non-slow-roll dynamics.</description>

      <title>Scale-dependence in $\Lambda$CDM parameters inferred from the CMB: a possible sign of Early Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The early dark energy (EDE) model is one of the promising solutions to the Hubble tension. One of the successes of the EDE model is that it can provide a similar fit to the $\Lambda$CDM model for the CMB power spectrum. In this work, I analyze the phenomenology of the EDE and $\Lambda$CDM parameters on the CMB temperature power spectrum and notice that this cannot hold on all scales. Thus, if the real cosmology is as described by the EDE model, the $\Lambda$CDM parameters will be scale-dependent when fitting the CMB power spectrum with the $\Lambda$CDM model, which can be hints for the EDE model. I examine CMB-S4-like observations through mock data analysis and find that parameter shifts are notable. As observations include smaller scales, I find lower $H_0$, $n_s$, $\omega_b$ and higher $\omega_m$, $A_s e^{-2\tau}$, which will also constitute new tensions with other observations. They can serve as a possible signal for the EDE model.</description>

      <title>KiDS-Legacy: Angular galaxy clustering from deep surveys with complex selection effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photometric galaxy surveys, despite their limited resolution along the line of sight, encode rich information about the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe thanks to the high number density and extensive depth of the data. However, the complicated selection effects in wide and deep surveys can potentially cause significant bias in the angular two-point correlation function (2PCF) measured from those surveys. In this paper, we measure the 2PCF from the newly published KiDS-Legacy sample. Given an $r$-band $5\sigma$ magnitude limit of $24.8$ and survey footprint of $1347$ deg$^2$, it achieves an excellent combination of sky coverage and depth for such a measurement. We find that complex selection effects, primarily induced by varying seeing, introduce over-estimation of the 2PCF by approximately an order of magnitude. To correct for such effects, we apply a machine learning-based method to recover an organised random (OR) that presents the same selection pattern as the galaxy sample. The basic idea is to find the selection-induced clustering of galaxies using a combination of self-organising maps (SOMs) and hierarchical clustering (HC). This unsupervised machine learning method is able to recover complicated selection effects without specifying their functional forms. We validate this SOM+HC method on mock deep galaxy samples with realistic systematics and selections derived from the KiDS-Legacy catalogue. Using mock data, we demonstrate that the OR delivers unbiased 2PCF cosmological parameter constraints, removing the $27\sigma$ offset in the galaxy bias parameter that is recovered when adopting uniform randoms. Blinded measurements on the real KiDS-Legacy data show that the corrected 2PCF is robust to the SOM+HC configuration near the optimal set-up suggested by the mock tests.</description>

      <title>Observable CMB B-modes from Cosmological Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A B-mode polarization signal in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is widely regarded as smoking gun evidence for gravitational waves produced during inflation. Here we demonstrate that tensor perturbations from a cosmological phase transition can produce a B-mode signal whose strength rivals that of testable inflationary predictions across a range of observable scales. Although phase transitions arise from causal sub-horizon physics, they nevertheless exhibit a white noise power spectrum on super-horizon scales. Power is suppressed on the large scales relevant for CMB B-mode polarization, but it is not necessarily negligible. For appropriately chosen phase transition parameters, the maximal B-mode amplitude can compete with inflationary predictions that can be tested with current and future experiments. These scenarios can be differentiated by performing measurements on multiple angular scales, since the phase transition signal predicts peak power on smaller scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the Baryon Pasted (BP) X-ray and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) maps derived from the half-sky Uchuu Lightcone simulation. These BP-Uchuu maps are constructed using more than $75$ million dark matter halos with masses $M_{500c} \geq 10^{13} M_\odot$ within the redshift range $0 \leq z \leq 2$. A distinctive feature of our BP-Uchuu Lightcone maps is their capability to assess the influence of both extrinsic and intrinsic scatter caused by triaxial gaseous halos and internal gas characteristics, respectively, at the map level. We show that triaxial gas drives substantial scatter in X-ray luminosities of clusters and groups, accounting for nearly half of the total scatter in core-excised measurements. Additionally, scatter in the thermal pressure and gas density profiles of halos enhances the X-ray and SZ power spectra, leading to biases in cosmological parameter estimates. These findings are statistically robust due to the extensive sky coverage and large halo sample in the BP-Uchuu maps. The BP-Uchuu maps are publicly available on https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=cf8dadb7-b6e9-4e2c-abc1-0813877efc13 .</description>

      <title>Can Dark Stars account for the star formation efficiency excess at very high redshifts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently conducted observations of massive galaxies at high redshifts, revealing a notable anomaly in their star formation efficiency (SFE). Motivated by the recent identification of three $\sim 10^{6}M_\odot$ dark star candidates, we investigate whether dark stars can be the origin of the SFE excess. It turns out that the excess can be reproduced by a group of dark stars with $M \gtrsim 10^{3}\, \rm M_{\odot}$, because of their domination in generating primary UV radiation in high-redshift galaxies. The genesis of these dark stars is attributed to the capture of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) within a mass range of tens of GeV to a few TeV. However, if the top-heavy initial mass function of dark stars holds up to $\sim 10^{5}M_\odot$, the relic black holes stemming from their collapse would be too abundant to be consistent with the current observations of Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). We thus suggest that just a small fraction of SFE excess may be contributed by the very massive dark stars and the majority likely originated from other reasons such as the Population III stars in view of their rather similar UV radiation efficiencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that collider searches for long-lived particles (LLPs) can test the dynamics responsible for matter domination in the early universe. In this letter we concentrate on the specific example of glueballs from a GeV-scale confining dark sector and compute the dilution of cosmological relics induced by their decay. We then show that searches for long-lived glueballs from Higgs decays test increasing values of dilution at ATLAS and CMS, CODEX-b, ANUBIS and MATHUSLA. We identify the general features that make models of early matter domination discoverable via LLPs at colliders. Our study provides a quantitative physics motivation to test longer lifetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16367v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent potentials are common in galactic systems that undergo significant evolution, interactions, or encounters with other galaxies, or when there are dynamic processes like star formation and merging events. Recent studies show that an ensemble approach along with the so-called snapshot framework in dynamical system theory provide a powerful tool to analyze time dependent dynamics.
  In this work, we aim to explore and quantify the phase space structure and dynamical complexity in time-dependent galactic potentials consisting of multiple components. We apply the classical method of Poincar\'e-surface of section to analyze the phase space structure in a chaotic Hamiltonian system subjected to parameter drift. This, however, makes sense only when the evolution of a large ensemble of initial conditions is followed. Numerical simulations explore the phase space structure of such ensembles while the system undergoes a continuous parameter change. The pair-wise average distance of ensemble members allows us to define a generalized Lyapunov-exponent, that might also be time dependent, to describe the system stability. We provide a comprehensive dynamical analysis of the system under circumstances where linear mass transfer occurs between the disk and bulge components of the model.</description>

Abstract: We consider Thomson-like processes between dark matter dark photons and free electrons in the Milky Way. The result is a radio signal background that can be detectable with current or future radio telescope arrays. In particular, we computed sensitivity prospects for the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) radio telescope and for the future Square Kilometer Array (SKA), concluding that unconstrained parameter space in a wide range of dark photon masses can be probed.</description>

      <title>The emergence of the Star Formation Main Sequence with redshift unfolded by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the correlation between stellar mass (M*) and star formation rate (SFR) across the stellar mass range log10(M*/Msun)~6-11. We consider almost 50,000 star-forming galaxies at z~3-7, leveraging data from COSMOS/SMUVS, JADES/GOODS-SOUTH, and MIDIS/XDF. This is the first study spanning such a wide stellar mass range without relying on gravitational lensing effects. We locate our galaxies on the SFR-M* plane to assess how the location of galaxies in the star-formation main sequence (MS) and starburst (SB) region evolves with stellar mass and redshift. We find that the two star-forming modes tend to converge at log10(M*/Msun) &lt; 7, with all galaxies found in the SB mode. However, deeper observations will be instrumental for reaching lower SFRs and Msun to further validate this scenario. By dissecting our galaxy sample in stellar mass and redshift, we show that the emergence of the star-formation MS is stellar-mass dependent: while in galaxies with log10(M*/Msun) &gt; 9 the MS is already well in place at z = 5-7, for galaxies with log10(M*/Msun)~7-8 it only becomes significant at z&lt;4. Overall, our results are in line with previous findings that the SB mode dominates amongst low stellar-mass galaxies. The earlier emergence of the MS for massive galaxies is consistent with galaxy downsizing.</description>

      <title>Observational bounds on a possible electron-to-proton mass ratio variation and constraints in the lepton-specific 2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we test a possible redshift variation of the electron-to-proton mass ratio, $\mu = m_e/m_p$, directly from galaxy cluster gas mass fraction measurements and type Ia supernovae observations. Our result reveals no variation of $\mu$ within 1~$\sigma$. From the point of view of Particle Physics, we can use the precision on these results to constrain the parameter space of models beyond the Standard Model of electroweak interactions. We exemplify this by focusing on a specific Two-Higgs doublet model (2HDM), where the second scalar doublet couples exclusively to leptons. An important parameter in the model concerns the ratio between its vacuum expectation values, defined by $\tan\beta\equiv v_2/v_1$. In our approach, we can constrain the inverse parameter $(\cot\beta)$ to an optimal value, $(\cot\beta)= (2.003 \pm 0.081)\cdot 10^{-3}$, with the highest vacuum expectation value for 2HDM, $v_2$, estimated at around $240.57 \pm 2.93$~GeV. Also, by taking into account the discrepancy in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon found between theory and experiment, we can reduce the validity region for this model and establish bounds on the scalar masses, in light of our findings from galaxy cluster data for $\mu$. This study contributes valuable insights to the understanding of the interface between Particle Physics and Astrophysics, establishing a new interrelationship between data on the large-scale structure of the Universe and subatomic Physics.</description>

      <title>GA-NIFS: Multi-phase analysis of a star-forming galaxy at $z \sim 5.5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a detailed multiphase analysis of HZ4, a main-sequence star-forming galaxy at z ~ 5.5, known for being a turbulent rotating disk and having a detection of a [CII] outflow in the ALMA observations. We exploit JWST/NIRSpec observations in the integral field spectroscopy mode with low- and high-spectral resolution that allow us for the first time to spatially resolve the rest-frame UV and optical emission of the galaxy to investigate the galaxy properties. In particular, the high-resolution dataset allows us to study the kinematics of the ionized gas phase, and the conditions of the interstellar medium, such as the excitation mechanism, dust attenuation, and metallicity. The lower-spectral resolution observations allow us to study the continuum emission and infer the stellar populations' ages and properties. Our findings suggest that HZ4 is a galaxy merger rather than a rotating disk as previously inferred from lower resolution [CII] data. The merger is associated with an extended broad, blueshifted emission, potentially indicative of an outflow originating from a region of intense star formation and extending up to 4 kpc. In light of these new observations we reanalyzed the ALMA data to compare the multiphase gas properties. If we interpret the broad components seen in [CII] and [OIII]$\lambda$5007\.A as outflows, the neutral and ionized components are co-spatial, the mass loading factor of the ionized phase is significantly lower than that of the neutral phase, aligning with trends observed in multi-phase systems at lower redshifts. Nonetheless, additional observations and larger statistical samples are essential to determine the role of mergers and outflows in the early Universe and to clarify the origin of the broad emission components observed in this system.</description>

      <title>A mechanism to generate varying speed of light via Higgs-dilaton coupling: Theory and cosmological applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We allow the Higgs field $\Phi$ to interact with a dilaton field $\chi$ of the background spacetime via the coupling $\chi^2\,\Phi^\dagger\Phi$. Upon spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking, the Higgs VEV becomes proportional to $\chi$. While traditionally this linkage is employed to make the Planck mass and particle masses dependent on $\chi$, we present an $\textit alternative$ mechanism: the Higgs VEV will be used to construct Planck's constant $\hbar$ and speed of light $c$. Specifically, each open set vicinity of a given point $x^*$ on the spacetime manifold is equipped with a replica of the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam action operating with its own effective values of $\hbar_*$ and $c_*$ per $\hbar_*\propto\chi^{-1/2}(x^*)$ and $c_*\propto\chi^{1/2}(x^*)$, causing these ``fundamental constants'' to vary alongside the dynamical field $\chi$. Moreover, in each open set around $x^*$, the prevailing value $\chi(x^*)$ determines the length and time scales for physical processes occurring in this region as $l\propto\chi^{-1}(x^*)$ and $\tau\propto\chi^{-3/2}(x^*)$. This leads to an $\textit anisotropic$ relation $\tau^{-1}\propto l^{-3/2}$ between the rate of clocks and the length of rods, resulting in a distinct set of novel physical phenomena. For late-time cosmology, the variation of $c$ along the trajectory of light waves from distant supernovae towards the Earth-based observer necessitates modifications to the Lema\^itre redshift relation and the Hubble law. These modifications are capable of: (1) Accounting for the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa $\textit{through a declining speed of light in an expanding Einstein--de Sitter universe}$, thus avoiding the need for dark energy; (2) Revitalizing Blanchard-Douspis-Rowan-Robinson-Sarkar's CMB power spectrum analysis that bypassed dark energy [A&amp;A 412, 35 (2003)]; and (3) Resolving the $H_0$ tension without requiring a dynamical dark energy component.</description>

      <title>High-Energy and Ultra-High-Energy Neutrinos from Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) are capable of emitting extremely energetic particles independent of their interactions with the Standard Model. In this work, we investigate whether PBHs evaporating in the early universe could be responsible for some of the observed high-energy neutrinos above the TeV or PeV scale in the present universe. We compute the energy spectrum of neutrinos directly emitted by PBHs with a monochromatic mass function and estimate the wash-out point, which determines the maximum energy of the spectrum. We find that the spectrum generally extends to high energies following a power law of $E_{\nu}^{-3}$ until it reaches the wash-out point, which crucially depends on the PBH mass. For PBHs of $10^{13}$ grams, the spectrum can extend up to the PeV scale, though the flux is too low for detection. We also consider an indirect production mechanism involving dark particles that are emitted by PBHs and decay into neutrinos at a much later epoch. This mechanism allows lighter (such as those in the gram to kilogram range) PBHs to produce more energetic neutrino fluxes without being washed out by the thermal plasma in the early universe. In this scenario, we find that ultra-high-energy neutrinos around or above the EeV scale can be generated, with sufficiently high fluxes detectable by current and future high-energy neutrino observatories such as IceCube and GRAND.</description>

      <title>Space-based optical lattice clocks as gravitational wave detectors in search for new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04340v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity and performance of space-based Optical Lattice Clocks (OLCs) in detecting gravitational waves, in particular the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) at low frequencies $(10^{-4}, 1) \rm Hz$, which are inaccessible to ground-based detectors. We first analyze the response characteristics of a single OLC detector for SGWB detection and compare its sensitivity with that of Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Due to longer arm lengths, space-based OLC detectors can exhibit unique frequency responses and enhance the capability to detect SGWB in the low-frequency range, but the sensitivity of a single OLC detector remains insufficient overall compared to LISA. Then, as a preliminary plan, we adopt a method of cross-correlation on two OLC detectors to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This method leverages the uncorrelated origins but statistically similar properties of noise in two detectors while the SGWB signal is correlated between them, thus achieving effective noise suppression and sensitivity enhancement. Future advancements in OLC stability are expected to further enhance their detection performance. This work highlights the potential of OLC detectors as a promising platform for SGWB detection, offering complementary capabilities to LISA, and opening an observational window into more astrophysical sources and the early universe.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Galaxies or Cirrus? Decomposition of Galactic Cirrus in Deep Wide-Field Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00933v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffuse Galactic cirrus, or Diffuse Galactic Light (DGL), can be a prominent component in the background of deep wide-field imaging surveys. The DGL provides unique insights into the physical and radiative properties of dust grains in our Milky Way, and it also serves as a contaminant on deep images, obscuring the detection of background sources such as low surface brightness galaxies. However, it is challenging to disentangle the DGL from other components of the night sky. In this paper, we present a technique for the photometric characterization of Galactic cirrus, based on (1) extraction of its filamentary or patchy morphology and (2) incorporation of color constraints obtained from Planck thermal dust models. Our decomposition method is illustrated using a $\sim$10 deg$^2$ imaging dataset obtained by the Dragonfly Telephoto Array, and its performance is explored using various metrics which characterize the flatness of the sky background. As a concrete application of the technique, we show how removal of cirrus allows low surface brightness galaxies to be identified on cirrus-rich images. We also show how modeling the cirrus in this way allows optical DGL intensities to be determined with high radiometric precision.</description>

      <title>A note on the gravitational dark matter production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06626v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter, one of the fundamental components of the universe, has remained mysterious in modern cosmology and particle physics, and hence, this field is of utmost importance at present moment. One of the foundational questions in this direction is the origin of dark matter which directly links with its creation. In the present article we study the gravitational production of dark matter in two distinct contexts: firstly, when reheating occurs through the gravitational particle production, and secondly, when it is driven by the inflaton's decay. We establish a connection between the reheating temperature and the mass of dark matter, and from the reheating bounds, we determine the range of viable dark matter mass values.</description>

      <title>Conditions for Super-Eddington Accretion onto the First Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of supermassive black holes at high redshift challenge our understanding of the evolution of the first generation of black holes (BHs) in proto-galactic environments. One possibility is that they grow much more rapidly than current estimates of feedback and accretion efficiency permit. Following our previous analysis of super-Eddington accretion onto stellar-mass black holes in mini-haloes under no-feedback conditions, we now investigate whether this can be sustained when thermal feedback is included. We use four sets of cosmological simulations at sub-pc resolution with initial black hole masses varying from $1 \times 10^3 - 6 \times 10^4 M_\odot$, exploring a range of feedback efficiencies. We also vary the feedback injection radius to probe the threshold of numerical overcooling. We find that super-Eddington growth sustained on the order of $\sim$$100 \, \rm kyr$ is possible with very weak thermal feedback efficiency in all environments and moderate efficiency for two of the BHs. Trans-Eddington growth is possible for a $3 \times 10^3 - 6 \times 10^3 M_\odot$ BH at moderate feedback efficiencies. We discuss the effectiveness of thermal feedback in heating the gas, suppressing accretion, and driving outflows at these parameter configurations. Our results suggest that super-Eddington growth may be possible in the presence of thermal feedback for black holes formed from the first stars.</description>

      <title>Neutrino reheating predictions with non-thermal leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Connecting inflation with neutrino physics through non-thermal leptogenesis via direct inflaton-right-handed neutrino (RHN) coupling naturally incorporates neutrino reheating, leaving no ambiguity regarding the early history of the Universe. In ref.~\cite{Zhang:2023oyo}, we demonstrate that non-thermal leptogenesis from inflaton decay expands the viable parameter space compared to thermal leptogenesis and provides a natural link to inflation. In this work, we refine our previous findings by closely examining the dynamics of neutrino reheating. We first calculate the duration of neutrino reheating on a general basis, then analyze inflationary observables consistent with neutrino reheating across four models, establishing a direct connection between baryon asymmetry and the spectral index. This approach places these two important observables on the same plane and yields specific predictions that help break the degeneracy among inflationary models. The well-motivated and economical framework offers a simple, natural, and testable description of the early Universe.</description>
