      <title>Relativistic Time Modeling for Lunar Positioning Navigation and Timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future lunar missions will depend on an internationally agreed upon timescale that remains accurate under the Moon's unique gravitational environment and its orbital dynamics. This thesis investigates the proposed Lunar Coordinate Time (TCL), derived analogously to Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG) and thus aligned with current IAU proposals. We first formalise the TCL transformation and quantify its characteristics from solar system simulations. Next, we compute stationary surface-clock drifts caused by gravitational redshift and the Moon's changing orientation parameters, evaluating how accurate atomic clocks deployed on the surface of the Moon (much like for ESA's proposed NovaMoon mission) would have to be to measure these effects. Finally, we simulate relativistic proper time for ESA's Moonlight navigation satellites, identifying average drift and harmonic variations, to better understand the system that will comprise and enable a Lunar PNT (Positioning, Navigation and Timing) architecture. These kinds of investigations are an essential step toward a sustained internationally cooperative operation at the lunar south pole and beyond.</description>

      <title>Snowball Bistability Vanishes at Moderate Orbital Eccentricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Snowball episodes are associated with increases in atmospheric oxygen and the complexity of life on Earth, and they may be essential for the development of complex life on exoplanets. Sustained stable Snowball episodes require a Snowball bifurcation and climate bistability between the globally ice-covered Snowball state and a state with at least some open ocean. We find that climate bistability disappears for an aquaplanet with a slab ocean in the Global Climate Model ExoCAM when the orbital eccentricity is increased to 0.2-0.3. This happens because the Snowball state loses stability as seasonal insolation variations intensify, while the warm state remains stable due to the ocean's large heat capacity. We use a low-order ice-thermodynamic model to show that the Snowball state loses stability as seasonality increases because winter freezing at the ice bottom is reduced relative to summer melting at the ice top due to ice self-insulation. Combined with previous research showing that Snowball climate bistability diminishes for planets orbiting low-mass stars, ones with longer rotation periods, and disappears entirely for tidally locked planets, our work suggests that the Snowball climate bistability may not be as robust to planetary parameters as previously thought, representing one aspect of habitability more consistent with the Rare Earth Hypothesis than the Copernican Principle.</description>

      <title>Dust growth and planet formation by disc fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is often argued that gravitational instability of realistic protoplanetary discs is only possible at distances larger than $\sim 50$ au from the central star, requiring high disc masses and accretion rates, and that therefore disc fragmentation results in the production of brown dwarfs rather than gas giant planets. However, the effects of dust growth on opacity can be very significant but have not been taken into account systematically in the models of fragmenting discs. We employ dust opacity that depends on both temperature and maximum grain size to evaluate analytically the properties of a critically fragmenting protoplanetary disc. We find that dust growth may promote disc fragmentation at disc radii as small as $\sim 30$ au. As a result, the critical disc masses and accretion rates are smaller, and the initial fragment masses are in the gas giant planet mass regime. While this suggests that formation of gas giant planets by disc fragmentation may be more likely than usually believed, we caution that numerical models of the process are needed to evaluate the effects not taken into account here, e.g., dust grain mobility and fragment evolution after disc fragmentation.</description>

      <title>A Radially Resolved Magnetic Field Threading the Disk of TW Hya</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new approach to detecting and characterizing a magnetic field in protoplanetary disks through the differential broadening of unpolarized molecular emission from CN. To demonstrate this technique, we apply it to new ALMA observations of the full complement of hyperfine components from the $N=1-0$ transition, achieving a spatial and spectral resolution of ${\approx}\,0.5^{\prime\prime}$ and $80~{\rm m\,s^{-1}}$, respectively. By fitting a model that incorporates the velocity structure of the disk, the potential non-LTE excitation of the molecule, and the Zeeman effect, we recover a radially resolved magnetic field with a strength of ${\sim}10~{\rm mG}$ between 60 and 120~au. The morphology of the field is also inferred through azimuthal variations in the line broadening, revealing a predominantly poloidal field at 60~au, sharply transitioning to one within the disk plane outside of the gap at 82~au. The signal-to-noise ratio of the data meant that the planar component was unable to be decomposed into toroidal and radial components. Lower limits on the local gas density ($n({\rm H_2}) \gtrsim 10^8~{\rm cm^{-3}}$) from the excitation analysis of the CN emission correspond to a lower limit between 0.1 and 0.01 for the plasma $\beta$.</description>

      <title>YSES 2b is a background star: Differential astrometric M-dwarf measurements in time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We wish to confirm the nature of YSES 2b, a purportedly faint companion of the young star YSES 2. We used on-sky observations from SPHERE and GRAVITY to measure the astrometric position of 2b with respect to the star YSES 2, and examined the competing hypotheses of (i) a bound substellar companion versus (ii) a distant unrelated background source with a non-zero proper motion. YSES 2b appears to be a late-type M-dwarf star over 2 kiloparsecs behind the star YSES 2. It has a transverse velocity of about 300 km/s and is located within one of the spiral arms of the Galaxy. The main discriminant was multiple epochs of GRAVITY astrometry that identified the sub-milliarcsecond parallactic motion of the star.</description>

      <title>Empirical Modeling of Zodiacal Backgrounds to Improve JWST NIRISS/SOSS Data Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zodiacal light -- arising from both the thermal emission and scattered sunlight by interplanetary dust -- is the dominant component of the sky background in NIRISS Single Object Slitless Spectroscopy (SOSS) observations. The GR700XD grism disperses the zodiacal background across multiple diffraction orders, producing a characteristic two-dimensional, spectral order-dependent background pattern on the detector that reflects the combined contribution of overlapping orders. Observations reveal significant variability in background intensity driven by JWST's sky pointing and seasonal changes, underscoring the need for precise background subtraction during SOSS data reduction. Current methods rely on a generic background template derived during commissioning, scaled to match individual exposures. However, mis-scaled templates can leave behind structured residuals that may compromise the precision of exoplanet transit depth measurements. To improve background modeling, we conducted two calibration programs (PID 4479 and 6658) using the FULL frame readout mode and a 5-row by 2-column mosaic pattern to sample a range of sky positions. These observations enable empirical reconstruction of the sky background and provide detailed insights into its spatial and spectral characteristics. We present a library of empirically derived background templates and evaluate their performance, alongside the current template, by benchmarking against the PID 2113 dataset, which includes contemporaneous background exposures. This work supports aims to enhance background subtraction for SOSS time-series to achieve higher-precision exoplanet spectroscopy with JWST.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating Improved Contrast on the Roman Coronagraph with Spatial Linear Dark Field Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The baseline contrast floor from the Roman Coronagraph's High-Order Wavefront Sensing and Control strategy likely degrades over the course of time, requiring periodic recalibration of the dark hole. Here, we propose to consider spatial linear dark field control (sLDFC) on a one-sided deep-contrast region of the focal plane as a potential test. Implementing sLDFC on CGI will likely require some unique data acquisition strategies given the EMCCD's high flux sensitivity in long exposures/high gain: we outline three possible approaches. However, if successful, sLDFC's advances are substantial: (1) enabling us to maintain a fainter, more temporally correlated dark hole which will improve CGI's contrast after post-processing and (2) efficiently providing a reliable signal (bright field) for accurate reconstruction of residual starlight in the dark field, further boosting CGI's detection limit for bright targets.</description>

      <title>HWO Target Stars and Systems: A Survey of Archival UV and X-ray Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assess archival high-energy data for key stars on the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) Target Stars and Systems 2025 list, as stellar radiation is critical to shaping and interpreting planetary atmospheres. Using a sample of 98 nearby stars (HWO Tier 1 targets), we compile and evaluate X-ray and ultraviolet (UV) data from archival eROSITA, Chandra, XMM-Newton, ROSAT, EUVE, Swift, FUSE, IUE, GALEX, and HST. We examine spectral and temporal coverage, assess data quality, and identify major gaps. UV data are moderately available, with most coverage coming from near-UV spectra from IUE. Far fewer stars have far-UV spectra, especially from HST. In the X-ray regime, some stars have high-quality spectra, while others are limited to shallow detections or broad-band photometry. A small fraction of the sample has both X-ray and UV spectra of sufficient quality to support full spectral energy distribution modeling. Truly comprehensive coverage across X-ray, extreme-UV, and both UV bands remains extremely rare. Most datasets are single-epoch, limiting assessments of variability and flares - key factors in atmospheric photochemistry and escape. Moreover, the lack of simultaneous or contemporaneous observations across bands adds further uncertainty. Our findings underscore the need for new space-based missions and coordinated multiwavelength campaigns, ideally with overlapping coverage, to improve stellar characterization for HWO. As several key observatories age and face potential decommissioning, there is a narrow window of opportunity to secure these critical data. Investing in this effort now will directly support the science goals of HWO and enhance future studies of planetary habitability.</description>

      <title>Lyman-Alpha Emission from K and M Dwarfs: Intrinsic Profiles, Variability, and Flux in the Habitable Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) is the most prominent ultraviolet emission line in low-mass stars, playing a crucial role in exoplanet atmospheric photochemistry, heating, and escape. However, interstellar medium (ISM) absorption typically obscures most of the Ly$\alpha$ profile, requiring reconstructions that introduce systematic uncertainties. We present intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ profiles for 12 high radial velocity K and M dwarfs, where Doppler shifting minimizes ISM contamination, allowing direct measurements of $\sim$50-95\% of the line flux. Our sample spans the K-to-M spectral transition, enabling us to constrain the dependence of self-reversals in Ly$\alpha$ emission profiles on effective temperature ($T_{eff}$). The depth of self-reversal, driven by non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) effects, decreases with decreasing $T_{eff}$, with M dwarfs exhibiting little to none. Two stars, Ross 1044 and Ross 451, were observed over multiple days, revealing $\sim$20\% Ly$\alpha$ variability confined to the line core - implying that studies relying on reconstructions may underestimate temporal variability. We find strong correlations between Ly$\alpha$ flux, peak-to-trough ratio, and hydrogen departure coefficients with $T_{eff}$, providing empirical constraints for stellar atmosphere models. A comparison of Ly$\alpha$ flux in the habitable zone shows measured values for high radial velocity stars less than the reconstructed values for the rest of the sample, likely due to the older ages of the high-RV stars and/or overestimated reconstructed fluxes due to model deficiency (e.g., neglecting self-reversal). Our results establish an empirical foundation for Ly$\alpha$ emission in K and M dwarfs, reducing uncertainties in reconstructions and improving models of stellar UV emission relevant to exoplanetary studies.</description>

      <title>High-resolution simulations of disc tearing in the GW Orionis triple system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The disc around the pre-main-sequence triple star system GW Orionis is known from observations to be warped and broken. Theoretical modelling has produced conflicting results regarding the mechanism responsible for breaking the disc. Analytical predictions for the measured parameters of GW Ori suggest the disc is only marginally stable to tearing. We present new high-resolution simulations of GW Ori that replicate the wavelike regime expected in thick, low-turbulence protoplanetary discs for the first time to settle this question. Using the most optimistic values of misalignment and stellar mass ratio allowed by observational constraints, we find that the GW Ori disc can be torn by stellar torques alone, without need for an embedded planet. Even if the disc retains a smooth warp in simulations with similar parameters, it is likely that any small perturbation in the density or temperature structure could cause the disc to break. The new simulations rule out retrograde disc rotation relative to the stellar orbits and tentatively suggest the thicker ($h/r = 0.04$) disc better matches observations. Going forward, we should take care to ensure models of GW Ori and similar systems appropriately represent the propagation of warps. Additionally, analytical predictions are derived from idealized (and often massless) discs and it is useful to assess how each observed disc might deviate from those assumptions, especially in the context of a young and active star-forming neighbourhood.</description>

      <title>Dual-Backend Multibeam Position Switching Targeted SETI Observations toward Nearby Active Planet-Hosting Systems with FAST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), the world's largest single-dish radio telescope, lists the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) as one of its key scientific objectives. In this work, we present a targeted SETI observation for 7 nearby active stars utilizing the FAST L-band multibeam receiver, employing a observational strategy that combines position switching with multibeam tracking to balance on-source integration time with the accuracy of the beam response. Using both pulsar and SETI backends, we perform a comprehensive search for narrowband drifting signals with Doppler drift rates within $\pm 4 \ \mathrm{Hz\ s^{-1}}$ and channel-width periodic signal with periods between 0.12 and 100 s and duty cycles between 10\% and 50\%. No credible radio technosignatures were detected from any of the target systems. Based on this null result, we place constraints on the presence of transmitters at a 95\% confidence level, ruling out narrowband transmitters with with EIRP above $3.98\times10^8 \,\mathrm{W}$ and periodic transmitter with EIRP above $1.80\times10^{10} \,\mathrm{W}$,respectively, within the observation band.</description>

      <title>Detecting Land with Reflected Light Spectroscopy to Rule Out Waterworld O$_2$ Biosignature False Positives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21790v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for life outside our solar system is at the forefront of modern astronomy, and telescopes such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) are being designed to identify biosignatures. Molecular oxygen, O$_2$, is considered a promising indication of life, yet substantial abiotic O$_2$ may accumulate from H$_2$O photolysis and hydrogen escape on a lifeless, fully (100%) ocean-covered terrestrial planet when surface O$_2$ sinks are suppressed. This so-called waterworld false positive scenario could be ruled out with land detection because exposed land precludes extremely deep oceans (~50 Earth oceans) given topographic limits set by the crushing strength of rocks. Land detection is possible because plausible geologic surfaces exhibit increasing reflectance with wavelength in the visible, whereas liquid water and ice/snow have flat or decreasing reflectance, respectively. Here, we present reflected light retrievals to demonstrate that HWO could detect land on an exo-Earth in the disk-averaged spectrum. Given a signal-to-noise ratio of 20 spectrum, Earth-like land fractions can be confidently detected with 0.3-1.1 $\mu$m spectral coverage (resolution R~140 in the visible, R~7 in the UV, with Earth-like atmosphere and clouds). We emphasize the need for UV spectroscopy down to at least 0.3 $\mu$m to break an O$_3$-land degeneracy. We find that the SNR and resolution requirements in the visible/UV imply that a larger aperture (~8 m) will be necessary to ensure the observing times required for land detection are feasible for most HWO terrestrial habitable zone targets. These results strongly inform the HWO minimum requirements to corroborate possible oxygen biosignatures.</description>

Abstract: Near-Earth objects (NEOs) have the potential to cause extensive damage and loss of life on Earth. Advancements in NEO discovery, trajectory prediction, and deflection technology indicate that an impact could be prevented, with sufficient warning time. We derive an impact frequency of NEOs 140m and larger, using the NEOMOD2 NEO population model and JPL Horizons. We then place that frequency in context with other preventable causes of death; allowing for comparison between a planet-wide event and individual events that cause fatalities such as car crashes and carbon monoxide poisoning. We find that the chance of a $&gt;140$ m asteroid hitting the Earth is more likely than the chance of an individual being struck by lightning.</description>

Abstract: I present a preliminary orbit for the satellite of dwarf planet (136472) Makemake, based on archival Hubble Space Telescope images taken on 13 days between April 2015 and February 2019. The satellite was detected on twelve of them. A best-fit circular orbit has a period of $18.023 \pm 0.017$ d, a semi-major axis of $22250 \pm 780$ km, and an inclination of $83.7^{\circ} \pm 1.0^{\circ}$ relative to the line of sight. That orbit is nearly edge-on, raising the possibility of ongoing or imminent mutual events between Makemake and its satellite.</description>

      <title>MasconCube: Fast and Accurate Gravity Modeling with an Explicit Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geodesy of irregularly shaped small bodies presents fundamental challenges for gravitational field modeling, particularly as deep space exploration missions increasingly target asteroids and comets. Traditional approaches suffer from critical limitations: spherical harmonics diverge within the Brillouin sphere where spacecraft typically operate, polyhedral models assume unrealistic homogeneous density distributions, and existing machine learning methods like GeodesyNets and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN-GM) require extensive computational resources and training time. This work introduces MasconCubes, a novel self-supervised learning approach that formulates gravity inversion as a direct optimization problem over a regular 3D grid of point masses (mascons). Unlike implicit neural representations, MasconCubes explicitly model mass distributions while leveraging known asteroid shape information to constrain the solution space. Comprehensive evaluation on diverse asteroid models including Bennu, Eros, Itokawa, and synthetic planetesimals demonstrates that MasconCubes achieve superior performance across multiple metrics. Most notably, MasconCubes demonstrate computational efficiency advantages with training times approximately 40 times faster than GeodesyNets while maintaining physical interpretability through explicit mass distributions. These results establish MasconCubes as a promising approach for mission-critical gravitational modeling applications requiring high accuracy, computational efficiency, and physical insight into internal mass distributions of irregular celestial bodies.</description>
