      <title>Quantum at a Music Festival: the Impact of an Exhibit about Quantum Science and Technologies on Festival Visitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum technologies are seen as transformative, with a potential to revolutionize fields like drug discovery and machine learning. Public engagement is crucial to align these developments with societal needs and foster acceptance. This study measured the impact of an exhibit about quantum technologies at the 2024 Lowlands music festival (n = 812). Pre- and post-surveys assessed changes in attitude, concern, interest and subjective knowledge. Results showed an increase in subjective knowledge but a decrease in interest, possibly due to reduced novelty or increased perceived difficulty. These findings underscore the effectiveness of exhibits as outreach tools in informal settings and highlight the critical role of maintaining novelty and emphasizing the relevance of quantum technologies in future outreach efforts. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of assessing outreach effectiveness to ensure that objectives are successfully achieved.</description>

      <title>Neuroqueer Literacies in a Physics Context: A Discussion on Changing the Physics Classroom Using a Neuroqueer Literacy Framework</title>

Abstract: Neurodiversity, the paradigm shift away from a pathologization of cognitive difference and towards a celebration of cognitive diversity, in an educational context has important implications on how educators structure their classes and on how they develop inclusive and responsive pedagogies, which we discuss in this article. Being neurodivergent means having non-normative ways of thinking, sensing, and behaving. Because of this, neurodivergent people learn and perform their understanding of physics differently than neurotypical people. Kleekamp and Smilges call to our attention that when educators assess student competence, educators do so in a normative way. That is to say, educators privilege specific (non-disabled) ways of demonstrating understanding while pushing students who problem solve differently to the margins. By using a neuroqueer literacy framework from Kleekamp and Smilges and applying ideas on neurodivergent physics learning and performance from McDermott, we provide recommendations for neuro-inclusive physics pedagogy.

      <title>Evaluation of a Virtual Laboratory Platform in General Education on Quantum Information Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the findings of pedagogical research on the efficacy of a virtual laboratory platform in general education courses on quantum information science. Specifically, a virtual laboratory activity based on the Bell test has been developed using a commercially available Quantum Optical Simulation Laboratory, QLab. The experiential activity is designed to help undergraduates from diverse academic disciplines understand the counterintuitive yet foundational concept of quantum entanglement. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations conducted over three academic years using carefully designed questionnaires indicated that the virtual laboratory enabled over 80% of students to grasp the complex concepts of quantum entanglement. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the virtual laboratory in making abstract quantum concepts accessible and engaging, regardless of students' prior knowledge of advanced mathematics or technical skills. Despite certain limitations, such as the relatively small sample sizes in the last two semesters, this study offers valuable insights and a practical framework for addressing the challenges of teaching quantum information science in undergraduate curricula, particularly within general education courses designed for both science and non-science students.</description>
