      <title>A U-match Algorithm for Persistent Relative Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central problem in data-driven scientific inquiry is how to interpret structure in noisy, high-dimensional data. Topological data analysis (TDA) provides a solution via persistent homology, which encodes features of interest as topological holes within a filtration of data. The present work extends this framework to a related invariant which uncovers topological structure of a space relative to a subspace: persistent relative homology (PRH). We show that this invariant can be computed in a simple, highly transparent and general manner, using a two-step matrix reduction technique with worst-case time complexity comparable to ordinary persistent homology. We provide proofs demonstrating the correctness and computational complexity of this approach in addition to a performance-optimized implementation for a special case.</description>

      <title>Computational techniques for sheaf cohomology of locally profinite sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the sheaf cohomology with constant $\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients of a concrete class of locally profinite sets of independent interest. We introduce $k$-Fubini partitions to aid in constructions, which witness a failure of a Fubini theorem analog for these spaces. It is also shown that questions of intermediate cohomology degrees can be reduced to questions about top cohomology degrees by exhibiting nontrivial top cocycles as pointwise limits of coboundaries.</description>

      <title>Norms and Hermitian $\mathrm{K}$-Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past century, cohomology operations have played a crucial role in homotopy theory and its applications. A powerful framework for constructing such operations is the theory of commutative algebras in spectra. In this article, we discuss an algebro-geometric analogue of this framework, called the theory of normed algebras in motivic spectra. Specifically, we show that the motivic spectrum $\mathrm{ko}$ representing very effective hermitian $\mathrm{K}$-theory can be equipped with a normed algebra structure, and that the orientation map $\mathrm{MSL} \to \mathrm{ko}$ respects this structure. The main step will be showing that the motivic infinite loop space machine is compatible with norms.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and Higher-Form Connections in Derived Differential Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general definition of higher-form connections on principal $\infty$-bundles in differential geometry. This is achieved by developing the formal differentiation and integration of maps from smooth manifolds to derived stacks with sufficient deformation theory. That allows us to introduce the Atiyah $L_\infty$-algebroid of a principal $\infty$-bundle and establish its global sections as the $L_\infty$-algebra of the derived higher symmetry group of the bundle. We define the space of $p$-form connections on an $\infty$-bundle as the space of order $p$ splittings of its Atiyah $L_\infty$-algebroid. We demonstrate that our new concept of derived geometric $p$-form connections recovers the known notion of connections on higher U(1)-bundles defined via \v{C}ech-Deligne differential cocycles. We further relate the $L_\infty$-algebras of derived higher symmetries of higher U(1)-bundles and higher Courant algebroids. Some applications in higher gauge theory and in supergravity are mentioned.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce two definitions of $G$-equivariant partitions of a finite $G$-set, both of which yield $G$-equivariant partition complexes. By considering suitable notions of equivariant trees, we show that $G$-equivariant partitions and $G$-trees are $G$-homotopy equivalent, generalizing existing results for the non-equivariant setting. Along the way, we develop equivariant versions of Quillen's Theorems A and B, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A Structural Characterization of the Hit Image in the Motivic Steenrod Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The motivic hit problem seeks a minimal generating set for the motivic cohomology of classifying spaces as a module over the motivic Steenrod algebra. In this paper, we provide a complete structural classification of the hit image within the top layer of Kameko's decomposition, revealing a sharp dichotomy governed by parity. Specifically, for degrees $d=k+2d_1$ with $d_1=(n-1)(2^k-1)$, let $V$ denote the span of the monotone translates of Kameko's monomial $z_k$. We prove that the intersection of $V$ with the hit subspace is exactly the even-parity hyperplane. Consequently, the quotient $V/(\text{hits})$ is one-dimensional and is generated by any odd-parity linear combination of these translates. This establishes the "odd-parity gap" as the precise obstruction to the hit property in this layer. As an arithmetic consequence of this structural result, we identify a new infinite numerical family with $n=2^r+1$ and $k=n-4$ ($r\ge 5$) where $\beta(d)&gt;n$. This yields a new class of counterexamples to the motivic Peterson-type conjecture, distinct from Kameko's original family. Furthermore, we show that these structural results and counterexamples persist over any algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$.</description>

      <title>Invertible phases for mixed spatial symmetries and the fermionic crystalline equivalence principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.02941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Freed-Hopkins give a mathematical ansatz for classifying gapped invertible phases of matter with a spatial symmetry in terms of Borel-equivariant generalized homology. We propose a slight generalization of this ansatz to account for cases where the symmetry type mixes nontrivially with the spatial symmetry, such as crystalline phases with spin-1/2 fermions. From this ansatz, we prove as a theorem a "fermionic crystalline equivalence principle," as predicted in the physics literature. Using this and the Adams spectral sequence, we compute classifications of some classes of phases with a point group symmetry; in cases where these phases have been studied by other methods, our results agree with the literature.</description>

      <title>Random Surfaces and Higher Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08366v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a characteristic function for laws of random surfaces $\mathbf{X}: [0,s] \times [0,t] \to \mathbb{R}^d$, in the spirit of expected path developments for one-dimensional stochastic processes into matrix groups. A key property is that path development is structure preserving: path concatenation becomes matrix multiplication. The main challenge is to account for two distinct concatenation operations for surfaces: horizontal and vertical. To address this, we use the notion of surface holonomy from higher geometry to define surface developments, and study this in a stochastic context. We generalize surface developments to the Young setting of $\rho$-H\"older surfaces, where $\rho &gt; \frac12$, show that such developments characterize parametrized surfaces. Our main result shows that the resulting expected surface development provides a computable and structured description of laws of random surfaces and leads to a natural metric on the space of probability measures on surfaces.</description>

      <title>Hom complexes of graphs whose codomains are square-free</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19144v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hom complex $\mathrm{Hom}(G, H)$ of graphs is a simplicial complex associated to a pair of graphs $G$ and $H$, and its homotopy type is of interest in the graph coloring problem and the homomorphism reconfiguration problem. In this paper, we show that if $G$ is a connected graph and $H$ is a square-free connected graph, then every connected component of $\mathrm{Hom}(G, H)$ is homotopy equivalent to a point, a circle, $H$ or a connected double cover over $H$. We also obtain a certain relation between the fundamental group of $\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ and realizable walks studied in the homomorphism reconfiguration problem.</description>
