      <title>Reflected entropy in random tensor networks III: triway cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For general random tensor network states at large bond dimension, we prove that the integer R\'enyi reflected entropies (away from phase transitions) are determined by minimal triway cuts through the network. This generalizes the minimal cut description of bipartite entanglement for these states. A natural extrapolation away from integer R\'enyi parameters, suggested by the triway cut problem, implies the holographic conjecture $S_R=2EW$, where $S_R$ is the reflected entropy and $EW$ is the entanglement wedge cross-section. Minimal triway cuts can be formulated as integer programs which cannot be relaxed to find a dual maximal flow/bit-thread description. This sheds light on the gap between the existence of tripartite entanglement in holographic states and the bipartite entanglement structure motivated by bit-threads. In particular, we prove that the Markov gap that measures tripartite entanglement is lower bounded by the integrality gap of the integer program that computes the triway cut.</description>

      <title>Parting gravity's tail: quadrupole tails at fifth order and beyond via integer partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the systematic organization of higher-order gravitational quadrupole tails using generalized unitarity methods imported from the study of scattering amplitudes. The first major result is a constructive algorithm for generic arbitrary-order tail effective actions which links the structure of their loop integral basis expansion with integer partitions, and predicts that only a single new unitarity cut needs to be evaluated at each tail order with all other contributions given in terms of lower-loop data. The algorithm is employed to compute the tail-of-tail-of-tail-of-tail-of-tail (T$^5$) contributions to the effective action and associated energy loss to gravitational waves. Validation of the new effective action and radiated energy is done through counterterm extraction and renormalization analysis, leading to complete agreement with known counterterms and renormalization flow equations.</description>

      <title>Atomic Higgsings of 6D SCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the full Higgs branch Hasse diagram for any given 6d $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ SCFT constructed via F-theory. This can be done by a procedure of determining all the minimal Higgsings on the generalized quiver of the 6d SCFT. We call this procedure the atomic Higgsing, which can be implemented iteratively. We present our general algorithms with many concrete examples of Hasse diagrams. We also compare our algorithm with the Higgsings determined by the 3d $\mathcal{N} = 4$ magnetic quivers. For the cases where the magnetic quivers are unitary, we can reproduce the full Hasse diagrams. We also construct the orthosymplectic magnetic quivers from the Type IIA brane systems for some new examples. Our approach, based on F-theory, applies to the known and new orthosymplectic cases, as well as theories that do not have known descriptions in terms of magnetic quivers. We expect our geometry-based approach to help extend the horizon of the RG flows of the 6d SCFTs.</description>

      <title>Solving four-dimensional superconformal Yang-Mills theories with Tracy-Widom distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a special class of observables in $\mathcal N=2$ and $\mathcal N=4$ superconformal Yang-Mills theories which, for an arbitrary 't Hooft coupling constant $\lambda$, admit representation as determinants of certain semi-infinite matrices. Similar determinants have previously appeared in the study of level-spacing distributions in random matrices and are closely related to the celebrated Tracy-Widom distribution. We exploit this relationship to develop an efficient method for computing the observables in superconformal Yang-Mills theories at both weak and strong coupling. The weak coupling expansion has a finite radius of convergence. The strong coupling expansion involves the sum of the `perturbative' part, given by series in $1/\sqrt\lambda$, and the `non-perturbative' part, given by an infinite sum of exponentially small terms, each accompanied by a series in $1/\sqrt\lambda$ with factorially growing coefficients. We explicitly compute the expansion coefficients of these series and show that they are uniquely determined by the large order behavior of the expansion coefficients of the perturbative part via resurgence relations.</description>

      <title>The complex Liouville string</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the complex Liouville string, a solvable string theory defined by coupling two Liouville theories with complex conjugate central charges $c \in 13+i \mathbb{R}$ on the worldsheet. We compute its amplitudes from first principles and establish a duality with a double-scaled two-matrix integral. We also analyze general worldsheet boundaries and non-perturbative effects in the genus expansion. This theory is capable of capturing aspects of de Sitter quantum gravity in both two and three dimensions, which leads to a precise version of de Sitter holography.</description>

      <title>Boson-fermion algebraic mapping in second quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algebraic method to derive the structure at the basis of the mapping of bosonic algebras of creation and annihilation operators into fermionic algebras, and vice versa, introducing a suitable identification between bosonic and fermionic generators. The algebraic structure thus obtained corresponds to a deformed Grassmann algebra, involving anticommuting Grassmann-type variables. The role played by the latter in the implementation of gauge invariance in second quantization within our procedure is then discussed, together with the application of the mapping to the case of the bosonic and fermionic harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Towards a complete classification of holographic entropy inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a deterministic method to find all holographic entropy inequalities and prove the completeness of our method. We use a triality between holographic entropy inequalities, contraction maps and partial cubes. More specifically, the validity of a holographic entropy inequality is implied by the existence of a contraction map, which we prove to be equivalent to finding an isometric embedding of a contracted graph. Thus, by virtue of the completeness of the contraction map proof method, the problem of finding all holographic entropy inequalities is equivalent to the problem of finding all contraction maps, which we translate to a problem of finding all image graph partial cubes. We give an algorithmic solution to this problem and characterize the complexity of our method. We also demonstrate interesting by-products, most notably, a procedure to generate candidate quantum entropy inequalities.</description>

      <title>Deformations of the AdS-Schwarzschild black brane and the shear viscosity of the quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deformations of the AdS$_5$-Schwarzschild black brane, implemented in the AdS/CFT membrane paradigm, are scrutinized in the dual viscous hydrodynamic infrared limit. The latest experimental data analyses, regarding the shear viscosity-to-entropy density ratio of the quark-gluon plasma produced by heavy-ion collisions at the LHC and RHIC, are shown to constrain these deformations severely. Although corroborating with the robustness of the standard AdS$_5$-Schwarzschild black brane against deformations, there is still a margin for mild deformations which may carry 2-loop quantum corrections to gravity, whose implications to the strongly-coupled dual field theory are addressed and discussed.</description>

      <title>Generalized Supergravity Equations for the WZW Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized supergravity equations (GSEs) were originally proposed as a modification of the standard IIB supergravity equations to satisfy the background of $\eta$-deformed $AdS_5 \times S^5$ introduced by Arutyunov {\it et al}. In this study, we proceed to write down the GSEs for the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models based on Lie groups. First, we simplify the GSEs for the WZW model by imposing the conditions for vanishing of the one-loop beta function equations. Then, by introducing an {\it Ansatz} for the Killing vector field $I$, it is shown that the Killing equation ${\cal L}_{_{I}} G_{_{\mu \nu}}=0$ is held. In this way, we solve the simplified GSEs for the WZW models constructed on Lie groups up to dimension five.</description>

      <title>Euclidean and complex geometries from real-time computations of gravitational R\'enyi entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational R\'enyi computations have traditionally been described in the language of Euclidean path integrals. In the semiclassical limit, such calculations are governed by Euclidean (or, more generally, complex) saddle-point geometries. We emphasize here that, at least in simple contexts, the Euclidean approach suggests an alternative formulation in terms of the bulk quantum wavefunction. Since this alternate formulation can be directly applied to the real-time quantum theory, it is insensitive to subtleties involved in defining the Euclidean path integral. In particular, it can be consistent with many different choices of integration contour.
  Despite the fact that self-adjoint operators in the associated real-time quantum theory have real eigenvalues, we note that the bulk wavefunction encodes the Euclidean (or complex) R\'enyi geometries that would arise in any Euclidean path integral. As a result, for any given quantum state, the appropriate real-time path integral yields both R\'enyi entropies and associated complex saddle-point geometries that agree with Euclidean methods. After brief explanations of these general points, we use JT gravity to illustrate the associated real-time computations in detail.</description>

      <title>Higher spin AdS$_{3}$ gravity and Tits-Satake diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate higher spin AdS$_{3}$ gravity with real split forms of complex A$_{N}$ B$_{N}$, C$_{N}$ and D$_{N}$ Lie algebras. This is done by linking $SO(1,2)$ spin multiplets with splitted root systems using Tits-Satake diagrams of real forms. Unlike $SL(N,R)$, we show that the orthogonal families have two different higher spin (HS) spectrums: vectorial and spinorial. We find amongst others that the spinorial spectrum has an isolated spin j$_{\mathcal{N}}$ given by $\mathcal{N}\left(\mathcal{N}+1\right)/2$ for $SO(\mathcal{N},1+\mathcal{N})$ and $\mathcal{N} \left( \mathcal{N}-1\right) /2$ for $SO(\mathcal{N},\mathcal{N})$. We implement these results into the computation of the HS partition functions in these gravity theories and identify the individual contributions of the higher spin fields; valuable to manoeuver the HS-BTZ black hole partition function</description>

      <title>Worldline Formalism, Eikonal Expansion and the Classical Limit of Scattering Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the fundamentals of two different methods for calculating classical observables: the eikonal method, which is a scattering amplitude-based method, and the worldline quantum field theory (WQFT) method. The latter has been considered an extension of the worldline effective field theory. We show that the eikonal and WQFT methods are equivalent and that calculations can be translated freely between them.
  Concretely, we focus on 2-into-2 scattering processes mediated by massless force carriers. On the one hand, taking the classical limit of the QFT scattering amplitude leads to the eikonal method. On the other hand, since in the classical limit the scattering particles are almost on-shell throughout the scattering process, the worldline, a first quantized formalism, is the most efficient framework to study the scattering amplitude. This is an alternate but equivalent formalism to the quantum field theoretic (QFT) framework. By taking the classical limit of the scattering amplitude computed in the worldline, we can derive the WQFT rules of Mogull, Plefka and Steinhoff. In WQFT, the Feynman diagrams are reorganized into a new set of diagrams that facilitate the $\hbar$ expansion. Unlike the QFT eikonal method, which works recursively in identifying the eikonal phase, the worldline-based computation allows to target and systematically extract the classical contributions directly through a specific set of WQFT diagrams. In worldline formalism the perturbative expansion of the scattering amplitude is naturally organized in diagrams which factorize (reducible) and diagrams which are new to that order (irreducible), in a one-to-one map with the structure of the amplitude in the eikonal method. This opened up the possibility to investigate and prove the conjectured exponentiation of the eikonal phase in arXiv: 2409.12895.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Enhancement, SPT Absorption, and Duality in QED$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions (QED$_3$) with two Dirac fermions displays time reversal symmetry, nontrivial SPT phases and anomalies. The fate of this theory in its strongly coupled regime has been debated extensively. Surprisingly, we find that gluing together the phase diagrams of two standard Wilson-Fisher $O(4)$ theories suffices to reproduce all the SPT phases, anomalies, and semi-classical limits. A central mechanism behind it is ``SPT absorption''. The patching of the $O(4)$ transitions makes very concrete predictions for the behavior of the theory in its strongly coupled limits; for instance, the $\theta=\pi$ sigma model with $S^3$ topology appears due to monopole condensation.</description>

      <title>Symmetries, Universes and Phases of QCD$_2$ with an Adjoint Dirac Fermion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study 2d $SU(N)$ QCD with an adjoint Dirac fermion. Assuming that the IR limit of the massless theory is captured by a WZW coset CFT, we show that this CFT can be decomposed into a sum of distinct CFTs, each representing a superselection sector (universe) of the gauge theory corresponding to different flux tube sectors. The CFTs describing each universe are related by non-invertible topological lines that exhibit a mixed anomaly with the $\mathbb{Z}^{(1)}_N$ 1-form symmetry. These symmetries exist along the entire RG flow thereby implying deconfinement of the massless theory. We begin by outlining the general features of the model for arbitrary $N$ and then provide a detailed analysis for $N=2$ and $N=3$. In these specific cases, we explicitly determine the IR partition function, identify the symmetries, and explore relevant deformations. Based on these findings and in alignment with various previous studies, we propose a phase diagram for the massive $SU(2)$ gauge theory and calculate its confining string tension.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Carrollian limit of ModMax electrodynamics, namely the limit of vanishing speed of light, for the most general, four-dimensional, duality and conformal invariant electromagnetism. The theory is parameterized by a unique real constant $\gamma$, which remains playing a non-trivial role in the magnetic Carrollian case, while it can be removed in the electric Carrollian contraction, and we therefore focus in the former. Applying the technique of Lie point symmetries, we obtain that the magnetic limit is invariant under the Carrollian group, as well as under the local translation in Carrollian time $x^{0}\rightarrow x^{0\prime}=x^{0}+f\left(x^{i}\right) $ and $x^{i}\rightarrow x^{i\prime}=x^{i}$, with $f$ being an arbitrary function. A diagonal part of the symmetries span the Conformal Carroll algebra of level $2$, $\mathfrak{ccarr}_2$ in four dimensions. Two additional internal symmetries remain in the Carrollian limit of ModMax standing for the conformal invariance of the theory, as well as the invariance under duality transformations.</description>

      <title>Bridging 4D QFTs and 2D VOAs via 3D high-temperature EFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-temperature limit of the superconformal index, especially on higher sheets, often captures useful universal information about a theory. In 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories with fractional r-charges, there exists a special notion of high-temperature limit on higher sheets that captures data of three-dimensional topological quantum field theories arising from r-twisted circle reduction. These TQFTs are closely tied with the VOA of the 4d SCFT. We study such high-temperature limits. More specifically, we apply Di~Pietro-Komargodski type supersymmetric effective field theory techniques to r-twisted circle reductions of $(A_1,A_{2n})$ Argyres-Douglas theories, leveraging their Maruyoshi-Song Lagrangian with manifest $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry. The result on the second sheet is the Gang-Kim-Stubbs family of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SUSY enhancing rank-$0$ theories with monopole superpotentials, whose boundary supports the Virasoro minimal model VOAs $M(2,2n+3)$. Upon topological twist, they give non-unitary TQFTs controlled by the $M(2,2n+3)$ modular tensor category (MTC). The high-temperature limit on other sheets yields their unitary or non-unitary Galois conjugates. This opens up the prospect of a broader four-supercharge perspective on the celebrated correspondence between 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs and 2d VOAs via interpolating 3d EFTs. Several byproducts follow, including a systematic approach to 3d SUSY enhancement from 4d SUSY enhancement, and a 3d QFT handle on Galois orbits of various MTCs associated with 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs.</description>

      <title>Eisenhart Lift for Scalar Fields in the FLRW Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Eisenhart lift of Riemannian type describes the motion of a particle as a geodesic in a higher-dimensional Riemannian manifold with one additional coordinate. It has recently been generalized to a scalar field system by introducing one additional vector field. We apply this approach to a scalar field system in the FLRW (Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker) universe and classify the symmetries of the system. In particular, we find nontrivial (conformal) Killing vector field and Killing tensor fields for a scalar field potential consisting of the square of a combination of exponential functions with specific index $e^{\pm\frac{\sqrt{6}}{4}\phi}$. Moreover, we find nontrivial conformal Killing vector fields for a potential which is written as an exponentiation of a combination of exponential potentials with general index. Complete solutions to the equations of motion are given. We also classify the symmetries of multiple scalar field system.</description>

      <title>Floating orbits and energy extraction from magnetized Kerr black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study electromagnetic radiation reaction on a charged particle around a weakly magnetized Kerr black hole. We solve numerically the Teukolsky equation to find energy fluxes in electromagnetic radiation at the horizon and at spatial infinity. We also employ analytical methods in the low-frequency limit, finding excellent agreement with the numerical results. For a wide range of parameters, energy fluxes on the horizon are negative for all orbital radii: the modes are amplified through superradiance. More interestingly, the flux on the horizon is larger (in absolute value) than the flux at infinity for orbits with orbital radius $r_0 \gtrsim 9M$ -- floating orbits are a generic outcome of having magnetic fields around black holes. Particles on these orbits extract energy from the BH through their radiation field; the net effect is an increase in the particles' kinetic energy, so that they outspiral to infinity. Although in realistic accretion disks viscous forces are expected to dominate, floating orbits remain an interesting feature of the existence of ergoregions in black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Free Independence and the Noncrossing Partition Lattice in Dual-Unitary Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate details of the chaotic dynamics of dual-unitary quantum circuits by evaluating all $2k$-point out-of-time-ordered correlators. For the generic class of circuits, by writing the correlators as contractions of a class of quantum channels, we prove their exponential decay. This implies that local operators separated in time approach free independence. Along the way, we develop a replica trick for dual-unitary circuits, which may be useful and of interest in its own right. We classify the relevant eigenstates of the replica transfer matrix by paths in the lattice of noncrossing partitions, combinatorial objects central to free probability theory. Interestingly, the noncrossing lattice emerges even for systems without randomness and with small onsite Hilbert space dimension.</description>

      <title>Critical spin models from holographic disorder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete models of holographic dualities, typically modeled by tensor networks on hyperbolic tilings, produce quantum states with a characteristic quasiperiodic disorder not present in continuum holography. In this work, we study the behavior of XXZ spin chains with such symmetries, showing that lessons learned from previous non-interacting (matchgate) tensor networks generalize to more generic Hamiltonians under holographic disorder: While the disorder breaks translation invariance, site-averaged correlations and entanglement of the disorder-free critical phase are preserved at a plateau of nonzero disorder even at large system sizes. In particular, we show numerically that the entanglement entropy curves in this disordered phase follow the expected scaling of a conformal field theory (CFT) in the continuum limit. This property is shown to be non-generic for other types of quasiperiodic disorder, only appearing when our boundary disorder ansatz is described by a "dual" bulk hyperbolic tiling. Our results therefore suggest the existence of a whole class of critical phases whose symmetries are derived from models of discrete holography.</description>

      <title>Modified particle dynamics and thermodynamics in a traversable wormhole in bumblebee gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze various phenomena influenced by the gravitational field in a bumblebee gravity solution, with a particular emphasis on a traversable wormhole for massless particle modes. Specifically, we calculate the index of refraction, group velocity, time delay, modified distances, and interparticle potential, demonstrating the possibility of photon-photon interactions due to the wormhole geometry. For the latter aspect, we also extend the analysis to massive particle modes, resulting in a ``combination'' of modified Yukawa- and Couloumb-like potentials. These calculations are shown to be dependent on the wormhole's parameters, particularly the wormhole throat. Finally, we derive thermodynamic properties for photon-like modes by considering the modified dispersion relation induced by the wormhole geometry, taking into account non-interacting particle modes. Remarkably, all calculations are performed in an analytical manner.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-weak spontaneous breaking of 1-form symmetry and intrinsically mixed topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological orders in 2+1d are spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) phases of 1-form symmetries in pure states. The notion of symmetry is further enriched in the context of mixed states, where a symmetry can be either ``strong" or ``weak". In this work, we apply a R\'enyi-2 version of the proposed equivalence relation in [Sang, Lessa, Mong, Grover, Wang, &amp; Hsieh, to appear] on density matrices that is slightly finer than two-way channel connectivity. This equivalence relation distinguishes general 1-form strong-to-weak SSB (SW-SSB) states from phases containing pure states, and therefore labels SW-SSB states as ``intrinsically mixed". According to our equivalence relation, two states are equivalent if and only if they are connected to each other by finite Lindbladian evolution that maintains continuously varying, finite R\'enyi-2 Markov length. We then examine a natural setting for finding such density matrices: disordered ensembles. Specifically, we study the toric code with various types of disorders and show that in each case, the ensemble of ground states corresponding to different disorder realizations form a density matrix with different strong and weak SSB patterns of 1-form symmetries, including SW-SSB. Furthermore we show by perturbative calculations that these disordered ensembles form stable ``phases" in the sense that they exist over a finite parameter range, according to our equivalence relation.</description>

      <title>Localized Chiral Magnetic Effect in equilibrium QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of a non-uniform magnetic background field on the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in equilibrium QCD using lattice simulations with 2+1 flavors of dynamical staggered quarks at the physical point. We show that in the presence of a non-uniform magnetic field the CME manifests itself via a localized electromagnetic current density along the direction of the field, which integrates to zero over the full volume. Our primary observable is the leading-order coefficient of the current in a chiral chemical potential expansion, which we compute for various lattice spacings and extrapolate to the continuum limit. Our findings demonstrate that, even though the global spatial average of the CME conductivity vanishes in equilibrium, steady currents still exist locally. Thus, spatially modulated magnetic fields provide a possible way of generating a non-trivial CME signal in equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of local operations and classical communication (LOCC) for bipartite quantum systems represented by commuting von Neumann algebras. Our central result is the extension of Nielsen's Theorem to arbitrary factors. As in the matrix algebra case, the LOCC ordering of bipartite pure states is connected to the majorization of their restrictions. Our theorem implies that, in a bipartite system modeled by commuting factors in Haag duality, a) all states have infinite one-shot entanglement if and only if the local factors are not of type I, b) type III factors are characterized by LOCC transitions of arbitrary precision between any two pure states, and c) the latter holds even without classical communication for type III$_{1}$ factors. In the case of semifinite factors, the usual construction of entanglement monotones carries over using majorization theory. In the appendix, we provide a self-contained treatment of majorization on semifinite von Neumann algebras and $\sigma$-finite measure spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine a loop quantum gravity (LQG) inspired rotating black hole, treating it as a central supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) system, where an inspiralling object exhibits eccentric motion around the SMBH. With the orbital dynamics, we derive analytical expressions for the rate of change of orbital energy and angular momentum, as well as orbital evolution, and subsequently generate the gravitational waveforms. To evaluate the difference between EMR waveforms emitted from the Kerr black hole and a spinning black hole in LQG, we compute the dephasing and mismatch using the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) observation. Our result indicates that LISA can distinguish the modified effect of LQG with a parameter as small as $2\times10^{-6}$. The constraint on a parameter in LQG using the Fisher information matrix can be obtained within a fraction error of $10^{-6}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In strongly coupled field theories, perturbation theory cannot be employed to study the low-energy spectrum. Thus, non-perturbative techniques are required. We employ the variational method, a rigorous, non-perturbative approach which provides variational upper bounds on the energy eigenstates of the theory. An essential step in the variational method is the choice of trial wave function. In this work, we study the viability of employing a neural network as our variational ansatz. As a first step towards phenomenologically interesting strongly coupled theories like quantum chromodynamics, we study scalar field theories with quartic couplings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify the Standard Model's $\mathfrak{su}(3)\oplus \mathfrak{su}(2)\oplus \mathfrak{u}(1)$ internal symmetries within the triality symmetries $\mathfrak{tri}(\mathbb{C}) \oplus \mathfrak{tri}(\mathbb{H}) \oplus \mathfrak{tri}(\mathbb{O})$. From here, the corresponding Standard Model group action is applied to the triality triple $\left( \Psi_+, \Psi_-,V\right)$ for $\Psi_+, \Psi_-, V \in \mathbb{C}\otimes\mathbb{H}\otimes\mathbb{O}$. Together, $\Psi_+$ and $\Psi_-$ provide the correct irreducible representations for two generations. Owing to a certain Cartan Factorization, which we define, $V$ provides the irreducible representations for a third generation. Said more explicitly in another way, division algebraic multiplication merges a third generation of spinor representations into a set of scalar bosons. This set of scalar bosons includes the familiar Standard Model Higgs representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The backreaction of a conformal matter sector and its associated conformal anomaly on gravity can be systematically studied using the formalism of the anomaly effective action. This action, defined precisely in flat spacetime within ordinary quantum field theory, can be analyzed perturbatively in terms of external graviton insertions. The expansion coefficients correspond to correlation functions of the stress-energy tensor, which are renormalized through two key counterterms: the square of the Weyl tensor $(C^2)$ and the Gauss-Bonnet term $(E)$. Anomalous conformal Ward identities impose hierarchical constraints on this expansion, revealing that the anomaly's contribution arises from bilinear mixings of the form $R \Box^{-1} E$ and $R \Box^{-1} C^2$, supplemented by local Weyl-invariant terms. These mixings reflect the non-local structure of the anomaly. The precise form of the effective action, however, may vary depending on the regularization scheme used, with potential differences manifesting through additional Weyl-invariant terms. These actions encapsulate the breaking of Weyl invariance in the early universe, with implications that are particularly relevant during the inflationary epoch. For chiral and gravitational anomalies, we demonstrate that the corresponding effective actions exhibit similar structures, influencing the evolution of chiral asymmetries in the early universe plasma.</description>

      <title>(SPT-)LSM theorems from projective non-invertible symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Projective symmetries are ubiquitous in quantum lattice models and can be leveraged to constrain their phase diagram and entanglement structure. In this paper, we investigate the consequences of projective algebras formed by non-invertible symmetries and lattice translations in a generalized $1+1$D quantum XY model based on group-valued qudits. This model is specified by a finite group $G$ and enjoys a projective $\mathsf{Rep}(G)\times Z(G)$ and translation symmetry, where symmetry operators obey a projective algebra in the presence of symmetry defects. For invertible symmetries, such projective algebras imply Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomalies. However, this is not generally true for non-invertible symmetries, and we derive a condition on $G$ for the existence of an LSM anomaly. When this condition is not met, we prove that any unique and gapped ground state is necessarily a non-invertible weak symmetry protected topological (SPT) state with non-trivial entanglement, for which we construct an example fixed-point Hamiltonian. The projectivity also affects the dual symmetries after gauging $\mathsf{Rep}(G)\times Z(G)$ sub-symmetries, giving rise to non-Abelian and non-invertible dipole symmetries, as well as non-invertible translations. We complement our analysis with the SymTFT, where the projectivity causes it to be a topological order non-trivially enriched by translations. Throughout the paper, we develop techniques for gauging $\mathsf{Rep}(G)$ symmetry and inserting its symmetry defects on the lattice, which are applicable to other non-invertible symmetries.</description>

      <title>Higher-Spin Self-Dual Yang-Mills and Gravity from the twistor space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.06209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We lift the recently proposed theories of higher-spin self-dual Yang-Mills (SDYM) and gravity (SDGR) to the twistor space. We find that the most natural room for the twistor formulation of these theories is not in the projective, but in the full twistor space, which is the total space of the spinor bundle over the 4-dimensional manifold. In the case of higher-spin extension of the SDYM we prove an analogue of the Ward theorem, and show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the solutions of the field equations and holomorphic vector bundles over the twistor space. In the case of the higher-spin extension of SDGR we show show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between solutions of the field equations and Ehresmann connections on the twistor space whose horizontal distributions are Poisson, and whose curvature is decomposable. These data then define an almost complex structure on the twistor space that is integrable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When applying T-duality to a generic, non-extreme Killing horizon, T-duality is spacelike on one side and timelike on the other. We show, using simple examples from four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory, that the image of the horizon is a singularity which can be understood as an interface between two different T-dual theories and their solutions. Using an embedding into type-II string theory, we show that the singularity occurs when scalars reach the boundary of moduli space, resulting in a breakdown of the effective field theory due to the presence of tensionless strings.</description>

Abstract: We study the giant gravitons in the $AdS_4$ bagpipe geometries involving end-of-the-world (ETW) brane constructed by a single $5$-brane and either two stacks or one stack of D3-branes in Type IIB string theory. From the exact formulae and giant graviton expansions of the half-indices for the half-BPS boundary conditions and interfaces in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory, we obtain the BPS spectra of the fluctuation modes of the $AdS_4$ bagpipe geometries including the ETW brane region.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct soliton solutions of the four-dimensional Wess-Zumino-Witten (4dWZW) model in the context of a unified theory of integrable systems with relation to the 4d/6d Chern-Simons theory. We calculate the action density of the solutions and find that the soliton solutions behave as the KP-type solitons, that is, the one-soliton solution has a localized action/energy density on a 3d hyperplane in 4-dimensions (soliton wall) and the n-soliton solution describes n intersecting soliton walls with phase shifts. We note that the Ward conjecture holds mostly in the split signature (+,+,-,-). Furthermore, the 4dWZW model describes the string field theory action of the open N=2 string theory in the four-dimensional space-time with the split signature and hence our soliton solutions would describe a new-type of physical objects in the N=2 string theory. We discuss instanton solutions in the 4dWZW model as well. Noncommutative extension and quantization of the unified theory of integrable systems are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: The total number of gravitons emitted during nonrelativistic inspiral of two black holes or other effectively point masses is calculated approximately and found to be remarkably close to (well within 1% of, perhaps within about 0.2% of) the initial orbital angular momentum divided by the spin angular momentum of each graviton ($2\hbar$), although at unit initial eccentricity, $2\hbar$ times the initial graviton number emission per angular momentum emission is $248/(45\sqrt{3}\pi) \approx 1.012\,811\,600\,479$, almost 1.3% greater than unity.</description>

      <title>Mixmasters in Wonderland: Chaotic dynamics from Carroll limits of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the Carroll limit of general relativity coupled to matter captures the chaotic mixmaster dynamics of near-singularity limits. Zooming in on the behavior of general relativity close to spacelike singularities reveals rich and solvable ultra-local Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz (BKL) dynamics, which we show to be captured by a Carroll limit. Specifically, building on recent work on geometric Carroll expansions of general relativity, we establish that leading-order Carroll gravity, with suitable matter coupling, accurately describes well-known cosmological billiards behavior. Since the Carroll limit implements the ultra-local limit off shell, this opens up the door to a wide range of possible tractable applications, including spatially inhomogeneous setups and the emergence of spikes at late times. This further suggests that Carroll gravity, along with its subleading corrections, could serve as a valuable tool for studying deep infrared physics in AdS/CFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10432v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Sasakian quasi-Killing spinor (SqK-spinor), which is a generalization of a Killing spinor on Sasakian manifolds, was defined in \cite{Kim Friedrich 2000}.The purpose of this paper is to study in detail SqK-spinors on three-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian Sasakian space-form.We briefly review some results on SqK-spinors and then investigate some geometric properties.First, we demonstrate that the Reeb vector field is described by a specific SqK-spinor. Then we establish that the motion of a charged particle in the presence of a contact Maxwell field can be depicted using an SqK-spinor. urthermore, we find that almost all SqK-spinors provide solutions to the Einstein-Dirac system with a non-zero cosmological constant.Additionally, we reveal that a particular SqK-spinor in conjunction with a contact Maxwell field satisfies the Einstein-Dirac-Maxwell systems.Finally, we show explicit formulae of SqK-spinors in terms of elementary functions with respect to a certain frame.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14916v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ a protocol, dubbed entanglement microscopy, to reveal the multipartite entanglement encoded in the full reduced density matrix of microscopic subregion both in spin and fermionic many-body systems. We exemplify our method by studying the phase diagram near quantum critical points (QCP) in 2 spatial dimensions: the transverse field Ising model and a Gross-Neveu-Yukawa transition of Dirac fermions. Our main results are: i) the Ising QCP exhibits short-range entanglement with a finite sudden death of the LN both in space and temperature; ii) the Gross-Neveu QCP has a power-law decaying fermionic LN consistent with conformal field theory (CFT) exponents; iii) going beyond bipartite entanglement, we find no detectable 3-party entanglement with our two witnesses in a large parameter window near the Ising QCP in 2d, in contrast to 1d. We further establish the singular scaling of general multipartite entanglement measures at criticality, and present an explicit analysis in the tripartite case. We also analytically obtain the large-temperature power-law scaling of the fermionic LN for general interacting systems. Entanglement microscopy opens a rich window into quantum matter, with countless systems waiting to be explored.</description>

      <title>A Noisy Approach to Intrinsically Mixed-State Topological Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13879v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for studying two-dimensional (2D) topologically ordered states subject to local correlated errors and show that the resulting mixed-state can display intrinsically mixed-state topological order (imTO) -- topological order which is not expected to occur in the ground state of 2D local gapped Hamiltonians. Specifically, we show that decoherence, previously interpreted as anyon condensation in a doubled Hilbert space, is more naturally phrased as, and provides a physical mechanism for, ``gauging out" anyons in the original Hilbert space. We find that gauging out anyons generically results in imTO, with the decohered mixed-state strongly symmetric under certain anomalous 1-form symmetries. This framework lays bare a striking connection between the decohered density matrix and topological subsystem codes, which can appear as anomalous surface states of 3D topological orders. Through a series of examples, we show that the decohered state can display a classical memory, encode logical qubits (i.e., exhibit a quantum memory), and even host chiral or non-modular topological order. We argue that a partial classification of imTO is given in terms of non-modular braided fusion categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the standard 1+1d $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ cluster model has a non-invertible global symmetry, described by the fusion category Rep(D$_8$). Therefore, the cluster state is not only a $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase, but also a non-invertible SPT phase. We further find two new commuting Pauli Hamiltonians for the other two Rep(D$_8$) SPT phases on a tensor product Hilbert space of qubits, matching the classification in field theory and mathematics. We identify the edge modes and the local projective algebras at the interfaces between these non-invertible SPT phases. Finally, we show that there does not exist a symmetric entangler that maps between these distinct SPT states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The capability of hydrodynamics to accurately describe slow and long-wavelength fluctuations around non-equilibrium steady states (NESS), characterized by a stationary flow of energy or matter in the presence of a driving force, remains an open question. In this study, we explicitly construct a hydrodynamic description of electrically driven non-equilibrium charged steady states \new{in the limit in which the relaxation of the first non-hydrodynamic excitation is parametrically slow}. Our approach involves introducing gapped modes and extending the effective description into a relaxed hydrodynamic theory (RHT). Leveraging the gauge-gravity duality as a tool for controlled computations within non-equilibrium systems, we establish an ultraviolet complete model for these NESS that confirms the validity of our RHT. In summary, our findings provide a concrete realization of the validity of hydrodynamics beyond thermal equilibrium, offering valuable insights into the dynamics of non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes-shadow correspondence for rotating regular black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eikonal quasinormal modes (QNMs) of black holes (BHs) and parameters of null geodesics, ultimately tied to the appearance of BHs to external observers, are known to be related, and the eikonal QNM-BH shadow radii correspondence has been extensively studied for spherically symmetric BHs. The extension to rotating BHs is non-trivial, and has been worked out only for equatorial ($m=\pm\ell$) QNMs, or for general modes but limited to the Kerr metric. We extend the QNM-shadow radius correspondence to more general rotating space-times, and argue that the requirements for it to hold amount to conditions on the separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for null geodesics and the Klein-Gordon equation. Metrics obtained by the Newman-Janis algorithm enjoy these conditions, provided certain mathematical requirements are imposed on the line element. We explicitly verify the correspondence for the rotating Bardeen and Hayward regular BHs, both of which satisfy the separability requirements. Our findings show that the QNM-shadow radius correspondence holds for a wide range of axisymmetric space-times beyond Kerr. This paves the way to potential strong-field multi-messenger tests of fundamental physics by hearing (via gravitational wave spectroscopy - the "thunder") and seeing (via VLBI imaging - the "lightning") BHs, although substantial improvements relative to the current observational sensitivity are required to make this possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of resurgence uniquely associates a factorially divergent formal power series with a collection of exponentially small non-perturbative corrections paired with a set of complex numbers known as Stokes constants. When the Borel plane displays a single infinite tower of singularities, the secondary resurgent series are trivial, and the Stokes constants are coefficients of an $L$-function, a rich analytic number-theoretic fabric underlies the resurgent structure of the asymptotic series. We propose a new paradigm of modular resurgence that focuses on the role of the Stokes constants and the interplay of the $q$-series acting as their generating functions with the corresponding $L$-functions. Guided by two pivotal examples arising from topological string theory and the theory of Maass cusp forms, we introduce the notion of modular resurgent series, which we conjecture to have specific summability properties as well as to be related to quantum modular forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gertsenshtein effect could in principle be used to detect a single graviton by firing it through a region filled with a constant magnetic field that enables its conversion to a photon, which can be efficiently detected via standard techniques. The quantization of the gravitational field could then be inferred indirectly. We show that for currently available single-photon detector technology, the Gertsenshtein detector is generically inefficient, meaning that the probability of detection is $\ll 1$. The Gertsenshtein detector can become efficient on astrophysical scales for futuristic single-photon detectors sensitive to frequencies in the Hz to kHz range. It is not clear whether such devices are in principle possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of traversable wormhole formation in the dark matter halos in the context of $f(Q)$ gravity. We obtain the exact wormhole solutions with anisotropic matter source based on the Bose-Einstein condensate, Navarro-Frenk-White, and pseudo-isothermal matter density profiles. Notably, we present a novel wormhole solution supported by these dark matters using the expressions for the density profile and rotational velocity along with the modified field equations to calculate the redshift and shape functions of the wormholes. With a particular set of parameters, we demonstrate that our proposed wormhole solutions fulfill the flare-out condition against an asymptotic background. Additionally, we examine the energy conditions, focusing on the null energy conditions at the wormhole's throat, providing a graphical representation of the feasible and negative regions. Our study also examines the wormhole's shadow in the presence of various dark matter models, revealing that higher central densities result in a shadow closer to the throat, whereas lower values have the opposite effect. Moreover, we explore the deflection of light when it encounters these wormholes, particularly noting that light deflection approaches infinity at the throat, where the gravitational field is extremely strong.</description>

      <title>Gravitational reheating in Starobinsky inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of achieving post-inflationary reheating exclusively through the gravitational interaction in Starobinsky inflation, which itself assumes nothing but gravity. We consider the possibility that the reheating sector couples to gravity via a non-minimal coupling. Our analysis is performed both in a perturbative and in a non-perturbative approach, where particle production is computed from Bogoliubov coefficients. Our findings indicate that, for a minimal coupling, a reheating temperature $T_\text{reh}\sim 10^{8}$~GeV is obtained, with a reheating duration of approximately 21 $e$-folds. We also show that non perturbative gravitational production during preheating can lead to maximum temperatures of the order of $10^{12}$ GeV. This shows that the gravitational interaction could be the sole responsible for reheating the Universe after inflation, without the need to assume other \emph{ad hoc} inflaton interactions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave background in bouncing models from semi-classical, quantum and string gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the primordial spectra and the gravitational-wave background (GWB) of three models of semi-classical, quantum or string gravity where the big bang is replaced by a bounce and the primordial tensor spectrum is blue: ekpyrotic universe with fast-rolling Galileons, string-gas cosmology with Atick-Witten conjecture and pre-big-bang cosmology. We find that the ekpyrotic scenario with Galileons does not produce a GWB amplitude detectable by present or third-generation interferometers, while the Atick-Witten-based string-gas model is ruled out in its present form for violating the big-bang-nucleosynthesis bound, contrary to the original string-gas scenario. In contrast, the GWB of the pre-big-bang scenario falls within the sensitivity window of both LISA and Einstein Telescope, where it takes the form of a single or a broken power law depending on the choice of parameters. The latter will be tightly constrained by both detectors.</description>

      <title>Time and its arrow from quantum geometrodynamics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss how quantum geometrodynamics, a conservative approach to quantum gravity, might explain the emergence of classical spacetime and, with it, the emergence of classical time and its arrow from the universal quantum state. This follows from a particular but reasonable choice of boundary condition motivated by the structure of the Hamiltonian of the theory. This condition can also be seen as defining a quantum version of Penrose's Weyl curvature hypothesis. We comment on the relation of this picture to the `past hypothesis' and the different observed arrows of time, and we consider how quantum geometrodynamics could serve as a unifying and more fundamental framework to explain these observations.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking as a result of extra dimensions compactification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider dynamics of a scalar field in compactification scenario of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet cosmology. It is shown that if the field is non-minimally coupled to curvature, its asymptotic value under certain conditions may be shifted from the minimum of its potential. This means that due to influence of extra dimensions a scalar field with $\lambda \phi^4$ potential can stabilise away from $\phi=0$ stable point which means an effective symmetry breaking occurs in such a system.</description>

      <title>Relaxation Fluctuations of Correlation Functions: Spin and Random Matrix Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral statistics and correlations are the usual way to study the presence or absence of quantum chaos in quantum systems. We present our investigation on the study of the fluctuation average and variance of certain correlation functions as a diagnostic measure of quantum chaos and to possibly characterize quantum systems based on it. These quantities are related to eigenvector distribution and eigenvector correlation. Using the Random Matrix Theory certain analytical expressions of these quantities, for the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble case, were calculated before. So as a first step, we study these quantities for the Gaussian unitary ensemble case numerically, and deduce certain analytical results for the same. We then carry out our investigations in physical system, such as the mixed-field Ising model. For this model, we find that although the eigenvalue statistics follow the behaviour of corresponding random matrices, the fluctuation average and variance of these correlation functions deviate from the expected random matrix theory behaviour. We then turn our focus on the Rosenzweig-Porter model of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble and Gaussian Unitary Ensemble types. By using the fluctuation average and variance of these correlations, we identify the three distinct phases of these models: the ergodic, the fractal, and the localized phases. We provide an alternative way to study and distinguish the three phases and firmly establish the use of these correlation fluctuations as an alternative way to characterize quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Rotations, Negative Eigenvalues, and Newton Method in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10312v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the tensor network approach to statistical physics, properties of the critical point of a 2D lattice model are encoded by a four-legged tensor which is a fixed point of an RG map. The traditional way to find the fixed point tensor consists in iterating the RG map after having tuned the temperature to criticality. Here we develop a different and more direct technique, which solves the fixed point equation via the Newton method. This is challenging due to the existence of marginal deformations -- linear transformations of the coordinate frame, which parametrize a two-dimensional family of fixed points. We address this challenge by including a 90 degree rotation into the RG map. This flips the sign of the problematic marginal eigenvalues, rendering the fixed point isolated and accessible via the Newton method. We demonstrate the power of this technique via explicit computations for the 2D Ising model. Using the Gilt-TNR algorithm at bond dimension $\chi=30$, we find the fixed point tensor with $10^{-9}$ accuracy, much higher than what was previously achieved.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Form Factors of Hadrons from CFT in Momentum Space and the Dilaton in Perturbative QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05609v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the hard scattering amplitude of the gravitational form factors (GFFs) of hadrons at one-loop, in relation to their conformal field theory (CFT) description, within the framework of QCD factorization for hard exclusive processes at large momentum transfers. These form factors play an essential role in studying the quark and gluon angular momentum of the hadrons due to their relation to the Mellin moments of the Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) invariant amplitudes. Our analysis is performed using a diffeomorphism invariant approach, applying the formalism of the gravitational effective action and conformal symmetry in momentum space for the discussion of the quark and gluon contributions. The interpolating correlator in the hard scattering of any GFF is the non-Abelian $TJJ$ (stress-energy/gluon/gluon) 3-point function at $O(\alpha_s^2)$, revealing an effective dilaton interaction in the $t$-channel due to the trace anomaly, in the form of a massless anomaly pole in the QCD hard scattering, constrained by a sum rule on its spectral density. We investigate the role of quarks, gauge-fixing and ghost contributions in the reconstruction of the hard scattering amplitude mediated by this interaction, performed in terms of its transverse traceless, longitudinal, and trace decomposition, as identified from CFT in momentum space ($CFT_p$). We present a convenient parameterization of the hard scattering amplitude relevant for future experimental investigations of the DVCS/GFF amplitudes at the Electron-Ion Collider at BNL.</description>

      <title>More on quantum measuring systems and the holographic principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we approach the structure of the quantum measuring system in the Euclidean regime of the classicalized holographic tensor network from the perspective of integrated information theory. As a result, we obtain the following picture of the Euclidean regime. First, there are complexes, which are independently accompanied by the level and structure of experiences, determined from the full transition probability matrix of the whole particle system. Second, the cause-effect structures of independent complexes would be directly entangled by the physical information propagation in the whole particle system. Finally, distinct full transition probability matrices of the whole particle system that exhibit the maximum cause-effect power may coexist.</description>

      <title>Exact Results On the Number of Gravitons Radiated During Binary Inspiral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive an exact formula $F(e) = 2 \hbar \frac{dN}{dJ}$ which provides a concrete estimate for the total number and angular momentum of gravitons emitted during the nonrelativistic inspiral of two black holes. We show that the function $F(e)$ is a slowly growing monotonic function of the eccentricity $0 \le e \le 1$ and $F(1) = 1.012\, 815 \, 967 \,259 \,511 \cdots $. We confirm and extend the results of Page for the function $F(e)$. We also get an exact result for the ratio $\nu (e_i) = \frac{2\hbar N(L_i, e_i)}{L_i}$ of the sum of the spin angular momentum magnitudes of gravitons emitted to the magnitude $L_i$ of the total angular momentum emitted in the graviational waves by inspiraling binary black holes. If the orbit starts off with unit eccentricity $e_i=1$, we get the exact value $\nu(1) = 1.002\, 268\, 666\, 2 \pm 10^{-10}$ which confirms the Page conjecture. We also show that the formula $F(e)$ for gravitons emitted can be determined by a single function.</description>
