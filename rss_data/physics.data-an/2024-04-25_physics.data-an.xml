      <title>3D deep learning for enhanced atom probe tomography analysis of nanoscale microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative analysis of microstructural features on the nanoscale, including precipitates, local chemical orderings (LCOs) or structural defects (e.g. stacking faults) plays a pivotal role in understanding the mechanical and physical responses of engineering materials. Atom probe tomography (APT), known for its exceptional combination of chemical sensitivity and sub-nanometer resolution, primarily identifies microstructures through compositional segregations. However, this fails when there is no significant segregation, as can be the case for LCOs and stacking faults. Here, we introduce a 3D deep learning approach, AtomNet, designed to process APT point cloud data at the single-atom level for nanoscale microstructure extraction, simultaneously considering compositional and structural information. AtomNet is showcased in segmenting L12-type nanoprecipitates from the matrix in an AlLiMg alloy, irrespective of crystallographic orientations, which outperforms previous methods. AtomNet also allows for 3D imaging of L10-type LCOs in an AuCu alloy, a challenging task for conventional analysis due to their small size and subtle compositional differences. Finally, we demonstrate the use of AtomNet for revealing 2D stacking faults in a Co-based superalloy, without any defected training data, expanding the capabilities of APT for automated exploration of hidden microstructures. AtomNet pushes the boundaries of APT analysis, and holds promise in establishing precise quantitative microstructure-property relationships across a diverse range of metallic materials.</description>

      <title>AMEP: The Active Matter Evaluation Package for Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Active Matter Evaluation Package (AMEP) is a Python library for analyzing simulation data of particle-based and continuum simulations. It provides a powerful and simple interface for handling large data sets and for calculating and visualizing a broad variety of observables that are relevant to active matter systems. Examples range from the mean-square displacement and the structure factor to cluster-size distributions, binder cumulants, and growth exponents. AMEP is written in pure Python and is based on powerful libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-image. Computationally expensive methods are parallelized and optimized to run efficiently on workstations, laptops, and high-performance computing architectures, and an HDF5-based data format is used in the backend to store and handle simulation data as well as analysis results. AMEP provides the first comprehensive framework for analyzing simulation results of both particle-based and continuum simulations (as well as experimental data) of active matter systems. In particular, AMEP also allows it to analyze simulations that combine particle-based and continuum techniques such as used to study the motion of bacteria in chemical fields or for modeling particle motion in a flow field. AMEP is available at https://amepproject.de and can be installed via conda and pip.</description>

      <title>Limits to extreme event forecasting in chaotic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting extreme events in chaotic systems, characterized by rare but intensely fluctuating properties, is of great importance due to their impact on the performance and reliability of a wide range of systems. Some examples include weather forecasting, traffic management, power grid operations, and financial market analysis, to name a few. Methods of increasing sophistication have been developed to forecast events in these systems. However, the boundaries that define the maximum accuracy of forecasting tools are still largely unexplored from a theoretical standpoint. Here, we address the question: What is the minimum possible error in the prediction of extreme events in complex, chaotic systems? We derive the minimum probability of error in extreme event forecasting along with its information-theoretic lower and upper bounds. These bounds are universal for a given problem, in that they hold regardless of the modeling approach for extreme event prediction: from traditional linear regressions to sophisticated neural network models. The limits in predictability are obtained from the cost-sensitive Fano's and Hellman's inequalities using the R\'enyi entropy. The results are also connected to Takens' embedding theorem using the information can't hurt inequality. Finally, the probability of error for a forecasting model is decomposed into three sources: uncertainty in the initial conditions, hidden variables, and suboptimal modeling assumptions. The latter allows us to assess whether prediction models are operating near their maximum theoretical performance or if further improvements are possible. The bounds are applied to the prediction of extreme events in the R\"ossler system and the Kolmogorov flow.</description>
