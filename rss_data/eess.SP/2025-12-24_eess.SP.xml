      <title>Enhanced Information Security via Wave-Field Selectivity and Structured Wavefront Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel secure wireless transmission architecture that enables the co-existence of spatial field modulation (SFM) and digital bandpass modulation (DBM), utilizing multi-mode vortex waves and programmable meta-surfaces (PMS). Distinct from conventional joint modulation schemes, our approach establishes two logically independent transmission channels--SFM and DBM--thereby eliminating the need for joint signal design or time synchronization. Specifically, the orthogonality of vortex wave modes is exploited to construct a high-capacity multi-mode DBM channel, in which each mode carries modulated symbols independently. As the composite waveform passes through the PMS, energy from different vortex modes is spatially focused onto distinct positions, dynamically determined by the PMS configuration. This spatial mapping forms a unique lookup table that encodes additional information in the electro-magnetic (EM) field distribution, effectively enabling a second, concurrent SFM channel. To enhance physical-layer security, the DBM channel transmits encrypted symbols transformed via dynamic symbol-domain mapping, while the corresponding mapping relations--or key information--are carried by the SFM channel. This lightweight dual-channel encryption strategy provides strong confidentiality without requiring complex joint decoding. To validate the feasibility of the proposed architecture, we design and implement a proof-of-concept prototype system, and conduct experimental demonstrations under real-world wireless communication conditions. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the co-existent DBM-SFM design in achieving reliable and secure transmission. The proposed architecture offers a scalable, low-complexity, and secure transmission solution for future IoT networks, especially in scenarios demanding both spectral efficiency and physical-layer confidentiality.</description>

      <title>Joint Power Control and Antenna Positioning for Uplink RSMA in Pinching Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) for uplink pinching antenna system (PASS). Our objective is to maximize the uplink sum rate by jointly optimizing a continuous antenna positioning and user's transmission power. The formulated problem is highly non-convex and difficult to solve directly; to address this challenge, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) framework which decomposes the original problem into two tractable sub-problems, namely (i) power allocation optimization sub-problem and (ii) antenna position optimization sub-problem. Both sub-problems are solved using successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm and solved alternatively until convergence. The RSMA access for PASS is compared with conventional non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and space-division multiple access (SDMA) techniques. The performance of discrete antenna activation with PASS strategy is also examined. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly enhances the achievable sum rate compared to other multiple access methods.</description>

      <title>Securing the Sensing Functionality in ISAC: KLD-Based Ambiguity Function Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems are deployed in next-generation wireless networks, a new security vulnerability emerges, particularly in terms of sensing privacy. Unauthorized sensing eavesdroppers (Eve) can potentially exploit the ISAC signal for their own independent passive sensing. However, solutions for sensing-secure ISAC remain largely unexplored to date. This work addresses sensing-security for OFDM- and OTFS-based ISAC waveforms from a target-detection perspective, aiming to prevent Eves from exploiting the ISAC signal for unauthorized passive sensing. We develop ISAC system models for the base station (BS), communication user equipment, and the sensing Eve, and define a Kullback-Leibler-divergence-based detection metric that accounts for mainlobe, sidelobe, and noise components in the ambiguity function and the resulting range-Doppler maps of the legitimate BS's and Eve's sensing. Building on this analysis, we formulate a sensing-secure ISAC signaling design problem that tunes a perturbation matrix to jointly control signal amplitude and phase in the time-frequency domain and solve it via simulated annealing. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme substantially degrades Eve's detection probability -- from 79.4% to 37.4% for OTFS and from 94.3% to 33.0% for OFDM -- while incurring only a small loss in BS sensing performance. In addition, it allows controllable trade-offs across sensing-security and communication performance.</description>

      <title>From Optimization to Learning: Dual-Approach Resource Allocation for Over-the-Air Edge Computing Under Execution Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential proliferation of mobile devices and data-intensive applications in future wireless networks imposes substantial computational burdens on resource-constrained devices, thereby fostering the emergence of over-the-air computation (AirComp) as a transformative paradigm for edge intelligence.} To enhance the efficiency and scalability of AirComp systems, this paper proposes a comprehensive dual-approach framework that systematically transitions from traditional mathematical optimization to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for resource allocation under execution uncertainty. Specifically, we establish a rigorous system model capturing execution uncertainty via Gamma-distributed computational workloads, resulting in challenging nonlinear optimization problems involving complex Gamma functions. For single-user scenarios, we design advanced block coordinate descent (BCD) and majorization-maximization (MM) algorithms, which yield semi-closed-form solutions with provable performance guarantees. However, conventional optimization approaches become computationally intractable in dynamic multi-user environments due to inter-user interference and resource contention. To this end, we introduce a Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based DRL framework capable of adaptively learning optimal policies through environment interaction. Our dual methodology effectively bridges analytical tractability with adaptive intelligence, leveraging optimization for foundational insight and learning for real-time adaptability. Extensive numerical results corroborate the performance gains achieved via increased edge server density and validate the superiority of our optimization-to-learning paradigm in next-generation AirComp systems.</description>

      <title>Reliable LLM-Based Edge-Cloud-Expert Cascades for Telecom Knowledge Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as key enablers of automation in domains such as telecommunications, assisting with tasks including troubleshooting, standards interpretation, and network optimization. However, their deployment in practice must balance inference cost, latency, and reliability. In this work, we study an edge-cloud-expert cascaded LLM-based knowledge system that supports decision-making through a question-and-answer pipeline. In it, an efficient edge model handles routine queries, a more capable cloud model addresses complex cases, and human experts are involved only when necessary. We define a misalignment-cost constrained optimization problem, aiming to minimize average processing cost, while guaranteeing alignment of automated answers with expert judgments. We propose a statistically rigorous threshold selection method based on multiple hypothesis testing (MHT) for a query processing mechanism based on knowledge and confidence tests. The approach provides finite-sample guarantees on misalignment risk. Experiments on the TeleQnA dataset -- a telecom-specific benchmark -- demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior cost-efficiency compared to conventional cascaded baselines, while ensuring reliability at prescribed confidence levels.</description>

      <title>Robust and Secure Transmission for Movable-RIS Assisted ISAC with Imperfect Sense Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been extensively applied in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems due to the capability of enhancing physical layer security (PLS). However, conventional static RIS architectures lack the flexibility required for adaptive beam control in multi-user and multifunctional scenarios. To address this issue without introducing additional hardware complexity and power consumption, in this paper, we exploit a movable RIS (MRIS) architecture, which consists of a large fixed sub-surface and a smaller movable sub-surface that slides on the fixed sub-surface to achieve dynamic beam reconfiguration with static phase shifts. This paper investigates an MRIS-assisted ISAC system under imperfect sensing estimation, where dedicated radar signals serve as artificial noise to enhance secure transmission against potential eavesdroppers (Eves). The transmit beamforming vectors, MRIS phase shifts, and relative positions of the two sub-surfaces are jointly optimized to maximize the minimum secrecy rate, ensuring robust secrecy performance for the weakest user under the uncertainty of the Eves' channels. To handle the non-convexity, a convex bound is derived for the Eve channel uncertainty, and the S-procedure is employed to reformulate semi-infinite constraints as linear matrix inequalities. An efficient alternating optimization and penalty dual decomposition-based algorithm is developed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MRIS architecture substantially improves secrecy performance, especially when only a small number of elements are allocated to the movable sub-surface.</description>

      <title>Target Classification for Integrated Sensing and Communication in Industrial Deployments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems enable cellular networks to jointly operate as communication technology and sense the environment. While opportunities and potential performance have been largely investigated in simulations, few experimental works have showcased Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) effectiveness in a real-world deployment based on cellular radio units. To bridge this gap, this paper presents an initial study investigating the feasibility of ATR for ISAC. Our ATR solution uses a Deep Learning (DL)-based detector to infer the target class directly from the radar images generated by the ISAC system. The DL detector is evaluated with experimental data from a ISAC testbed based on commercially available mmWave radio units in the ARENA 2036 industrial research campus located in Stuttgart, Germany. Experimental results demonstrate accurate classification performance, demonstrating the feasibility of ATR ISAC with cellular hardware in our setup. We finally provide insights about the open generalization challenges, that will fuel future work on the topic.</description>

      <title>Sum-Rate Maximization for Uplink Segmented Waveguide-Enabled Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multiuser uplink transmission framework based on the segmented waveguide-enabled pinching-antenna system (SWAN) is proposed under two operating protocols: segment selection (SS) and segment aggregation (SA). For each protocol, the achievable uplink sum-rate is characterized for both time-division multiple access (TDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). Low-complexity placement methods for the pinching antennas (PAs) are developed for both protocols and for both multiple-access schemes. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and show that SWAN achieves higher sum-rate performance than conventional pinching-antenna systems, while SA provides additional performance gains over SS.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial to Multirate Extended Kalman Filter Design for Monitoring of Agricultural Anaerobic Digestion Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many applications of biotechnology, measurements are available at different sampling rates, e.g., due to online sensors and offline lab analysis. Offline measurements typically involve time delays that may be unknown a priori due to the underlying laboratory procedures. This multirate (MR) setting poses a challenge to Kalman filtering, where conventionally measurement data is assumed to be available on an equidistant time grid and without delays. The present study derives the MR version of an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based on sample state augmentation, and applies it to the anaerobic digestion (AD) process in a simulative agricultural setting. The performance of the MR-EKF is investigated for various scenarios, i.e., varying delay lengths, measurement noise levels, plant-model mismatch (PMM), and initial state error. Provided with an adequate tuning, the MR-EKF could be demonstrated to reliably estimate the process state, to appropriately fuse delayed offline measurements, and to smooth noisy online measurements well. Because of the sample state augmentation approach, the delay length of offline measurements does not critically impair state estimation performance, provided observability is not lost during the delays. Poor state initialization and PMM affect convergence more than measurement noise levels. Further, selecting an appropriate tuning was found to be critically important for successful application of the MR-EKF, for which a systematic approach is presented. This study provides implementation guidance for practitioners aiming at successfully applying state estimation for multirate systems. It thereby contributes to develop demand-driven operation of biogas plants, which may aid in stabilizing a renewable electricity grid.</description>

      <title>A Covariance-Surrogate Framework for Movable-Antenna Enabled Anti-Jamming with Unknown Jammers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a movable antenna (MA) enabled anti-jamming optimization problem, where a legitimate uplink system is exposed to multiple jammers with unknown jamming channels. To enhance the anti-jamming capability of the considered system, an MA array is deployed at the receiver, and the antenna positions and the minimum-variance distortionless-response (MVDR) receive beamformer are jointly optimized to maximize the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The main challenge arises from the fact that the interference covariance matrix is unknown and nonlinearly dependent on the antenna positions. To overcome these issues, we propose a surrogate objective by replacing the unknown covariance with the sample covariance evaluated at the current antenna position anchor. Under a two-timescale framework, the surrogate objective is updated once per block (contains multiple snapshots) at the current anchor position, while the MVDR beamformer is adapted on a per-snapshot basis. We establish a local bound on the discrepancy between the surrogate and the true objective by leveraging matrix concentration inequalities, and further prove that a natural historical-averaging surrogate suffers from a non-vanishing geometric bias. Building on these insights, we develop a low-complexity projected trust-region (TR) surrogate optimization (PTRSO) algorithm that maintains the locality of each iteration via TR constraints and enforces feasibility through projection, which is guaranteed to converge to a stationary point near the anchor. Numerical results verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed PTRSO algorithm, which consistently achieves higher output SINR than existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air Goal-Oriented Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Goal-oriented communications offer an attractive alternative to the Shannon-based communication paradigm, where the data is never reconstructed at the Receiver (RX) side. Rather, focusing on the case of edge inference, the Transmitter (TX) and the RX cooperate to exchange features of the input data that will be used to predict an unseen attribute of them, leveraging information from collected data sets. This chapter demonstrates that the wireless channel can be used to perform computations over the data, when equipped with programmable metasurfaces. The end-to-end system of the TX, RX, and MS-based channel is treated as a single deep neural network which is trained through backpropagation to perform inference on unseen data. Using Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM), it is shown that this Metasurfaces-Integrated Neural Network (MINN) can achieve performance comparable to fully digital neural networks under various system parameters and data sets. By offloading computations onto the channel itself, important benefits may be achieved in terms of energy consumption, arising from reduced computations at the transceivers and smaller transmission power required for successful inference.</description>

Abstract: Non terrestrial networks (NTNs), particularly low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems, play a vital role in supporting future mission critical applications such as disaster relief. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-native communications enable LEO satellites to act as intelligent edge nodes capable of on board learning and task oriented inference. However, the limited link budget, coupled with severe path loss and fading, significantly constrains reliable downlink transmission. This paper proposes a deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC)-based downlink scheme for AI-native LEO networks, optimized for goal-oriented visual inference. In the DJSCC approach, only semantically meaningful features are extracted and transmitted, whereas conventional separate source-channel coding (SSCC) transmits the original image data. To evaluate information freshness and visual event detection performance, this work introduces the age of misclassified information (AoMI) metric and a threshold based AoI analysis that measures the proportion of users meeting application specific timeliness requirements. Simulation results show that the proposed DJSCC scheme provides higher inference accuracy, lower average AoMI, and greater threshold compliance than the conventional SSCC baseline, enabling semantic communication in AI native LEO satellite networks for 6G and beyond.</description>

      <title>Towards a point-to-point CV-QKD system: Implementation challenges and perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents an analysis of the practical challenges and implementation perspectives of point-to-point continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) systems over optical fiber. The study addresses the physical layer, including the design of transmitters, quantum channels, and receivers, with emphasis on impairments such as attenuation, chromatic dispersion, polarization fluctuations, and coexistence with classical channels. We further examine the role of digital signal processing (DSP) as the bridge between quantum state transmission and classical post-processing, highlighting its impact on excess noise mitigation, covariance matrix estimation, and reconciliation efficiency. The post-processing pipeline is detailed with a focus on parameter estimation in the finite-size regime, information reconciliation using LDPC-based codes optimized for low-SNR conditions, and privacy amplification employing large-block universal hashing. From a hardware perspective, we discuss modular digital architectures that integrate dedicated accelerators with programmable processors, supported by a reference software framework (CV-QKD-ModSim) for algorithm validation and hardware co-design. Finally, we outline perspectives for the deployment of CV-QKD in Brazil, starting from metropolitan testbeds and extending toward hybrid fiber/FSO and space-based infrastructures. The work establishes the foundations for the first point-to-point CV-QKD system in Brazil, while providing a roadmap for scalable and interoperable quantum communication networks.</description>

      <title>Generative Bayesian Spectrum Cartography: Unified Reconstruction and Active Sensing via Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity spectrum cartography is pivotal for spectrum management and wireless situational awareness, yet it remains a challenging ill-posed inverse problem due to the sparsity and irregularity of observations. Furthermore, existing approaches often decouple reconstruction from sensing, lacking a principled mechanism for informative sampling. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a unified diffusion-based Bayesian framework that jointly addresses spectrum reconstruction and active sensing. We formulate the reconstruction task as a conditional generation process driven by a learned diffusion prior. Specifically, we derive tractable, closed-form posterior transition kernels for the reverse diffusion process, which enforce consistency with both linear Gaussian and non-linear quantized measurements. Leveraging the intrinsic probabilistic nature of diffusion models, we further develop an uncertainty-aware active sampling strategy. This strategy quantifies reconstruction uncertainty to adaptively guide sensing agents toward the most informative locations, thereby maximizing spectral efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art interpolation, sparsity-based, and deep learning baselines in terms of reconstruction accuracy, sampling efficiency, and robustness to low-bit quantization.</description>

      <title>Designing Spatial Architectures for Sparse Attention: STAR Accelerator via Cross-Stage Tiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20198v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely on self-attention for contextual understanding, demanding high-throughput inference and large-scale token parallelism (LTPP). Existing dynamic sparsity accelerators falter under LTPP scenarios due to stage-isolated optimizations. Revisiting the end-to-end sparsity acceleration flow, we identify an overlooked opportunity: cross-stage coordination can substantially reduce redundant computation and memory access. We propose STAR, a cross-stage compute- and memory-efficient algorithm-hardware co-design tailored for Transformer inference under LTPP. STAR introduces a leading-zero-based sparsity prediction using log-domain add-only operations to minimize prediction overhead. It further employs distributed sorting and a sorted updating FlashAttention mechanism, guided by a coordinated tiling strategy that enables fine-grained stage interaction for improved memory efficiency and latency. These optimizations are supported by a dedicated STAR accelerator architecture, achieving up to 9.2$\times$ speedup and 71.2$\times$ energy efficiency over A100, and surpassing SOTA accelerators by up to 16.1$\times$ energy and 27.1$\times$ area efficiency gains. Further, we deploy STAR onto a multi-core spatial architecture, optimizing dataflow and execution orchestration for ultra-long sequence processing. Architectural evaluation shows that, compared to the baseline design, Spatial-STAR achieves a 20.1$\times$ throughput improvement.</description>

      <title>Aliasing-Free Neural Audio Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural vocoders and codecs reconstruct waveforms from acoustic representations, which directly impact the audio quality. Among existing methods, upsampling-based time-domain models are superior in both inference speed and synthesis quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Still, despite their success in producing perceptually natural sound, their synthesis fidelity remains limited due to the aliasing artifacts brought by the inadequately designed model architectures. In particular, the unconstrained nonlinear activation generates an infinite number of harmonics that exceed the Nyquist frequency, resulting in ``folded-back'' aliasing artifacts. The widely used upsampling layer, ConvTranspose, copies the mirrored low-frequency parts to fill the empty high-frequency region, resulting in ``mirrored'' aliasing artifacts. Meanwhile, the combination of its inherent periodicity and the mirrored DC bias also brings ``tonal artifact,'' resulting in constant-frequency ringing. This paper aims to solve these issues from a signal processing perspective. Specifically, we apply oversampling and anti-derivative anti-aliasing to the activation function to obtain its anti-aliased form, and replace the problematic ConvTranspose layer with resampling to avoid the ``tonal artifact'' and eliminate aliased components. Based on our proposed anti-aliased modules, we introduce Pupu-Vocoder and Pupu-Codec, and release high-quality pre-trained checkpoints to facilitate audio generation research. We build a test signal benchmark to illustrate the effectiveness of the anti-aliased modules, and conduct experiments on speech, singing voice, music, and audio to validate our proposed models. Experimental results confirm that our lightweight Pupu-Vocoder and Pupu-Codec models can easily outperform existing systems on singing voice, music, and audio, while achieving comparable performance on speech.</description>

      <title>RIS-Empowered OTFS Modulation With Faster-than-Nyquist Signaling in High-Mobility Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-mobility wireless communication systems suffer from severe Doppler spread and multi-path delay, which degrade the reliability and spectral efficiency of conventional modulation schemes. Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation offers strong robustness in such environments by representing symbols in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, while faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling can further enhance spectral efficiency through intentional symbol packing. Meanwhile, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) provide a promising means to improve link quality via passive beamforming. Motivated by these advantages, we propose a novel RIS-empowered OTFS modulation with FTN signaling (RIS-OTFS-FTN) scheme. First, we establish a unified DD-domain input-output relationship that jointly accounts for RIS passive beamforming, FTN-induced inter-symbol interference, and DD-domain channel characteristics. Based on this model, we provide comprehensive analytical performance for the frame error rate, spectral efficiency, and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), etc. Furthermore, a practical RIS phase adjustment strategy with quantized phase selection is designed to maximize the effective channel gain. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations under a standardized extended vehicular A (EVA) channel model validate the theoretical results and provide key insights into the trade-offs among spectral efficiency, PAPR, input back-off (IBO), and error performance, with some interesting insights.The proposed RIS-OTFS-FTN scheme demonstrates notable performance gains in both reliability and spectral efficiency, offering a viable solution for future high-mobility and spectrum-constrained wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Viterbi State Selection for Discrete Pinching Antenna Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pinching antennas enable dynamic control of electromagnetic wave propagation through reconfigurable radiating structures, but selecting an optimal subset of antennas remains a combinatorial problem with exponential complexity. This letter considers antenna subset selection for a waveguide-fed pinching antenna array serving ground users under a time-division access scheme. The achievable rate depends on the coherent superposition of the effective complex channel gains and is therefore highly sensitive to the relative phase alignment of the activated antennas. To address the prohibitive complexity of exhaustive search, we propose a Viterbi state selection (VSS) algorithm that exploits the phase structure of the combined received signal. The trellis state is defined by a quantized representation of the phase of the accumulated complex gain, and a Viterbi-based survivor rule is used to prune dominated antenna subsets across stages. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the same antenna selection and rate as exhaustive search, while reducing the computational complexity from exponential to polynomial in the number of available antennas.</description>

      <title>M${}^2$NuFFT: A Computationally Efficient Suboptimal Power Spectrum Estimator for Fast Exploration of Nonuniformly Sampled Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01943v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonuniformly sampled signals are prevalent in real-world applications. However, estimating their power spectra from finite samples poses a significant challenge. The optimal solution-Bronez Generalized Prolate Spheroidal Sequence (GPSS) by solving the associated Generalized Eigenvalue Problem (GEP)-is computationally intensive and thus impractical for large datasets. This paper describes a fast, nonparametric method: Multiband-Multitaper Nonuniform Fast Fourier Transform (M${}^2$NuFFT), which substantially reduces computational burden while maintaining statistical efficiency. The algorithm partitions the signal frequency band into multiple sub-bands. Within each sub-band, optimal tapers are computed at a nominal analysis band and shifted to other analysis bands using the Nonuniform Fast Fourier Transform (NuFFT), avoiding repeated GEP computations. Spectral power within the analysis band is then estimated as the average power across the taper outputs. For the special case where the nominal band is centered at zero frequency, tapers can be approximated via cubic spline interpolation of Discrete Prolate Spheroidal Sequence (DPSS), eliminating GEP computation entirely. This reduces the complexity from $O(N^4)$ to $O(N \log N + N \log(1/\epsilon))$. Statistical properties of the estimator, assessed using Bronez GPSS theory, reveal that the bias and variance bound of the M2NuFFT estimator are identical to those of the optimal estimator. Additionally, the degradation of bias bound indicates deviation from optimality. Finally, we propose an extension of Thomson F-test to test periodicity in nonuniform samples. The estimator's performance is validated through simulation and real-world data, demonstrating its practical applicability. The MATLAB code of the fast algorithm is available on GitHub (https://github.com/jiecui/mtnufft).</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Frequency-Dependent Linearizers Based on Parallel Bias-Modulus and Bias-ReLU Operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16210v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces low-complexity frequency-dependent (memory) linearizers designed to suppress nonlinear distortion in analog-to-digital interfaces. Two different linearizers are considered, based on nonlinearity models which correspond to sampling before and after the nonlinearity operations, respectively. The proposed linearizers are inspired by convolutional neural networks but have an order-of-magnitude lower implementation complexity compared to existing neural-network-based linearizer schemes. The proposed linearizers can also outperform the traditional parallel Hammerstein (as well as Wiener) linearizers even when the nonlinearities have been generated through a Hammerstein model. Further, a design procedure is proposed in which the linearizer parameters are obtained through matrix inversion. This eliminates the need for costly and time-consuming iterative nonconvex optimization which is traditionally associated with neural network training. The design effectively handles a wide range of wideband multi-tone signals and filtered white noise. Examples demonstrate significant signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) improvements of some $20$--$30$ dB, as well as a lower implementation complexity than the Hammerstein linearizers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks strive to deliver both high-precision target localization and high-throughput data services across the entire coverage area. In this work, we examine the fundamental trade-off between sensing and communication from the perspective of base station (BS) deployment. Furthermore, we conceive a design that simultaneously maximizes the target localization coverage, while guaranteeing the desired communication performance. In contrast to existing schemes optimized for a single target, an effective network-level approach has to ensure consistent localization accuracy throughout the entire service area. While employing time-of-flight (ToF) based localization, we first analyze the deployment problem from a localization-performance coverage perspective, aiming for minimizing the area Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (A-CRLB) to ensure uniformly high positioning accuracy across the service area. We prove that for a fixed number of BSs, uniformly scaling the service area by a factor \kappa increases the optimal A-CRLB in proportion to \kappa^{2\beta}, where \beta is the BS-to-target pathloss exponent. Based on this, we derive an approximate scaling law that links the achievable A-CRLB across the area of interest to the dimensionality of the sensing area. We also show that cooperative BSs extend the coverage but yield marginal A-CRLB improvement as the dimensionality of the sensing area grows.</description>

Abstract: With the rapid development of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) technology, Generative Diffusion Models (GDMs) have shown significant empowerment potential in the field of wireless networks due to advantages, such as noise resistance, training stability, controllability, and multimodal generation. Although there have been multiple studies focusing on GDMs for wireless networks, there is still a lack of comprehensive reviews on their technological evolution. Motivated by this, we systematically explore the application of GDMs in wireless networks. Firstly, we identify the core challenges of wireless networks and argue why GDMs are uniquely suited to address them. We then introduce the mathematical principles of GDMs and representative models. Furthermore, we organize our comprehensive review through a structured taxonomy that categorizes GDM-based schemes into the sensing, transmission, and Applications, complemented by a security plane. For each representative scheme, we analyze its innovative points, the role of GDMs, strengths, and weaknesses. Ultimately, we extract key challenges and provide potential solutions, with the aim of providing directional guidance for future research in this field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25390v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is critical for current and next-generation multi-antenna systems. Yet conventional pilot-based estimators incur prohibitive overhead as antenna counts grow. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a novel framework based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) that predicts full CSI from only a few observed entries, thereby reducing pilot overhead. The correlation between data points in GPR is defined by the covariance function, known as kernel. In the proposed GPR-based CSI estimation framework, we incorporate three kernels, i.e., radial basis function, Mat'ern, and rational quadratic, to model smooth and multi-scale spatial correlations derived from the antenna array geometry. The proposed approach is evaluated across two channel models with three distinct pilot probing schemes. Results show that the proposed GPR with 50% pilot saving achieves the lowest prediction error, the highest empirical 95% credible-interval coverage, and the best preservation of spectral efficiency relative to the benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for long sequence processing, outperforming traditional methods on diverse benchmarks. Fundamentally, SSMs can generalize both recurrent and convolutional networks and have been shown to even capture key functions of biological systems. Here we report an approach to implement SSMs in energy-efficient compute-in-memory (CIM) hardware to achieve real-time, event-driven processing. Our work re-parameterizes the model to function with real-valued coefficients and shared decay constants, reducing the complexity of model mapping onto practical hardware systems. By leveraging device dynamics and diagonalized state transition parameters, the state evolution can be natively implemented in crossbar-based CIM systems combined with memristors exhibiting short-term memory effects. Through this algorithm and hardware co-design, we show the proposed system offers both high accuracy and high energy efficiency while supporting fully asynchronous processing for event-based vision and audio tasks.</description>

      <title>Decentralized GNSS at Global Scale via Graph-Aware Diffusion Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Network-based Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) underpin critical infrastructure and autonomous systems, yet typically rely on centralized processing hubs that limit scalability, resilience, and latency. Here we report a global-scale, decentralized GNSS architecture spanning hundreds of ground stations. By modeling the receiver network as a time-varying graph, we employ a deep linear neural network approach to learn topology-aware mixing schedules that optimize information exchange. This enables a gradient tracking diffusion strategy wherein stations execute local inference and exchange succinct messages to achieve two concurrent objectives: centimeter-level self-localization and network-wide consensus on satellite correction products. The consensus products are broadcast to user receivers as corrections, supporting precise point positioning (PPP) and precise point positioning-real-time kinematic (PPP-RTK). Numerical results demonstrate that our method matches the accuracy of centralized baselines while significantly outperforming existing decentralized methods in convergence speed and communication overhead. By reframing decentralized GNSS as a networked signal processing problem, our results pave the way for integrating decentralized optimization, consensus-based inference, and graph-aware learning as effective tools in operational satellite navigation.</description>

      <title>WaveletGaussian: Wavelet-domain Diffusion for Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Object Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a powerful representation for image-based object reconstruction, yet its performance drops sharply in sparse-view settings. Prior works address this limitation by employing diffusion models to repair corrupted renders, subsequently using them as pseudo ground truths for later optimization. While effective, such approaches incur heavy computation from the diffusion fine-tuning and repair steps. We present WaveletGaussian, a framework for more efficient sparse-view 3D Gaussian object reconstruction. Our key idea is to shift diffusion into the wavelet domain: diffusion is applied only to the low-resolution LL subband, while high-frequency subbands are refined with a lightweight network. We further propose an efficient online random masking strategy to curate training pairs for diffusion fine-tuning, replacing the commonly used, but inefficient, leave-one-out strategy. Experiments across two benchmark datasets, Mip-NeRF 360 and OmniObject3D, show WaveletGaussian achieves competitive rendering quality while substantially reducing training time.</description>
