      <title>Entropic Approach to Critical Materials Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most methodologies for materials criticality assessment score supply risk and societal importance. Market-based criteria offer quantitative measures for assessment. Here we develop a statistical approach based on a geologic entropy function in which flexible constraints, such as economic, national security related, or regulatory, can be applied. As an example, the formulation describes the relation between elemental price and crustal abundance for selected elements, both important to supply risk. The method may be applicable to parameters resulting from collective decisions exhibiting a highly peaked probability distribution.</description>

      <title>Emergent Nonperturbative Universal Floquet Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a robust, nonperturbative localization plateau emerges in periodically driven quasiperiodic lattices, independent of the static localization properties and drive protocol. Using exact Floquet dynamics, Floquet perturbation theory, and optimal-order van Vleck analysis, we identify a fine-tuned amplitude-to-frequency ratio where all Floquet states become localized despite dense resonances. The van Vleck expansion achieves superasymptotic accuracy up to an optimal orde; it ultimately breaks down due to resonant hybridization at a weak quasiperiodic potential, revealing that the observed localization is nonperturbative.</description>

      <title>Localization Landscape in Non-Hermitian and Floquet quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the Filoche--Mayboroda localization landscape that extends the theory well beyond the static, elliptic and Hermitian settings while preserving its geometric interpretability. Using the positive operator $H^\dagger H$, we obtain a landscape that predicts localization across non-Hermitian, Floquet, and topological systems without computing eigenstates. Singular-value collapse reveals spectral instabilities and skin effects, the Sambe formulation captures coherent destruction of tunneling, and topological zero modes emerge directly from the landscape. Applications to Hatano--Nelson chains, driven two-level systems, and driven Aubry--Andr\'e--Harper models confirm quantitative accuracy, establishing a unified predictor for localization in equilibrium and driven quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Madelung hydrodynamics of spin-orbit coupling: action principles, currents, and correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exploit the variational and Hamiltonian structures of quantum hydrodynamics with spin to unfold the correlation and torque mechanisms accompanying spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in electronic motion. Using Hamilton's action principle for the Pauli equation, we isolate SOC-induced quantum forces that act on the orbital Madelung--Bohm trajectories and complement the usual force terms known to appear in quantum hydrodynamics with spin. While the latter spin-hydrodynamic forces relate to the quantum geometric tensor (QGT), SOC-induced orbital forces originate from a particular current operator that contributes prominently to the spin current and whose contribution was overlooked in the past. The distinction between different force terms reveals two fundamentally different mechanisms generating quantum spin-orbit correlations. Leveraging the Hamiltonian structure of the hydrodynamic system, we also elucidate spin transport features such as the current shift in the spin Hall effect and the correlation-induced quantum torques. Finally, we illustrate the framework via the Madelung--Rashba equations for planar SOC configurations and propose a particle-based scheme for numerical implementation.</description>

      <title>Resonant fragility and nonresonant robustness of Floquet eigenstates in kicked spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In classical systems, the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theorem establishes that resonant tori of integrable Hamiltonians are destroyed by any nonintegrable perturbation, whereas nonresonant tori are only deformed up to a finite value of the perturbation parameter. In this contribution, we identify a quantum analog of this differentiated sensitivity for one-degree-of-freedom spin Hamiltonians subject to periodic instantaneous kicks. After detecting quantum signatures of resonances in the participation ratio and in the quasiprobability phase-space distribution of Floquet eigenstates of the perturbed Hamiltonian, we show that eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian exhibit greater sensitivity against the perturbation when they satisfy a resonant condition. The sensitivity is quantified through the fidelity between perturbed and unperturbed eigenstates. This differentiated sensitivity becomes increasingly pronounced as the system size grows. Our findings are supported by numerical results and insights from analytical calculations based on unitary perturbation theory. Although our analysis focuses on kicked models, the mechanism could be extended to more general periodic drivings, providing a preliminary step toward a quantum counterpart of the classical breaking of resonant tori.</description>

      <title>Systems with Quantum Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose quantum-mechanical systems in which the number of spatial dimensions is promoted to a dynamical quantum variable, making the effective dimension state-dependent. Interestingly, systems of this form can exhibit enhanced symmetries compared to their fixed-dimensional counterparts. As an explicit example, we analyze a two-state system for which the number of spatial dimensions is represented by a quantum operator. By evaluating the corresponding partition function, we uncover a temperature-dependent effective dimension. Our framework opens a new avenue for constructing physical systems, from gravity to condensed matter, where the very notion of dimensionality becomes quantum.</description>
