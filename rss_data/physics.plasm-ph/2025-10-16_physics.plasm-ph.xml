      <title>Structure of self-generated magnetic fields in laser-solid interaction from proton tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong magnetic fields are naturally self-generated in high-power, laser-solid interactions through the Biermann-battery mechanism. This work experimentally characterizes the 3D location and strength of these fields, rather than path-integrated quantities, through multi-view proton radiography and tomographic inversion on the OMEGA laser. We infer magnetic fields that extend several millimeters off the target surface into the hot, rarefied corona and are sufficient to strongly magnetize the plasma ($\Omega_{e}\tau_e \gg 1$). The data is used to validate MHD simulations incorporating recent improvements in magnetic transport modeling; we achieve reasonable agreement only with models with re-localization of transport by magnetic fields. This work provides a key demonstration of tomographic inversion in proton radiography, offering a valuable tool for investigating magnetic fields in laser-produced plasmas.</description>

      <title>Plasma Confinement State Classification via FPP Relevant Microwave Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a parsimonious and robust machine learning approach for identifying plasma confinement states in fusion power plants (FPPs) where reliable identification of the low-confinement (L-mode) and high-confinement (H-mode) regimes is critical for safe and efficient operation. Unlike research-oriented devices, FPPs must operate with a severely constrained set of diagnostics. To address this challenge, we demonstrate that a minimalist model, using only electron cyclotron emission (ECE) signals, can deliver accurate and reliable state classification. ECE provides electron temperature profiles without the engineering or survivability issues of in-vessel probes, making it a primary candidate for FPP-relevant diagnostics. Our framework employs ECE as input, extracts features with radial basis functions, and applies a gradient boosting classifier, achieving high accuracy with test accuracy averaging 96\% correct predictions. Robustness analysis and feature importance study confirm the reliability of the approach. These results demonstrate that state-of-the-art performance is attainable from a restricted diagnostic set, paving the way for minimalist yet resilient plasma control architectures for FPPs.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional unmagnetized Mach probe analysis and initial flow measurements in reversed-field pinch experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel matrix method of analyzing ion saturation current data from a general three-dimensional (3D) array of unmagnetized Mach probe tips is developed and used with data sets from two 3D Mach probes to make initial measurements of local plasma flow velocity in reversed-field pinch (RFP) experiments in the Madison Symmetric Torus (MST). The two 3D Mach probes are composed of regular polyhedral arrays of six and four tips, respectively, with the six-tip array composed of three orthogonal pairs of mutually opposite tips at the vertices of a regular octahedron and the four-tip array composed of non-opposite tips at the vertices of a regular tetrahedron, the analysis of which is specifically facilitated by the matrix method. Velocity measurement uncertainties for the Mach probes are derived based on uncertainties in probe machining and ion saturation current measurements, and typical relative uncertainties for the probes are estimated to be of order several percent, likely smaller than systematic uncertainties related to the Mach probe calibration constant and experimental uncertainties related to plasma and probe conditioning. Initial results for the octahedral probe show flow speeds of roughly the expected magnitudes based on previous MST measurements but with somes differences in flow direction, while those for the tetrahedron probe show similar flow directions to some previous measurements but also some larger than expected speeds. We consider possible causes for the unexpected results of these initial tests, with a focus on probe conditioning and fast electron issues.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Scale Energy Budget in Turbulent Plasmas: Role of Electron to Ion Temperature Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dissipation mechanisms in weakly collisional plasmas have been a longstanding topic of investigation, where significant progress has been made in recent years. A recent promising development is the use of the "scale-filtered" Vlasov-Maxwell equations to fully quantify the scale-by-scale energy balance, a feature that was absent when using fluid models in kinetic plasmas. In particular, this method reveals that the energy transfer in kinetic scales is fully accounted for by the scale-filtered pressure-strain interaction. Despite this progress, the influence of ion-electron thermal disequilibrium on the kinetic-scale energy budget remains poorly understood. Using two-dimensional fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of decaying plasma turbulence, we systematically investigate the pressure-strain interaction and its components at sub-ion scales by varying electron-to-ion temperature ratios. Our analysis focuses on three key ingredients of the pressure-strain interaction: the normal and shear components of Pi-D and pressure dilatation. Our results demonstrate that the scale-filtered pressure-strain interaction is dominated by scale-filtered Pi-D across the kinetic range, with the shear component consistently providing the dominant contribution. We find that the scale-filtered normal and shear contributions of Pi-D exhibit persistent anticorrelation and opposite signs across all kinetic scales. We also discover that the amplitude of both anisotropic components for each species scales directly with their temperature and inversely with the temperature of the other species, while the scale-filtered pressure dilatation remains negligible compared to the Pi-D terms but shows enhanced compressibility effects as plasma temperatures decrease. We discuss the implications of these findings in thermally non-equilibrated plasmas, such as in the turbulent magnetosheath and solar wind.</description>

      <title>Flux Jamming, Phase Transitions and Layering in Turbulent Magnetized Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses transport barrier formation and layering as consequences of jam formation. Extensive use is made of analogies with the theory of traffic flow in one dimension. The relation of flux jamming to motility induced phase separation (MIPS) is explained. Two routes to heat flux jamming are identified. The first is due to a rollover in the heat flux-pulse size relation, i.e. $dQ_T(\delta T)/d\delta T&lt;0$, and is similar to the condition of flux-gradient bistability. The second occurs when the delay time between pulse and heat flux exceeds a critical value. This does not require bistability and tends to occur near marginality. This analysis yields an estimate of the answer to the eternal question of 'how near is "near"?'. Staircase development is shown to follow jamiton train formation. The relation of jamming of avalanches to phase transitions in drift wave-zonal flow turbulence is elucidated. The formation of outward propagating blob trains and inward propagating void trains is demonstrated. The important role of turbulence spreading is identified.</description>

      <title>Dust-ion-acoustic solitons in an ion-beam-driven dusty magnetoplasma with adiabatic and nonadiabatic dust charge variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the characteristics of small-amplitude nonlinear dust-ion-acoustic (DIA) solitary waves in active magnetized positive-ion-beam-driven dusty plasmas with the effects of nonadiabatic and adiabatic dust charge variations. In the model, we consider the ion-neutral collision and thereby consider the collision enhanced ion current to the dust-charging process and dust charge fluctuations. We show that the streaming of the positive-ion beam significantly affects the dust-charging process in which the dust charge number decreases (increases) with an increased beam velocity (number density). Using the standard reductive perturbation technique, we derive the evolution equations in the form of Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations for DIA solitary waves for two different cases: nonadiabatic and adiabatic dust charge variations. We study the effect of positive ion beam, dust charge variation, magnetic field, ion creation, and ion-neutral collision enhanced current on the wave characteristics. We find that the soliton energy decays with time and is affected by the beam velocity. Also, the solitary waves get damped by the effects of ion creation, ion loss, ion-neutral collision enhanced current, and dust charge variation. Although the ion beam does not change the polarity of solitary waves in the case of adiabatic dust charge variation, a transition from rarefactive to compressive solitary waves occurs in the presence of an ion beam with nonadiabatic dust charge variation.</description>

      <title>Linear damping of magneto-acoustic waves in two-fluid partially ionized plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magneto-acoustic waves in partially ionized plasmas are damped due to elastic collisions between charged and neutral particles. Here, we use a linearized two-fluid model to describe the influence of this collisional interaction on the properties of small-amplitude waves propagating in a uniform and static background. Mainly focusing on the case of waves generated by a periodic driver, we perform a detailed study of the dependence of the wavenumbers and damping rates on the ionization degree of the plasma, the strength of the collisional coupling, and the angle of propagation. We describe how the different wave modes (fast, slow, acoustic) are related to the individual properties of each fluid in a wide range of physical conditions. In addition, we derive analytical approximations for the damping rates due to charge-neutral collisions in the limits of weak and strong coupling and check their range of validity in comparison with the exact numerical results. These approximations can be generally applied to a large variety of astrophysical and laboratory partially ionized plasmas, but here we also discuss the particular application to plasmas only composed of hydrogen.</description>

      <title>Bell Instability and Cosmic-Ray Acceleration in AGN Ultrafast Outflow Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate magnetic-field amplification driven by the nonresonant hybrid (NRH or Bell) instability and its impact on cosmic-ray (CR) acceleration at reverse shocks of ultrafast outflows (UFOs) from active galactic nuclei (AGN). Previous kinetic studies by particle-in-cell simulations have demonstrated that when maximum CR energy is near the injection scale, NRH instability efficiently amplifies magnetic field up to the saturation level. However, the efficiency of NRH instability goes down as maximum energy increase since CR current is carried by escaping CRs near the maximum energy. We employ a one-dimensional MHD--CR framework solving telegraph-type diffusion--convection equations to trace the coupled evolution of CRs, magnetic fields, and shock dynamics under realistic parameters. We find a distinct transition with magnetic field strength: for weak background fields ($B_{0}\!\lesssim\!10^{-4}\,\mathrm{G}$), NRH instability efficiently amplifies upstream turbulence, driving a self-regulated state where $E_{\max}$ becomes independent of initial strength of magnetic turbulence. In contrast, for stronger background fields ($B_{0}\!\gtrsim\!10^{-3}\,\mathrm{G}$), the escaping CR current is too weak to drive NRH instability, and magnetic turbulence further decays through parametric instabilities, potentially reducing the acceleration efficiency. We give the physical interpretation for the transition and discuss conditions for PeV--EeV acceleration at UFO reverse shocks.</description>

      <title>No cosmological constraints on dark photon dark matter from resonant conversion: Impact of nonlinear plasma dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit and invalidate all dark photon dark matter constraints from resonant conversion of dark photons into photons (plasmons) in the early universe. These constraints rely on the resonant transfer of a substantial portion of the dark photon energy density into the SM plasma, heating the plasma in the process. We demonstrate that this resonant transfer saturates because of plasma nonlinearities. Dark photon dark matter resonantly converts into $k \simeq 0$ Langmuir waves in the early universe electron-ion plasma. Once the Langmuir-wave energy approaches the thermal energy of the plasma, nonlinear effects driven by the ponderomotive force become significant. In particular, we show using dedicated Particle-in-Cell simulations that large-amplitude $k = 0$ Langmuir waves excite higher-k Langmuir and ion acoustic waves, producing strong spatial variations in density and plasma frequency. These inhomogeneities suppress further resonant conversion, limiting the deposited energy to about the thermal energy of the electrons at the time of conversion, orders of magnitude below observable cosmological thresholds. Consequently, the dark photon dark matter constraints are weaker by factors of $3000$ to $10^7$ across ten orders of magnitude in dark photon mass.</description>

      <title>A Flying Focus with Arbitrary Directionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flying focus techniques produce laser pulses whose focal points travel at arbitrary, controllable velocities. While this flexibility can enhance a broad range of laser-based applications, existing techniques constrain the motion of the focal point to the propagation direction of the pulse. Here, we introduce a flying focus configuration that decouples the motion of the focus from the propagation direction. A chirped laser pulse focused and diffracted by a diffractive lens and grating creates a focal point that can move both along and transverse to the propagation direction. The focal length of the lens, grating period, and chirp can be tuned to control the direction and velocity of the focus. Simulations demonstrate this control for a holographic configuration suited to high-power pulses, in which two off-axis pump beams with different focal lengths encode the equivalent phase of a chromatic lens and grating in a gas or plasma. For low-power pulses, conventional solid-state or adaptive optics can be used instead. Multi-dimensional control over the focal trajectory enables new configurations for applications, including laser wakefield acceleration of ions, steering of broadband THz radiation, and surface harmonic generation.</description>

      <title>Influence of kinetic effects in large-scale magnetic reconnection with multi-hierarchy simulation code KAMMUY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a multiscale phenomenon where fluid- and particle-scale processes interact. The particle-in-cell (PIC) method, capable of resolving kinetic (particle-scale) physics, is extensively used to study the kinetic effects in magnetic reconnection. Meanwhile, because of the high computational cost, PIC simulations cannot capture the interaction between kinetic and fluid dynamics, which poses a major obstacle to understanding magnetic reconnection in large-scale phenomena such as solar flares. A multi-hierarchy simulation that combines Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and PIC provides a promising means to overcome these spatial and temporal scale gaps. We developed a multi-hierarchy simulation code KAMMUY (Kinetic And Magnetohydrodynamic MUlti-hierarchY simulation code), in which an ideal MHD simulation for a large domain and a PIC simulation for a smaller domain are solved in parallel with mutual information exchange. To validate the code, we conducted test simulations of MHD wave propagation and the shock tube problem. The results demonstrate that short-wavelength, high-frequency waves generated in the PIC region do not propagate into the MHD region, whereas MHD-scale structures propagate smoothly into the PIC region, highlighting the capability of our code for numerical studies of magnetic reconnection. By applying the KAMMUY code to magnetic reconnection while varying the PIC domain size, we find that the reconnection rate remains unchanged, regardless of the extent of the PIC region where the Hall magnetic field is present. It suggests that the spatial extension of the Hall magnetic field on the scale of $10 \sim 100 \lambda_i$ does not influence the reconnection rate.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Effects of Parameters in Widespread SEP Events with EPREM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Energetic Particle Radiation Environment Model (EPREM) solves the focused transport equation (FTE) on a Lagrangian grid in a frame co-moving with the solar wind plasma and simulates the acceleration and transport of solar energetic particles (SEP) in the heliosphere. When not coupled to an external magnetohydrodynamic model, EPREM functions in an uncoupled mode where an ideal cone-shock is injected into a homogeneous background solar wind. We carried out an analysis of the effects of multiple physical parameters in producing widespread SEP events simulated by the uncoupled EPREM using a relatively simple model of a strong magnetized shock propagating radially outward through the inner heliosphere to produce the requisite MHD quantities for EPREM's sophisticated model of proton acceleration and transport. We compared a baseline simulation with seven variations in which the value of a single parameter differed from its baseline value. All simulations exhibit complex profiles of SEP flux as a function of time and energy, with clear dependence on parameters related to diffusion, mean free path, and shock profile. Moreover, while all simulations exhibit significant longitudinal spread in SEP flux, for certain parameter values there exists a decrease or absence in SEP flux at observers located $\geq 90^\circ$ from the shock origin. Relating the differences in SEP flux to the specific values of each parameter in the simulations provides insight into the morphology of observed SEP events and the state of the solar wind through which the driving CME propagates.</description>
