      <title>Global strong solutions to the compressible Navier--Stokes--Coriolis system for large data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the compressible Navier--Stokes system with the Coriolis force on the $3$D whole space. In this model, the Coriolis force causes the linearized solution to behave like a $4$th order dissipative semigroup $\{ e^{-t\Delta^2} \}_{t&gt;0}$ with slower time decay rates than the heat kernel, which creates difficulties in nonlinear estimates in the low-frequency part and prevents us from constructing the global strong solutions by following the classical method. On account of this circumstance, the existence of unique global strong solutions has been open even in the classical Matsumura--Nishida framework. In this paper, we overcome the aforementioned difficulties and succeed in constructing a unique global strong solution in the framework of scaling critical Besov spaces. Furthermore, our result also shows that the global solution is constructed for arbitrarily {\it large} initial data provided that the speed of the rotation is high and the Mach number is low enough by focusing on the dispersive effect due to the mixture of the Coriolis force and acoustic wave.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the final state problem for the Hartree equation with repulsive Coulomb potential: \[i\partial_t u+\frac{1}{2}\Delta u-\frac{1}{|x|}u=((-\Delta)^{-1}|u|)^2u\] We show the work in \cite{KaMi} can be extended to the Hartree nonlinearity: Given a prescribed asymptotic profile, we construct a unique global solution scattering to the profile. In particular, the existence of the modified wave operators is obtained for sufficiently localized small scattering data.</description>

      <title>On the F\"oppl-von K\'arm\'an theory for elastic prestrained films with varying thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the variational limiting theory of thin films, parallel to the F\"oppl-von K\'arm\'an theory in the nonlinear elasticity, for films that have been prestrained and whose thickness is a general non-constant function. Using $\Gamma$-convergence, we extend the existing results to the variable thickness setting, calculate the associated Euler-Lagrange equations of the limiting energy, and analyze the convergence of equilibria. The resulting formulas display the interrelation between deformations of the geometric mid-surface and components of the growth tensor.</description>

      <title>Weak pullback attractors for damped stochastic fractional Schr\"odinger equation on $\mathbb{R}^n</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article discusses the weak pullback attractors for a damped stochastic fractional Schr\"odinger equation on $\mathbb{R}^n$ with $n\geq 2$. By utilizing the stochastic Strichartz estimates and a stopping time technique argument, the existence and uniqueness of a global solution for the systems with the nonlinear term $|u|^{2\sigma}u$ are proven. Furthermore, we define a mean random dynamical system due to the uniqueness of the solution, which has a unique weak pullback mean random attractor in $L^\rho\left(\Omega; L^2\left(\mathbb{R}^n\right)\right)$. This result highlights the long-term dynamics of a broad class of stochastic fractional dispersion equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a new version of the von K\'arm\'an energy and the corresponding Euler-Langrange equations, in the context of thin prestrained plates, under the condition of incompressibility relative to the given prestrain. Our derivation uses the theory of $\Gamma$-convergence in the calculus of variations, building on prior techniques in [Conti, Dolzmann (2009)] and [Lewicka, Mahadevan, Pakzad (2011)].</description>

      <title>Local Well-posedenss of the Bartnik Static Extension Problem near Schwarzschild spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the local well-posedness of the Bartnik static metric extension problem for arbitrary Bartnik data that perturb that of any sphere in a Schwarzschild $\{t=0\}$ slice. Our result in particular includes spheres with arbitrary small mean curvature. We introduce a new framework to this extension problem by formulating the governing equations in a geodesic gauge, which reduce to a coupled system of elliptic and transport equations. Since standard function spaces for elliptic PDEs are unsuitable for transport equations, we use certain spaces of Bochner-measurable functions traditionally used to study evolution equations. In the process, we establish existence and uniqueness results for elliptic boundary value problems in such spaces in which the elliptic equations are treated as evolutionary equations, and solvability is demonstrated using rigorous energy estimates. The precise nature of the expected difficulty of solving the Bartnik extension problem when the mean curvature is very small is identified and suitably treated in our analysis.</description>

      <title>Interior $W^{2,\delta}$ type estimates for degenerate fully nonlinear elliptic equations with $L^n$ data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish interior $W^{2,\delta}$ type estimates for a class of degenerate fully nonlinear elliptic equations with $L^n$ data. The main idea of our approach is to slide $C^{1,\alpha}$ cones, instead of paraboloids, vertically to touch the solution, and estimate the contact set in terms of the measure of the vertex set. This shows that the solution has tangent $C^{1,\alpha}$ cones almost everywhere, which leads to the desired Hessian estimates. Accordingly, we are able to develop a kind of counterpart to the estimates for divergent structure quasilinear elliptic problems.</description>

      <title>Two parabolic inverse problems for an equation with unbounded zero-order coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is composed of two parts. We prove in the first part the uniqueness of the determination of the unbounded zero-order coefficient in a parabolic equation from boundary measurements. The novelty of our result is that it covers the largest class of unbounded zero-order coefficients. We establish in the second part a logarithmic stability inequality for the problem of determining the initial condition from a single interior measurement. As by-product, we obtain an observability inequality for a parabolic equation with unbounded zero-order coefficient.</description>

      <title>Muskat-Leverett two-phase flow in thin cylindric porous media: Asymptotic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A reduced-dimensional asymptotic modelling approach is presented for the analysis of two-phase flow in a thin cylinder with aperture of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon),$ where $\varepsilon$ is a small positive parameter. We consider a nonlinear Muskat-Leverett two-phase flow model expressed in terms of a fractional flow formulation and Darcy's law with a saturation and the reduced pressure as unknown. We assume that the capillary pressure is non-singular and neglect the acceleration of gravity in Darcy's law. Given flows seep through the lateral surface of the cylinder. This exchange process leads to a non-homogeneous Neumann boundary condition with an intensity factor $\varepsilon^\alpha$ $(\alpha \ge 1)$ which controls the mass transport.Furthermore, the absolute permeability tensor comprises an intensity coefficient $\varepsilon^\beta,$ $\beta \in \Bbb R,$ in the transversal directions. The asymptotic behaviour of the solution is studied as $\varepsilon \to 0,$ i.e. when the thin cylinder shrinks into an interval. Two qualitatively distinct cases are discovered in the asymptotic behavior of the solution: $\alpha =1 \ \text{and} \ \beta &lt;2,$ and $\alpha&gt; \beta -1 \ \text{and} \ \alpha &gt;1.$ In each of these cases, the asymptotic approximations are constructed for the pressures, saturations and velocities of these flows, and the corresponding asymptotic estimates are proved in various norms, including energy and uniform pointwise norms. Depending on the values of the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta,$ the first terms of the asymptotics are solutions to the corresponding nonlinear elliptic-parabolic system of two differential equations, which is a one-dimensional model of the Muskat-Leverett two-phase flow.</description>

      <title>$L^p$ asymptotics for the heat equation on symmetric spaces for non-symmetric solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of this work is to study the $L^p$-asymptotic behavior of solutions to the heat equation on arbitrary rank Riemannian symmetric spaces of non-compact type $G/K$ for non-bi-$K$ invariant initial data. For initial data $u_0$ compactly supported or in a weighted $L^1(G/K)$ space with a weight depending on $p\in [1, \infty]$, we introduce a mass function $M_p(u_0)(\cdot)$, and prove that if $h_t$ is the heat kernel on $G/K$, then $$\|h_t\|_p^{-1}\,\|u_0\ast h_t \, - \,M_p(u_0)(\cdot)\,h_t\|_p \rightarrow 0 \quad \text{as} \quad t\rightarrow \infty.$$ Interestingly, the $L^p$ heat concentration leads to completely different expressions of the mass function for $1\leq p &lt;2$ and $2\leq p\leq \infty$. If we further assume that the initial data are bi-$K$-invariant, then our mass function boils down to the constant $\int_{G/K}u_0$ in the case $p=1$, and more generally to $\mathcal{H}{u_0}(i\rho(2/p-1))$ if $1\leq p&lt;2$, and to $\mathcal{H}{u_0}(0)$ if $2\leq p \leq \infty$. Thus we improve upon results by V\'azquez, Anker et al, Naik et al, clarifying the nature of the problem.</description>

      <title>Regular solutions to the dissipative Aw-Rascle system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the local-in-time existence of regular solutions to dissipative Aw-Rascle system with the offset equal to gradient of some increasing and regular function of density. It is a mixed degenerate parabolic-hyperbolic hydrodynamic model, and we extend the techniques previously developed for compressible Navier-Stokes equations to show the well-posedness of the system in the $L_2-L_2$ setting. We also discuss relevant existence results for offset involving singular or nonlocal functions of density.</description>

      <title>Existence of weak solutions for the anisotropic $p(x)$-Laplacian via degree theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider Dirichlet boundary value problem involving the anisotropic $p(x)$-Laplacian, where $p(x)= (p_1(x), ..., p_n(x))$, with $p_i(x)&gt; 1$ in $\overline{\Omega}$. Using the topological degree constructed by Berkovits, we prove, under appropriate assumptions on the data, the existence of weak solutions for the given problem. An important contribution is that we are considering the degenerate and the singular cases in the discussion. Finally, according to the compact embedding for anisotropic Sobolev spaces, we point out that the considered boundaru value problem may be critical in some region of $\Omega$.</description>

      <title>Existence and higher regularity of statistically steady states for the stochastic Coleman-Gurtin equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of semi-linear differential Volterra equations with polynomial-type potentials that incorporates the effects of memory while being subjected to random perturbations via an additive Gaussian noise. We show that for a broad class of non-linear potentials, the system always admits invariant probability measures. However, the presence of memory effects precludes access to compactness in a typical fashion. In this paper, this obstacle is overcome by introducing functional spaces adapted to the memory kernels, thereby allowing one to recover compactness. Under the assumption of sufficiently smooth noise, it is then shown that the statistically stationary states possess higher-order regularity properties dictated by the structure of the nonlinearity. This is established through a control argument that asymptotically transfers regularity onto the solution by exploiting the underlying Lyapunov structure of the system in a novel way.</description>

      <title>Interaction between harvesting intervention and birth perturbation in an age-structured model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An age-structured fish model with birth and harvesting pulses is established, where birth pulses are responsible for increasing the amount of fish due to the constant multiple placement of juveniles, and harvesting pulses describe the decrease of fish due to fishing activities. The principal eigenvalue as a threshold value depending on the harvesting and birth intensity is firstly investigated by three different ways. The asymptotic behavior of the population is fully investigated and sufficient conditions for the species to be extinct or persist are given. Numerical simulations suggest that interaction between negative harvesting intervention and positive birth perturbation decides extinction and persistence of the species. It is also shown that perturbation timing plays an important role.</description>

      <title>The spectral concentration for damped waves on compact Anosov manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral distribution of damped waves on compact Anosov manifolds. Sj\"ostrand \cite{SJ1} proved that the imaginary parts of the majority of the eigenvalues concentrate near the average of the damping function, see also Anantharaman \cite{AN2}. In this paper, we prove that the most of eigenvalues actually lie in certain regions with imaginary parts that approaching the average logarithmically as the real parts tend to infinity. As an application, we show the concentration of non-trivial zeros of twisted Selberg zeta functions in a logarithmic region asymptotically close to $\Re s=\frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Quantized slow blow-up dynamics for the energy-critical corotational wave maps problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the blow-up dynamics for the energy-critical 1-corotational wave maps problem with 2-sphere target. In arXiv:0911.0692, Rapha\"el and Rodnianski exhibited a stable finite time blow-up dynamics arising from smooth initial data. In this paper, we exhibit a sequence of new finite-time blow-up rates (quantized rates), which can still arise from well-localized smooth initial data. We closely follow the strategy of the paper arXiv:1301.1859 by Rapha\"el and Schweyer, who exhibited a similar construction of the quantized blow-up rates for the harmonic map heat flow. The main difficulty in our wave maps setting stems from the lack of dissipation and its critical nature, which we overcome by a systematic identification of correction terms in higher-order energy estimates.</description>

      <title>Solving Riemann Problems with a Topological Tool (Extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17377v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous work, we developed a topological framework for solving Riemann initial-value problems for a system of conservation laws. Its core is a differentiable manifold, called the wave manifold, with points representing shock and rarefaction waves. In the present paper, we construct, in detail, the three-dimensional wave manifold for a system of two conservation laws with quadratic flux functions. Using adapted coordinates, we derive explicit formulae for important surfaces and curves within the wave manifold and display them graphically. The surfaces subdivide the manifold into regions according to shock type, such as ones corresponding to the Lax admissibility criterion. The curves parametrize rarefaction, shock, and composite waves appearing in contiguous wave patterns. Whereas wave curves overlap in state space, they are disentangled within the wave manifold. We solve a Riemann problem by constructing a wave curve associated with the slow characteristic speed family, generating a surface from it using shock curves, and intersecting this surface with a fast family wave curve. This construction is applied to solve Riemann problems for several illustrative cases.</description>

      <title>Fokker-Planck equations on homogeneous Lie groups and probabilistic counterparts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11524v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the well-posedness of subelliptic Fokker-Planck equations arising from stochastic control problems, as well as the properties of the associated diffusion processes. Here, the main difficulty arises from the possible polynomial growth of the coefficients, which is related to the growth of the family of vector fields generating the first layer of the associated Lie algebra. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the energy solution, and its representation as the transition density of the underlying subelliptic diffusion process. Moreover, we show its Holder continuity in time w.r.t.the Fortet-Mourier distance, where the Holder seminorm depends on the degree of homogeneity of the vector fields. Finally, we provide a probabilistic proof of the Feyman-Kac formula, as a consequence of the uniform boundedness in finite time intervals of all moments.</description>

      <title>Transonic shock solutions for steady 3-D axisymmetric full Euler flows with large swirl velocity in a finite cylindrical nozzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns the existence and location of three-dimensional axisymmetric transonic shocks with large swirl velocity for solutions of the steady compressible full Euler system in a cylindrical nozzle with prescribed receiver pressure. Special non-trivial shock solutions with large vorticity are first constructed by considering arbitrarily given non-zero swirl functions. Then the existence and locations of the transonic shock solutions to the full Euler equations are achieved under small perturbations on the special shock solutions with appropriate boundary conditions on the entrance of the nozzle and the receiver pressure at the exit. It turns out that the non-zero swirl velocity, which brings new challenging difficulties in the analysis, plays an essential and fundamental role in determining the location of the shock front. Mathematically, it can be formulated as a free boundary value problem with the shock front as the free boundary governed by nonlinear equations of hyperbolic-elliptic mixed-type with strongly coupled lower order terms and a singularity at the symmetry axis. Because the shock location can be arbitrarily shifted for the special shock solutions, in order to catch the location of the shock front directly from the perturbed boundary data, approximate shock solutions of a free boundary problem for a specific linearized Euler system are constructed and an iteration scheme is designed around the approximate shock solution with a perturbation of higher order. As far as we know, it is the first mathematical result on the three-dimensional transonic shock with either large vorticity or large swirl velocity. The new methods and techniques developed in this paper to deal with the new challenging difficulties in the analysis will also be helpful for other problems with similar difficulties.</description>

      <title>Exact Boundary Controllability for Reduced System Associated to Extended Maxwell Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the theory of viscoelasticity, an important class of models admits a representation in terms of springs and dashpots. Widely used members of this class are the Maxwell model and its extended version. The paper concerns about the exact boundary controllability (abbreviated by EBC) for the reduced system (abbreviated by RS) associated to the extended Maxwell model (EMM). The initial boundary value problem (abbreviated by IBP) with a mixed type boundary condition (abbreviated by MBC) in the absence of the exterior force is called the augmented system (abbreviated by AD system). Here, the MBC consists of a homogeneous displacement boundary condition and inhomogeneous traction boundary condition with a boundary control. The RS is a closed subsystem inside the AD system (see Section \ref{sec1} for the details of the EMM and the RS). For the RS, we consider the IBP for the associated AD system. By using a dissipative structure of the RS in relation with the AD system, we will prove the EBC for the RS by a modified version of Russell's principle. Also, as an application of this EBC, we will show a partial boundary controllability (abbreviated by PBC) for the Boltzmann type viscoelastic system of equations (abbreviated by BVS) associated to the EMM. That is, for a large enough time $T&gt;0$ and any pair of given speeds $(v_0, v_1)$, there is a boundary control which steers to have $v(0)=v^0,\,v(t)=v^1$, where $v(t)=\partial_t u(t)$ is the speed of the displacement vector $u(t)$ of BVS at time $t$.</description>

      <title>A note for double H\"{o}lder regularity of the hydrodynamic pressure for weak solutions of Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an elementary proof for the double H\"{o}lder regularity of the hydrodynamic pressure for weak solutions of the Euler Equations in a bounded $C^2$-domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$; $d\geq 3$. That is, for velocity $u \in C^{0,\gamma}(\Omega;\mathbb{R}^d)$ with some $0&lt;\gamma&lt;1/2$, we show that the pressure $p \in C^{0,2\gamma}(\Omega)$. This is motivated by the studies of turbulence and anolalous dissipation in mathematical hydrodynamics and, recently, has been established in [L. De Rosa, M. Latocca, and G. Stefani, Int. Math. Res. Not. 2024.3 (2024), 2511-2560] over $C^{2,\alpha}$-domains by means of pseudodifferential calculus. Our approach involves only standard elliptic PDE techniques, and relies crucially on a variant of the modified pressure introduced in [C. W. Bardos, D. W. Boutros, and E. S. Titi, H\"{o}lder regularity of the pressure for weak solutions of the 3D Euler equations in bounded domains, arXiv: 2304.01952] and the potential estimates in [L. Silvestre, unpublished notes]. The key novel ingredient of our proof is the introduction of two cutoff functions whose localisation parameters are carefully chosen as a power of the distance to $\partial\Omega$.</description>

  We provide the existence and several fundamental properties of nonnegative solutions for the above equation inferred from \cite{DSVZ24}. And then, we prove that such equation possesses a unique (up to translations) ground state, which is nondegenerate.</description>

      <title>The $L^p$ regularity problem for parabolic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we fully resolve the question of whether the Regularity problem for the parabolic PDE $-\partial_tu + \mbox{div}(A\nabla u)=0$ on a Lipschitz cylinder $\mathcal O\times\mathbb R$ is solvable for some $p\in (1,\infty)$ under the assumption that the matrix $A$ is elliptic, has bounded and measurable coefficients and its coefficients satisfy a natural Carleson condition (a parabolic analog of the so-called DKP-condition).
  We prove that for some $p_0&gt;1$ the Regularity problem is solvable in the range $(1,p_0)$. We note that answer to this question was not known even in the small Carleson case, that is, when the Carleson norm of coefficients is sufficiently small.
  In the elliptic case the analogous question was only fully resolved recently independently by two groups, with two very different methods: one involving two of the authors and S. Hofmann, the second by M. Mourgoglou, B. Poggi and X. Tolsa. Our approach in the parabolic case is motivated by that of the first group, but in the parabolic setting there are significant new challenges.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Boundary Control of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky Equation Under Intermittent Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study in this paper boundary stabilization, in the L2 sense, of the perturbed Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation subject to intermittent sensing. We assume that we measure the state on a given spatial subdomain during certain time intervals, while we measure the state on the remaining spatial subdomain during the remaining time intervals. We assign a feedback law at the boundary of the spatial domain and force to zero the value of the state at the junction of the two subdomains. Throughout the study, the equation's destabilizing coefficient is assumed to be unknown and possibly space dependent but bounded. As a result, adaptive boundary controllers are designed under different assumptions on the perturbation. In particular, we guarantee input-to-state stability (ISS) when an upperbound on the perturbation's size is known. Otherwise, only global uniform ultimate boundedness (GUUB) is guaranteed. In contrast, when the state is measured at every spatial point all the time (full state measurement), convergence to an arbitrarily-small neighborhood of the origin is guaranteed, even if the perturbation's maximal size is unknown. Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Flow: Shi-Type Estimates and Long-time Existence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the long-time existence of the anomaly flow on a compact complex $3$-fold with general slope parameter $\alpha'$. In particular, we obtain integral Shi-type estimates for the flow by adapting a integration-by-parts type argument instead of the usual maximum principle techniques. Following this, we prescribe a sufficient smallness condition on $\alpha'$ in order to extend the flow on $[0,\tau)$ to $[0,\tau + \epsilon)$.</description>
