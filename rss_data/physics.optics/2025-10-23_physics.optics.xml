      <title>Broadband Thermal Noise Correlations Induced by Measurement Back-Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern mechanical sensors increasingly measure motion with precision sufficient to resolve the fundamental thermal noise floor over a broad band. Compared to traditional sensors -- achieving this limit only near resonance -- this capability provides massive gains in acquisition rates along with access to otherwise obscured transient signals. However, these stronger measurements of motion are naturally accompanied by increased back-action. Here we show how resolving the broadband thermal noise spectrum reveals back-action-induced correlations in the noise from many mechanical modes, even those well-separated in frequency. As a result, the observed spectra can deviate significantly from predictions of the usual single-mode and (uncorrelated) multimode models over the broad band, notably even at the mechanical resonance peaks. This highlights that these effects must be considered in all systems exhibiting measurement back-action, regardless of whether the resonances are spectrally isolated or the readout noise is high enough that the noise peaks appear consistent with simpler models. Additionally, these correlations advantageously allow the thermal noise spectrum to reach a minimum -- equivalent to that of a single mode -- in a band far from the resonance peak, where the mechanical susceptibility is comparatively stable against frequency noise.</description>

      <title>Near-field enhancement by a metasurface at octupole plasmon resonance in periodic disc dimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local intensity enhancement by plasmonic nanoparticles is widely used in optics and photonics. However, the effect is usually based on dipole resonances in the particles. Recently, it has been shown that quadrupole and octupole resonances can exhibit comparable, or even higher near-field enhancement. In this work, we focus on the near-field enhancement by a metasurface composed of gold-disc dimers arranged in a rectangular array. We find that, owing to an octupole plasmon resonance coupled to a surface lattice resonance, exceptionally high near-field enhancement in the dimer gaps can be achieved in the visible spectral range. To gain insight into the effect, we develop an analytical model for the effective dipole and octupole polarizabilities of the particles in an array, and discover, that at decreasing array periods, the dipole polarizability tends to vanish, while the octupole polarizability rapidly increases. Hence, octupole resonances can find applications in high-density arrays of plasmonic resonators. We propose a method to numerically evaluate multipole polarizabilities of a single particle, applying it to the gold dimer that we consider. The influence of the array on the effective polarizabilities is then verified by numerical calculations and a good agreement is obtained. Our results may open new avenues for investigating the properties of periodic plasmonic structures based on higher-order multipole resonances and their applications.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high-precision fused silica micro-hole machining via spherical aberration-assisted filamentation and laser-induced deep etching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glass materials play an increasingly important role in advanced technologies due to their superior physical properties. However, precise machining of glass remains a major challenge because of its brittleness and sensitivity to thermal and mechanical stresses. In this study, we present a novel approach that combines spherical-aberration-assisted filamentation with Laser-Induced Deep Etching (LIDE) to achieve unprecedented high-precision micro-hole machining in fused silica substrates. By deliberately introducing spherical aberration into an intense femtosecond laser beam, thin, uniformly elongated, and stable filaments are generated, which effectively suppress unwanted plasma formation and thermal deformation typical of standard filamentation. Using this method, we fabricated micro-holes with diameters as small as 10 $\mu$m across various sizes, maintaining an almost zero taper even in 1 mm-thick samples. The sidewalls exhibited nanoscale smoothness (Ra = 38.1 nm, RMS = 53.9 nm), and the hole area demonstrated excellent repeatability with only \sim 1.0\% variation across multiple trials. This simple optical configuration drastically reduces cost compared with existing approaches that rely on specialized components, while moderately satisfying critical requirements for geometrical versatility, minimal damage, precision, and repeatability. This work represents a significant step forward in precision glass machining and lays a foundation for future microstructured electronic, optical, and microfluidic devices.</description>

      <title>Fully automatic fabrication of fibre Bragg gratings using an AI-powered femtosecond laser inscription system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fibre Bragg gratings (FBGs) are widely used in optical sensing and communication systems. Femtosecond laser inscription (FLI) enables hydrogen-free, thermally stable, high-resolution, and complex structures of FBG fabrication, but its practical application is limited by manual operation, low throughput, and sensitivity to laser alignment. In this study, we present an AI-powered FLI system that enables automated, stable, and efficient FBG fabrication. By integrating a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model for real-time fabrication position correction, the system maintains precise laser alignment (-0.6 to 0.2 microns of the fibre core plane) and ensures consistent processing. Strong and weak FBGs were fabricated in different types of fibres, and their spectral characteristics-including central wavelength, reflectivity, and FWHM-exhibited high stability and repeatability. The results demonstrate that the proposed AI-powered FLI system significantly reduces manual intervention while achieving reliable FBG performance. This approach holds great promise for scalable, high-throughput FBG production and can be extended to the fabrication of arbitrary FBG structures across various fibre types. With further training and model refinement, the AI-powered FLI provides a scalable and intelligent platform for next-generation automated FBG manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Memory Effects in Time-Modulated Radiative Heat Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of radiative heat exchange between dipoles with time-modulated optical properties. This framework extends fluctuational electrodynamics beyond equilibrium by incorporating nonstationary correlations and memory effects induced by temporal modulation. Closed-form expressions for the heat currents in modulated many-body systems are obtained, together with a generalized Landauer-like formulation of the pairwise exchanges, where the transmission coefficient accounts for all inelastic frequency-conversion channels. Near-resonant modulation redistributes and amplifies thermal fluctuations across Floquet sidebands, acting as a parametric amplifier of thermal radiation and enabling active, frequency-selective control of nanoscale heat transfer.</description>

      <title>Influence of mechanical resonances on the linearity of adiabatic frequency conversion in whispering gallery resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adiabatic frequency conversion enables fast and efficient tuning of laser light by coupling it into an optical resonator whose eigenfrequency is varied on a timescale shorter than its photon lifetime. In this regime, the optical frequency follows the cavity resonance, allowing frequency shifts of several hundred gigahertz within sub-microsecond time - independent of optical power and without phase-matching constraints. While a linear dependence of the cavity resonance on a control parameter (e.g., applied voltage) suggests that arbitrary temporal signals could be linearly transferred to optical frequency changes, we show that this assumption fails near mechanical resonances of the resonator. Using a millimeter-sized lithium niobate whispering gallery resonator with a pronounced mechanical mode at 10.5 MHz, we observe strong deviations from linearity even when higher harmonics of the control signal coincide with this resonance. The experimental results are in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. They demonstrate that mechanical resonances impose intrinsic limits on the linearity of adiabatic frequency conversion and other frequency control schemes based on the variation of the eigenfrequency of an optical cavity.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Laser Beam Engineering with Coherent Beam Combining for Efficient and Uniform Power Delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-power laser technologies are critical in precision manufacturing, defense, and scientific research, where accurate control over the beam profile is essential. To address this need, we employ coherent beam combining (CBC) through adaptive phase control to precisely craft far-field intensity distributions. We present a comprehensive framework comprising two complementary strategies: (i) dynamic beam shaping through sequential steering, enabling programmable trajectories and arbitrary patterns for versatile energy delivery, and (ii) static shaping via iterative phase optimization, producing target defined profiles such as rings, squares, and triangles. Rapid reconfiguration of beam profiles and steering is achieved through optimized phase-control algorithms. Among the tested methods, a deep-learning-inspired Adagrad optimization approach demonstrated the fastest and most stable convergence, ensuring scalability and robustness. The proposed strategy significantly enhances power delivery efficiency and beam uniformity compared to conventional shaping techniques. This dual-mode CBC framework establishes a versatile and resilient platform for adaptive laser beam control, with transformative potential across industrial manufacturing, materials processing, medical systems, directed-energy applications, and tunable light-field research.</description>

Abstract: The study investigated transparent on-chip structures with a rectangular profile and triangular profiles with grating ridge base angles of $\alpha = 36^\circ$, $30^\circ$, and $20^\circ$. Each triangular structure had both left- and right-handed profile orientations. For all variants, a modified version with a reflective gold coating was additionally considered. The maximum energy gains and accelerating gradients were determined and quantified for all structure classes: transparent and reflective (with both rectangular and triangular profiles).</description>

      <title>Observation of counterion binding in the inner Helmholtz layer at the ionic surfactant-water interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding specific ion adsorption within the inner Helmholtz layer remains central to electrochemistry yet experimentally elusive. Here we directly quantify counterion adsorption and extract the associated thermodynamic parameters within the inner Helmholtz layer using phase-sensitive sum-frequency vibrational spectroscopy (PS-SFVS). Using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as a model ionic surfactant, we determine the Na+ and DS- surface densities by simultaneously analyzing interfacial free OH response and the diffuse-layer SF signal, from which the adsorption thermodynamic parameters are derived. We then construct an adsorption phase diagram that maps the evolution of Na+ and DS- species in the compact layer as functions of bulk NaCl and SDS concentrations, revealing a continuous increase in surface ion pairing. The DS-: Na+ pairing ratio gradually decreases with increasing NaCl and approaches 2.8 at the supersaturation state prior to surface nucleation. These results establish PS-SFVS as a quantitative probe of ion-headgroup correlations in charged interfaces and reveal the thermodynamic mechanism underlying counterion-mediated interfacial ordering, with broad implications for electrolyte design, biomembrane stability, and soft-matter assembly.</description>

      <title>The Eckhaus instability: from initial to final stages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systematic analysis of the Eckhaus instability in the one-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau equation is presented. The analysis is based on numerical integration of the equation in a large (xt)-domain. The initial conditions correspond to a stationary, unstable spatially periodic solution perturbed by "noise." The latter consists of a set of spatially periodic modes with small amplitudes and random phases. The evolution of the solution is examined by analyzing and comparing the dynamics of three key characteristics: the solution itself, its spatial spectrum, and the value of the Lyapunov functional. All calculations exhibit four distinct, mutually agreed, well-defined regimes: (i) rapid decay of stable perturbations; (ii) latent changes, when the solution and the Lyapunov functional undergo minimal alterations while the Fourier spectrum concentrates around the most unstable perturbations; (iii) a phase-slip period, characterized by a sharp decrease in the Lyapunov functional; (iv) slow relaxation to a final stable state.</description>

      <title>Detuning Tunable OAM Generation via Double-$\Lambda$ Four-Wave Mixing in Hot Rubidium Vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate detuning-tunable generation of orbital-angular-momentum (OAM) light using a double Lambda four-wave-mixing (FWM) process in Doppler broadened rubidium vapor. Two near-resonant pumps on the D1 line drive non degenerate FWM that produces bright probe conjugate beams whose transverse modes evolve with pump detuning. A paraxial density-matrix model coupled to split-step propagation predicts detuning-dependent spatial gain shaping that sets the OAM content; experiments with a mode cleaned pump laser and a 12-mm AR-coated vapor cell validate these predictions. We quantify mode formation by imaging, spectroscopy, and power measurements, and verify OAM conservation between the generated beams. The results establish resonant atomic vapor as a compact, tunable platform for structured-light generation with applications to high-dimensional quantum communications and imaging.</description>

      <title>High Uniformity GaN Micro-pyramids and Platelets by Selective Area Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of uniform GaN micro-pyramids and platelets via selective area growth is a critical step toward advancing III-nitride device technologies, particularly for micro-light-emitting diode applications. This work investigates the origins of morphological non-uniformity in micro-pyramids and micro-platelets grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). We observe that a direct one-step growth approach leads to significant growth rate inhomogeneity across arrays. To shed light on this issue, we examine the mechanisms driving non-uniformity and explore process modifications aimed at mitigating these effects. Building on these insights, we propose a controlled multi-step growth strategy that combines sequen-tial growth and thermal treatment phases. This approach is demonstrated to enhance surface morphology and structural regularity. The work contributes to the broader objective of enabling scalable, high-precision GaN microstructure fabrication for next-generation optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Colloquium: Quantum optics of intense light--matter interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intense light-matter interaction largely relies on the use of high-power light sources, creating fields comparable to, or even stronger than, the field keeping the electrons bound in atoms. Under such conditions, the interaction induces highly nonlinear processes such as high harmonic generation, in which the low-frequency photons of a driving laser field are upconverted into higher-frequency photons. These processes have enabled numerous groundbreaking advances in atomic, molecular, and optical physics, and they form the foundation of attosecond science. Until recently, however, such processes were typically described using semi-classical approximations, since the quantum properties of the light field were not required to explain the observables. This has changed in the recent past. Ongoing theoretical and experimental advances show that fully quantized descriptions of intense light-matter interactions, which explicitly incorporate the quantum nature of the light field, open new avenues for both fundamental research and technological applications at the fully quantized level. These advances emerge from the convergence of quantum optics with strong-field physics and ultrafast science. Together, they have given rise to the field of quantum optics and quantum electrodynamics of strong-field processes.</description>

      <title>Active tuning of ENZ resonances in meta-antenna through phase modulation of optical pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanoantennas offer new avenues to manipulate the propagation of light in materials due to their near field enhancement and ultrafast response time. Here we investigate the epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) response in an L-shaped nanoantenna structure under the phenomenon of plasmonic analog of enhancement in the index of refraction. Using a quantum mechanical approach, we analyze the modulation in the response of probe field and emergence of ENZ frequency region both in the linear and nonlinear plasmonic system. We also demonstrate the active tuning of ENZ frequency region in a nanoantenna structure by modulating the phase of control pulse. The analytical and 3D FDTD simulation results show a significant spectral shift in the ENZ modes. Our proposed method offers the possibility to design and control optical tunable ENZ response in plasmonic metasurfaces without the use of ENZ material. Such metasurfaces can be used in on-chip photonic integrated circuits, further localization of incident fields, slow light operations and various quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Photonic scattering in 2D waveguide QED: Quantum Goos-H\"anchen shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum emitters coupled to traveling photons in waveguides, known as waveguide quantum electrodynamics (WQED), offer a powerful platform for understanding light-matter interactions and underpinning emergent quantum technologies. While WQED has been extensively studied in one dimension, two-dimensional (2D) WQED remains largely unexplored, where novel photonic scattering phenomena unique to higher dimensions are expected. Here, we present a comprehensive scattering theory for 2D WQED based on the Green function method. We show that the mean displacement between emitted and injected photons serves as a quantum analogue of the Goos-H\"anchen shift. When a photon is injected into a single off-centered port, the quantum Goos-H\"anchen (QGH) shift can be enhanced in backward scattering under resonant conditions with subradiant states. When a photon is injected into the center port, there is no QGH shift due to the mirror symmetry of structure. However, for multiple-port injection with transverse momentum, the QGH shift is recovered and proportional to the derivative of phase with respect to transverse momentum. Unlike the classical Goos-H\"anchen shift, these effects can be flexibly tuned by the injected photon's frequency. Our work provides a general framework for exploring and manipulating photonic scattering in complex WQED networks.</description>

      <title>Dynamic control of dipole decay rate via graphene plexcitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active control of the radiative properties of quantum emitters through engineered light-matter interactions is a key challenge in nanophotonics and quantum optics. In this work, we demonstrate dynamic modulation of dipole's decay rate by exploiting the tunable plexcitonic modes (graphene plasmons and QD-excitons) in the strong coupling regime. By integrating a quantum dot inside a graphene spherical shell and tuning the local optical response of hybrid modes via voltage-bias, we achieve continuous and reversible control over the decay rate, leading to significant enhancement or suppression of dipole emission from near- to far-infrared regime. Furthermore, the plexcitonic peaks shows much sharper linewidths in contrast to bare graphene plasmons even in the off-resonant coupling which indicates higher sensitivity of the systems at tuned wavelengths. We demonstrate the phenomenon with the numerical solution of 3D Maxwell's equations using MNPBEM tool. Our approach demonstrate a versatile platform for programmable emission control and offer a promising pathway for developing reconfigurable quantum photonic devices, such as tunable single-photon sources and ultrafast optical switches.</description>

      <title>Universality and Optimal Architectures for Layered Programmable Unitary Decompositions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The decomposition of arbitrary unitary transformations into sequences of simpler, physically realizable operations is a foundational problem in quantum information science, quantum control, and linear optics. We establish a 1D Quantum Field Theory model for justifying the universality of a broad class of such factorizations. We consider parametrizations of the form $U = D_1 V_1 D_2 V_2 \cdots V_{M-1}D_M$, where $\{D_j\}$ are programmable diagonal unitary matrices and $\{V_j\}$ are fixed mixing matrices. By leveraging concepts like the anomalies of our effective model, we establish criteria for universality given the set of mixer matrices. This approach yields a rigorous proof grounded on physics for the conditions required for the parametrization to cover the entire group of special unitary matrices. This framework provides a unified method to verify the universality of various proposed architectures and clarifies the nature of the ``generic'' mixers required for such constructions. We also provide a geometry-aware optimization method for finding the parameters of a decomposition.</description>

      <title>Universal non-Hermitian valley filtering via uniform dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Valley, as a ubiquitous degree of freedom in lattices, has found wide applications in both electronic and classical-wave devices in recent years. However, achieving valley-polarized states, a prerequisite for valley-based operations, still remains challenging. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a universal non-Hermitian mechanism for valley filtering using only uniform background dissipation, which creates a propagation length contrast between valleys through their intrinsic group velocity differences. We implement this concept in an acoustic crystal, observing switchable and robust valley polarization of sound through large-scale field mapping. Remarkably, our approach is solely based on uniform loss, without the need for any special lattice structures, tailored excitations, or external fields. We further provide designs of our non-Hermitian valley filter on photonic and electronic platforms. Our results offer a simple and effective solution to valley-polarized state generation and may advance the development of novel valley-based devices in both classical and quantum regimes.</description>

      <title>Temperature-invariant magneto-optical Kerr effect in a noncollinear antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The anomalous Hall effect and magneto-optical Kerr effect have traditionally been associated with ferromagnets, but recent studies reveal their presence in noncollinear antiferromagnets due to nonzero Berry curvature despite negligible net magnetization. However, Hall measurements often show strong temperature dependence caused by extrinsic scattering, complicating quantitative analysis, and temperature invariance of the Kerr effect remains unconfirmed. Here we employ epitaxial, stoichiometric Mn3NiN single crystal films and perform polar Kerr measurements at an infrared 1550 nm telecommunication wavelength, demonstrating a spontaneous Kerr signal that remains stable within a few percent across a 200 Kelvin range below the N\'eel temperature. This temperature-invariant Kerr effect contrasts with the strongly temperature-dependent Hall effect and confirms the intrinsic nature of Berry curvature in these materials. Our findings establish infrared Kerr effect as a reliable, local probe of Berry curvature in noncollinear antiferromagnets, facilitating quantitative characterization and advancing antiferromagnetic spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Atomic-superfluid heat engines controlled by twisted light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a quantum heat engine using a setup consisting of a ring-trapped Bose-Einstein condensate placed in a Fabry--P\'erot cavity where the optical fields carry orbital angular momentum. We first show that the cavity-enhanced light-atom coupling leads to the emergence of polaritonic modes, whose character can be reversibly switched between photonlike and phononlike by detuning sweeps allowing work extraction governed by distinct reservoirs. We investigate the dependence of the engine efficiency on the orbital angular momentum. Beyond ideality, we discuss finite-time scenarios based on shortcuts to adiabaticity such that the efficiency retains its ideal-operation value, despite finite-time challenges. Finally, for lower values of the orbital angular momentum, we describe an alternate scheme for operating quantum heat engines based on the adiabatic elimination of a mechanical mode. Our analysis identifies orbital angular momentum as an experimentally-accessible control knob that can reconfigure the performance of such quantum heat engines as desired.</description>

      <title>Theoretical analysis of performance limitation of computational refocusing in optical coherence tomography</title>

Abstract: High-numerical-aperture optical coherence tomography (OCT) enables sub-cellular imaging but faces a trade-off between lateral resolution and depth of focus. Computational refocusing can correct defocus in Fourier-domain OCT, yet its limitations remain unaddressed theoretically. We formulate the lateral imaging process of OCT by using pupil-based imaging theory and the constraints of the computational refocusing in point-scanning OCT and spatially-coherent full-field OCT (FFOCT) are analyzed. The constrains in lateral sampling density and the confocality are considered, and it is shown that the maximum correctable defocus (MCD) is primarily limited by confocality in point-scanning OCT, while spatially-coherent FFOCT has no such constraint and can achieve virtually infinite MCD with a proper and reasonable sampling density. This makes spatially-coherent FFOCT particularly suitable for optical coherence microscopy.</description>

      <title>Wave morphing and flat-top ground states in photonics systems driven by artificial gauge fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21183v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum physics, classical optics, and many other wave systems, wave confinement in a potential well is associated with discrete oscillatory states, and the ground state is typically assumed to vanish uniformly. An open question is whether the ground state can counterintuitively support a flat-top, nonzero envelope, offering new opportunities for quantum emitters, optical antennas, and lasers. Here, we show that by applying the Byers-Yang theorem with an artificial gauge field, energy levels can be continuously shifted, driving eigenstates to morph into a ground state with a uniform yet nontrivial wave envelope. We implement this concept in a photonic crystal slab where a central bulk region is surrounded by heterogeneous bandgaps that engineer reflective phases acting as an artificial local gauge field. By inducing lasing, we probe directly the evolution of the energy levels, demonstrating wave morphing toward a flat-top ground state via near- and far-field measurements.</description>

      <title>Advanced mirror shapes for mode enhancement in plano-concave cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical cavities are frequently used in quantum technologies to enhance light matter interactions, with applications including single photon generation and entanglement of distant emitters. The Fabry-P\'{e}rot resonator is a popular choice for its high optical access and large emitter-mirror separation. A typical configuration, particularly for emitters that should not be placed close to the mirror surface like trapped ions and Rydberg atoms, features two spherical mirrors placed around a central emitter, but this arrangement can put demanding requirements on the mirror alignment. In contrast, plano-concave cavities are tolerant to mirror misalignment and only require the manufacture of one curved mirror, but have limited ability to focus light in the centre of the cavity. Here we show how mirror shaping can overcome this limitation of plano-concave cavities while preserving the key advantages. We demonstrate through numerical simulations that simple mirror shaping can increase coupling between a plano-concave cavity and a central emitter by an order of magnitude, even rivalling misalignment-sensitive concave-concave counterparts for achievable interaction strength. We use these observations to establish the conditions under which plano-concave cavities with shaped mirrors could improve the performance and practicality of emitter-cavity systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Performances of Autonomous Quantum Refrigerators via Two-Photon Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional autonomous quantum refrigerators rely on uncorrelated heat exchange between the working system and baths via two-body interactions enabled by single-photon transitions and positive-temperature work baths, inherently limiting their cooling performance. Here, we introduce distinct qutrit refrigerators that exploit correlated heat transfer via two-photon transitions with the hot and cold baths, yielding a genuine enhancement in performance over conventional qutrit refrigerators that employ uncorrelated heat transfer. These refrigerators achieve at least a twofold enhancement in cooling power and reliability compared to conventional counterparts. Moreover, we show that cooling power and reliability can be further enhanced simultaneously by several folds, even surpassing existing cooling limits, by utilizing a synthetic negative-temperature work bath. Such refrigerators can be realized by combining correlated heat transfer and synthetic work baths, which consist of a four-level system coupled to hot and cold baths and two conventional work baths via two independent two-photon transitions. Here, the composition of two work baths effectively creates a synthetic negative-temperature work bath under suitable parameter choices. Additionally, our autonomous refrigerators with negative temperature baths significantly outperform previously studied autonomous and non-autonomous refrigerators in terms of cooling ability without requiring any additional energy resources, as they cool the cold bath to much lower temperature, which is forbidden for others refrigerators. Our results demonstrate that correlated heat transfers and baths with negative temperatures can yield thermodynamic advantages in quantum devices. Finally, we discuss the experimental feasibility of the proposed refrigerators across various existing platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlated phenomena occur in quantum materials because of the delicate interplay between internal degrees of freedom, leading to multiple symmetry-broken quantum phases. Resolving the structure of these phases is a key challenge, often requiring facilities equipped with x-ray free-electron lasers and electron sources that may not be readily accessible to the average user. Table-top sources that offer alternative means are therefore needed. In this work, we present an all-optical, table-top setup that enables symmetry-resolved studies using linear and nonlinear spectroscopies. We demonstrate the versatility of the setup with chosen examples that underscore the importance of tracking symmetries and showcase the strengths of the setup, which offers a large tunable parameter space.</description>
