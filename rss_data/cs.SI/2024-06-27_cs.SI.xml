      <title>A data-driven assessment of biomedical terminology evolution using information theoretical and network analysis approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), one of the main knowledge organization systems in the biomedical domain, is constantly evolving following the latest scientific discoveries in health and life sciences. Previous research focused on quantifying information in MeSH using its hierarchical structure. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach based on information theory and network analyses to quantify the knowledge evolution in MeSH and the relevance of its individual concepts. Our approach leverages article annotations and their citation networks to compute the level of informativeness, usefulness, disruptiveness, and influence of MeSH concepts over time. The citation network includes the instances of MeSH concepts or MeSH headings, and the concept relevance is calculated individually. Then, this computation is propagated to the hierarchy to establish the relevance of a concept. We quantitatively evaluated our approach using changes in the MeSH terminology and showed that it effectively captures the evolution of the terminology. Moreover, we validated the ability of our framework to characterize retracted articles and show that concepts used to annotate retracted articles differ substantially from those used to annotate non-retracted. The proposed framework provides an effective method to rank concept relevance and can be useful in maintaining evolving knowledge organization systems.</description>

      <title>CoDiNG -- Naming Game with Continuous Latent State of Agents</title>

Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms behind opinion formation is crucial for gaining insight into the processes that shape political beliefs, cultural attitudes, consumer choices, and social movements. This work aims to explore a nuanced model that captures the intricacies of real-world opinion dynamics by synthesizing principles from cognitive science and employing social network analysis. The proposed model is a hybrid continuous-discrete extension of the well-known Naming Game opinion model. The added latent continuous layer of opinion strength follows cognitive processes in the human brain, akin to memory imprints. The discrete layer allows for the conversion of intrinsic continuous opinion into discrete form, which often occurs when we publicly verbalize our opinions. We evaluated our model using real data as ground truth and demonstrated that the proposed mechanism outperforms the classic Naming Game model in many cases, reflecting that our model is closer to the real process of opinion formation.</description>

      <title>The Emergence of Threads: The Birth of a New Social Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Threads, a new microblogging platform from Meta, was launched in July 2023. In contrast to prior new platforms, Threads was borne out of an existing parent platform, Instagram, for which all users must already possess an account. This offers a unique opportunity to study platform evolution, to understand how one existing platform can support the "birth" of another. With this in mind, this paper provides an initial exploration of Threads, contrasting it with its parent, Instagram. We compare user behaviour within and across the two social media platforms, focusing on posting frequency, content preferences, and engagement patterns. Utilising a temporal analysis framework, we identify consistent daily posting trends on the parent platform and uncover contrasting behaviours when comparing intra-platform and cross-platform activities. Our findings reveal that Threads engages more with political and AI-related topics, compared to Instagram which focuses more on lifestyle and fashion topics. Our analysis also shows that user activities align more closely on weekends across both platforms. Engagement analysis suggests that users prefer to post about topics that garner more likes and that topic consistency is maintained when users transition from Instagram to Threads. Our research provides insights into user behaviour and offers a basis for future studies on Threads.</description>

      <title>A Weighted-Median Model of Opinion Dynamics on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social interactions influence people's opinions. In some situations, these interactions result in a consensus opinion; in others, they result in opinion fragmentation and the formation of different opinion groups in the form of "echo chambers". Consider a social network of individuals, who hold continuous-valued scalar opinions and change their opinions when they interact with each other. In such an opinion model, it is common for an opinion-update rule to depend on the mean opinion of interacting individuals. However, we consider an alternative update rule - which may be more realistic in some situations - that instead depends on a weighted median opinion of interacting individuals. Through numerical simulations of our opinion model, we investigate how the limit opinion distribution depends on network structure. For configuration-model networks, we also derive a mean-field approximation for the asymptotic dynamics of the opinion distribution when there are infinitely many individuals in a network.</description>

      <title>Investigation on centrality measures and opinion dynamics in two-layer networks with replica nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine two-layer networks and centrality measures defined on them. The propose two fast and accurate algorithms to approximate the game-theoretic centrality measures and examine connection between centrality measures and characteristics of opinion dynamic processes on such networks. As an example, we consider a Zachary's karate club social network and extend it by adding the second (internal) layer of communication. Internal layer represents the idea that individuals can share their real opinions with their close friends. The structures of the external and internal layers may be different. As characteristics of of opinion dynamic processes we mean consensus time and winning rate of a particular opinion. We find significantly strong positive correlation between internal graph density and consensus time, and significantly strong negative correlation between centrality of authoritative nodes and consensus time.</description>

      <title>What Is Missing In Homophily? Disentangling Graph Homophily For Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph homophily refers to the phenomenon that connected nodes tend to share similar characteristics. Understanding this concept and its related metrics is crucial for designing effective Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The most widely used homophily metrics, such as edge or node homophily, quantify such "similarity" as label consistency across the graph topology. These metrics are believed to be able to reflect the performance of GNNs, especially on node-level tasks. However, many recent studies have empirically demonstrated that the performance of GNNs does not always align with homophily metrics, and how homophily influences GNNs still remains unclear and controversial. Then, a crucial question arises: What is missing in our current understanding of homophily? To figure out the missing part, in this paper, we disentangle the graph homophily into $3$ aspects: label, structural, and feature homophily, providing a more comprehensive understanding of GNN performance. To investigate their synergy, we propose a Contextual Stochastic Block Model with $3$ types of Homophily (CSBM-3H), where the topology and feature generation are controlled by the $3$ metrics. Based on the theoretical analysis of CSBM-3H, we derive a new composite metric, named Tri-Hom, that considers all $3$ aspects and overcomes the limitations of conventional homophily metrics. The theoretical conclusions and the effectiveness of Tri-Hom have been verified through synthetic experiments on CSBM-3H. In addition, we conduct experiments on $31$ real-world benchmark datasets and calculate the correlations between homophily metrics and model performance. Tri-Hom has significantly higher correlation values than $17$ existing metrics that only focus on a single homophily aspect, demonstrating its superiority and the importance of homophily synergy.

      <title>"A network of mutualities of being": socio-material archaeological networks and biological ties at \c{C}atalh\"oy\"uk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in archaeogenomics have granted access to previously unavailable biological information with the potential to further our understanding of past social dynamics at a range of scales. However, to properly integrate these data within archaeological narratives, new methodological and theoretical tools are required. Effort must be put into finding new methods for weaving together different datasets where material culture and archaeogenomic data are both constitutive elements. This is true on a small scale, when we study relationships at the individual level, and at a larger scale when we deal with social and population dynamics. Specifically, in the study of kinship systems it is essential to contextualize and make sense of biological relatedness through social relations, which, in archaeology, is achieved by using material culture as a proxy. In this paper we propose a Network Science framework to integrate archaeogenomic data and material culture at an intrasite scale to study biological relatedness and social organization at the Neolithic site of \c{C}atalh\"oy\"uk. Methodologically, we propose the use of network variance to investigate the concentration of biological relatedness and material culture within networks of houses. This approach allowed us to observe how material culture similarity between buildings gives valuable information on potential biological relationships between individuals and how biogenetic ties concentrate at specific localities on site.</description>

      <title>Heterophily-Aware Graph Attention Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in graph representation learning. Unfortunately, current weight assignment schemes in standard GNNs, such as the calculation based on node degrees or pair-wise representations, can hardly be effective in processing the networks with heterophily, in which the connected nodes usually possess different labels or features. Existing heterophilic GNNs tend to ignore the modeling of heterophily of each edge, which is also a vital part in tackling the heterophily problem. In this paper, we firstly propose a heterophily-aware attention scheme and reveal the benefits of modeling the edge heterophily, i.e., if a GNN assigns different weights to edges according to different heterophilic types, it can learn effective local attention patterns, which enable nodes to acquire appropriate information from distinct neighbors. Then, we propose a novel Heterophily-Aware Graph Attention Network (HA-GAT) by fully exploring and utilizing the local distribution as the underlying heterophily, to handle the networks with different homophily ratios. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HA-GAT, we analyze the proposed heterophily-aware attention scheme and local distribution exploration, by seeking for an interpretation from their mechanism. Extensive results demonstrate that our HA-GAT achieves state-of-the-art performances on eight datasets with different homophily ratios in both the supervised and semi-supervised node classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Estimating True Beliefs in Opinion Dynamics with Social Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social networks often exert social pressure, causing individuals to adapt their expressed opinions to conform to their peers. An agent in such systems can be modeled as having a (true and unchanging) inherent belief while broadcasting a declared opinion at each time step based on her inherent belief and the past declared opinions of her neighbors. An important question in this setting is parameter estimation: how to disentangle the effects of social pressure to estimate inherent beliefs from declared opinions. This is useful for forecasting when agents' declared opinions are influenced by social pressure while real-world behavior only depends on their inherent beliefs. To address this, Jadbabaie et al. formulated the Interacting P\'olya Urn model of opinion dynamics under social pressure and studied it on complete-graph social networks using an aggregate estimator, and found that their estimator converges to the inherent beliefs unless majority pressure pushes the network to consensus.
  In this work, we studythis model on arbitrary networks, providing an estimator which converges to the inherent beliefs even in consensus situations. Finally, we bound the convergence rate of our estimator in both consensus and non-consensus scenarios; to get the bound for consensus scenarios (which converge slower than non-consensus) we additionally found how quickly the system converges to consensus.</description>
