      <title>RLC Parameters of a Two-Wire Line with the Finite Element Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This tutorial paper shows how to compute the DC (or low-frequency) resistance, inductance and capacitance of a pair of parallel wires using the finite element method. A three-dimensional infinite domain (open boundary) modeling of electrostatic and magnetostatic fields is presented, along with the electrokinetic formulation for the current flow inside the wires. The effects of the insulation and of a proposed physical defect in the wires are also considered. The open-source ONELAB software is used to perform the simulations and the code listing is provided. Comparisons using analytical models (when applicable) and the Altair Flux software are performed to help validate the simulations.</description>

      <title>A Level Set Method on Particle Flow Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Particle Flow Map Level Set (PFM-LS) method for high-fidelity interface tracking. We store level-set values, gradients, and Hessians on particles concentrated in a narrow band around the interface, advecting them via bidirectional flow maps while using a conventional grid-based representation elsewhere. By interpreting the level set value as a 3-form and its gradient as a 1-form, PFM-LS achieves exceptional geometric fidelity during complex deformations and preserves sub-grid features that traditional methods cannot capture. Our dual-timescale approach utilizes long-range maps for values and gradients, with frequent reinitialization of short-range maps for the distortion-sensitive Hessian, alongside adaptive particle control that maintains sufficient density within the narrow band. We also develop a hybrid particle-grid quasi-Newton redistancing scheme that preserves fine-scale features while enforcing the signed-distance property. Benchmark comparisons in 2D and 3D demonstrate that PFM-LS achieves state-of-the-art volume preservation and shape fidelity against a broad range of existing level-set methods.</description>

      <title>A volume penalization method for solving conjugate scalar transport with interfacial jump conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conjugate scalar transport with interfacial jump conditions on complex interfacial geometries is common in thermal and chemical processes, while its accurate and efficient simulations are still quite challenging. In the present study, a novel treatment of a two-phase interface in the volume penalization method, a kind of immersed boundary method, for solving conjugate scalar transport with general interfacial boundary conditions is developed. We first propose an interfacial treatment for solving an advection-diffusion equation with a Neumann boundary condition, and then extend it to general conjugate scalar transport with both interfacial flux and scalar jumps. A one-dimensional diffusion problem is solved to verify the present scheme and demonstrate the advantage of the present scheme in improving accuracy and unifying the governing equations in the two phases with an additional source term representing the local jump condition of the interfacial scalar flux. Then, the present scheme is further applied to fluid-solid coupled scalar diffusion and advection-diffusion problems with the scalar and its flux jumps across the interface. The simulation results of the present scheme generally show good agreement with reference results obtained by body-fitted mesh simulations with average relative deviations less than 3.0%.</description>

      <title>Shallow-KAN Based Solution of Moving Boundary PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) require significantly smaller architectures compared to multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based approaches, while retaining expressive power through spline-based activations. We propose a shallow KAN framework that directly approximates the temperature distribution T(x,t) and the moving interface $\Gamma(t)$, enforcing the governing PDEs, phase equilibrium, and Stefan condition through physics-informed residuals. To enhance accuracy, we employ interface-focused collocation resampling. Numerical experiments in one and two dimensions show that the framework achieves accurate reconstructions of both temperature fields and interface dynamics, highlighting the potential of KANs as a compact and efficient alternative for moving boundary PDEs. First, we validate the model with semi-infinite analytical solutions. Subsequently, the model is extended to 2D using a level-set based formulation for interface propagation, which is solved within the KAN framework. This work demonstrates that KANs are capable of solving complex moving boundary problems without the need for measurement data.</description>

      <title>Variable coherence model for free-electron laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the variable coherence model (VCM) for simulating free-electron laser (FEL) pulses generated through self-amplified spontaneous emission. Building on the established partial coherence model of [T. Pfeifer et. al, Opt. Lett. 35, 3441 (2010)], we demonstrate that the implementation of a variable coherence width allows for continuous control over the pulses' characteristic noise, while keeping the average pulse parameters such as the bandwidth fixed. We demonstrate this through systematic statistical analyses of the intensity and number of sub-pulses in VCM pulses, in both time and frequency. In particular, we analyze how the sub-pulse statistics are affected by the coherence width parameter. We perform our analyses across three distinct regimes of FEL parameters and demonstrate how the VCM can generate pulses that range from maximally random to fully coherent. Finally, we illustrate the effect of the VCM variable coherence width on an absorption simulation.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure theory of H$_{3}$S: Plane-wave-like valence states, density-of-states peak and its guaranteed proximity to the Fermi level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity in sulfur superhydride H$_{3}$S under extreme pressures has been explained theoretically, but it requires a peaked concentration of the electronic density of states (DOS), which has been found in first-principles calculations. The mechanism of this peak formation, though vital for its high transition temperature, has however remained obscure. We address this problem through detailed analysis of the first-principles electronic wave functions. The valence wave functions are shown to be significantly plane-wave-like. From the Fourier-mode analysis of the self-consistent potential and atomic pseudopotentials, we extract the nearly uniform models that accurately reproduce the first-principles band structure with very few parameters. The DOS peak is shown to be the consequence of the hybridization of specific plane waves. Adjacency of Jones' large zone to the plane-wave spherical Fermi surface is posited to be the root cause of the multiple plane-wave hybridization, the DOS peak formation and its proximity to the Fermi level. The present theory resolves the minimal modeling problem of electronic states in H$_{3}$S, as well as establishes a mechanism that may help to boost the transition temperatures in pressure induced superconductors.</description>

      <title>Computing Statistical Properties of Velocity Fields on Current Quantum Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms are gaining attention in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for their favorable scaling, as encoding physical fields into quantum probability amplitudes enables representation of two to the power of n spatial points with only n qubits. A key challenge in Quantum CFD is the efficient readout of simulation results, a topic that has received limited attention in literature. This work presents methods to extract statistical properties of spatial velocity fields, such as central moments and structure functions, directly from parameterized ansatz circuits, avoiding full quantum state tomography. As a proof of concept, we implement our approach for 1D velocity fields, encoding 16 spatial points with 4 qubits, and analyze both a sine wave signal and four snapshots from Burgers' equation evolution. Using Qedma's error mitigation software QESEM, we demonstrate that such computations achieve high accuracy on current quantum devices, specifically IBMQ's Heron2 system ibm_fez.</description>

      <title>Discrete versus continuous -- lattice models and their exact continuous counterparts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review and study the correspondence between discrete lattice/chain models of interacting particles and their continuous counterparts represented by partial differential equations. We study the correspondence problem for nearest neighbour interaction lattice models as well as for multiple-neighbour interaction lattice models, and we gradually proceed from infinite lattices to periodic lattices and finally to finite lattices with fixed ends/zero Dirichlet boundary conditions. The whole study is framed as systematic specialisation of Fourier analysis tools from the continuous to the discrete setting and vice versa, and the correspondence between the discrete and continuous models is examined primarily with regard to the dispersion relation.</description>

      <title>Volume penalization method for simulating flows around a rotating solid with multiple reference frame and sliding mesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the significant role of turbomachinery in fluid-based energy transfer, precise simulation of rotating solid objects with complex geometry is a challenging task. In the present study, the volume penalization method (VPM) is combined with multiple reference frame (MRF) and sliding mesh (SLM), respectively, so as to develop immersed-boundary approaches for simulating flows around a rotating solid. The level-set function is adopted to represent arbitrary geometries embedded in Cartesian grids. The VPM body-forcing terms in the momentum equation are proposed for MRF and SLM, respectively, so as to build unified governing equations for both fluid and solid regions. The flows around a rotating cuboid under various rotating speeds are simulated by the present schemes, namely, VPM with MRF, and VPM with SLM, and compared to corresponding simulations by the body-fitted method (BFM). The results suggest the relative deviations of predicted pressure drop and torque between the present VPM and BFM are around 5%, demonstrating the validity of the present VPM.</description>

      <title>The transformation mechanisms among cuboctahedra, Ino's decahedra and icosahedra structures of magic-size gold nanoclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gold nanoclusters possess multiple competing structural motifs with small energy differences, enabling structural coexistence and interconversion. Using a high-accuracy machine learned potential trained on some 20'000 density functional theory reference data points, we investigate transformation pathways connecting both high-symmetry and amorphous cuboctahedra, Ino's decahedra and icosahedra for Au55, Au147, Au309 and Au561 nanoclusters. Our saddle point searches reveal that high-symmetry transformations from cuboctahedra and Ino's decahedra to icosahedra proceed through a single barrier and represent soft-mode-driven jitterbug-type and slip-dislocation motions. In addition, we identify lower-barrier asymmetric transformation pathways that drive the system into disordered, Jahn-Teller-stabilized amorphous icosahedra. Minima Hopping sampling further uncovers, in this context, many such low-symmetry minima. Some of the newly identified global minima for Au309 and Au561 have energies that are up to 2.8 eV lower than the previously reported global minima. Hence, both the shapes and the transformation pathways studied in previous investigations are not the physically relevant ones. In contrast to the previously studied pathways, our transformation pathways give reasonable transformation times that are in rough agreement with experiments.</description>

      <title>Stable Differentiable Modal Synthesis for Learning Nonlinear Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modal methods are a long-standing approach to physical modelling synthesis. Extensions to nonlinear problems are possible, including the case of a high-amplitude vibration of a string. A modal decomposition leads to a densely coupled nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations. Recent work in scalar auxiliary variable techniques has enabled construction of explicit and stable numerical solvers for such classes of nonlinear systems. On the other hand, machine learning approaches (in particular neural ordinary differential equations) have been successful in modelling nonlinear systems automatically from data. In this work, we examine how scalar auxiliary variable techniques can be combined with neural ordinary differential equations to yield a stable differentiable model capable of learning nonlinear dynamics. The proposed approach leverages the analytical solution for linear vibration of system's modes so that physical parameters of a system remain easily accessible after the training without the need for a parameter encoder in the model architecture. As a proof of concept, we generate synthetic data for the nonlinear transverse vibration of a string and show that the model can be trained to reproduce the nonlinear dynamics of the system. Sound examples are presented.</description>

      <title>Chebyshev Accelerated Subspsace Eigensolver for Pseudo-hermitian Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying the optoelectronic structure of materials can require the computation of up to several thousands of the smallest eigenpairs of a pseudo-hermitian Hamiltonian. Iterative eigensolvers may be preferred over direct methods for this task since their complexity is a function of the desired fraction of the spectrum. In addition, they generally rely on highly optimized and scalable kernels such as matrix-vector multiplications that leverage the massive parallelism and the computational power of modern exascale systems. \textit{Chebyshev Accelerated Subspace iteration Eigensolver} (ChASE) is able to compute several thousands of the most extreme eigenpairs of dense hermitian matrices with proven scalability over massive parallel accelerated clusters. This work presents an extension of ChASE to solve for a portion of the spectrum of pseudo-hermitian Hamiltonians as they appear in the treatment of excitonic materials. The new pseudo-hermitian solver achieves similar convergence and performance as the hermitian one. By exploiting the numerical structure and spectral properties of the Hamiltonian matrix, we propose an oblique variant of Rayleigh-Ritz projection featuring quadratic convergence of the Ritz-values with no explicit construction of the dual basis set. Additionally, we introduce a parallel implementation of the recursive matrix-product operation appearing in the Chebyshev filter with limited amount of global communications. Our development is supported by a full numerical analysis and experimental tests.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{H}$-HIGNN: A Scalable Graph Neural Network Framework with Hierarchical Matrix Acceleration for Simulation of Large-Scale Particulate Suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a fast and scalable framework, leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) and hierarchical matrix ($\mathcal{H}$-matrix) techniques, for simulating large-scale particulate suspensions, which have broader impacts across science and engineering. The framework draws on the Hydrodynamic Interaction Graph Neural Network (HIGNN) that employs GNNs to model the mobility tensor governing particle motion under hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) and external forces. HIGNN offers several advantages: it effectively captures both short- and long-range HIs and their many-body nature; it realizes a substantial speedup over traditional methodologies, by requiring only a forward pass through its neural networks at each time step; it provides explainability beyond black-box neural network models, through direct correspondence between graph connectivity and physical interactions; and it demonstrates transferability across different systems, irrespective of particles' number, concentration, configuration, or external forces. While HIGNN provides significant speedup, the quadratic scaling of its overall prediction cost (with respect to the total number of particles), due to intrinsically slow-decaying two-body HIs, limits its scalability. To achieve superior efficiency across all scales, in the present work we integrate $\mathcal{H}$-matrix techniques into HIGNN, reducing the prediction cost scaling to quasi-linear. Through comprehensive evaluations, we validate $\mathcal{H}$-HIGNN's accuracy, and demonstrate its quasi-linear scalability and superior computational efficiency. It requires only minimal computing resources; for example, a single mid-range GPU is sufficient for a system containing 10 million particles. Finally, we demonstrate $\mathcal{H}$-HIGNN's ability to efficiently simulate practically relevant large-scale suspensions of both particles and flexible filaments.</description>

Abstract: We present a new method that efficiently solves TO problems and provides a practical pathway to leverage quantum computing to exploit potential quantum advantages. This work targets on large-scale, multi-material TO challenges for three-dimensional (3D) continuum structures, beyond what have been addressed in prior studies. Central to this new method is the modified Dantzig-Wolfe (MDW) decomposition, which effectively mitigates the escalating computational cost associated with using classical Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solvers to solve the master problems involved in TO, by decomposing the MILP into local and global sub-problems. Evaluated on 3D bridge designs, our classical implementation achieves comparable solution quality to state-of-the-art TO methods while reducing computation time by orders of magnitude. It also maintains low runtimes even in extreme cases where classical MILP solvers fail to converge, such as designs involving over 50 million variables. The computationally intensive local sub-problems, which are essentially Binary Integer Programming (BIP) problems, can potentially be accelerated by quantum computing via their equivalent Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations. Enabled by the MDW decomposition, the resulting QUBO formulation requires only sparse qubit connectivity and incurs a QUBO construction cost that scales linearly with problem size, potentially accelerating BIP sub-problem solutions by an additional order of magnitude. All observed and estimated speedups become increasingly significant with larger problem sizes and when moving from single-material to multi-material designs. This suggests that this new method, along with quantum computing, will play an increasingly valuable role in addressing the scale and complexity of real-world TO applications.</description>

      <title>Bridging Quantum Mechanics to Organic Liquid Properties via a Universal Force Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08575v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are essential tools for unraveling atomistic insights into the structure and dynamics of condensed-phase systems. However, the universal and accurate prediction of macroscopic properties from ab initio calculations remains a significant challenge, often hindered by the trade-off between computational cost and simulation accuracy. Here, we present ByteFF-Pol, a graph neural network (GNN)-parameterized polarizable force field, trained exclusively on high-level quantum mechanics (QM) data. Leveraging physically-motivated force field forms and training strategies, ByteFF-Pol exhibits exceptional performance in predicting thermodynamic and transport properties for a wide range of small-molecule liquids and electrolytes, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) classical and machine learning force fields. The zero-shot prediction capability of ByteFF-Pol bridges the gap between microscopic QM calculations and macroscopic liquid properties, enabling the exploration of previously intractable chemical spaces. This advancement holds transformative potential for applications such as electrolyte design and custom-tailored solvent, representing a pivotal step toward data-driven materials discovery.</description>

      <title>A reduced-order derivative-informed neural operator for subsurface fluid-flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as cost-effective surrogates for expensive fluid-flow simulators, particularly in computationally intensive tasks such as permeability inversion from time-lapse seismic data, and uncertainty quantification. In these applications, the fidelity of the surrogate's gradients with respect to system parameters is crucial, as the accuracy of downstream tasks, such as optimization and Bayesian inference, relies directly on the quality of the derivative information. Recent advances in physics-informed methods have leveraged derivative information to improve surrogate accuracy. However, incorporating explicit Jacobians can become computationally prohibitive, as the complexity typically scales quadratically with the number of input parameters. To address this limitation, we propose DeFINO (Derivative-based Fisher-score Informed Neural Operator), a reduced-order, derivative-informed training framework. DeFINO integrates Fourier neural operators (FNOs) with a novel derivative-based training strategy guided by the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). By projecting Jacobians onto dominant eigen-directions identified by the FIM, DeFINO captures critical sensitivity information directly informed by observational data, significantly reducing computational expense. We validate DeFINO through synthetic experiments in the context of subsurface multi-phase fluid-flow, demonstrating improvements in gradient accuracy while maintaining robust forward predictions of underlying fluid dynamics. These results highlight DeFINO's potential to offer practical, scalable solutions for inversion problems in complex real-world scenarios, all at substantially reduced computational cost.</description>

      <title>Patch-MLP-Based Predictive Control: Simulation of Upstream Pointing Stabilization for PHELIX Laser System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-energy laser facilities such as PHELIX at GSI require excellent beam pointing stability for reproducibility and relative independence for future experiments. Beam pointing stability has been traditionally achieved using simple proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control which removes the problem of slow drift, but is limited because of the time delay in knowing the diagnosis and the inertia in the mechanical system associated with mirrors. In this work, we introduce a predictive control strategy where the forecasting of beam pointing errors is performed by a patch-based multilayer perceptron (Patch-MLP) designed to capture local temporal patterns for more robust short-term jitter prediction. The subsequent conversion of these predicted errors into correction signals is handled by a PID controller. The neural network has been trained on diagnostic time-series data to predict beam pointing error. Using the feed-forward controller compensates for system delays. Simulations with a correction mirror placed upstream of the PHELIX pre-amplifier bridge confirm that the predictive control scheme reduces residual jitter compared to conventional PID control. Over a 10-hour dataset the controller maintained stable performance without drift, while standard pointing metrics showed consistent improvements of the order of 10 to 20 percent. The predictive controller operates without drift, and therefore may improve reproducibility and operational efficiency in high energy, low repetition rate laser experiment conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.02548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, wave propagation in structured media with quasiperiodic patterns is investigated. We propose a methodology based on Sturmian sequences for the generation of structured mechanical systems from a given parameter. The approach is presented in a general form so that it can be applied to waveguides of different nature, as long as they can be modeled with the transfer matrix method. The bulk spectrum is obtained and its fractal nature analyzed. For validation of the theoretical results, three numerical examples are presented. The obtained bulk spectra show different shapes for the studied examples, but they share features which can be explained from the proposed theoretical setting.</description>

      <title>An information-matching approach to optimal experimental design and active learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02740v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficacy of mathematical models heavily depends on the quality of the training data, yet collecting sufficient data is often expensive and challenging. Many modeling applications require inferring parameters only as a means to predict other quantities of interest (QoI). Because models often contain many unidentifiable (sloppy) parameters, QoIs often depend on a relatively small number of parameter combinations. Therefore, we introduce an information-matching criterion based on the Fisher Information Matrix to select the most informative training data from a candidate pool. This method ensures that the selected data contain sufficient information to learn only those parameters that are needed to constrain downstream QoIs. It is formulated as a convex optimization problem, making it scalable to large models and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various modeling problems in diverse scientific fields, including power systems and underwater acoustics. Finally, we use information-matching as a query function within an Active Learning loop for material science applications. In all these applications, we find that a relatively small set of optimal training data can provide the necessary information for achieving precise predictions. These results are encouraging for diverse future applications, particularly active learning in large machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Predicting the suitability of photocatalysts for water splitting using Koopmans spectral functionals: The case of TiO$_2$ polymorphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photocatalytic water splitting has attracted considerable attention for renewable energy production. Since the first reported photocatalytic water splitting by titanium dioxide, this material remains one of the most promising photocatalysts, due to its suitable band gap and band-edge positions. However, predicting both of these properties is a challenging task for existing computational methods. Here we show how Koopmans spectral functionals can accurately predict the band structure and level alignment of rutile, anatase, and brookite TiO$_2$ using a computationally efficient workflow that only requires (a) a DFT calculation of the photocatalyst/vacuum interface and (b) a Koopmans spectral functional calculation of the bulk photocatalyst. The success of this approach for TiO$_2$ suggests that this strategy could be deployed for assessing the suitability of novel photocatalyst candidates.</description>

      <title>Correlation function metrology for warm dense matter: Recent developments and practical guidelines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) has emerged as a valuable diagnostic for matter under extreme conditions, as it captures the intricate many-body physics of the probed sample. Recent advances, such as the model-free temperature diagnostic of Dornheim et al. [Nat.Commun. 13, 7911 (2022)], have demonstrated how much information can be extracted directly within the imaginary-time formalism. However, since the imaginary-time formalism is a concept often difficult to grasp, we provide here a systematic overview of its theoretical foundations and explicitly demonstrate its practical applications to temperature inference, including relevant subtleties. Furthermore, we present recent developments that enable the determination of the absolute normalization, Rayleigh weight, and density from XRTS measurements without reliance on uncontrolled model assumptions. Finally, we outline a unified workflow that guides the extraction of these key observables, offering a practical framework for applying the method to interpret experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Constrained dynamics for searching saddle points on general Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding constrained saddle points on Riemannian manifolds is significant for analyzing energy landscapes arising in physics and chemistry. Existing works have been limited to special manifolds that admit global regular level-set representations, excluding applications such as electronic excited-state calculations. In this paper, we develop a constrained saddle dynamics applicable to smooth functions on general Riemannian manifolds. Our dynamics is formulated compactly over the Grassmann bundle of the tangent bundle. By analyzing the Grassmann bundle geometry, we achieve universality via incorporating the second fundamental form, which captures variations of tangent spaces along the trajectory. We rigorously establish the local linear stability of the dynamics and the local linear convergence of the resulting algorithms. Remarkably, our analysis provides the first convergence guarantees for discretized saddle-search algorithms in manifold settings. Moreover, by respecting the intrinsic quotient structure, we remove unnecessary nondegeneracy assumptions on the eigenvalues of the Riemannian Hessian that are present in existing works. We also point out that locating saddle points can be more ill-conditioning than finding local minimizers, and requires using nonredundant parametrizations. Finally, numerical experiments on linear eigenvalue problems and electronic excited-state calculations showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and corroborate the established local theory.</description>

      <title>Discrete Solution Operator Learning for Geometry-Dependent PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural operator learning accelerates PDE solution by approximating operators as mappings between continuous function spaces. Yet in many engineering settings, varying geometry induces discrete structural changes, including topological changes, abrupt changes in boundary conditions or boundary types, and changes in the computational domain, which break the smooth-variation premise. Here we introduce Discrete Solution Operator Learning (DiSOL), a complementary paradigm that learns discrete solution procedures rather than continuous function-space operators. DiSOL factorizes the solver into learnable stages that mirror classical discretizations: local contribution encoding, multiscale assembly, and implicit solution reconstruction on an embedded grid, thereby preserving procedure-level consistency while adapting to geometry-dependent discrete structures. Across geometry-dependent Poisson, advection-diffusion, linear elasticity, as well as spatiotemporal heat conduction problems, DiSOL produces stable and accurate predictions under both in-distribution and strongly out-of-distribution geometries, including discontinuous boundaries and topological changes. These results highlight the need for procedural operator representations in geometry-dominated problems and position discrete solution operator learning as a distinct, complementary direction in scientific machine learning.</description>
