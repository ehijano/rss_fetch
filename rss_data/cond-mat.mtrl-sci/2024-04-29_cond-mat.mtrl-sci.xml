      <title>Physically recurrent neural network for rate and path-dependent heterogeneous materials in a finite strain framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a hybrid physics-based data-driven surrogate model for the microscale analysis of heterogeneous material is investigated. The proposed model benefits from the physics-based knowledge contained in the constitutive models used in the full-order micromodel by embedding them in a neural network. Following previous developments, this paper extends the applicability of the physically recurrent neural network (PRNN) by introducing an architecture suitable for rate-dependent materials in a finite strain framework. In this model, the homogenized deformation gradient of the micromodel is encoded into a set of deformation gradients serving as input to the embedded constitutive models. These constitutive models compute stresses, which are combined in a decoder to predict the homogenized stress, such that the internal variables of the history-dependent constitutive models naturally provide physics-based memory for the network. To demonstrate the capabilities of the surrogate model, we consider a unidirectional composite micromodel with transversely isotropic elastic fibers and elasto-viscoplastic matrix material. The extrapolation properties of the surrogate model trained to replace such micromodel are tested on loading scenarios unseen during training, ranging from different strain-rates to cyclic loading and relaxation. Speed-ups of three orders of magnitude with respect to the runtime of the original micromodel are obtained.</description>

      <title>Equivariant graph convolutional neural networks for the representation of homogenized anisotropic microstructural mechanical response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composite materials with different microstructural material symmetries are common in engineering applications where grain structure, alloying and particle/fiber packing are optimized via controlled manufacturing. In fact these microstructural tunings can be done throughout a part to achieve functional gradation and optimization at a structural level. To predict the performance of particular microstructural configuration and thereby overall performance, constitutive models of materials with microstructure are needed.
  In this work we provide neural network architectures that provide effective homogenization models of materials with anisotropic components. These models satisfy equivariance and material symmetry principles inherently through a combination of equivariant and tensor basis operations. We demonstrate them on datasets of stochastic volume elements with different textures and phases where the material undergoes elastic and plastic deformation, and show that the these network architectures provide significant performance improvements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current condensed matter research is centered on advanced materials and their distinctive features. The interest in Quantum materials (QMs) continues to increase without any decrease due to their novel phenomenon and potential as platforms for revolutionary new technologies in modern science and technology. This article emphasizes the exploration of diverse devices and applications facilitated by the unique properties of QMs. Encompassing fields like quantum computing, metrology, sensing, energy, and communication, the review highlights their transformative potential. In QMs, the emerging phenomena are governed by quantum confinement, strong electronic correlations, topology, and symmetry, which makes these materials apart, making them exceptional in their own regard. This paper emphasizes their unique properties, different types of QMs, various interdisciplinary applications, and integration with existing technologies. This study provides a concise overview of diverse discoveries and advancements, presenting a prospective outlook on QMs in multiple domains.</description>

      <title>Large spontaneous valley polarization and anomalous valley Hall effect in antiferromagnetic monolayer $\mathrm{Fe_2CF_2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superior to ferromagnetic (FM) materials, antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials do not have any net magnetic moment and are robust to external magnetic perturbation with ultra-high dynamic speed. To achieve spontaneous valley polarization and anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE) in AFM materials is of great significance for potential applications in spintronics and valleytronics. Here, we predict an A-type AFM monolayer $\mathrm{Fe_2CF_2}$ with large spontaneous valley polarization. Monolayer $\mathrm{Fe_2CF_2}$ has zero Berry curvature in momentum space but non-zero layer-locked hidden Berry curvature in real space, which provides the basic conditions for the realization of AVHE. Because $\mathrm{Fe_2CF_2}$ possesses the combined symmetry ($PT$ symmetry) of spatial inversion ($P$) and time reversal ($T$) symmetry, the spin is degenerate, which prevents the AVHE. An out-of-plane external electric field can be used to produce spin splitting due to the introduction of layer-dependent electrostatic potential, and then layer-locked AVHE can be realized in $\mathrm{Fe_2CF_2}$. Moreover, the spin order of spin splitting can be reversed, when the direction of electric field is reversed. It is proved that the AVHE can be achieved in Janus $\mathrm{Fe_2CFCl}$ without external electric field due to intrinsic built-in electric field. Our works provide an AFM monolayer with excellent properties to realize AVHE.</description>

      <title>Temperature and excitation energy dependence of Raman scattering in nodal line Dirac semimetal ZrAs_{2}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Raman study of ZrAs_{2} single crystals, a nodal line semimetal with symmetry-enforced Dirac-like band crossings. We identified the symmetry of phonon modes by polarized light measurements and comparison with calculated phonon frequencies. Significant dependence of peak intensities on the excitation wavelength was observed, indicating quantum interference effects. Phonon peaks in the spectra are superimposed on the electronic background, with quasi-elastic scattering observed for the 785 nm excitation. We identified the Fano shape of the 171 cm^{-1} Ag mode due to interference of the phonon state with the electronic continuum. The temperature dependence of phonon peaks linewidth indicates that the electron-phonon coupling plays an essential role in phonon decay.</description>

      <title>Single crystal growth, chemical defects, magnetic and transport properties of antiferromagnetic topological insulators (Ge$_{1-\delta-x}$Mn$_x$)$_2$Bi$_2$Te$_5$ ($x\leq 0.47$, $0.11 \leq \delta \leq 0.20$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic topological insulators provide a platform for emergent phenomena arising from the interplay between magnetism and band topology. Here we report the single crystal growth, crystal structure, magnetic and transport properties, as well as the neutron scattering studies of topological insulator series (Ge$_{1-\delta-x}$Mn$_x$)$_2$Bi$_2$Te$_5$ ($x\leq 0.47$, $0.11 \leq \delta \leq 0.20$). Upon doping up to $x = 0.47$, the lattice parameter $c$ decreases by 0.8\%, while the lattice parameter $a$ remains nearly unchanged. Significant Ge vacancies and Ge/Bi site mixing are revealed via elemental analysis as well as refinements of the neutron and X-ray diffraction data, resulting in holes dominating the charge transport. At $x = 0.47$, below 10.8 K, a bilayer A-type antiferromagnetic ordered state emerges, featuring an ordered moment of 3.0(3) $\mu_{B}$/Mn at 5 K, with the $c$ axis as the easy axis. Magnetization data unveil a much stronger interlayer antiferromagnetic exchange interaction and a much smaller uniaxial anisotropy compared to MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$. We attribute the former to the shorter superexchange path and the latter to the smaller ligand-field splitting in (Ge$_{1-\delta-x}$Mn$_x$)$_2$Bi$_2$Te$_5$. Our study demonstrates that this series of materials holds promise for the investigation of the Layer Hall effect and quantum metric nonlinear Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Radial distribution and its spherical harmonics expansion in liquid CO2 at 250 K and 50 bar based on pressure-constant Monte Carlo simulation using Kihara Potential Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to compute the radial distribution function of liquid CO2 at 250 K and 50 bar and its expansion coefficients by spherical harmonics as a function of intermolecular distance up to 20 angstroms for all possible combinations of angular indices l, l prime, and m less than or equal to 8, in contrast to past works of limited combinations. The positions and orientations of CO2 molecules were determined by pressure-constant Monte Carlo simulation using a Kihara potential model. It was found that the radial distribution function had an intense peak at 4.05 angstroms and a broad band at around 7.85 angstroms. The expansion coefficients had prominent structures below approximately 7.5 angstroms, showing positive and/or negative peaks, which indicated that the orientational correlations of the central molecule were intense with the molecules present in that region. It was also found that the peaks of some expansion coefficients were not small even when l = 8. The implication of the values of the expansion coefficients as well as their positive/negative peaks, relating to orientational correlation, are yet to be investigated further.</description>

      <title>Localized State-Induced Enhanced Emission in Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The luminescent mechanism of nano-sized materials with indirect bandgap and parity-forbidden transition has always been a critical issue in breaking through bottlenecks in traditional luminescent materials. The lack of understanding has resulted in great disputes regarding the origin of fluorescence in weak-transition nanocrystals (NCs). This paper proposes a new physical luminescence model, named as localized state-induced enhanced emission (LIEE), i.e., localized processes induced by size-limitation or partial doping, to explain the anomalous luminescence from non-luminescent state to luminescent state in various perovskite nanocrystals with indirect/direct bandgap or parity-forbidden transition. These findings provide a theoretical viewpoint to design efficient lead-free perovskite NCs and promote the development of fast optical transitions in luminescent materials.</description>

      <title>Influence of chemical substitution and sintering temperature on the structural, magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of La1-xSrxMn1-yFeyO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of sintering temperature (Ts) and chemical substitution on the structural and magnetic properties of manganite compounds La1-xSrxMn1-yFeyO3 (0.025 &lt;= x &lt;= 0.7; y= 0.01,0.15) are explored in a search to optimize their magnetocaloric properties around room temperature. A ferromagnetic (FM) to paramagnetic (PM) phase transition is observed at a Curie temperature Tc that can be controlled to approach room temperature by Sr and Fe substitution, but also by adjusting the sintering temperature Ts. Accordingly, the magnetic entropy change (-DSM) quantifying the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) presents a peak at or close to Tc that shifts and broadens with both Sr and Fe doping and is further tuned with sintering temperature. Altogether, we show that it is possible to adjust the strength and dominance of the ferromagnetic coupling in these ceramics, but also using disorder as a tool to broaden and adjust the temperature range with significant magnetic entropy change.</description>

      <title>Mapping electron beam-induced radiolytic damage in molecular crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every electron crystallography experiment is fundamentally limited by radiation damage. Nevertheless, little is known about the onset and progression of radiolysis in beam-sensitive molecular crystals. Here we apply ambient-temperature scanning nanobeam electron diffraction to record simultaneous dual-space snapshots of organic and organometallic nanocrystals at sequential stages of beam-induced radiolytic decay. We show that the underlying mosaic of coherently diffracting zones (CDZs) continuously undergoes spatial reorientation as a function of accumulating electron exposure, causing the intensities of many Bragg reflections to fade nonmonotonically. Furthermore, we demonstrate that repeated irradiation at a single probe position leads to the concentric propagation of delocalized radiolytic damage well beyond the initial point of impact. These results sharpen our understanding of molecular crystals as conglomerates of CDZs whose complex lattice structure deteriorates through a series of dynamic internal changes during exposure to ionizing radiation.</description>

      <title>Deformability, inherent mechanical properties and chemical bonding of Al11Nd3 in Al-Nd target material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microstructure uniformity of the Al-Nd target materials with Al11Nd3 significantly affects the performance of the fabricated film, which is widely used as wiring material in largesize thin-film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) panels. Understanding the inherent mechanical properties and chemical bonds of Al11Nd3 is crucial for homogenizing the Al-Nd target. Here, by a combined experimental and ab-initio theoretical study, the microstructure and deformability of the Al-3wt%Nd alloy and the inherent mechanical properties and chemical bonds of Al11Nd3 are investigated comprehensively. The Al-3wt%Nd alloy is composed of the pre-eutectic {\alpha}-Al matrix and the eutectic {\alpha}-Al and a high stable {\alpha}-Al11Nd3 phases. During the plastic deformation, the eutectic microstructure transforms from a cellular to a lamellar shape, while the morphology and dimension of {\alpha}-Al11Nd3 are not changed significantly. By examining ideal tensile strength, elastic moduli, hardness and brittleness-ductility, the hardnessbrittleness of {\alpha}-Al11Nd3 is quantitatively evaluated, accounting for its difficulties of plastic deformation and fragmentation. Combining band structure, population analysis, topological analysis and crystal orbital Hamilton population, it is revealed that {\alpha}-Al11Nd3 possesses two types of chemical bonds: the Nd-Al and Al-Al bonds. The former is a typical ionic bond with electron transfer from Nd to Al, while the latter, dominated by both 3s-3p and 3p-3p interactions, is a weak covalent bond. The mixed chemical bond is responsible for the high hardness-brittleness of {\alpha}-Al11Nd3. This work is expected to lay a foundation for Al-Nd alloy and catalyze the fabrication of high-quality Al-Nd target materials.</description>

      <title>Enhanced torque efficiency in ferromagnetic multilayers by introducing naturally oxidized Cu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit torque (SOT) in the heavy elements with a large spin-orbit coupling (SOC) has been frequently used to manipulate the magnetic states in spintronic devices. Recent theoretical works have predicted that the surface oxidized light elements with a negligible SOC can yield a sizable orbital torque (OT), which plays an important role in switching the magnetization. Here, we report anomalous-Hall-resistance and harmonic-Hall-voltage measurements on perpendicularly magnetized Ta/Cu/[Ni/Co]$_5$/Cu-CuO$_x$ multilayers. Both torque efficiency and spin-Hall angle of these multilayers are largely enhanced by introducing a naturally oxidized Cu-CuO$_x$ layer, where the SOC is negligible. Such an enhancement is mainly due to the collaborative driven of the SOT from the Ta layer and the OT from the Cu/CuO$_x$ interface, and can be tuned by controlling the thickness of Cu-CuO$_x$ layer. Compared to the Cu-CuO$_x$-free multilayers, the maximum torque efficiency and spin-Hall angle were enhanced by a factor of ten, larger than most of the reported values in the other heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Fast \textit{ab initio} design of high-entropy magnetic thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the magnetic properties of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) can be captured by \textit{ab initio} calculations within the coherent potential approximation, where the atomic details of the high-entropy mixing are considered as an effective medium that possesses the translational symmetry of the lattice. This is demonstrated using the face-centered cubic (FCC) phase of $\textrm{FeCoNiMnCu}$ and the $L1_0$ phase of $\textrm{(FeCoNiMnCu)Pt}$ by comparing the density functional theory (DFT) results with the experimental values. Working within the first Brillouin zone and the primitive unit cell, we show that DFT can capture the smooth profile of magnetic properties such as the saturation magnetization, the Curie temperature and the magnetic anisotropy, using only a sparse set of sampling points in the vast compositional space. The smooth profiles given by DFT indeed follow the experimental trend, demonstrating the promising potential of using machine learning to explore the magnetic properties of HEAs, by establishing reasonably large datasets with high-throughput calculations using density-functional theory.</description>

      <title>Quantized Born Effective charges as probes for the topological phase transition in the Haldane and Kane-Mele models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to study the transition between different topological states, based on the assessment of the vibrational resonances in infrared spectra. We consider the Haldane and Kane-Mele models finding that Born effective charges are nearly quantized, with a discontinuous jump concomitant with the topological phase transition. In particular, Born effective charges display a finite value in the trivial phase and a null one in the nontrivial one. This is rooted in the connection between Born effective charges and electronic Berry curvature at the band edges.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Phonon in Charge-Density-Wave Phase of Kagome Metal CsV3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CsV3Sb5, a notable compound within the kagome family, is renowned for its topological and superconducting properties, as well as its detection of local magnetic field and anomalous Hall effect in experiments. However, the origin of this local magnetic field is still veiled. In this study, we employ the first-principles calculations to investigate the atomic vibration in both the pristine and the charge-density-wave phases of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. Our analysis reveals the presence of ``anomalous phonons" in these structures, these phonon induce the circular vibration of atoms, contributing to the phonon magnetic moments and subsequently to the observed the local magnetic fields. Additionally, we observe that lattice distortion in the charge-density-wave phase amplifies these circular vibrations, resulting in a stronger local magnetic field, particularly from the vanadium atoms. This investigation not only reveals the potential relation between lattice distortion and atomic polarization but also offers a novel idea to understand the origin of local magnetic moment in CsV3Sb5.</description>

Abstract: The interaction of atomic orbitals at the interface of perovskite oxide heterostructures has been investigated for its profound impact on the band structures and electronic properties, giving rise to unique electronic states and a variety of tunable functionalities. In this study, we conducted an extensive investigation of the optical and electronic properties of epitaxial NdNiO3 thin films grown on a series of single crystal substrates. Unlike films synthesized on other substrates, NdNiO3 on SrTiO3 (NNO/STO) gives rise to a unique band structure which features an additional unoccupied band situated above the Fermi level. Our comprehensive investigation, which incorporated a wide array of experimental techniques and density functional theory calculations, revealed that the emergence of the interfacial band structure is primarily driven by the orbital hybridization between Ti 3d orbitals of the STO substrate and O 2p orbitals of the NNO thin film. Furthermore, exciton peaks have been detected in the optical spectra of the NNO/STO film, attributable to the pronounced electron-electron (e-e) and electron-hole (e-h) interactions propagating from the STO substrate into the NNO film. These findings underscore the substantial influence of interfacial orbital hybridization on the electronic structure of oxide thin-films, thereby offering key insights into tuning their interfacial properties.</description>

      <title>Orbital selective commensurate modulations of the local density of states in ScV6Sn6 probed by nuclear spins</title>

Abstract: The Kagome network is a unique platform in solid state physics that harbors a diversity of special electronic states due to its inherent band structure features comprising Dirac cones, van-Hove singularities, and flat bands. Some Kagome-based non-magnetic metals have recently been found to exhibit favorable properties, including unconventional superconductivity, charge density waves (CDW), switchable chiral transport, and signatures of an anomalous Hall effect (AHE). The Kagome metal ScV6Sn6 is another promising candidate for studying the emergence of an unconventional CDW and accompanying effects. We use 51V nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to study the local properties of the CDW phase in single crystalline ScV6Sn6, aided by density functional theory (DFT). We trace the dynamics of the local magnetic field during the CDW phase transition and determine a loss in the density of states (DOS) by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$, in excellent agreement with DFT. The local charge symmetry of the V surrounding in the CDW phase reflects the commensurate modulation of the charge density with wave vector q=(1/3,1/3,1/3). An unusual orientation dependent change in the NMR shift splitting symmetry, however, reveals orbital selective modulations of the local DOS.</description>

      <title>New tool for extraction of $^{187}$Os M\"ossbauer parameters with biologically relevant detection sensitivity</title>

Abstract: A large number of osmium complexes with osmium in different oxidation states (II, III, IV, VI) have been reported recently to exhibit good antiproliferative activity in cancer cell lines. Herein, we demonstrate new opportunities offered by $^{187}$Os nuclear forward scattering (NFS) and nuclear inelastic scattering (NIS) of synchrotron radiation for characterization of hyperfine interactions and lattice dynamics in a benchmark Os(VI) complex K$_2$[OsO$_2$(OH)$_4$], by accurate extraction of M\"ossbauer parameters and the determination of Os-projected density of phonon states confirmed by first-principles phonon calculations. The values of isomer shift ($\delta$ = 3.3(1) mm/s) relative to [Os$^{IV}$ Cl$_{6}$]$^{2-}$ and quadrupole splitting ($\Delta E_Q$ = 12.0(2) mm/s) were determined with NFS, while the Lamb-M\"ossbauer factor (0.55(1)), the density of phonon states (DOS), and a full thermodynamics characterization was carried out using the NIS data combined with first principle theoretical calculations. In more general terms, this study provides strong evidence that $^{187}$Os nuclear resonance scattering is a reliable technique for the investigation of hyperfine interactions and Os specific vibrations in osmium(VI) species, which might be potentially applicable for measuring such interactions in osmium complexes of other oxidation states, including those with anticancer activity such as Os(III) and Os(IV).</description>

      <title>Diffuse scattering from dynamically compressed single-crystal zirconium following the pressure-induced $\alpha\to\omega$ phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prototypical $\alpha\to\omega$ phase transition in zirconium is an ideal test-bed for our understanding of polymorphism under extreme loading conditions. After half a century of study, a consensus had emerged that the transition is realized via one of two distinct displacive mechanisms, depending on the nature of the compression path. However, recent dynamic-compression experiments equipped with in situ diffraction diagnostics performed in the past few years have revealed new transition mechanisms, demonstrating that our understanding of the underlying atomistic dynamics and transition kinetics is in fact far from complete. We present classical molecular dynamics simulations of the $\alpha\to\omega$ phase transition in single-crystal zirconium shock-compressed along the [0001] axis using a machine-learning-class potential. The transition is predicted to proceed primarily via a modified version of the two-stage Usikov-Zilberstein mechanism, whereby the high-pressure $\omega$-phase heterogeneously nucleates at boundaries between grains of an intermediate $\beta$-phase. We further observe the fomentation of atomistic disorder at the junctions between $\beta$ grains, leading to the formation of highly defective interstitial material between the $\omega$ grains. We directly compare synthetic x-ray diffraction patterns generated from our simulations with those obtained using femtosecond diffraction in recent dynamic-compression experiments, and show that the simulations produce the same unique, anisotropic diffuse scattering signal unlike any previously seen from an elemental metal. Our simulations suggest that the diffuse signal arises from a combination of thermal diffuse scattering, nanoparticle-like scattering from residual kinetically stabilized $\alpha$ and $\beta$ grains, and scattering from interstitial defective structures.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Impact of B-site Distribution on the Frustration Effect in Double Perovskite Ca2FeReO6 Using Monte Carlo Simulation and Molecular Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work systematically investigates the spin glass behavior of the double perovskite Ca2FeReO6. Building on previous studies, we have developed a formula to quantify the ions distribution at B-site, incorporating the next-nearest neighbor interactions. Employing molecular field theory and Monte Carlo simulations, the influence of various arrangements of two B-site ions on frustration effects was uncovered. B-site is segmented into a and b-site, defining the number of nearest neighbors from Fea to Feb (and vice versa) as Zx(Zy). The significant frustration effects occur when 1&lt;Zx(or Zy)&lt;3, with Zx is not equal to Zy and also when Zx(or Zy) ~ 3 while Zy(or Zx) ~ 4. All of these are reflected in the variations observed in ground state magnetization and the Thermal Energy Step relation to Zx and Zy. The model proposed in this work can be applied to most B-site disordered in perovskite systems and even to other chemically disordered in frustrated systems.</description>

      <title>Simulating Crystallization in a Colloidal System Using State Predictive Information Bottleneck based Enhanced Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate crystal nucleation in supersaturated colloid suspensions using enhanced molecular dynamics simulations augmented with machine learning techniques. The simulations reveal that crystallization in the model colloidal system studied here, with particles interacting through a repulsive screened Coulomb Yukawa potential, proceeds from vapor to dense liquid droplet to crystalline phases across multiple high barriers. Employing a one-dimensional reaction coordinate derived from the State Predictive Information Bottleneck framework, our simulations capture backand-forth phase transitions across multiple barriers effectively in biased metadynamics simulations. We obtain relative free energy differences between different phases and also quantify the roles of different molecular level features in driving the phase changes.</description>

      <title>Ultimate charge transport regimes in doping-controlled graphene laminates: phonon-assisted processes revealed by the linear magnetoresistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the electrical properties of solution-processed 2D materials is key to further printed electronics progress. Here we demonstrate that the thermolysis of the aromatic intercalants utilized in nanosheet exfoliation for graphene laminates opens the route to achieving high intrinsic mobility and simultaneously controlling doping type ($n$- and $p$-) and concentration over a wide range. We establish that the intra-flake mobility is high by observing a linear magnetoresistance of such solution-processed graphene laminates and using it to devolve the inter-flake tunneling and intra-layer magnetotransport. Consequently, we determine the temperature dependences of the inter- and intra-layer characteristics, which both appear to be dominated by phonon-assisted processes at temperature $T&gt;$20 Kelvin. In particular, we identify the efficiency of phonon-assisted tunneling as the main limiting factor for electrical conductivity in graphene laminates at room temperature. We also demonstrate a thermoelectric sensitivity of around 50 ${\mu}$V K$^{-1}$ in a solution-processed metal-free graphene-based thermocouple.</description>

      <title>Tensor hypercontraction for fully self-consistent imaginary-time GF2 and GWSOX methods: theory, implementation, and role of the Green's function second-order exchange for intermolecular interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply tensor hypercontraction (THC) to reduce the computational scaling of expensive fully self-consistent Green's function methods. We present an efficient MPI-parallel algorithm and its implementation for evaluating the correlated second-order exchange term (SOX). This approach enabled us to conduct the largest fully self-consistent calculations with over 1100 atomic orbitals (AOs), with negligible errors attributed to THC fitting. Utilizing our THC implementation for scGW, scGF2, and scGWSOX (GW plus the SOX term iterated to achieve full Green's function self-consistency), we evaluated energies of intermolecular interactions. This approach allowed us to circumvent issues related to reference dependence and ambiguity in energy evaluation, which are common challenges in non-self-consistent calculations. We demonstrate that scGW exhibits a slight overbinding tendency for large systems, contrary to the underbinding observed with non-self-consistent RPA. Conversely, scGWSOX exhibits a slight underbinding tendency for such systems. This behavior is both physical and systematic and is caused by exclusion-principle violating diagrams or corresponding corrections. Our analysis elucidates the role played by these different diagrams, which is crucial for the construction of rigorous, accurate, and systematic methods. Finally, we explicitly show that all perturbative fully self-consistent Green's function methods are size-extensive.</description>

      <title>Suppressed self-diffusion of nanoscale constituents of a complex liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to understand and ultimately control the transformations and properties of various nanoscale systems, from proteins to synthetic nanomaterial assemblies, hinges on the ability to directly elucidate their dynamics on their characteristic length and time scales. Here, we use MHz X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) to directly elucidate the characteristic microsecond-dynamics of density fluctuations of semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs), not only in a colloidal dispersion but also in a liquid phase consisting of densely packed, yet mobile, NCs with no long-range order. By carefully disentangling X-ray induced effects, we find the wavevector-dependent fluctuation rates in the liquid phase are suppressed relative to those in the colloidal phase and to those in experiments and hydrodynamic theories of densely packed repulsive particles. We show that the suppressed rates are due to a substantial decrease in the self-diffusion of NCs in the liquid phase, which we attribute to explicit attractive interactions. Via comparison with simulations, we find that the extracted strength of the attractions explains the stability of the liquid phase, in contrast to the gelation observed via XPCS in many other charged colloidal systems. This work opens the door to elucidating fast, condensed phase dynamics in a variety of complex fluids and other nanoscale soft matter systems, such as densely packed proteins and non-equilibrium self-assembly processes.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Giant Unit-Cell Super-Structure in the Infinite-Layer Nickelate PrNiO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectacular quantum phenomena such as superconductivity often emerge in flat-band systems where Coulomb interactions overpower electron kinetics. Engineering strategies for flat-band physics is therefore of great importance. Here, using high-energy grazing-incidence x-ray diffraction, we demonstrate how in-situ temperature annealing of the infinite-layer nickelate PrNiO$_2$ induces a giant superlattice structure. The annealing effect has a maximum well above room temperature. By covering a large scattering volume, we show a rare period-six in-plane (bi-axial) symmetry and a period-four symmetry in the out-of-plane direction. This giant unit-cell superstructure likely stems from ordering of diffusive oxygen. The stability of this superlattice structure suggests a connection to an energetically favorable electronic state of matter. As such, our study provides a new pathway - different from Moir\'e structures - to ultra-small Brillouin zone electronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanical instabilities of two-dimensional membranes has strong connection to the subjects of structure instabilities, morphology control and materials failures. In this work, we investigate the plastic mechanism developed in the annular crystalline membrane system for adapting to the shrinking space, which is caused by the controllable gradual expansion of the inner boundary. In the process of plastic deformation, we find the continuous generation of dislocations at the inner boundary, and their collective migration to the outer boundary; this neat dynamic scenario of dislocation current captures the complicated reorganization process of the particles. We also reveal the characteristic vortex structure arising from the interplay of topological defects and the displacement field. These results may find applications in the precise control of structural instabilities in packings of particulate matter and covalently bonded systems.</description>

      <title>Melting Temperature of Iron Under the Earth's Inner Core Condition from Deep Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constraining the melting temperature of iron under Earth's inner core conditions is crucial for understanding core dynamics and planetary evolution. Here, we develop a deep potential (DP) model for iron that explicitly incorporates electronic entropy contributions governing thermodynamics under Earth's core conditions. Extensive benchmarking demonstrates the DP's high fidelity across relevant iron phases and extreme pressure and temperature conditions. Through thermodynamic integration and direct solid-liquid coexistence simulations, the DP predicts melting temperatures for iron at the inner core boundary, consistent with previous \textit{ab initio} results. This resolves the previous discrepancy of iron's melting temperature at ICB between the DP model and \textit{ab initio} calculation and suggests the crucial contribution of electronic entropy. Our work provides insights into machine learning melting behavior of iron under core conditions and provides the basis for future development of binary or ternary DP models for iron and other elements in the core.</description>

      <title>On the suitability of single-edge notch tension (SENT) testing for assessing hydrogen-assisted cracking susceptibility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combined experiments and computational modelling are used to increase understanding of the suitability of the Single-Edge Notch Tension (SENT) test for assessing hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility. The SENT tests were designed to provide the mode I threshold stress intensity factor ($K_{\text{th}}$) for hydrogen-assisted cracking of a C110 steel in two corrosive environments. These were accompanied by hydrogen permeation experiments to relate the environments to the absorbed hydrogen concentrations. A coupled phase-field-based deformation-diffusion-fracture model is then employed to simulate the SENT tests, predicting $K_{\text{th}}$ in good agreement with the experimental results and providing insights into the hydrogen absorption-diffusion-cracking interactions. The suitability of SENT testing and its optimal characteristics (e.g., test duration) are discussed in terms of the various simultaneous active time-dependent phenomena, triaxiality dependencies, and regimes of hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility.</description>

      <title>Realization of a Two-Dimensional Lieb Lattice in a Metal-Inorganic Framework with Flat Bands and Topological Edge States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat bands and Dirac cones in materials are at the source of the exotic electronic and topological properties. The Lieb lattice is expected to host these electronic structures, arising from quantum destructive interference. Nevertheless, the experimental realization of a two-dimensional Lieb lattice remained challenging to date due to its intrinsic structural instability. After computationally designing a Platinum-Phosphorus (Pt-P) Lieb lattice, we have successfully overcome its structural instability and synthesized it on a gold substrate via molecular beam epitaxy. Low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy verified the Lieb lattice's morphology and electronic flat bands. Furthermore, topological Dirac edge states stemming from pronounced spin-orbit coupling induced by heavy Pt atoms have been predicted. These findings convincingly open perspectives for creating metal-inorganic framework-based atomic lattices, offering prospects for strongly correlated phases interplayed with topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the recently discovered kagome superconductor AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, and Cs), the superconductivity is intertwined with an unconventional charge density wave order. Its pairing symmetry remains elusive owing to the lack of direct measurement of the superconducting gap in the momentum space. In this letter, utilizing laser-based ultra-high-resolution and low-temperature angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe anisotropic Cooper pairing in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5. We detect a highly anisotropic superconducting gap structure with an anisotropy over 80% and the gap maximum along the V-V bond direction on a Fermi surface originated from the 3d-orbital electrons of the V kagome lattice. It is in stark contrast to the isotropic superconducting gap structure on the other Fermi surface that is occupied by Sb 5p-orbital electrons.

      <title>Pre-relaxation in quantum, classical, and quantum-classical two-impurity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically study the relaxation dynamics of impurity-host systems, focusing on the presence of long-lived metastable states in the non-equilibrium dynamics after an initial excitation of the impurities. In generic systems, an excited impurity coupled to a large bath at zero temperature is expected to relax and approach its ground state over time. However, certain exceptional cases exhibit metastability, where the system remains in an excited state on timescales largely exceeding the typical relaxation time. We study this phenomenon for three prototypical impurity models: a tight-binding quantum model of independent spinless fermions on a lattice with two stub impurities, a classical-spin Heisenberg model with two weakly coupled classical impurity spins, and a tight-binding quantum model of independent electrons with two classical impurity spins. Through numerical integration of the fundamental equations of motion, we find that all three models exhibit similar qualitative behavior: complete relaxation for nearest-neighbor impurities and incomplete or strongly delayed relaxation for next-nearest-neighbor impurities. The underlying mechanisms leading to this behavior differ between models and include impurity-induced bound states, emergent approximately conserved local observables, and exact cancellation of local and nonlocal dissipation effects.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study of nonlinear perturbations in the dynamics of planar crack fronts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of crack fronts with asperities is central to the criteria of fracture in heterogeneous materials and for the prediction of fracture surface formation. It is known how dynamic crack fronts respond to small, 1st-order, perturbations. Large and localized disturbances to crack motion, however, induce dynamic and geometric nonlinear effects that are beyond the existing linear theories. Because the determination of the 3D elastic fields surrounding perturbed crack fronts is a necessary step towards any theoretical study of crack front dynamics, we develop a 2nd-order perturbation theory for the asymptotic fields of planar crack fronts. Based on previous work, we consider two models of fracture. In the so-called scalar elastic model, which is analogous to anti-plane (Mode III) fracture, the stress and displacement fields are obtained through matched asymptotic expansions. A self-consistent expansion is used to resolve the fields near tensile (Mode I) crack fronts. Both methods can be extended to higher perturbation orders. The main results of this work are the explicit 2nd-order expressions of the local dynamic energy-release-rates for perturbations of straight fronts. These general formulae recover the known energy-release-rates of curved quasi-static fronts and of straight dynamic fronts.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Spin and Orbital Hall Phenomena in Antiferromagnetic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate anomalous spin and orbital Hall phenomena in antiferromagnetic (AF) materials via orbital pumping experiments. Conducting spin and orbital pumping experiments on YIG/Pt/Ir20Mn80 heterostructures, we unexpectedly observe strong spin and orbital anomalous signals in an out-of-plane configuration. We report a sevenfold increase in the signal of the anomalous inverse orbital Hall effect (AIOHE) compared to conventional effects. Our study suggests expanding the Orbital Hall angle ({\theta}_OH) to a rank 3 tensor, akin to the Spin Hall angle ({\theta}_SH), to explain AIOHE. This work pioneers converting spin-orbital currents into charge current, advancing the spin-orbitronics domain in AF materials.</description>

      <title>Tuning the BCS-BEC crossover of electron-hole pairing with pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In graphite, a moderate magnetic field confines electrons and holes into their lowest Landau levels. In the extreme quantum limit, two insulating states with a dome-like field dependence of the their critical temperatures are induced by the magnetic field. Here, we study the evolution of the first dome (below 60 T) under hydrostatic pressure up to 1.7 GPa. With increasing pressure, the field-temperature phase boundary shifts towards higher magnetic fields, yet the maximum critical temperature remains unchanged. According to our fermiology data, pressure amplifies the density and the effective mass of hole-like and electron-like carriers. Thanks to this information, we verify the persistent relevance of the BCS relation between the critical temperature and the density of states in the weak-coupling boundary of the dome. In contrast, the strong-coupling summit of the dome does not show any detectable change with pressure. We argue that this is because the out-of-plane BCS coherence length approaches the interplane distance that shows little change with pressure. Thus, the BCS-BEC crossover is tunable by magnetic field and pressure, but with a locked summit.</description>

      <title>A general framework for active space embedding methods: applications in quantum computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a general framework for hybrid quantum-classical computing of molecular and periodic embedding calculations based on an orbital space separation of the fragment and environment degrees of freedom. We show its potential by presenting a specific implementation of periodic range-separated DFT coupled to a quantum circuit ansatz, whereby the variational quantum eigensolver and the quantum equation-of-motion approach are used to obtain the low-lying spectrum of the embedded fragment Hamiltonian. Application of this scheme to study strongly correlated molecular systems and localized electronic states in materials is showcased through the accurate prediction of the optical properties for the neutral oxygen vacancy in magnesium oxide (MgO). Despite some discrepancies in absorption predictions, the method demonstrates competitive performance with state-of-the-art ab initio approaches, particularly evidenced by the accurate prediction of the photoluminescence emission peak.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we present an effective tight-binding model for an accurate description of the lowest energy quadruplet of conduction band in a ferromagnetic CrX$_3$ monolayer, tuned to the complementary \textit{ab initio} density functional theory simulations. This model, based on a minimum number of chromium orbitals, captures a distinctively flat dispersion in those bands but requires taking into account hoppings beyond nearest neighbours, revealing ligand-mediated electron pathways connecting remote chromium sites. Doping of states in the lowest conduction band of CrX$_3$ requires charge transfer, which, according to recent studies, can occur in graphene(G)/CrX$_3$ heterostructures. Here, we use the detailed description of the lowest conduction band in CrI$_3$ to show that G/CrI$_3$/G and G/CrI$_3$ are type-II heterostructures where light holes in graphene would coexist with heavy electrons in the magnetic layer, where the latter can be characterised by Wigner parameter $r_s\sim 15-20$ (as estimated for hBN-encapsulated structures).</description>

      <title>Colloidal dispersions of sterically and electrostatically stabilized PbS quantum dots: the effect of stabilization mechanism on structure factors, second virial coefficients, and film-forming properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrostatically stabilized nanocrystals (NCs) and, in particular, quantum dots (QDs) hold promise for forming strongly coupled superlattices due to their compact and electronically conductive surface ligands. However, studies on the colloidal dispersion and interparticle interactions of electrostatically stabilized sub-10 nm NCs have been limited, hindering the optimization of colloidal stability and self-assembly. In this study, we employed small-angle X ray scattering (SAXS) experiments to investigate the interparticle interactions and arrangement of PbS QDs with thiostannate ligands (PbS-Sn2S64-) in polar solvents. The study reveals significant deviations from ideal solution behavior in electrostatically stabilized QD dispersions. Our results demonstrate that PbS-Sn2S64- QDs exhibit long-range interactions within the solvent, in contrast to the short-range steric repulsion characteristic of PbS QDs with oleate ligands (PbS-OA). Introducing highly charged multivalent electrolytes screens electrostatic interactions between charged QDs, reducing the length scale of the repulsive interactions. Furthermore, we calculate the second virial (B2) coefficients from SAXS data, providing insights into how surface chemistry, solvent, and size influence pair potentials. Finally, we explore the influence of long-range interparticle interactions of PbS-Sn2S64- QDs on the morphology of films produced by drying or spin-coating colloidal solutions. The long-range repulsive term of PbS-Sn2S64- QDs promotes the formation of amorphous films, and screening the electrostatic repulsion by addition of an electrolyte enables the formation of a crystalline film. These findings highlight the critical role of NC-NC interactions in tailoring the properties of functional nanomaterials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin and charge are the two most important degrees of freedom of electrons. Their interplay lies at the heart of numerous strongly correlated phenomena including Hubbard model physics and high temperature superconductivity. Such interplay for bosons, on the other hand, is largely unexplored in condensed matter systems. Here we demonstrate a unique realization of the spin-1/2 Bose-Hubbard model through excitons in a semiconducting moir\'e superlattice. We find evidence of a transient in-plane ferromagnetic (FM-$xy$) order of exciton spin - here valley pseudospin - around exciton filling $\nu_{ex}$ = 1, which transitions into a FM-$z$ order both with increasing exciton filling and a small magnetic field of 10 mT. The phase diagram is different from the fermion case and is qualitatively captured by a simple phenomenological model, highlighting the unique consequence of Bose-Einstein statistics. Our study paves the way for engineering exotic phases of matter from spinor bosons, as well as for unconventional devices in optics and quantum information science.</description>

Abstract: Flat electronic bands near the Fermi level provide a fertile playground for realizing interaction-driven correlated physics. To date, related experiments have mostly been limited to engineered multilayer systems (e.g., moir\'e systems). Herein, we report an experimental realization of nearly flat bands across the Fermi level in monolayer MoTe2-x by fabricating a uniformly ordered mirror-twin boundary superlattice (corresponding to a stoichiometry of MoTe56/33). The kagome flat bands are discovered by combining scanning tunnelling microscopy and theoretical calculations. The partial filling nature of flat bands yields a correlated insulating state exhibiting a hard gap as large as 15 meV. Moreover, we observe pronounced responses of the correlated states to magnetic fields, providing evidence for a spin-polarized ground state. Our work introduces a monolayer platform that manifests strong correlation effects arising from flattened electronic bands.</description>

Abstract: We study Y3Fe5O12 (YIG) flakes that we produce via mechanical cleaving and exfoliation of YIG single crystals. By characterizing their structural and magnetic properties, we find that these YIG nanoflakes have surfaces oriented along unusual crystallographic axes and uniaxial in-plane magnetic anisotropy due to their shape, both of which are not commonly available in YIG thin films. These physical properties, combined with the possibility of picking up the YIG flakes and stacking them onto flakes of other van der Waals materials or pre-patterned electrodes or waveguides, open unexplored possibilities for magnonics and for the realization of novel YIG-based heterostructures and devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study ferroelectricity in the classic perovskite ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ to high pressures with density functional theory (DFT) and experimental diamond-anvil techniques. We use second harmonic generation (SHG) spectroscopy to detect lack of inversion symmetry, if present. Consistent with early understanding and experiments, we find that ferroelectricity disappears at moderate pressures. However, the DFT calculations show that the disappearance arises from the overtaking of zone boundary instabilities, and not from the squeezing out of the off-centering ferroelectric displacements with pressure, as previously thought. We find a new dense centrosymmetric post-perovskite phase with P$2_1/m$ symmetry that becomes stable at about 70 GPa. Our computations predict a dramatic reentrance of ferroelectricity 90 GPa in the distorted R3c structure, but this phase is metastable relative to the post-perovskite phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Micro-channel plate (MCP) detectors, when used at pulsed-neutron-source instruments, offer the possibility of high spatial resolution and high contrast imaging with pixel-level spectroscopic information. Here we demonstrate the possibility of multimodal analysis including total neutron cross-section spectra measurements, quantitative material differentiation imaging and texture-sensitive in-line phase imaging, from a single exposure using an MCP detector. This multimodal approach operates in full-field imaging mode, with the neutron transmission spectra acquired at each individual detector pixel. Due to the polychromatic nature of the beam and spectroscopic resolving capability of the detector, no energy scanning is required. Good agreement with the library reference data is demonstrated for neutron cross-section spectra measurements. Two different images corresponding to two selected energy bandwidths are used for elemental differentiation imaging. Moreover, the presence of changes in texture, i.e., preferred grain orientation, in the sample is identified from our phase-retrieval imaging results.</description>

Abstract: Here, we present a study of the influence of microstructure on the magnetic properties of polycrystalline samples of the La1.5Sr0.5CoMnO6 double perovskite, with primary attention to the spontaneous exchange bias effect, a fascinating recently discovered phenomena for which some materials exhibit unidirectional magnetic anisotropy after being cooled in zero magnetic fields. By sintering La1.5Sr0.5CoMnO6 at different temperatures, we obtained samples with distinct average grain sizes, ranging from 1.54 to 6.65 mu_m. A detailed investigation of the material's structural, morphologic, electronic, and magnetic properties using X-ray powder diffraction, powder neutron diffraction, X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and AC and DC magnetometry has revealed a systematic enhancement of the exchange bias effect with increasing the average grain size. This evolution is discussed in terms of changes in the material's porosity and grain morphology and its influence on the exchange couplings at the magnetic interfaces.</description>

      <title>Understanding the flat thermal conductivity of La2Zr2O7 at ultrahigh temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many crystals, such as lanthanum zirconate (La2Zr2O7), exhibit a flat temperature dependence of thermal conductivity at elevated temperatures. This phenomenon has recently been attributed to the inter-band phonon tunneling (or diffuson) contribution using different formalisms. However, the contributions of finite-temperature corrections (e.g., higher-order phonon-scattering, phonon renormalization, and phonon scattering cross-section softening effects) remain unclear. In this work, we predict and compare the thermal conductivity of La2Zr2O7 using three distinct first-principles methods. The first method is Green-Kubo molecular dynamics (MD) based on temperature-dependent machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained from ab initio MD simulations, which successfully predict the flat trend at ultra-high temperatures. The second method is the Peierls Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), within the phonon particle framework, using phonon lifetime that includes all the finite-temperature corrections. Four-phonon scattering is found large but is cancelled by the phonon scattering cross-section softening effect. As a result, BTE with temperature corrections does not reproduce the flat thermal conductivity. The third method is Wigner formalism, which includes both phonon particle and wave contributions, which successfully reproduce the flat thermal conductivity. Diffuson and phonon contribute about 67% and 27% of thermal conductivity at 1800 K, respectively. The radiation contribution to thermal conductivity is around 6%. The scaling laws of the phonon, diffuson, radiation, and total thermal conductivity are found to be ~T-0.97, ~T0.43, ~T2.01, and ~T-0.40, respectively. This work clarifies the thermal transport mechanisms in La2Zr2O7 at ultra-high temperatures from different aspects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A high-throughput screening using density functional calculations is performed to search for stable boride superconductors from the existing materials database. The workflow employs the fast frozen phonon method as the descriptor to evaluate the superconducting properties quickly. 23 stable candidates are identified from the screening. For almost all found binary compounds, the superconductivity was obtained earlier experimentally or computationally. For ternary borides, previous studies are very limited. Our extensive search among ternary systems confirmed superconductivity in known systems and found several new compounds. Among these discovered superconducting ternary borides, Ta(MoB)$_2$ shows the highest superconducting temperature of ~12K. Most predicted compounds were synthesized previously; therefore, our predictions can be examined experimentally. Our work also demonstrates that the boride systems can have diverse structural motifs that lead to superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Picturing the Gap Between the Performance and US-DOE's Hydrogen Storage Target: A Data-Driven Model for MgH2 Dehydrogenation</title>

Abstract: Developing solid-state hydrogen storage materials is as pressing as ever, which requires a comprehensive understanding of the dehydrogenation chemistry of a solid-state hydride. Transition state search and kinetics calculations are essential to understanding and designing high-performance solid-state hydrogen storage materials by filling in the knowledge gap that current experimental techniques cannot measure. However, the ab initio analysis of these processes is computationally expensive and time-consuming. Searching for descriptors to accurately predict the energy barrier is urgently needed, to accelerate the prediction of hydrogen storage material properties and identify the opportunities and challenges in this field. Herein, we develop a data-driven model to describe and predict the dehydrogenation barriers of a typical solid-state hydrogen storage material, magnesium hydride (MgH2), based on the combination of the crystal Hamilton population orbital of Mg-H bond and the distance between atomic hydrogen. By deriving the distance energy ratio, this model elucidates the key chemistry of the reaction kinetics. All the parameters in this model can be directly calculated with significantly less computational cost than conventional transition state search, so that the dehydrogenation performance of hydrogen storage materials can be predicted efficiently. Finally, we found that this model leads to excellent agreement with typical experimental measurements reported to date and provides clear design guidelines on how to propel the performance of MgH2 closer to the target set by the United States Department of Energy (US-DOE).</description>

      <title>Interpolation and differentiation of alchemical degrees of freedom in machine learning interatomic potentials</title>

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become a workhorse of modern atomistic simulations, and recently published universal MLIPs, pre-trained on large datasets, have demonstrated remarkable accuracy and generalizability. However, the computational cost of MLIPs limits their applicability to chemically disordered systems requiring large simulation cells or to sample-intensive statistical methods. Here, we report the use of continuous and differentiable alchemical degrees of freedom in atomistic materials simulations, exploiting the fact that graph neural network MLIPs represent discrete elements as real-valued tensors. The proposed method introduces alchemical atoms with corresponding weights into the input graph, alongside modifications to the message-passing and readout mechanisms of MLIPs, and allows smooth interpolation between the compositional states of materials. The end-to-end differentiability of MLIPs enables efficient calculation of the gradient of energy with respect to the compositional weights. Leveraging these gradients, we propose methodologies for optimizing the composition of solid solutions towards target macroscopic properties and conducting alchemical free energy simulations to quantify the free energy of vacancy formation and composition changes. The approach offers an avenue for extending the capabilities of universal MLIPs in the modeling of compositional disorder and characterizing the phase stabilities of complex materials systems.</description>

      <title>Explainable machine learning to enable high-throughput electrical conductivity optimization and discovery of doped conjugated polymers</title>

Abstract: The combination of high-throughput experimentation techniques and machine learning (ML) has recently ushered in a new era of accelerated material discovery, enabling the identification of materials with cutting-edge properties. However, the measurement of certain physical quantities remains challenging to automate. Specifically, meticulous process control, experimentation and laborious measurements are required to achieve optimal electrical conductivity in doped polymer materials. We propose a ML approach, which relies on readily measured absorbance spectra, to accelerate the workflow associated with measuring electrical conductivity. The classification model accurately classifies samples with a conductivity &gt; 25 to 100 S/cm, achieving a maximum of 100 % accuracy rate. For the subset of highly conductive samples, we employed a regression model to predict their conductivities, yielding an impressive test R2 value of 0.984. We tested the models with samples of the two highest conductivities (498 and 506 S/cm) and showed that they were able to correctly classify and predict the two extrapolative conductivities at satisfactory levels of errors. The proposed ML-assisted workflow results in an improvement in the efficiency of the conductivity measurements by 89 % of the maximum achievable using our experimental techniques. Furthermore, our approach addressed the common challenge of the lack of explainability in ML models by exploiting bespoke mathematical properties of the descriptors and ML model, allowing us to gain corroborated insights into the spectral influences on conductivity. Through this study, we offer an accelerated pathway for optimizing the properties of doped polymer materials while showcasing the valuable insights that can be derived from purposeful utilization of ML in experimental science.</description>

      <title>Anomalous shift and optical vorticity in the steady photovoltaic current</title>

Abstract: Steady illumination of a non-centrosymmetric semiconductor results in a bulk photovoltaic current, which is contributed by real-space displacements (`shifts') of charged quasiparticles as they transit between Bloch states. The shift induced by interband excitation via absorption of photons has received the prevailing attention. However, this excitation-induced shift can be far outweighed ($\ll$) by the shift induced by intraband relaxation, or by the shift induced by radiative recombination of electron-hole pairs. This outweighing ($\ll$) is attributed to (i) time-reversal-symmetric, intraband Berry curvature, which results in an anomalous shift of quasiparticles as they scatter with phonons, as well as to (ii) topological singularities in the interband Berry phase (`optical vortices'), which makes the photovoltaic current extraordinarily sensitive to the linear polarization vector of the light source. Both (i-ii) potentially lead to nonlinear conductivities of order $mAV^{-2}$, without finetuning of the incident radiation frequency, band gap, or joint density of states. A case study of BiTeI showcases the anomalous shift and optical vorticity in a realistic material.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of new materials has a documented history of propelling human progress for centuries and more. The behaviour of a material is a function of its composition, structure, and properties, which further depend on its processing and testing conditions. Recent developments in deep learning and natural language processing have enabled information extraction at scale from published literature such as peer-reviewed publications, books, and patents. However, this information is spread in multiple formats, such as tables, text, and images, and with little or no uniformity in reporting style giving rise to several machine learning challenges. Here, we discuss, quantify, and document these challenges in automated information extraction (IE) from materials science literature towards the creation of a large materials science knowledge base. Specifically, we focus on IE from text and tables and outline several challenges with examples. We hope the present work inspires researchers to address the challenges in a coherent fashion, providing a fillip to IE towards developing a materials knowledge base.</description>

      <title>Topological magnons in a non-coplanar magnetic order on the triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12505v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The bond-dependent Kitaev interaction $K$ is familiar in the effective spin model of transition metal compounds with octahedral ligands. In this work, we find a peculiar non-coplanar magnetic order can be formed with the help of $K$ and next-nearest neighbor Heisenberg coupling $J_2$ on the triangular lattice. It can be seen as a miniature version of skyrmion crystal, since it has nine spins and an integer topological number in a magnetic unit cell. The magnon excitations in such an order are studied by the linear spin-wave theory. Of note is that the change in the relative size of $J_2$ and $K$ produces topological magnon phase transitions although the topological number remains unchanged. We also calculated the experimentally observable thermal Hall conductivity, and found that the signs of thermal Hall conductivity will change with topological phase transitions or temperature changes in certain regions.</description>

      <title>Six magnetization plateau phases in a kagome antiferromagnet with $\rm{Y}_3\rm{Cu}_9(\rm{OH})_{19}\rm{Cl}_8$-type distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recently discovered kagome antiferromagnet $\rm{Y}_3\rm{Cu}_9(\rm{OH})_{19}\rm{Cl}_8$ has attracted significant interest due to its unique kagome lattice structure and magnetic properties. Two separate studies have proposed distinct sets of exchange interaction parameters for this compound. In this study, we investigate the ground state of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg kagome model with three types of nearest-neighbor exchange interactions under a magnetic field by exact diagonalization using the Lanczos method. We reveal that clear magnetization plateaus at $M/M_{\rm sat}$=1/3, 5/9, and 7/9 are present under both parameter sets, which are identified as magnon crystal states based on their spin structures. Our findings suggest that these plateaus could potentially be experimentally confirmed with magnetization measurements on $\rm{Y}_3\rm{Cu}_9(\rm{OH})_{19}\rm{Cl}_8$ under a magnetic field of approximately 300 T. Due to the uncertainty in the exchange interactions of $\rm{Y}_3\rm{Cu}_9(\rm{OH})_{19}\rm{Cl}_8$, we perform additional calculations by varying these interactions. Consequently, we discover additional plateau phases at $M/M_{\rm sat}$=1/3, 5/9, and 7/9, each distinctly different from the magnon crystal states.</description>
