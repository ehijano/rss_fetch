      <title>Electric field measurements made in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The operating principles of a DC and low frequency electric field detector are developed, after which, examples of earlier important electric field measurements are presented, including, the first observation of parallel electric fields in the auroral acceleration region, the first observation of time domain structures in space, the first experimental verification of symmetric magnetic field reconnection, the first observations of triggered ion acoustic waves, and oblique whistlers that directly accelerate electrons. Future possible improvements in the electric field measurement technique are described.</description>

      <title>Robust and compact single-lens crossed-beam optical dipole trap for Bose-Einstein condensation in microgravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel concept for a compact and robust crossed-beam optical dipole trap (cODT) based on a single lens, designed for the efficient generation of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) under dynamic conditions. The system employs two independent two-dimensional acousto-optical deflectors (AODs) in combination with a single high-numerical-aperture lens to provide three-dimensional control over the trap geometry, minimizing potential misalignments and ensuring long-term operational stability. By leveraging time-averaged potentials, rapid and efficient evaporative cooling sequences toward BECs are enabled. The functionality of the cODT under microgravity conditions has been successfully demonstrated in the Einstein-Elevator in Hannover, Germany, where the beam intersection was shown to remain stable throughout the microgravity phase of the flight. In addition, the system has been implemented in the sensor head of the INTENTAS project to verify BEC generation. Additional realization of one- and two-dimensional control of arrays of condensates through dynamic trap shaping was achieved. This versatile approach allows for advanced quantum sensing applications in mobile and space-based environments based on all- optical BECs.</description>
