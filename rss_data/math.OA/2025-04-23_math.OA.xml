      <title>$\mathrm{M}$-ideals: from Banach spaces to rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and investigate a class of ring ideals, termed ring $\mathrm{M}$-ideals, inspired by the Alfsen--Effros theory of $\mathrm{M}$-ideals in Banach spaces. We show that $\mathrm{M}$-ideals extend the classical notion of essential ideals and subsume them as a subclass. The central theorem provides a full characterization: an ideal is an $\mathrm{M}$-ideal if and only if it is either essential or relatively irreducible. This dichotomy reveals the abundant and diverse nature of $\mathrm{M}$-ideals, encompassing both essential and minimal ideals, and admits natural generalizations in rings beyond the commutative and unital settings.
  We systematically study the algebraic stability of $\mathrm{M}$-ideals under standard constructions such as intersection, quotient, direct product, and Morita equivalence and establish their behavior in topological rings and operator algebras. In certain rings such as $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and C*-algebras, we completely classify $\mathrm{M}$-ideals and relate them to algebraically minimal projections and central idempotents. The ring $\mathrm{M}$-ideals in $C(K)$ are shown to be precisely the essential ideals or those minimal ideals corresponding to isolated points.
  Structurally, we show that the absence of proper $\mathrm{M}$-ideals characterizes simplicity, while rings in which every proper $\mathrm{M}$-ideal is a direct summand must decompose as finite direct sums of simple rings. In closing, we introduce the notion of $\mathrm{M}$-complements, drawing an analogy with essential extensions in module theory, and demonstrate their existence.</description>

      <title>Thirty-six officers, artisanally entangled</title>

Abstract: A perfect tensor of order $d$ is a state of four $d$-level systems that is maximally entangled under any bipartition. These objects have attracted considerable attention in quantum information and many-body theory. Perfect tensors generalize the combinatorial notion of orthogonal Latin squares (OLS). Deciding whether OLS of a given order exist has historically been a difficult problem. The case $d=6$ proved particularly thorny, and was popularized by Leonhard Euler in terms of a putative constellation of "36 officers". It took more than a century to show that Euler's puzzle has no solution. After yet another century, its quantum generalization was resolved in the affirmative: 36 entangled officers can be suitably arranged. However, the construction and verification of known instances relies on elaborate computer codes. (In particular, Leonhard would have had no means of dealing with such solutions to his own puzzle -- an unsatisfactory state of affairs). In this paper, we present the first human-made order-$6$ perfect tensors. We decompose the Hilbert space $(\mathbb{C}^6)^{\otimes 2}$ of two quhexes into the direct sum $(\mathbb{C}^3)^{\otimes 2}\oplus(\mathbb{C}^3)^{\otimes 3}$ comprising superpositions of two-qutrit and three-qutrit states. Perfect tensors arise when certain Clifford unitaries are applied separately to the two sectors. Technically, our construction realizes solutions to the perfect functions ansatz recently proposed by Rather. Generalizing an observation of Bruzda and \.Zyczkowski, we show that any solution of this kind gives rise to a two-unitary complex Hadamard matrix, of which we construct infinite families. Finally, we sketch a formulation of the theory of perfect tensors in terms of quasi-orthogonal decompositions of matrix algebras.</description>

      <title>On representations of the crystallization of the quantized function algebra C(SUq(n + 1))</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The crystal limit C(K0) of the $q$-family of C*-algebras C(Kq) was introduced by Giri &amp; Pal for all K=SU(n+1), n\geq 2. This article aims to prove that the crystal limits C(K0) have the property that the representations of C(Kq) give rise to the representations of the crystallized algebra C(K0) by sending generators of C(K0) to the limit of (scaled) generators of C(Kq)$ and every representation of C(K0) occurs in this way. This work addresses a question raised by Giri &amp; Pal in \cite{GirPal-2024}. As a consequence, one can realize C(K0) as the C*-algebra generated by the limit operators of faithful representations of C(Kq).</description>
