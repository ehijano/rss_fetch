      <title>The InSAR absolute phase amid singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radar interferometric absolute phase is essential for estimating topography and displacements. However, its conventional definition based on the range difference is idealized in that it cannot be applied to complex, dynamic targets. Here, a universal observational definition is proposed, which is easiest to describe for differential interferometry: The absolute phase is determined by temporally unwrapping the phase while continuously varying the intermediate acquisition time between primary and secondary acquisitions. This absolute phase is typically not directly observable because a continuous series of observations is required. The absolute phase of a point target is proportional to the range difference, matching the conventional definition. For general targets undergoing a cyclic change, the absolute phase may be nonzero and then cannot be interpreted as a range difference. When a phase singularity (vanishing coherence) occurs at an intermediate time, the absolute phase becomes undefined, a situation termed an absolute phase singularity. Absolute phase singularities complicate absolute phase reconstruction through multifrequency techniques and through unwrapping multidimensional interferograms. They leave no trace in an interferogram, but unwrapping paths need to avoid those across which the absolute phase jumps by nonzero integer multiples of $2 \pi$. Mathematical analyses identify conditions for unwrapping-based reconstruction up to a constant, accounting for absolute phase singularities, undersampling and noise. The general definition of the absolute phase and the mathematical analyses enable a comprehensive appraisal of InSAR processing chains and support the interpretation of observations whenever low coherence engenders phase and absolute phase singularities.</description>

      <title>High-resolution eikonal imaging and uncertainty quantification of the Kilauea caldera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Images of the Earth's interior can provide us with insight into the underlying properties of the Earth, such as how seismic activity might emerge and the interplay between seismic and volcanic activity. Understanding these systems requires reliable high-resolution images to understand mechanisms and estimate physical quantities. However, reliable images are often difficult to obtain due to the non-linear nature of seismic wave propagation and the ill-posedness of the related inverse problem. Reconstructions rely on good initial estimates as well as hand-crafted priors, which can ultimately bias solutions. In our work, we present a 3D reconstruction of Kilauea's magmatic system at a previously unattained resolution. Our eikonal tomography procedure improves upon prior imaging results of Kilauea through increased resolution and per-pixel uncertainties estimated through variational inference. In particular, solving eikonal imaging using variational inference with stochastic gradient descent enables stable inversion and uncertainty quantification in the absence of strong prior knowledge of the velocity structure. Our work makes two key contributions: developing a stochastic eikonal tomography scheme with uncertainty quantification and illuminating the structure and melt quantity of the magmatic system that underlies Kilauea.</description>

      <title>A Foundation Model for Material Fracture Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting when and how materials fail is critical to designing safe, reliable structures, mechanical systems, and engineered components that operate under stress. Yet, fracture behavior remains difficult to model across the diversity of materials, geometries, and loading conditions in real-world applications. While machine learning (ML) methods show promise, most models are trained on narrow datasets, lack robustness, and struggle to generalize. Meanwhile, physics-based simulators offer high-fidelity predictions but are fragmented across specialized methods and require substantial high-performance computing resources to explore the input space. To address these limitations, we present a data-driven foundation model for fracture prediction, a transformer-based architecture that operates across simulators, a wide range of materials (including plastic-bonded explosives, steel, aluminum, shale, and tungsten), and diverse loading conditions. The model supports both structured and unstructured meshes, combining them with large language model embeddings of textual input decks specifying material properties, boundary conditions, and solver settings. This multimodal input design enables flexible adaptation across simulation scenarios without changes to the model architecture. The trained model can be fine-tuned with minimal data on diverse downstream tasks, including time-to-failure estimation, modeling fracture evolution, and adapting to combined finite-discrete element method simulations. It also generalizes to unseen materials such as titanium and concrete, requiring as few as a single sample, dramatically reducing data needs compared to standard ML. Our results show that fracture prediction can be unified under a single model architecture, offering a scalable, extensible alternative to simulator-specific workflows.</description>

      <title>Fully Coupled Implicit Hydro-Mechanical Multiphase Flow Simulation in Deformable Porous Media Using DEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of multiphase flow dynamics in porous media is crucial for optimizing subsurface engineering applications like geological carbon sequestration. However, studying the micro-mechanisms of multiphase fluid--grain interactions in the laboratory is challenging due to the difficulty in obtaining mechanical data such as force and displacement. Transitional discrete element method models coupled with pore networks offer insights into these interactions but struggle with accurate pressure prediction during pore expansion from fracturing and efficient simulation during the slow drainage of compressible fluids. To address these limitations, we develop an advanced two-way coupled hydro-mechanical discrete element method model that accurately and efficiently captures fluid--fluid and fluid--grain interactions in deformable porous media. Our model integrates an unconditionally stable implicit finite volume approach, enabling significant timesteps for advancing fluids. A pressure-volume iteration scheme dynamically balances injection-induced pressure buildup with substantial pore structure deformation, while flow front-advancing criteria precisely locate the fluid--fluid interface and adaptively refine timesteps, particularly when capillary effects block potential flow paths. The model is validated against benchmark Hele-Shaw experiments in both rigid and deformable porous media, providing quantitative insights into the micro-mechanisms governing multiphase flow. For the first time, grain-scale inputs such as viscous and capillary pressures, energies, contact forces, and flow resistances are utilized to provide a detailed understanding of micro-scale fluid--fluid and fluid--grain flow patterns and their transitions.</description>

      <title>A translation of the paper "Presentation of some observations that could be made to shed light on Meteorology" by Johann Heinrich Lambert (1771)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mulhouse mathematician Jean-Henri (or Johann Heinrich) Lambert (August 26 or 28, 1728; September 25, 1777) is well known for having devised the conformal conic projection in 1772, which is still used in some graphical outputs of our weather forecasting models, under the name "Lambert projection" Less well known is that he also devised the idea of a minimum temperature value corresponding to $-270${\deg}C in 1777, the year of his death and therefore 70 years before Lord Kelvin. But Johann Heinrich Lambert also published in 1771 an even lesser-known article, which is the subject of this publication. This article, written in Old French and published in a German journal, described in a rather striking manner the idea of a global observation network where the Earth would be divided into different zones where observers would record the same wind, temperature, pressure, and other current weather data at the same fixed times. The goal would then be to pool all this data to seek to understand how meteorological phenomena evolve in space and time, and to make meteorology a science on a par with astronomy.</description>
