      <title>Excimer-Suppressed and Oxygen-Tolerant Photophysics of 'Arm-like' Substituted Pyrene Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pyrene-functionalized materials are extensively employed in photoluminescent applications, owing to their extended pi-conjugation and favorable photophysical properties. However, their luminescent performance is often attenuated by pi-pi stacking-driven excimer formation and molecular oxygen quenching. To mitigate these undesirable effects, a novel class of 7-tert-butylpyren-2-ol derivatives with extended 'arm-like' substituents at the 1,3-positions have been synthesized and their luminescent properties in solution have been thoroughly investigated. While the 2- and 7-positions of the pyrene core are frequently modified with hydroxyl and tert-butyl groups, this work presents the first introduction of 'arm-like' substituents at the 1,3-positions. The stretched-out 'arm-like' substituents not only introduce steric bulk to suppress excimer formation but also change the symmetry class of pyrene and modulate electron density at its 1,2,3,7-positions. These effects tune pyrene's energy levels, demonstrating moderate (0.4) to high (0.7) fluorescence quantum yields and shorter-lived fluorescence lifetimes ranging from ca. 20 to 40 ns. These shorter lifetimes lead to a reduction of the pyrene derivatives' susceptibility to energy scavenging by molecular oxygen. In addition, the specific form of the 'arms' are important. Alkyl-containing arms and alkenyl-containing arms exhibit different decay pathways, which is reflected by their disparate nonradiative rates. Thus, the introduction of 'arm-like' modifications represents a promising approach to modulate the photophysical behaviours of annulenes, highlighting their applicability in next-generation electronic and optoelectronic systems.</description>

      <title>Tuning Molecular Motors with Tert-Butyl and Fluorinated Tert-Butyl Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of modifying substituents in the rotor group of five second generation molecular motors is estimated by theoretical calculations. The rotational speed is estimated by calculating the rate limiting step, the thermal helix inversion, as well as the competing backward transition using harmonic transition state theory with energy and atomic forces obtained from density functional theory. First, a methyl group at the stereogenic center is replaced with a tert-butyl (tBu) group and the rotational speed is found to increase due to reduced lifetime of the metastable state. For two of the rotors, comparison can be made with experimental measurements and the calculated half-life is in close agreement. Secondly, the effect of substituting the nine hydrogen atoms in the tBu group with fluorine atoms is studied and this is found to increase the rotational rate further without significantly altering the molecular structure. The excitation wavelength of both the stable and metastable states is calculated and the separation of the absorption peaks is found to increase by the tBu substitution and even more so by the fluorinated tBu substitution, up to 40 nm. These findings can help develop a strategy for designing molecular motors with a rotational speed that best fits a given application.</description>

      <title>Reduced-Cost Four-Component Relativistic Double Ionization Potential Equation-of-Motion Coupled-Cluster Approaches with 4-Hole--2-Particle Excitations and Three-Body Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The double ionization potential (DIP) equation-of-motion (EOM) coupled-cluster (CC) method with 4-hole--2-particle (4$h$-2$p$) excitations on top of the CC with singles, doubles, and triples calculation, abbreviated as DIP-EOMCCSDT(4$h$-2$p$), along with its perturbative DIP-EOMCCSD(T)(a)(4$h$-2$p$) approximation, are extended to a relativistic four-component (4c) framework. In addition, we introduce and test a new computationally practical DIP-EOMCC approach, which we call DIP-EOMCCSD(T)($\tilde{a}$)(4$h$-2$p$), that approximates the treatment of 4$h$-2$p$ correlations within the DIP-EOMCCSD(T)(a) (4$h$-2$p$) method and reduces the $\mathscr{N}^8$ scaling characterizing DIP-EOMCCSDT(4$h$-2$p$) and DIP-EOMCCSD(T)(a)(4$h$-2$p$) to $\mathscr{N}^7$ with the system size $\mathscr{N}$. Further improvements in computational efficiency are obtained using the frozen natural spinor (FNS) approximation to reduce the numbers of unoccupied spinors entering the correlated steps of the DIP-EOMCC calculations according to a well-defined occupation-number-based threshold. The resulting 4c-FNS-DIP-EOMCC approaches are used to compute DIPs for the series of inert gas atoms from argon to radon as well as the vertical DIPs in \Cltwo{}, \Brtwo{}, HBr, and HI, which have been experimentally examined in the past. We demonstrate that, when using complete basis set extrapolations and FNS truncation thresholds of $10^{-4.5}$, the 4c-FNS-DIP-EOMCCSD(T)($\tilde{a}$)(4$h$-2$p$) calculations are capable of predicting DIPs in agreement with experimental data, improving upon their nonrelativistic and spin-free scalar-relativistic counterparts, particularly when examining DIPs characterized by stronger spin-orbit coupling effects.</description>

      <title>Fluorescence-detected Wavepacket Interferometry reveals time-varying Exciton Relaxation Pathways in single Light-Harvesting Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photosynthesis relies on efficient energy relaxation within the excited-state manifold of pigment-protein complexes. Since the protein scaffold is rather flexible, the resulting energetic and structural disorder gives rise to a complex excited-state energy level structure that fluctuates on all time scales. Although the impact of such fluctuations on relaxation processes is known, the precise exciton states involved in relaxation as well as the nature of the vibrational modes driving relaxation are under debate. Here single pigment-protein complexes from a photosynthetic purple bacterium are excited with two identical ultrashort phase-locked pulses producing two exciton wave packets that can interfere. This leads to a modulation of the emission intensity as a function of the delay time between the pulses that fades out within about 100 fs due to fluctuating environments on those time scales. For several single complexes we find variations of the interference patterns on time scale of several 10 s that reveal fluctuations in the energy relaxation pathways towards the lowest-energy exciton states. This relaxation is driven by temporal variations in the coupling between electronic excitations and low-frequency vibrational modes.</description>

      <title>Exploring new construction schemes for extended-hierarchy CI (ehCI) wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the work of Loos et al. on hierarchy CI (hCI) we propose an extended way of partitioning the Hilbert space by combining the excitation and the seniority sectors in a more general way. We define the hierarchy parameter, h, involving two "weights" (alphas), measuring the importance of excitation (e) and seniority (s) contributions to the wavefunction according to: h = {\alpha}1.e + {\alpha}2.s. We test these new CI methods on the dissociation of chemical systems and analyze them based on the importance of these contributions.</description>

      <title>Mixed Quantum-Classical Approaches to Spin Current and Polarization Dynamics in Chiral Molecular Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral molecular junctions offer a promising platform for realizing chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS), where spin filtering occurs without external magnetic fields. Here, we investigate spin transport in such junctions by combining quantum master equation (QME) methods for purely electronic dynamics with surface hopping (SH) and mean-field Ehrenfest (MF) approaches to incorporate electron-phonon coupling. Our results show that transient spin polarization arises but ultimately decays to zero at long times. We find that bias voltage, molecular length, and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strongly influence the spin current dynamics: higher bias enhances spin current but reduces polarization, while longer molecules and stronger SOC amplify transient polarization. Including electron-phonon coupling modifies current-voltage characteristics, enhancing spin currents at intermediate bias but suppressing them at high bias, while leaving the polarization dynamics largely unchanged. These findings highlight the interplay between electronic and vibrational effects in CISS and provide guidance for designing molecular spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric properties of defective scandium nitride nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition-metal nitrides (TMNs) are currently being studied for potential applications in energy conversion. In this work, we used the Landauer approach to relate the various effects contributing to the thermoelectric efficiency of scandium nitride (ScN) to their microscopic origins. We model the impact of electronic and structural modifications induced by oxygen impurities and spatial vacancies on electronic transport in ScN nanostructures. Taking advantage of the results of our calculations, we propose a theoretical interpretation of recent experimental results revealing a strong dependence of the thermoelectric properties of ScN thin films on procedural variations during fabrication. The thermoelectric properties of ScN are decisively influenced by structural and electronic factors arising from defects or impurities. Our findings highlight the potential of this theoretical approach in studying thermoelectricity and uncovering future strategies to improve thermoelectric efficiency.</description>

      <title>Statistics makes a difference: Machine learning adsorption dynamics of functionalized cyclooctine on Si(001) at DFT accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interpretation of experiments on reactive semiconductor surfaces requires statistically significant sampling of molecular dynamics, but conventional ab initio methods are limited due to prohibitive computational costs. Machine-learning interatomic potentials provide a promising solution, bridging the gap between the chemical accuracy of short ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and the extensive sampling required to simulate experiment. Using ethinyl-functionalized cyclooctyne adsorption on Si(001) as a model system, we demonstrate that conventional AIMD undersamples the configurational space, resulting in discrepancies with scanning tunnelling microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data. To resolve these inconsistencies, we employ pre-trained equivariant message-passing neural networks, fine-tuned on only a few thousand AIMD snapshots, and integrate them into a "molecular-gun" workflow. This approach generates 10,000 independent trajectories more than 1,000 times faster than AIMD. These simulations recover rare intermediates, clarify the competition between adsorption motifs, and reproduce the experimentally dominant on-top [2+2] cycloaddition geometry. Our results show that fine-tuning of pre-trained foundational models enables statistically converged, chemically accurate simulations of bond-forming and bond-breaking events on complex surfaces, providing a scalable route to reconcile atomistic theory with experimental ensemble measurements in semiconductor functionalization.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gambling: Best-Arm Strategies for Generator Selection in Adaptive Variational Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive variational algorithms suffer from prohibitively high measurement costs during the generator selection step, since energy gradients must be estimated for a large operator pool. This scaling bottleneck limits their applicability to larger molecular systems on near-term quantum devices. We address this challenge by reformulating generator selection as a Best Arm Identification (BAI) problem, where the goal is to identify the generator with the largest energy gradient using as few measurements as possible. To solve it, we employ the Successive Elimination algorithm, which adaptively allocates measurements and discards unpromising candidates early. Numerical experiments on molecular systems demonstrate that this approach substantially reduces the number of measurements required while preserving ground-state energy accuracy. By cutting measurement overhead without sacrificing performance, our method makes adaptive variational algorithms more practical for near-term quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Towards universal property prediction in Cartesian space: TACE is all you need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has revolutionized atomistic simulations and materials science, yet current approaches often depend on spherical-harmonic representations. Here we introduce the Tensor Atomic Cluster Expansion and Tensor Moment Potential, the first unified framework formulated entirely in Cartesian space for the systematic prediction of arbitrary structure-determined tensorial properties. TACE achieves this by decomposing atomic environments into a complete hierarchy of (irreducible) Cartesian tensors, ensuring symmetry-consistent representations that naturally encode invariance and equivariance constraints. Beyond geometry, TACE incorporates universal embeddings that flexibly integrate diverse attributes including basis sets, charges, magnetic moments and field perturbations. This allows explicit control over external invariants and equivariants in the prediction process. Long-range interactions are also accurately described through the Latent Ewald Summation module within the short-range approximation, providing a rigorous yet computationally efficient treatment of electrostatic interactions. We demonstrate that TACE attains accuracy, stability, and efficiency on par with or surpassing leading equivariant frameworks across finite molecules and extended materials, including in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, spectra, hessians, external-field response, charged systems, magnetic systems, multi-fidelity training, and heterogeneous catalytic systems. Crucially, TACE bridges scalar and tensorial modeling and establishes a Cartesian-space paradigm that unifies and extends beyond the design space of spherical-harmonic-based methods. This work lays the foundation for a new generation of universal atomistic machine learning models capable of systematically capturing the rich interplay of geometry, fields and material properties within a single coherent framework.</description>

      <title>Chaotic scattering and heating in cold ion-atom collisions: two sides of the same coin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the classical dynamics of a Paul-trapped ion in a low-density bath of atoms above 1 $\mu\textrm{K}$. We find that lower energy collisions with more massive atoms, especially at energies less than the initial micromotion heating, are more likely to form atom-ion complexes. These complexes evolve in a fractal structure for every scattering observable, showing non-hyperbolic chaotic dynamics. To explore the chaotic dynamics, we use a GPU-accelerated methodology allowing us to run over $3\times 10^{8}$ trajectories of a $^{174}$Yb$^+$ and different atoms. As a result, after analyzing the dynamics as a function of the atom species, collision energy, trap parameters, and ion-atom potential depth, we find a link between heating and the onset of chaos in the first atom-ion interaction that occurs when a low-density atomic bath is merged with a trapped ion.</description>

Abstract: The technology of silicon anodes appears to be reaching maturity, with high-energy Si cells already in pilot-scale production. However, the performance of these systems can be difficult to replicate in academic settings, making it challenging to translate research findings into solutions that can be implemented by the battery industry. Part of this difficulty arises from the lack of access to engineered Si particles and anodes, as electrode formulations and the materials themselves have become valuable intellectual property for emerging companies. Here, we summarize the efforts by Argonne's Cell Analysis, Modeling, and Prototyping (CAMP) Facility in developing Si-based prototypes made entirely from commercially available materials. We describe the many challenges we encountered when testing high-loading electrodes (&gt; 5 mAh/cm2) and discuss strategies to mitigate them. With the right electrode and electrolyte design, we show that our pouch cells containing &gt; 70 wt% SiOx can achieve 600-1,000 cycles at C/3 and meet projected energy targets of 700 Wh/L and 350 Wh/kg. These results provide a practical reference for research teams seeking to advance silicon-anode development using accessible materials.</description>

Abstract: Computing excited states of many-body quantum Hamiltonians is a fundamental challenge in computational physics and chemistry, with state-of-the-art methods broadly classified into variational (critical point search) and linear response approaches. The K\"ahler manifold formalism provides a uniform framework which naturally accommodates both strategies for a wide range of variational models, including Hartree-Fock, CASSCF, Full CI, and adiabatic TDDFT. In particular, this formalism leads to a systematic and straightforward way to obtain the final equations of linear response theory for nonlinear models, which provides, in the case of mean-field models (Hartree-Fock and DFT), a simple alternative to Casida's derivation. We detail the mathematical structure of Hamiltonian dynamics on K\"ahler manifolds, establish connections to standard quantum chemistry equations, and provide theoretical and numerical comparisons of excitation energy computation schemes at the Hartree-Fock level.</description>

Abstract: In the field of quantum machine learning (QML), parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) -- constructed using a combination of fixed and tunable quantum gates -- provide a promising hybrid framework for tackling complex machine learning problems. Despite numerous proposed applications, there remains limited exploration of datasets relevant to quantum chemistry. In this study, we investigate the potential benefits and limitations of PQCs on two chemically meaningful datasets: (1) the BSE49 dataset, containing bond separation energies for 49 different classes of chemical bonds, and (2) a dataset of water conformations, where coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) wavefunctions are predicted from lower-level electronic structure methods using the data-driven coupled-cluster (DDCC) approach. We construct a comprehensive set of 168 PQCs by combining 14 data encoding strategies with 12 variational ans{\"a}tze, and evaluate their performance on circuits with 5 and 16 qubits. Our initial analysis examines the impact of circuit structure on model performance using state-vector simulations. We then explore how circuit depth and training set size influence model performance. Finally, we assess the performance of the best-performing PQCs on current quantum hardware, using both noisy simulations ("fake" backends) and real quantum devices. Our findings underscore the challenges of applying PQCs to chemically relevant problems that are straightforward for classical machine learning methods but remain non-trivial for quantum approaches.</description>
