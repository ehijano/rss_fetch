      <title>Numerical Investigation of the Effect of a Magnetic Field on the Transport of Oxygen in Air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of magnetisation forces in a binary mixture of gases characterised by large differences in magnetic susceptibility are studied using numerical simulations, with a focus on the differential diffusion of the species and the role of the gradient of mixture composition on the flow field resulting from magnetically-induced forces. A quiescent binary mixture of nitrogen and oxygen, representative of air, confined between two parallel plates is considered. In all simulations, a gradient of $\mathbf{B}^2$, the square of the magnetic flux density magnitude, uniform and directed normal to the walls is imposed. Cases characterised by different pressures, different strengths of $\nabla(\mathbf{B}^2)$, and different initial gradients of species composition are investigated, while the same initial temperature is used in all cases. Non-dimensional groups related to the examined configuration are proposed. In cases characterised by an initially uniform mixture composition, species tend to separate and accumulate at opposite walls, due to differential magnetic forces arising from the differences in magnetic susceptibility. For a given strength of $\nabla(\mathbf{B}^2)$, the effect of the magnetic field on the separation of species increases with decreasing pressure.In addition to species separation, it is shown that an initial gradient in the mixture composition perpendicular to $\nabla(\mathbf{B}^2)$ induces a significant change in the velocity field, which enhances the transport of species. This effect is due to a lack of alignment between the gradient of averaged magnetic susceptibility and $\nabla(\mathbf{B}^2)$ and could be exploited to achieve targeted mixing using engineered magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>JAX-Shock: A Differentiable, GPU-Accelerated, Shock-Capturing Neural Solver for Compressible Flow Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding shock-solid interactions remains a central challenge in compressiblefluiddynamics. WepresentJAX-Shock: afully-differentiable,GPU-accelerated, high-order shock-capturing solver for efficient simulation of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. Built entirely in JAX, the framework leverages automatic differentiation to enable gradient-based optimization, parameter inference, and end-to-end training of deep learning-augmented models. The solver integrates fifth-order WENO reconstruction with an HLLC flux to resolve shocks and discontinuities with high fidelity. To handle complex geometries, an immersed boundary method is implemented for accurate representation of solid interfaces within the compressible flow field. In addition, we introduce a neural flux module trained to augment the numerical fluxes with data-driven corrections, significantly improving accuracy and generalization. JAX-Shock also supports sequence-to-sequence learning for shock interaction prediction and reverse-mode inference to identify key physical parameters from data. Compared with purely data-driven approaches, JAX-Shock enhances generalization while preserving physical consistency. The framework establishes a flexible platform for differentiable physics, learning-based modeling, and inverse design in compressible flow regimes dominated by complex shock-solid interactions.</description>

      <title>Impact force and spreading characteristics of droplet impact on cylindrical surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Droplet impact phenomena are ubiquitous in both nature and industry. Existing studies of droplet impact have focused on the kinematics of droplet impact on flat surfaces, whereas research on cylindrical surfaces remains relatively limited, particularly from a force-based perspective. Here, droplet impact on cylindrical surfaces is studied by numerical simulation, with particular attention to the spreading behavior and impact force acting on the wall. In the deposition mode, a single peak appears in the impact force curve, which corresponds to the rapid transfer of the droplet's initial momentum. In the rebound mode, two distinct peaks are observed, and the second peak arises from the reaction force during the retraction process. Increasing the surface wettability causes the asymmetry coefficient, the ratio of the maximum spreading lengths in the azimuthal and axial directions of the cylinder, to first decrease and then gradually approach a constant, while the effect of the surface wettability on the initial impact force is negligible. As the Weber number We increases, the first dimensionless peak of the impact force $F_{p1}^{*}$ approaches a constant, and the relationship can be expressed as $F_{p1}^{*}={\beta}_1+{{\beta}_2}{{We}^{-1}}$ (where ${\beta }_1$ and ${\beta }_2$ are constants). The dimensionless maximum spreading area, dimensionless maximum spreading length, dimensionless maximum spreading angle, and asymmetry coefficient all exhibit power-law relationships with the Weber and Ohnesorge numbers. Furthermore, an increase in the diameter ratio of the cylinder and the droplet leads to a reduction in the asymmetry coefficient and an increase in the first dimensionless peak of the impact force.</description>

      <title>Numerical study on fast spectral evolution due to double resonance and applicability of generalized kinetic equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that for a two-layer fluid system, the kinetic equation governing the evolution of the spectrum of the wave field given by the standard wave turbulence theory (WTT) breaks down due to the existence of a "double resonance", and the spectrum can evolve on a time scale much faster than that predicted by the standard WTT. In this study, using a simplified model for a two-layer fluid system, the applicability of the generalized kinetic equation (GKE) for such a situation is examined numerically. It is shown that the GKE can reproduce the appearance of a sharp peak in the surface wave spectrum due to double resonance, but it overestimates the growth of the peak, consequently failing to quantitatively describe the temporal evolution of the spectrum correctly, particularly near the double resonance point.</description>

      <title>Low-wavenumber wall pressure fluctuations in turbulent flows within concentric annular ducts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compressible direct numerical simulations of turbulent channel flows in concentric annular ducts of height $2\delta$ are performed to study the low-wavenumber wall pressure fluctuations (WPF) over cylindrical walls at a bulk Mach number $M_b = 0.4$ and bulk Reynolds number $Re_b=3000$. The radius of the inner cylinder $R$ is varied between $0.2\delta$, $\delta$, $2\delta$ and $\infty$. As $R$ decreases, the one-point power spectral density of the WPF decreases at intermediate but increases at high frequencies. When $R$ decreases, the 1D (streamwise) wavenumber-frequency spectrum of the WPF decreases at high wavenumbers. At low wavenumbers, however, as $R$ reduces to $0.2\delta$ the 1D wavenumber-frequency spectrum exhibits multiple spectral peaks whose strengths increase with frequency. Examination of the 2D wavenumber-frequency spectra shows that these represent acoustic duct modes that closely match theoretical predictions. The acoustic modes of higher radial orders exhibit increasingly high amplitude on the inner than on the outer walls. The low-wavenumber components of the $0$th-order (azimuthal) 2D wavenumber-frequency spectrum are of great importance in practice, and their magnitude increases as $R$ reduces; this increase is increasingly pronounced at higher frequencies. Analytical modelling and numerical validation show that this increase appears to arise from the ``geometric'' effects connected with the Green's function, and they are generated mainly by radial and azimuthal disturbances. Disturbances closer to the wall are shown to be increasingly important in WPF generation as $R$ reduces, which highlights a potential in WPF control using wall treatment on thin cylinders.</description>

      <title>Ensemble of Fixed Points in Multi-branch Shell Models of Turbulent Cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stationary solutions of a shell model of turbulence defined on a dyadic tree topology are studied. Each node's amplitude is expressed as the product of amplitude multipliers associated with its ancestors, providing a recursive representation of the cascade process. A geometrical rule governs the tree growth, and we prove the existence of a continuum of fixed points, including the Kolmogorov solution, that sustain a strictly forward energy cascade. Sampling along randomly chosen branches defines a homogeneous Markov chain, enabling a stochastic characterization of extended self-similarity and intermittency through the spectral properties of the associated Feynman-Kac operators. Numerical simulations confirm the theoretical predictions, showing that multi-branch shell models offer a minimal yet physically rich framework for exploring the complexity of nonlinear energy transfer across scales.</description>

      <title>Turbulent Diffusion-Cascade Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the decay region around the centreline of three qualitatively different turbulent plane wakes, the turbulence is non-homogeneous and two-point turbulent diffusion counteracts the turbulence cascade all the way down to scales smaller than the Taylor length. It is found that the sum of the inter-space transfer rate and the horizontal part of the inter-scale transfer rate of horizontal two-point turbulent kinetic energy is approximately proportional to the turbulence dissipation rate in the inertial range with a constant of proportionality between $-0.6$ and $-1$ depending on wake and location within the wake, except at the near-field edge of the decay region.</description>

      <title>Mixed data-source transfer learning for a turbulence model augmented physics-informed neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative for extracting unknown quantities from experimental data. Despite this potential, much of the recent literature has relied on sparse, high-fidelity data from direct numerical simulations (DNS) rather than experimental sources like particle image velocimetry (PIV), which are not suitable for validating all reconstructed quantities. In the case of PIV, for example, pressure is not directly measured and the data have imperfections such as noise contamination or a limited field of view. To overcome these limitations, we present a novel methodology where PINNs are first trained on a RANS simulation such that it learns all states at every location in the domain. We then apply transfer learning which updates the PINN using sub-sampled PIV data. The resulting predictions are in significantly better agreement with the full PIV dataset than PINNs which are trained on experimental data only. This work builds on the recent literature by integrating a Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model and applying hard constraints to the no-slip wall boundary condition. We apply this new methodology to a two-dimensional NACA 0012 airfoil inclined at an angle of attack, $\alpha$ = 15 degrees, for two Reynolds numbers of Re = 10,000 and 75,000. The proposed methodology is initially validated using large eddy simulation (LES) data and then demonstrated on experimental PIV data. Our transfer learning approach results in improved predictions and a reduction in training time when compared to using a random network initialisation.</description>

      <title>Supersonic jet dynamics from two-cavitation-bubble interactions: acceleration, tip fragmentation and penetration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study experimentally and numerically investigates the dynamics of a high-speed liquid jet generated from the interaction of two tandem cavitation bubbles, termed bubble 1 and bubble 2, depending on their generation sequence. In our experiments, two near-identical, highly-energized cavitation bubbles were generated using an underwater electric discharge method, and their transient interactions were captured using a high-speed camera. We identify three distinct jet regimes that emerge from the tip of bubble 2: conical, umbrella-shaped, and spraying jets, characterized by variations in the initial bubble-bubble distance and the initiation time difference. Our numerical simulations using both Volume of Fluid and Boundary Integral methods reproduce the experimental observations quite well and explain the mechanism of jet acceleration. We show that the transition between the regimes is governed by the spatiotemporal characteristics of the pressure wave induced by the collapse of bubble 1, which impacts the high-curvature tip of bubble 2. Specifically, a conical jet forms when the pressure wave impacts the bubble tip prior to its contraction, while an umbrella-shaped jet develops when this impact occurs after the contraction. The spraying jets result from the breakup of the bubble tip, exhibiting mist-like and needle-like morphologies with velocities ranging from 10 to over 1200 m/s. Remarkably, we observe that the penetration distance of spraying jets exceeds ten times the maximum bubble radius, making them ideal for long-range, controlled fluid delivery. Finally, phase diagrams for jet velocity and penetration distance in the $\gamma-\theta$ parameter space are established to provide a practical reference for biomedical applications, such as needle-free injection and micro-pumping.</description>

      <title>Deformable bodies in a 3-dimensional viscous flow: Vorticity-Stream vector formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When simulating three-dimensional flows interacting with deformable and elastic obstacles, current methods often encounter complexities in the governing equations and challenges in numerical implementation. In this work, we introduce a novel numerical formulation for simulating incompressible viscous flows at low Reynolds numbers in the presence of deformable interfaces. Our method employs a vorticity-stream vector formulation that significantly simplifies the fluid solver, transforming it into a set of coupled Poisson problems. The body-fluid interface is modeled using a phase field, allowing for the incorporation of various free-energy models to account for membrane bending and surface tension. In contrast to existing three-dimensional approaches, such as Lattice Boltzmann Methods or boundary-integral techniques, our formulation is lightweight and grounded in classical fluid mechanics principles, making it implementable with standard finite-difference techniques. We demonstrate the capabilities of our method by simulating the evolution of a single vesicle or droplet in Newtonian Poiseuille and Couette flows under different free-energy models, successfully recovering canonical axisymmetric shapes and stress profiles. Although this work primarily focuses on single-body dynamics in Newtonian suspending fluids, the framework can be extended to include body forces, inertial effects, and viscoelastic media.</description>

      <title>PINN-Based Solution for a Diffusion Controlled Droplet Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study diffusion-controlled growth of a spherical droplet with a moving boundary using a physics-informed neural network (PINN) formulation. The governing diffusion equation is coupled to the interfacial mass balance, with the droplet radius treated as an additional trainable function of time. The PINN accurately reproduces the self-similar growth law and concentration profiles for a wide range of initial droplet radii, demonstrating convergence toward the asymptotic diffusive regime. The proposed approach provides a flexible and computationally efficient framework for solving moving-boundary diffusion problems and can be readily extended to include additional physical effects.</description>

      <title>Divide and Conquer: Cluster and manifold-based interpretation of complex flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework for a global description of the dynamics of complex flows via clusterized spatial representations of the flow, isolating and identifying local dynamics, retrieving different Space-Time Cluster-Based Network Models (ST-CNMs). The key enabler is the partitioning of the domain based on a nonlinear manifold learning approach, in which spatial points are clustered based on the similarity of their dynamics, as observed in their compact embedding in manifold coordinates. The method receives as input time-resolved flow fields. From these, the spatial manifold is computed through isometric mapping applied to the vorticity time histories at each spatial location. An unsupervised clustering method, applied in the manifold space, partitions the full flow domain into subdomains. The dynamics of each subdomain are then described with cluster-based modeling. The method is demonstrated on two flow-field datasets obtained with a direct numerical simulation of a fluidic pinball under periodic forcing and with two-dimensional particle image velocimetry measurements of a transitional jet flow. The spatial manifold-based flow partitioning identifies regions with similar dynamics in an automated way. For both cases, ST-CNM identifies local dynamics that are not captured by a global approach. In particular, vortex shedding and vortex pairing dynamics are isolated in the jet flow experiment. The proposed fully automated domain partitioning method will benefit the structural description of controlled flows and unveil the actuation mechanisms at play.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the scale dependence of the Reynolds number in correlated fluctuating fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the incompressible Navier--Stokes equation, the Reynolds number ($\mathrm{Re}$) is a dimensionless parameter quantifying the relative importance of inertial over viscous forces. In the low-$\mathrm{Re}$ regime ($\mathrm{Re} \ll 1$), the flow dynamics are commonly approximated by the linear Stokes equation. Here we show that, within the framework of spatially fluctuating hydrodynamics, this linearization breaks down when the thermal noise is spatially correlated, even if $\mathrm{Re} \ll 1$. We perform direct numerical simulations of spatially correlated fluctuating hydrodynamics in both one and two dimensions. In one dimension, the linearized dynamics exhibit significantly slower relaxation of high-wavenumber Fourier modes than the full nonlinear dynamics. In two dimensions, an analogous discrepancy arises in the particle velocity autocorrelation function, which decays more slowly in the correlated linear Stokes case than in the correlated nonlinear Navier--Stokes case. In both settings, spatial correlations inhibit viscous momentum diffusion at small scales, leading to prolonged relaxation under the linear dynamics, whereas nonlinear mode coupling accelerates small-scale relaxation. Thus, the interplay between nonlinear coupling and viscous damping becomes scale dependent, invalidating the use of a single global Reynolds number. Taken together, these findings show that, for spatially correlated fluctuating fluids, the effective Reynolds number must be reinterpreted as a scale-dependent quantity.</description>

      <title>The Semigeostrophic-Euler Limit: Lifespan Lower Bounds and $O(\varepsilon)$ Velocity Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the two-dimensional semigeostrophic (SG$^{\varepsilon}$) system on the torus in the small-amplitude scaling and its convergence to incompressible Euler in the dual (geostrophic) formulation. Within a natural bootstrap regime for the Poisson/Monge-Amp\`ere coupling, we obtain two main results. First, we prove a lifespan lower bound in slow time with a \emph{log-log} gain; in physical time this yields persistence at least on the scale $\varepsilon^{-1}|\log\log \varepsilon|$. Second, on any bootstrap window we establish a strong velocity-stability estimate with rate $O(\varepsilon)$ in $L^2$, complementing Loeper's $O(1/\varepsilon)$ existence time and $\varepsilon^{2/3}$ weak convergence rate. The proofs combine the incompressible transport structure with a sharp elliptic control of the velocity gradient and a flow-based stability argument. Overall, the results give a clean quantitative bridge from SG$^{\varepsilon}$ to Euler that is both longer-lived (by a log-log factor) and quantitatively stable in velocity.</description>

Abstract: We study experimentally a symmetrical rigid foil performing pitching oscillations around a mean incidence angle ($\alpha_{m}$) with respect to an incoming flow in a hydrodynamic channel at a constant velocity where the Reynolds number according to the chord of the foil is, $Re_{c} = \rho U_{\infty} c / \mu = 14400$. The problem is inspired from the pumping maneuver used by athletes on the new hydrofoil-based windsurf boards. The goal of the study is to quantify the forces on this configuration by varying the pitching kinematics characterized by the Strouhal number ($St_{A} = fA/U_{\infty}$), from 0 to 0.27, and the mean incidence angle $\alpha_{m}$, from 0 to 30$^{\circ}$, of the foil. The force measurements show a high lift production and the delay of the stall angle according to $St_A$ which can be linked to previous studies about the generation of vortices at the trailing edge. A general trend of decrease is observed for the drag force coefficient in pitching compare to the static case. For the highest Strouhal numbers tested, drag coefficient can become negative (thrust) in a range of $\alpha_{m}$ up to 15$^{\circ}$ in specific case. We present the various impacts of the amplitude of beating and the frequency of pitching on the aerodynamic forces for small mean incidence angle and high mean incidence angle (above the static stall angle). By using a sport-mimetic approach, we transform the measured lift $\&amp;$ drag forces into a propulsive and drifting force. Doing so allows us to investigate race strategies. We investigate the generation of propulsion in upwind conditions.</description>

      <title>Whipped and mixed warm clouds in the deep sea</title>

Abstract: Turbulence is indispensable to redistribute nutrients for all life forms larger than microbial, on land and in the ocean. Yet, the development of deep-sea turbulence was not studied in three dimensions to date. As a disproportionate laboratory, an array of nearly 3000 high-resolution temperature sensors had been installed for three years on the flat 2500-m deep bottom of the Mediterranean Sea. The time series from the half-cubic hectometer mooring-array allows for the creation of unique movies of deep-sea water motions. Although temperature differences are typically 0.001degrC, variable convection-turbulence is observed as expected from geothermal heating through the flat seafloor. During about 40% of the time, an additional turbulence, 3 times stronger in magnitude, is observed from slantwise advected warmer waters to pass in turbulent clouds. Besides turbulent clouds and seafloor heating, movies also reveal weakly turbulent interfacial-wave breakdown that commonly occurs in the open ocean far away from boundaries.</description>

      <title>Guiding diffusion models to reconstruct flow fields from sparse data</title>

Abstract: The reconstruction of unsteady flow fields from limited measurements is a challenging and crucial task for many engineering applications. Machine learning models are gaining popularity for solving this problem due to their ability to learn complex patterns from data and to generalize across diverse conditions. Among these, diffusion models have emerged as being particularly powerful for generative tasks, producing high-quality samples by iteratively refining noisy inputs. In contrast to other methods, these generative models are capable of reconstructing the smallest scales of the fluid spectrum. In this work, we introduce a novel sampling method for diffusion models that enables the reconstruction of high-fidelity samples by guiding the reverse process using the available sparse data. Moreover, we enhance the reconstructions with available physics knowledge using a conflict-free update method during training. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on 2 and 3-dimensional turbulent flow data. Our method consistently outperforms other diffusion-based methods in predicting the fluid's structure and in pixel-wise accuracy. This study underscores the remarkable potential of diffusion models in reconstructing flow field data, paving the way for leveraging them in fluid dynamics research and applications ranging from super-resolution to reconstructions of experiments.</description>

      <title>Relaxation and statistical equilibria in generalised two-dimensional flows</title>

Abstract: We study relaxation toward statistical equilibrium states of inviscid generalised two-dimensional flows, where the generalised vorticity $q$ is related to the streamfunction $\psi$ via $q=(-\nabla^2)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\psi$, with the parameter $\alpha$ controlling the strength of the nonlinear interactions. The equilibrium solutions exhibit an $\alpha \mapsto -\alpha$ symmetry, under which generalised energy $E_G$ and enstrophy $\Omega_G$ are interchanged. For initial conditions that produce condensates, we find long-lived quasi-equilibrium states far from the thermalised solutions we derive using canonical ensemble theory. Using numerical simulations we find that in the limit of vanishing nonlinearity, as $\alpha \to 0$, the time required for partial thermalisation $\tau_{th}$ scales like $1/\alpha$. So, the relaxation of the system toward equilibrium becomes increasingly slow as the system approaches the weakly nonlinear limit. This behaviour is also captured by a reduced model we derive using multiple scale asymptotics. These findings highlight the role of nonlinearity in controlling the relaxation toward equilibrium and that the inherent symmetry of the statistical equilibria determines the direction of the turbulent cascades.</description>

      <title>Pressure Drop in Non-Spherical Packed Beds: Influence of Geometry and Reynolds Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding fluid flow through porous media with complex geometries is essential for improving the design and operation of packed-bed reactors. Most existing studies focus on spherical packings, having as a consequence that accurate models for irregular interstitial geometries are scarce. In this study, we numerically investigated the flow through a set of packed-bed geometries consisting of square bars stacked on top of each other and arranged in disk-shaped modules. Rotation of each module allows the generation of a variety of geometrical configurations at Reynolds numbers of up to 200 (based on the bar size). Simulations were carried out using the open-source solver OpenFOAM. Selected cases (e.g., $\alpha = 30^\circ$, $\mathrm{Re}_\mathrm{p} = 100, 200$) were compared against Particle Image Velocimetry measurements. Results reveal that, based on the relative rotation angle, the realized geometries can be classified as channel-like ($\alpha \leq 20^\circ$ and $\alpha = 90^\circ$) and lattice-like, fundamentally altering the friction factor. Furthermore, the maximum friction factor obtained in the creeping regime occurred at $\alpha = 25^\circ$, whereas in the inertial regime, this occurred at $\alpha = 60^\circ$. Varying the rotation angle also affects the transition from the viscous to the inertial regime.</description>
