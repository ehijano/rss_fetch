      <title>The fundamental theorem of asset pricing with and without transaction costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a version of the fundamental theorem of asset pricing (FTAP) in continuous time that is based on the strict no-arbitrage condition and that is applicable to both frictionless markets and markets with proportional transaction costs. We consider a market with a single risky asset whose ask price process is higher than or equal to its bid price process. Neither the concatenation property of the set of wealth processes, that is used in the proof of the frictionless FTAP, nor some boundedness property of the trading volume of admissible strategies usually argued with in models with a nonvanishing bid-ask spread need to be satisfied in our model.</description>

      <title>A parametric approach to the estimation of convex risk functionals based on Wasserstein distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.14340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a static setting for the assessment of risk in the context of mathematical finance and actuarial science that takes into account model uncertainty in the distribution of a possibly infinite-dimensional risk factor. We allow for perturbations around a baseline model, measured via Wasserstein distance, and we investigate to which extent this form of probabilistic imprecision can be parametrized. The aim is to come up with a convex risk functional that incorporates a sefety margin with respect to nonparametric uncertainty and still can be approximated through parametrized models. The particular form of the parametrization allows us to develop a numerical method, based on neural networks, which gives both the value of the risk functional and the optimal perturbation of the reference measure. Moreover, we study the problem under additional constraints on the perturbations, namely, a mean and a martingale constraint. We show that, in both cases, under suitable conditions on the loss function, it is still possible to estimate the risk functional by passing to a parametric family of perturbed models, which again allows for a numerical approximation via neural networks.</description>

      <title>Multi-dimensional fractional Brownian motion in the G-setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a definition of a multi-dimensional fractional Brownian motion of Hurst index $H \in (0, 1)$ under volatility uncertainty (in short G-fBm). We study the properties of such a process and provide first results about stochastic calculus with respect to a fractional G-Brownian motion for a Hurst index $H &gt;\frac{1}{2}$ .</description>

      <title>Stochastic Expansion for the Pricing of Asian and Basket Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17684v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present closed analytical approximations for the pricing of basket options, also applicable to Asian options with discrete averaging under the Black-Scholes model with time-dependent parameters. The formulae are obtained by using a stochastic Taylor expansion around a log-normal proxy model and are found to be highly accurate for Asian options in practice as well as for vanilla options with discrete dividends.</description>
