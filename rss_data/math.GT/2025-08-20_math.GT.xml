      <title>Psyquandle Brackets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the notion of biquandle brackets to the case of psyquandles, defining quantum enhancements of the psyquandle counting invariant for singular knots and pseudoknots. We provide examples to illustrate the computation of these invariants, establishing that the enhancement is proper. We compute a few toy examples, noting that the true power of this infinite family of invariants lies in more computationally expensive larger-cardinality psyquandles and infinite coefficient rings.</description>

      <title>Counting hyperbolic 4-manifolds with vanishing Seiberg-Witten invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ian Agol and Francesco Lin proved the existence of hyperbolic four-manifolds with vanishing Seiberg-Witten invariants. We prove that the number of such manifolds of volume at most $v$ is asymptotically bounded by $v^{cv}$ considered up to commensurability, which has the same form as the lower bound and upper bound of the number of hyperbolic four-manifolds of volume at most $v$ proved by Tsachik Gelander and Arie Levit.</description>

      <title>On Topology of the Infinite-Dimensional Space of Fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work serves as an opening and basis of an ongoing program investigating topological and geometric aspects of the moduli space of smooth fiberings on a manifold. The present paper focuses on the algebraic and differential topology of this space, and particularly addresses the following three quests in a top-down manner: the classification, for each class the path components, and for each component the homotopy type (as loosely analogous to the those three for studying the moduli of smooth structures: exotic manifolds, mapping class groups, and Smale-type conjectures). The last of the three is infinite-dimensional in nature, as the corresponding moduli space is shown to inherit the structure of a smooth Fr\'echet manifold from the diffeomorphism group through a (infinite-dimensional) principal bundle, with which we establish further connections with the Lie theory of gauge symmetries from one perspective, and with the geometric analysis of extrinsic flows from another. Concretely, we tackle the problem of finding the "homotopy core": a minimal deformation retract that encodes the topological structure of such a moduli space of fibrations; as our first examples, we gave explicit homotopy calculations for various low-dimensional cases which, combined with earlier known cases from others' work, complete the solution to this problem for dimensions up to three.</description>

      <title>Remark on twists of Frobenius algebra and link homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss twists on Frobenius algebras in the context of link homology. In his paper in 2006, Khovanov asserted that a twist of a Frobenius algebra yields an isomorphic chain complex on each link diagram. Although the result has been widely accepted for nearly two decades, a subtle gap in the original proof was found in the induction step of the construction of the isomorphism. Following discussion with Khovanov, we decided to provide a new proof. Our proof is based on a detailed analysis of configurations of circles in each state.</description>

      <title>A boundary characterization of Turaev-Viro TQFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider three-dimensional topological field theories on manifolds with boundary defects and identify explicit boundary locality conditions. These conditions imply a state sum construction of the given TQFT. As a consistency check, we prove that Turaev-Viro state sum models obey the boundary locality conditions. Recent progress (arXiv:2410.18049v1) in the description of defects in Dijkgraaf-Witten theories enables us to show that these theories likewise satisfy boundary locality. This directly implies that Dijkgraaf-Witten theories with boundary defects admit a state sum description.</description>

      <title>The Theory of Doubly Periodic Pseudo Tangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Doubly periodic tangles (DP tangles) are configurations of curves embedded in the thickened plane, invariant under translations in two transversal directions. In this paper we extend the classical theory of DP tangles by introducing the theory of {\it doubly periodic pseudo tangles} (pseudo DP tangles), which incorporate undetermined crossings called {\it precrossings}, inspired by the theory of pseudo knots. Pseudo DP tangles are defined as liftings of spatial pseudo links in the thickened torus, called {\it pseudo motifs}, and are analyzed through diagrammatic methods that account for both local and global isotopies. We emphasize on {\it pseudo cover equivalence}, a concept defining equivalence between finite covers of pseudo motif diagrams. We investigate the notion of equivalence for these structures, leading to an analogue of the Reidemeister theorem for pseudo DP tangles. Furthermore, we address the complexities introduced by pseudo cover equivalence in defining minimal pseudo motif diagrams. This work contributes to the broader understanding of periodic entangled structures and can find applications in diverse fields such as textiles, materials science and crystallography due to their periodic nature.</description>

      <title>From planar to annular to toroidal bracket polynomials for pseudo knots and links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pseudo links are equivalence classes under Reidemeister-type moves of link diagrams containing crossings with undefined over and under information. In this paper, we extend the Kauffman bracket and Jones-type polynomials from planar pseudo links to annular and toroidal pseudo links and their respective lifts from the three-space to the solid torus and the thickened torus. Moreover, since annular and toroidal pseudo links can be represented as mixed links in the three-sphere, we also introduce the respective Kauffman bracket and Jones-type polynomials for their planar mixed link diagrams. Our work provides new tools for the study of annular and toroidal pseudo links.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by geometrically capturing generic directions in Teichm\"uller space -- that is, tracking rays for random walks of the mapping class group -- we use work of Chaika--Masur--Wolf and Durham--Zalloum to construct the first examples of a sublinearly-Morse Teichm\"uller geodesic rays with minimal non-uniquely ergodic vertical foliations.</description>

      <title>Slope detection, taut foliations, and the relative L-space conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $L$-space conjecture asserts the equivalence, for prime $3$-manifolds, of three properties: not being an $L$-space ($NLS$), having a left-orderable fundamental group ($LO$), and admitting a co-orientable taut foliation ($CTF$). In this paper we introduce a relative version of the $L$-space conjecture for knot manifolds $M$, stated in terms of sets of slopes on $\partial M$ characterised (i.e. detected) by Heegaard Floer homology, left-orders, and foliations, respectively. We give a unified characterisation of slope detection, and conjecture that the relative $L$-space conjecture is equivalent to the $L$-space conjecture for toroidal manifolds. We confirm this equivalence for the properties $CTF$ and $NLS$.
  Much of our technical work lies in proving that the set of $CTF$-detected slopes on $\partial M$ is a finite union of possibly degenerate closed intervals with rational endpoints; in particular, it is closed in the space of slopes. This involves generalizing results of Tao Li on laminar branched surfaces to the setting of manifolds with boundary.
  Within the slopes detected by co-orientable taut foliations, we identify a special subset, which we call exceptional $CTF$-detected slopes. This set includes $CTF$-detected slopes whose associated Dehn fillings don't admit co-orientable taut foliations. We believe this exceptional set is important to understand. In this article, we show that the set of exceptional slopes is finite. However, many questions remain open.
  Finally, in the last section of the article we provide a structured synthesis of previous work in the area.</description>

      <title>K-differentials with prescribed singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.11654v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the local invariants that a meromorphic $k$-differential on a Riemann surface of genus $g \geq 0$ can have for $k \geq 3$. These local invariants include the orders of zeros and poles, as well as the $k$-residues at the poles. We show that for a given pattern of orders of zeros, there exists, with a few exceptions, a primitive holomorphic $k$-differential having zeros of these orders. In the meromorphic case, for genus $g \geq 1$, every expected tuple appears as a configuration of $k$-residues. On the other hand, for certain strata in genus zero, finitely many tuples (up to simultaneous scaling) do not occur as configurations of $k$-residues for a $k$-differential.</description>
