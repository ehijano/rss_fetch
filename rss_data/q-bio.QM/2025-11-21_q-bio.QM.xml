      <title>Comparing Bayesian and Frequentist Inference in Biological Models: A Comparative Analysis of Accuracy, Uncertainty, and Identifiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical models support inference and forecasting in ecology and epidemiology, but results depend on the estimation framework. We compare Bayesian and Frequentist approaches across three biological models using four datasets: Lotka-Volterra predator-prey dynamics (Hudson Bay), a generalized logistic model (lung injury and 2022 U.S. mpox), and an SEIUR epidemic model (COVID-19 in Spain). Both approaches use a normal error structure to ensure a fair comparison.
  We first assessed structural identifiability to determine which parameters can theoretically be recovered from the data. We then evaluated practical identifiability and forecasting performance using four metrics: mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), 95 percent prediction interval (PI) coverage, and weighted interval score (WIS). For the Lotka-Volterra model with both prey and predator data, we analyzed three scenarios: prey only, predator only, and both.
  The Frequentist workflow used QuantDiffForecast (QDF) in MATLAB, which fits ODE models via nonlinear least squares and quantifies uncertainty through parametric bootstrap. The Bayesian workflow used BayesianFitForecast (BFF), which employs Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling via Stan to generate posterior distributions and diagnostics such as the Gelman-Rubin R-hat statistic.
  Results show that Frequentist inference performs best when data are rich and fully observed, while Bayesian inference excels when latent-state uncertainty is high and data are sparse, as in the SEIUR COVID-19 model. Structural identifiability clarifies these patterns: full observability benefits both frameworks, while limited observability constrains parameter recovery. This comparison provides guidance for choosing inference frameworks based on data richness, observability, and uncertainty needs.</description>

      <title>How Mathematical Forms of Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy Bias Model-Optimized Predictions: Implications for Model Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The move towards personalized treatment and digital twins for cancer therapy requires a complete understanding of the mathematical models upon which these optimized simulation-based strategies are formulated. This study investigates the influence of mathematical model selection on the optimization of chemotherapy and radiotherapy protocols. By examining three chemotherapy models (log-kill, Norton-Simon, and Emax), and three radiotherapy models (linear-quadratic, proliferation saturation index, and continuous death-rate), we identify similarities and significant differences in the optimized protocols. We demonstrate how the assumptions built into the model formulations heavily influence optimal treatment dosing and sequencing, potentially leading to contradictory results. Further, we demonstrate how different model forms influence predictions in the adaptive therapy setting. As treatment decisions increasingly rely on simulation-based strategies, unexamined model assumptions can introduce bias, leading to model-dependent recommendations that may not be generalizable. This study highlights the importance of basing model selection on a full analysis of bias, sensitivity, practical parameter identifiability and/or inferred parameter posteriors, as a part of the uncertainty quantification process, rather than solely relying on information criterion. Understanding how model choice impacts predictions guiding personalized treatment planning with sufficient uncertainty quantification analysis, will lead to more robust and generalizable predictions.</description>

      <title>ProtT-Affinity: Sequence-Based Protein-Protein Binding Affinity Prediction Using ProtT5 Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the binding affinity of protein protein complexes directly from sequence remains a challenging problem, particularly in the absence of reliable structural information. Here I present ProtT Affinity, a sequence only model that combines ProtT5 embeddings with a lightweight Transformer architecture. The model is trained and evaluated on homology filtered subsets of the PDBBind database following a curation protocol consistent with prior structure based work. Across two independent test sets,ProtT Affinity reaches Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.628 and 0.459, respectively.Although its performance does not match the strongest structure based methods, it is competitive with several widely used approaches and provides a practical alternative when structural data are missing or uncertain. The results suggest that large protein language models capture features relevant to binding energetics, and that these features can be exploited to approximate affinity trends at scale.</description>

      <title>Weakly Supervised Segmentation and Classification of Alpha-Synuclein Aggregates in Brightfield Midbrain Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with the accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates, forming Lewy bodies and neuritic shape used for pathology diagnostics. Automatic analysis of immunohistochemistry histopathological images with Deep Learning provides a promising tool for better understanding the spatial organization of these aggregates. In this study, we develop an automated image processing pipeline to segment and classify these aggregates in whole-slide images (WSIs) of midbrain tissue from PD and incidental Lewy Body Disease (iLBD) cases based on weakly supervised segmentation, robust to immunohistochemical labelling variability, with a ResNet50 classifier. Our approach allows to differentiate between major aggregate morphologies, including Lewy bodies and neurites with a balanced accuracy of $80\%$. This framework paves the way for large-scale characterization of the spatial distribution and heterogeneity of alpha-synuclein aggregates in brightfield immunohistochemical tissue, and for investigating their poorly understood relationships with surrounding cells such as microglia and astrocytes.</description>

      <title>Symbiotic causal network of seagrass-bacteria-algas-diatoms interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Seagrass meadows contribute to the conservation of marine ecosystems, reduction in global warming impacts and pathogen controls. However, the decline in seagrass habitats due to environmental loads has become an urgent global issue. One way to address this issue is to better understand healthy seagrass habitats. Here, we estimate the structural characteristics of symbiotic and metabolic systems in sediments from eight coastal regions of Japan, with each region containing both seagrass-covered areas and adjacent unvegetated areas. Notably, seagrasses commonly maintain a balanced symbiotic relationship characterized by a positive association with cable bacteria (Desulfobulbaceae), nitrogen-cycling bacteria (Hyphomonadaceae), and coral algae (Corallinophycidae) and a negative association with diatoms (Diatomea). Furthermore, seagrass growth conditions influence metabolic pathways by activating nitrogen-related metabolism while attenuating methanogenesis. Our findings highlight the crucial roles of marine plants and their symbiotic systems in ensuring environmental conservation within the context of blue carbon storage across environmental gradients.</description>
