      <title>Effects of Artificial Collisions, Filtering, and Nonlocal Closure Approaches on Hermite-based Vlasov-Poisson Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetic simulations of collisionless plasmas are computationally challenging due to phase space mixing and filamentation, resulting in fine-scale velocity structures. This study compares three methods developed to reduce artifacts related to limited velocity resolution in Hermite-based Vlasov-Poisson simulations: artificial collisions, filtering, and nonlocal closure approaches. We evaluate each method's performance in approximating the linear kinetic response function and suppressing recurrence in linear and nonlinear regimes. Numerical simulations of Landau damping demonstrate that artificial collisions, particularly higher orders of the Lenard-Bernstein collisional operator, most effectively recover the correct damping rate across a range of wavenumbers. Moreover, Hou-Li filtering and nonlocal closures underdamp high wavenumber modes in linear simulations, and the Lenard- Bernstein collisional operator overdamps low wavenumber modes in both linear and nonlinear simulations. This study demonstrates that hypercollisions offer a robust approach to kinetic simulations, accurately capturing collisionless dynamics with limited velocity resolution.</description>

      <title>Invasiveness of pico- and nanosecond E-FISH on plasma bullets in nitrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electric field is the driving force behind every plasma. Electric field induced second harmonic generation (E-FISH) is a diagnostic able to obtain the electric field with high temporal and spatial resolution, is considered non-invasive and can be applied to almost any type of plasma with high sensitivity. However, the high power laser beam used as a probe in this technique, can interact with the gas and induce charges, which can subsequently influence the plasma. In this work, E-FISH is applied on non-thermal pulsed plasma jets in N2 flowing into atmospheric air. In these jets, ionization fronts propagate along the axis of the jet, which are highly reproducible and periodic. This allows for phase resolved measurements. A nanosecond and a picosecond pulsed laser, both operating at 1064 nm, are used as sources. For the first time, the obtained E-FISH signals measured with both lasers are compared to each other. The results deviate significantly between the two lasers, which can be explained by laser induced guiding of the streamers. This is observed by taking ICCD images of the plasma trajectory. At the position where the plasma crosses the laser beam path, the plasma branches. This reveals that E-FISH is also invasive under some conditions. The profiles obtained with the picosecond laser are in good qualitative agreement with previous coherent Raman scattering-based four-wave mixing results on the same plasma source and therefore the picosecond laser is considered non-invasive. In future E-FISH measurements, the influence of the laser beam on the E-FISH signal should be taken into account to prevent changing the plasma behavior. By decreasing the laser power or using a shorter laser pulse, successful measurements can be performed.</description>

      <title>Torsional Alfven Oscillation in the Regime of Firehose Instability as a Mechanism of Plasma Stratification in a Laboratory Experiment on Modeling a Coronal Arch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The compact laboratory stand ``Solar Wind'' (Inst. Appl. Phys. of Russ. Acad. Sci.) forms an arch structure of the coronal loop type, in which the plasma pressure varies from zero to values of the order of and above the magnetic pressure. The arc discharge in each of the bases of the magnetic tube creates a plasma that is characterized by a significantly higher ion temperature along the magnetic field line than across the latter one. In the stationary state (when the ion pressure is below the threshold value for rupture of the system at the top of the loop), the plasma is found to be stratified in the form of a cylindrical layer along the outer wall of the tube or possibly two belts along the upper and lower vaults of the arch. The paper discusses the excitation of a torsional Alfven oscillation in the loop in the regime of firehose instability. In the case of rapid growth (with an increment of the order of an ion cyclotron period), the unstable Alfven oscillation essentially reallocates the particles between the central axis and the tube wall, which manifests itself in the form of the observed cylindrical layer.</description>

      <title>Dark energy as a battery for magnetic field generation in plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that in the spacetime dominated by a cosmological constant, in the far region of a Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole, a seed magnetic field can be generated in an ambient plasma (in a state of no magnetic field) by a general-relativistic battery, which depends on the interaction of spacetime curvature with inhomogeneous plasma thermodynamics. Thus, at large distances, dark energy becomes the only gravitational source for magnetic field generation. This allows a mechanism that make dark energy manifest through its conversion to cosmic magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>A Hamiltonian Formulation for Energy Loss, Collision Rate, and Entropy Evolution in Collisionless and Collisional Plasmas: Transition from Maxwellian to Non-Maxwellian Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a generalised Hamiltonian formulation to model the collision rate, energy loss, entropy evolution, and the transition from Maxwellian to non-Maxwellian distributions in a plasma. By incorporating gyrokinetic turbulence and the effects of collisions, we derive a Hamiltonian that captures both the collisionless and collisional dynamics of a plasma. The formulation accounts for entropy production, energy transport, and the resulting changes in plasma confinability. We show how entropy increase during the transition from Maxwellian to non-Maxwellian states impacts fusion efficiency and plasma stability. Finally, we provide a mathematical proof that links entropy evolution to energy loss and the emergent properties of confinement.</description>

      <title>Various Modifications to Debye-H\"uckel Interactions in Solar Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first order effect of Coulomb forces between the charged particles of a plasma is the well-known Debye-H\"uckel-term. It is a negative contribution to the pressure and energy of the gas, that at high densities will overwhelm the ideal gas contributions and make the gas implode into a black hole. Nature obviously constrains this term, avoiding this fate, but how? We investigate three different mechanisms and their effects on the equation of state and on solar models, and the physical justifications for each of them. We conclude that higher order Coulomb terms in combination with quantum diffraction of electrons, provide the needed convergence.</description>

      <title>The coupled tearing-thermal instability in coronal current sheets from the linear to the non-linear stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the solar corona, magnetically sheared structures are unstable to both tearing and thermal instabilities in a coupled fashion. However, how the choice of linear perturbation modes influences the time-scale to achieve the thermal runaway in a coupled tearing-thermal coronal current sheet is not well understood to date. Here, we model a force-free Harris current sheet under solar coronal conditions to investigate this coupling in the linear and non-linear regimes. In the linear regime, we adopt the magnetohydrodynamic spectroscopy code Legolas to compare the current sheet under thermal and thermoresistive conditions, after which we initialise non-linear simulations (with MPI-AMRVAC) with the unstable, linear tearing and thermal perturbations obtained with Legolas. It is shown that part of the unstable thermal quasi-continuum adopts tearing properties in the linear stage, but that it is not until the non-linear stage is reached that a true thermal 'runaway' effect leads to condensations inside tearing-induced flux ropes. Hence, the linear stage is governed by the dominant tearing instability whilst condensations form due to tearing-thermal coupling in the non-linear stage. Our results imply that perturbing an equilibrium current sheet with the fastest growing linear mode skips the mode mixing phase in which the dominant instability traditionally emerges, and significantly reduces the time-scale to enter into the non-linear stage and thermal runaway process from its equilibrium configuration.</description>

      <title>Quasi-universal behaviour of shear relaxation times in simple fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the shear relaxation times in four important simple monatomic model fluids: Lennard-Jones, Yukawa, soft-sphere and hard-sphere fluids. It is observed that in properly reduced units, the shear relaxation times exhibit quasi-universal behaviour when the density increases from the gas-like low values to the high-density regime near crystallization. They first decrease with density at low densities, reach minima at moderate densities, and then increase toward the freezing point. The reduced relaxation times at the minima and at the fluid-solid phase transition are all comparable for the various systems investigated, despite more than ten orders of magnitude difference in real systems. Important implications of these results are discussed.</description>

      <title>A generalized effective potential for differentially rotating plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global stability of differentially rotating plasma is investigated using a generalized effective potential. We first, for a current-free system, obtain a general form of an effective potential in terms of the free energies of global curvature and gradients of rotation for non-axisymmetric disturbances. We then examine the stability of differentially rotating disks for several rotation profiles and present the associated effective potential for the onset of these instabilities in the MHD regime. In particular, results for global axisymmetric magnetorotational instability (MRI) as well as local and global non-axisymmetric modes are presented. The latter constitute two distinct non-axisymmetric modes, a high frequency local MRI and a global low-frequency non-axisymmetric mode (the magneto-curvature mode, introduced in Ebrahimi&amp;Pharr, ApJ 2022), confined either between two Alfv\'enic resonances or an Alfv\'enic resonance and a boundary.</description>

      <title>Latent Space Dynamics Learning for Stiff Collisional-radiative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a data-driven method to discover the latent space and learn the corresponding latent dynamics for a collisional-radiative (CR) model in radiative plasma simulations. The CR model, consisting of high-dimensional stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs), must be solved at each grid point in the configuration space, leading to significant computational costs in plasma simulations. Our method employs a physics-assisted autoencoder to extract a low-dimensional latent representation of the original CR system. A flow map neural network is then used to learn the latent dynamics. Once trained, the reduced surrogate model predicts the entire latent dynamics given only the initial condition by iteratively applying the flow map. The radiative power loss is then reconstructed using a decoder. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed architecture can accurately predict both the full-order CR dynamics and the radiative power loss rate.</description>

      <title>Ion Temperature Measurements in the MAST-U Divertor During Steady State Plasmas and ELM Burn Through Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents ion temperature (\(T_i\)) measurements in the MAST-U divertor, using a Retarding Field Energy Analyzer (RFEA). Steady state measurements were made during an L-Mode plasma with the strike point on the RFEA. ELM measurements were made with the strike point swept over the RFEA. The scenarios are characterized by a plasma current (\(I_p\)) of 750 kA, line average electron density (\(n_e\)) between \(1.6 \times 10^{19}\) and \(4.5 \times 10^{19}\,\text{m}^{-3}\), and Neutral Beam Injection (NBI) power ranging from 1.1 MW to 1.6 MW. The ion temperatures, peaking at approximately 10 eV in steady state, were compared with electron temperatures (\(T_e\)) obtained from Langmuir probes (LP) at the same radial positions. Preliminary findings reveal a \(T_i/T_e\) ratio in the divertor region less than 1 for shot 48008. High temporal resolution measurements captured the dynamics of Edge Localized Modes (ELMs) Burn Through, providing \(T_i\) data as a radial distance from the probe peaking around 20 eV.</description>

      <title>Conservative Closures of the Vlasov-Poisson Equations Based on Symmetrically Weighted Hermite Spectral Expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive conservative closures of the Vlasov-Poisson equations discretized in velocity via the symmetrically weighted Hermite spectral expansion. The short note analyzes the conservative closures preservation of the hyperbolicity and anti-symmetry of the Vlasov equation. Furthermore, we verify numerically the analytically derived conservative closures on simulating a classic electrostatic benchmark problem: the Langmuir wave. The numerical results and analytic analysis show that the closure by truncation is the most suitable conservative closure for the symmetrically weighted Hermite formulation.</description>
