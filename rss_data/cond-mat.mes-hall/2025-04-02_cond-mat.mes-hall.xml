      <title>Identifying biases of the Majorana scattering invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The easily accessible experimental signatures of Majorana modes are ambiguous and only probe topology indirectly: for example, quasi-Majorana states mimic most properties of Majoranas. Establishing a correspondence between an experiment and a theoretical model known to be topological resolves this ambiguity. Here we demonstrate that already theoretically determining whether a finite system is topological is by itself ambiguous. In particular, we show that the scattering topological invariant -- a probe of topology most closely related to transport signatures of Majoranas -- has multiple biases in finite systems. For example, we identify that quasi-Majorana states also mimic the scattering invariant of Majorana zero modes in intermediate-sized systems. We expect that the bias due to finite size effects is universal, and advocate that the analysis of topology in finite systems should be accompanied by a comparison with the thermodynamic limit. Our results are directly relevant to the applications of the topological gap protocol.</description>

      <title>Indirect Excitons and Many-body Interactions in InGaAs Double Quantum Wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially indirect excitons in semiconductor quantum wells are relevant to basic research and device applications because they exhibit enhanced tunability, delocalized wave functions, and potentially longer lifetimes relative to direct excitons. Here we investigate the properties of indirect excitons and their coupling interactions with direct excitons in asymmetric InGaAs double quantum wells using optical multidimensional coherent spectroscopy and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy. Analyses of the spectra confirm a strong influence of many-body effects, and reveal that excited-state zero-quantum coherences between direct and indirect excitons in the quantum wells dephase faster than the much higher-energy single-quantum coherences between excitonic excited states and ground states. The results also suggest an important energy-dependent role of continuum states in mediating system dynamics, and they indicate that dephasing mechanisms are associated with uncorrelated or anticorrelated energy-level fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic Crystals with Tunable Band Gaps in the Grating Gate Transistor Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a hydrodynamic model of plasmonic crystals formed in the current-driven grating gate transistor structures. The model demonstrates that the quality factor of plasmonic resonances could be increased by using ungated regions with high electron densities connecting multiple plasmonic cavities. The analytical and numerical calculations of the EM radiation absorption by the band plasmons show that the drive current makes all plasma modes optically active by breaking the symmetry of the plasma oscillations. This effect results in splitting plasmon resonant absorption peaks revealing the gaps in the plasmonic band spectrum tunable by current. The analyzed design could achieve resonant behavior at room temperature for plasmonic crystals implemented in various material systems, including graphene, III-V, III-N materials, and p-diamond. We argue that the resulting double-peak spectrum line in the terahertz range also facilitates the absorption at the gap frequency, typically in microwave range. Power pumping at the gap frequency enables excitation of the gap plasmons, promoting frequency conversion from microwave to THz ranges. The flexibility in the length of the ungated region for the investigated structures allows for an effective coupling with THz radiation, with the metal grating acting as a distributive resonant antenna. The applications of the presented results extend to THz communication systems, THz sensing and imaging, frequency conversion systems, and other advanced THz plasmonic devices.</description>

      <title>Nagaoka ferromagnetism in semiconductor artificial graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the emergence of Nagaoka ferromagnetism in semiconductor-based artificial graphene using high-precision variational and diffusion Monte Carlo methods, complemented by exact diagonalization calculations of the extended Hubbard model. Specifically, we analyze a realistic model of an armchair hexagonal geometry comprising $42$ lattice sites, nanopatterned on GaAs quantum wells with nearest-neighbor distance of $a = 50$ nm. Our results reveal a distinct magnetic phase transition near $U/t \approx 60$ driven by the absence/addition of a single electron at half-filling where the ferromagnetic phase is further stabilized by Coulomb scattering terms.</description>

      <title>Shape Anisotropy Enabled Field Free Switching of Perpendicular Nanomagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin Orbit Torque-Magnetic Random Access Memory (SOT-MRAM) is being developed as a successor to the Spin transfer torque MRAM (STT-MRAM) owing to its superior performance on the metrics of reliability and read-write speed. SOT switching of perpendicularly magnetized ferromagnet in the heavy metal/ferromagnet bilayer of SOT-MRAM unit cell requires an additional external magnetic field to support the spin-orbit torque generated by heavy metal to cause deterministic switching. This complexity can be overcome if an internal field can be generated to break the switching symmetry. We experimentally demonstrate that by engineering the shape of ferromagnet, an internal magnetic field capable of breaking the switching symmetry can be generated, which allows for deterministic switching by spin-orbit torques. We fabricated nanomagnets of Cobalt with triangular shape on top of Platinum and showed external magnetic field free switching between the two stable states of magnetization by application of nano-second voltage pulses. The experimental findings are consistent with the micro-magnetic simulation results of the proposed geometry.</description>

      <title>Control of Andreev Reflection via a Single-Molecule Orbital</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge transport across a single-molecule junction fabricated from a normal-metal tip, a phthalocyanine, and a conventional superconductor in a scanning tunneling microscope is explored as a function of the gradually closed vacuum gap. The phthalocyanine (2H-Pc) molecule and its pyrrolichydrogen-abstracted derivative (Pc) exhibit vastly different behavior. Andreev reflection across the 2H-Pc contact exhibits a temporary enhancement that diminishes with increasing conductance. The hybridization of 2H-Pc with the tip at contact formation gives rise to a Kondo-screened molecular magnetic moment. In contrast, the single-Pc junction lacks Andreev reflection in the same conductance range. Spectroscopies and supporting nonequilibrium Green function calculations highlight the importance of a molecular orbital close to the Fermi energy for Andreev reflection.</description>

      <title>Scaling in Magnetic Neutron Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of scaling in the mesoscale magnetic microstructure of bulk ferromagnets. Supported by analytical micromagnetic theory, we introduce the field-dependent scaling length $l_{\mathrm{C}}(H)$, which describes the characteristic long-wavelength magnetization fluctuations that are caused by microstructural defects by means of magnetoelastic and magnetocrystalline anisotropy. The scaling length $l_{\mathrm{C}}$ is identified to consist of the micromagnetic exchange length of the field $l_{\mathrm{H}}$, which depends on the magnetic interactions, and a field-independent contribution that reflects the properties of the magnetic anisotropy field and the magnetostatic fluctuations. The latter finding is rooted in the convolution relationship between the grain microstructure and micromagnetic response functions. We validated the scaling property by analyzing experimental data for the magnetic neutron scattering cross section. When plotted as a function of the dimensionless scaled scattering vector $\mathfrak{q}(H) = q \, l_{\mathrm{C}}(H)$, the field-dependent amplitude-scaled neutron data of nanocrystalline Co and a Nd-Fe-B-based nanocomposite collapse onto a single master curve, demonstrating universal behavior. The scaling length $l_{\mathrm{C}}$ provides a framework for analyzing the field-dependent neutron scattering cross section, highlighting the existence of critical length scales that govern the mesoscale microstructure of magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>How chiral vibrations drive molecular rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze two simple model planar molecules: an ionic molecule with D3 symmetry and a covalent molecule with D6 symmetry. Both symmetries allow the existence of chiral molecular orbitals and normal modes that are coupled to each other in a Jahn-Teller manner, invariant under U (1) symmetry with generator a pseudo angular momentum. In the ionic molecule, the chiral mode possesses an electric dipole but lacks physical angular momentum, whereas, in the covalent molecule, the situation is reversed. In spite of that, we show that in both cases the chiral modes can be excited by a circularly polarized light and are subsequently able to induce rotational motion of the entire molecule. We further discuss the potential extension of our findings to the case of crystalline bulk samples.</description>

      <title>Sliding Dynamics of Skyrmion Molecular Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using both atomistic and particle-based simulations, we investigate the current-driven dynamics of skyrmions on two-dimensional periodic substrates when there are multiple skyrmions per substrate minimum. At zero drive, the system forms pinned skyrmion molecular crystal states consisting of dimers, trimers, or dimer-trimer mixtures that have both positional and orientational order. On a square substrate lattice, the motion above depinning occurs via a running soliton that travels completely transverse to the applied current. This motion is generated by a torque from the Magnus force, which rotates the $n$-mer states perpendicular to the applied current. At higher drives, the flow becomes disordered while the Hall angle diminishes and gradually approaches the intrinsic value. In some cases, we also find directional locking where the Hall angle becomes locked to certain symmetry directions of the substrate over a range of currents. The transitions into and out of directionally locked states are accompanied by negative differential mobility in which the net velocity decreases as the drive increases. On a triangular substrate, we find no transverse mobility effects, but still observe directionally locked motion.</description>

      <title>Shaking and pushing skyrmions: Formation of a non-equilibrium phase with zero critical current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In three-dimensional chiral magnets, skyrmions are line-like objects oriented parallel to the applied magnetic field. The efficient coupling of magnetic skyrmion lattices to spin currents and magnetic fields permits their dynamical manipulation. Here, we explore the dynamics of skyrmion lattices when slowly oscillating the field direction by up to a few degrees on millisecond timescales while simultaneously pushing the skyrmion lattice by electric currents. The field oscillations induce a shaking of the orientation of the skyrmion lines, leading to a phase where the critical depinning current for translational motion vanishes. We measure the transverse susceptibility of MnSi to track various depinning phase transitions induced by currents, oscillating fields, or combinations thereof. An effective slip--stick model for the bending and motion of the skyrmion lines in the presence of disorder explains main features of the experiment and predicts the existence of several dynamical skyrmion lattice phases under shaking and pushing representing new phases of matter far from thermal equilibrium.</description>

Abstract: Representing spectral densities, real-frequency, and real-time Green's functions of continuous systems by a small discrete set of complex poles is an ubiquitous problem in condensed matter physics, with applications ranging from quantum transport simulations to the simulation of strongly correlated electron systems. This paper introduces a method for obtaining a compact, approximate representation of these functions, based on their parameterization on the real axis and a given approximate precision. We show applications to typical spectral functions and results for structured and unstructured correlation functions of model systems.</description>

      <title>Operating two exchange-only qubits in parallel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductors are among the most promising platforms to implement large-scale quantum computers, as advanced manufacturing techniques allow fabrication of large quantum dot arrays. Various qubit encodings can be used to store and manipulate quantum information on these quantum dot arrays. Regardless of qubit encoding, precise control over the exchange interaction between electrons confined in quantum dots in the array is critical. Furthermore, it is necessary to execute high-fidelity quantum operations concurrently to make full use of the limited coherence of individual qubits. Here, we demonstrate the parallel operation of two exchange-only qubits, consisting of six quantum dots in a linear arrangement. Using randomized benchmarking techniques, we show that issuing pulses on the five barrier gates to modulate exchange interactions in a maximally parallel way maintains the quality of qubit control relative to sequential operation. The techniques developed to perform parallel exchange pulses can be readily adapted to other quantum-dot based encodings. Moreover, we show the first experimental demonstrations of an iSWAP gate and of a charge-locking Pauli spin blockade readout method. The results are validated using cross-entropy benchmarking, a technique useful for performance characterization of larger quantum computing systems; here it is used for the first time on a quantum system based on semiconductor technology.</description>

      <title>Triplet superconductivity by the orbital Rashba effect at surfaces of elemental superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is often assumed that in a superconductor without spin-triplet pairing, the formation of unconventional spin-triplet densities requires the spin-orbit interaction in combination with either broken inversion symmetry or broken time-reversal symmetry. Here, we show from first principles the existence of supercurrent-driven spin triplet densities on the surface of a variety of simple superconducting materials without spin-orbit coupling. We are able to attribute this phenomenon to the superconducting non-relativistic orbital Rashba Edelstein effect. Furthermore, we find that the spin-orbit induced spin moment is one order of magnitude smaller than the orbital moment, and has a vanishing effect on the total magnitude of the induced triplet density. Our findings imply the existence of a route to generate spin-currents without the use of heavy metals. Additionally, as an orbital moment can couple directly to a magnetic field, it shows that orbital physics is the dominant term that drives the superconducting diode effect.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically investigate nonequilibrium spin fluctuations in a ferromagnet induced by a light pulse. Using a Lindblad equation consistent with the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we compute the autocorrelation function of magnetization. Our analysis reveals that this function comprises both thermal and nonequilibrium components. To examine the latter in detail, we introduce a Fano factor similar to nonequilibrium current noise in electronic circuits. We demonstrate that this factor encapsulates insights into the transfer of spin units to the environment. Our findings lay the groundwork for nonequilibrium spin noise spectroscopy, offering valuable insights into spin relaxation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Robustness of electron charge shuttling: Architectures, pulses, charge defects and noise thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In semiconductor-based quantum technologies, the capability to shuttle charges between components is profoundly enabling. We numerically simulated various "conveyor-belt" shuttling scenarios for simple Si/SiO2 devices, explicitly modelling the electron's wave function using grid-based split-operator methods and a time-dependent 2D potential (obtained from a Poisson solver). This allowed us to fully characterise the electron loss probability and excitation fraction. Remarkably, with as few as three independent electrodes the process can remain near-perfectly adiabatic even in the presence of pulse imperfection, nearby charge defects, and Johnson-Nyquist noise. Only a substantial density of charge defects, or defects at 'adversarial' locations, can catastrophically disrupt the charge shuttling. While we do not explicitly model the spin or valley degrees of freedom, our results from this charge propagation study support the conclusion that conveyor-belt shuttling is an excellent candidate for providing connectivity in semiconductor quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Topological characterization of a non-Hermitian ladder via Floquet non-Bloch theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a non-Hermitian (NH) ladder subjected to a variety of driving protocols. The driven system looses chiral symmetry (CS) whose presence is indispensable for its topological characterization. Further, the bulk boundary correspondence (BBC) gets adversely affected due to the presence of non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). Here, we present a formalism that not only retrieves the lost CS, but also restores the BBC via the construction of a generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ). Specifically, we employ delta and step drives to compare and contrast between them with regard to their impact on NHSE. Further, a widely studied harmonic drive is invoked in this context, not only for the sake of completeness, but its distinct computational framework offers valuable insights on the properties of out-of-equilibrium systems. While the delta and the harmonic drives exhibit unidirectional skin effect in the system, the step drive may show bi-directional skin effect. Also, there are specific points in the parameter space that are devoid of skin effect. These act as critical points that distinguish the skin modes to be localized at one boundary or the other. Moreover, for the computation of the non-Bloch invariants, we employ GBZ via a pair of symmetric time frames corresponding to the delta and the step drives, while a high-frequency expansion was carried out to deal with the harmonic drive. Finally, we present phase boundary diagrams that demarcate distinct NH phases obtained via tracking the trajectories of the exceptional points. These diagrams demonstrate a co-existence of the zero and $\pi$ energy modes in the strong NH limit and thus may be relevant for studies of Floquet time crystals.</description>

      <title>Role of electron-electron interaction in the Mpemba effect in quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18456v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect has initially been noticed in macroscopic systems -- namely that hot water can freeze faster than cold water -- but recently its extension to open quantum systems has attracted significant attention. This phenomenon can be explained in the context of nonequilibrium thermodynamics of Markovian systems, relying on the amplitudes of different decay modes of the system dynamics. Here, we study the Mpemba effect in a single-level quantum dot coupled to a thermal bath, highlighting the role of the sign and magnitude of the electron-electron interaction in the occurrence of the Mpemba effect. We gain physical insights into the decay modes from a dissipative symmetry of this system called fermionic duality. Based on this analysis of the relaxation to equilibrium of the dot, we derive criteria for the occurrence of the Mpemba effect using two thermodynamically relevant measures of the distance to equilibrium, the nonequilibrium free energy and the dot energy. We furthermore compare this effect to a possible exponential speedup of the relaxation. Finally, we propose experimentally relevant schemes for the state preparation and explore different ways of observing the Mpemba effect in quantum dots in experiments.</description>

      <title>Selective enhancement of Coulomb interactions in planar Weyl fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on our study of the electron interaction effects in topological two-dimensional (2D) materials placed in a quantizing magnetic field. Taking our cue from a recent experimental report, we consider a particular case of bismuthene monolayer with a strong spin-orbit interaction which can be a Weyl semimetal when placed on a specially tuned substrate. Interestingly, we observe that in some Landau levels of this material, the interaction effects are strongly enhanced compared to those for a conventional 2D system. Such an enhancement of electron-electron interactions in these materials is largely due to an anisotropy present in the materials. Additionally, the interaction effects can be tuned by changing the coupling to the substrate and the strongest inter-electron interactions are observed when the system is a Weyl semimental. The observed enhancement of the interaction effects can therefore be an important signature of the 2D Weyl fermions.</description>

      <title>Interface-Generated Spin Current Induced Magnetoresistance in RuO2/Py Heterostructures</title>

Abstract: Altermagnets, a recently discovered class of magnetic materials exhibiting ferromagnetic-like spin-split bands and antiferromagnetic-like compensated magnetic order, have attracted significant interest for next-generation spintronic applications. Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) has emerged as a promising altermagnetic candidate due to its compensated antiparallel magnetic order and strong spin-split electronic bands. However, recent experimental and theoretical reports also suggest that RuO2 may be non-magnetic in its ground state, underscoring the need for deeper investigations into its magnetic character. Specifically, the (100)-oriented RuO2 films are expected to generate spin currents with transverse spin polarization parallel to the N\'eel vector. Here, we investigate magnetotransport in epitaxial RuO2/Permalloy (Py) heterostructures to examine spin Hall magnetoresistance and interfacial effects generated in such systems. Our measurements reveal a pronounced negative angular-dependent magnetoresistance for variation of magnetic field direction perpendicular to the charge current direction. Detailed temperature-, magnetic field-, and crystallographic orientation-dependent measurements indicate that interface-generated spin current (IGSC) at the RuO2/Py interface predominantly governs the observed magnetoresistance. This shows that strong interface effects dominate over possible altermagnetic contributions from RuO2. Our results show that the role of interface-generated spin currents is crucial and should not be overlooked in studies of altermagnetic systems. A critical step in this direction is disentangling interfacial from altermagnetic contributions. The insight into interfacial contributions from altermagnetic influences is essential for the advancement of RuO2 based spintronic memory and sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Enhanced thermoelectric properties of two-dimensional Janus ferromagnetic LaBrI with strain-induced valley degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the successful synthesis of the MoSSe monolayer, which violated the out-of-plane mirror symmetry of TMDs monolayers, considerable and systematic research has been conducted on Janus monolayer materials. By systematically analyzing the LaBrI monolayer, we are able to learn more about the novel Janus material by focusing on the halogen family next to group VIA (S, Se, Te). The structural optimizations have been carried out using pseudopotential based Quantum espresso code. Computed structural parameters are in good agreement with literature reports. The optimized crystal structures were used for computing effect of strain on electronic and thermoelectric properties. Dynamical stability predicts that this material can withstand up to 10% of tensile strain. Computed electronic structure reveals material to be indirect wide band gap ferromagnet with magnetic moment 1{\mu}B. With increase in the biaxial tensile strain the band gap decreases. Furthermore, the computed magneto-thermoelectric properties predict high Seebeck coefficient ~ 400 {\mu}V/K and low thermal conductivity of ~ 0.93 W/m.K in LaBrI which results in a high ZT ~ 1.84 for 4% strain at 800 K. The present study supports the fact that tensile strain on ferromagnetic LaBrI material can further enhance TE properties making it to be a promising material for TE applications at higher temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07918v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of a quantum many-body system driven by two competing measurements, which induces a topological entanglement transition between two distinct area law phases. We employ a positive operator-valued measurement with variable coupling between the system and detector within free fermion dynamics. This approach allows us to continuously track the universal properties of the transition between projective and continuous monitoring. Our findings suggest that the percolation universality of the transition in the projective limit is unstable when the system-detector coupling is reduced.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement in a pure state of strongly correlated quantum impurity systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18387v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum entanglement in strongly correlated quantum impurity systems for states manifesting interesting properties such as multi-level Kondo effect and dual nature between itineracy and localization etc.. For this purpose, we set up a system consisting of one or two quantum impurities arbitrarily selected from the system as a subsystem, and investigate quantum entanglement with its environmental system. We reduce the pure state of interest as described above to the subsystem, and formulate quantum informative quantities such as entanglement entropy, mutual information and relative entropy. We apply them to quantum impurity systems consisting of several sites and the single impurity Anderson model to study the relationship between their states and the behaviors of quantum informative quantities. The obtained results suggest that the method proposed here is promising for elucidating the quantum entanglement of pure states in various quantum impurity systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetic single wall CrI3 nanotubes encapsulated within multiwall Carbon Nanotubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14967v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: CrI3 is a layered ferromagnetic insulator that has recently attracted enormous interest as it was the first example of a stand-alone monolayer ferromagnet, paving the way towards the study of two-dimensional magnetic materials and their use as building blocks of hybrid van der Waals layered heterostructures. Here we go one step down in the dimensionality ladder and report the synthesis and characterization of a tubular one-dimensional van der Waals heterostructure where CrI3 nanotubes are encapsulated within multiwall carbon nanotubes, integrating a magnetic insulator and a conductor. By means of the capillary filling of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), we obtained single-wall CrI3 nanotubes with diameters ranging between 2 nm and 10 nm, with an average of 5.3 nm. Using aberration corrected electron microscopy in combination with spectroscopic techniques we confirm the structure and chemical composition of the nanotubes. SQUID measurements, combined with element-specific X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) indicate unequivocally that the Cr atoms in encapsulated CrI3 nanotubes are magnetic with a collective state compatible with a radial magnetization state predicted both by first-principles calculations and a model Hamiltonian. Our results represent a step forward in establishing 1D van der Waals heterostructures as a playground for the exploration of non-collinear magnetic states arising from the interplay between magnetic anisotropy and curvature in tubular geometries.</description>

Abstract: Selective excitation of vibrational modes using strong laser pulses has emerged as a powerful material engineering paradigm. However, to realize deterministic control over material properties for device applications, it is desirable to have an analogous scheme without a drive, operating in thermal equilibrium. We here propose such an equilibrium analog of the light-driven paradigm, leveraging the strong coupling between lattice degrees of freedom and the quantum fluctuations of the electric field of a THz micro-cavity. We demonstrate this approach by showing, using ab initio data, how electric field fluctuations can induce a sub-dominant ferromagnetic order, on top of the dominant zig-zag antiferromagnet order, in FePS$_3$ close to its N\'eel temperature.</description>

      <title>Criticality-Enhanced Quantum Sensing with a Parametric Superconducting Resonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum metrology, a cornerstone of quantum technologies, exploits entanglement and superposition to achieve higher precision than classical protocols in parameter estimation tasks. When combined with critical phenomena such as phase transitions, the divergence of quantum fluctuations is predicted to enhance the performance of quantum sensors. Here, we implement a critical quantum sensor using a superconducting parametric (i.e., two-photon driven) Kerr resonator. The sensor, a linear resonator terminated by a supercondicting quantum interference device, operates near the critical point of a finite-component second-order dissipative phase transition obtained by scaling the system parameters. We analyze the performance of a frequency-estimation protocol and show that quadratic precision scaling with respect to the system size can be achieved with finite values of the Kerr nonlinearity. Since each photon emitted from the cavity carries more information about the parameter to be estimated compared to its classical counterpart, our protocol opens perspectives for faster or more precise metrological protocols. Our results demonstrate that quantum advantage in a sensing protocol can be achieved by exploiting a finite-component phase transition.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Epitaxial Laterally Overgrown Diamond: Towards Up-scaling of Color Center-based Quantum Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Providing high-quality, single-crystal diamond (SCD) with a large area is desirable for up-scaling quantum technology applications that rely on color centers in diamond. Growth methods aiming to increase the area of SCD are an active research area. Native color centers offer a sensitive probe for local crystal quality in such novel materials e.g., via their reaction to stress. In this work, we investigate individual native nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in SCD layers manufactured via laterally overgrowing hole arrays in a heteroepitaxially grown large-scale substrate. Heteroepitaxy has become a common tool for growing large SCDs; however, achieving the high crystal quality needed for quantum applications remains a challenge. In the overgrown layer, we identify NV centers with spin-decoherence times in the order of hundreds of microseconds, comparable to high-purity homoepitaxial SCD. We quantify the effective crystal strain in different regions of the overgrown layer, indicating a low stress overall and a stress reduction in the diamond layer above the holes.</description>

      <title>The BPHZL renormalization of a planar quantum electrodynamics up to 2-loops and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The renormalization of a parity-even massless $U(1)\times U(1)$ quantum electrodynamics in three space-time dimensions (QED$_3$) is studied by adopting the Bogoliubov-Parasiuk-Hepp-Zimmermann-Lowenstein (BPHZL) renormalization method. The presence of two massless fermions requires the Lowenstein-Zimmermann (LZ) subtraction scheme to renormalize the infrared divergences induced by the ultraviolet subtractions at 1- and 2-loops, moreover due to the model superrenormalizability the ultraviolet divergences are bounded up to 2-loops. Finally, through the BPHZL renormalization method together with the LZ subtraction scheme the ultraviolet and infrared finiteness of the model is proved up to 2-loops and beyond.</description>
