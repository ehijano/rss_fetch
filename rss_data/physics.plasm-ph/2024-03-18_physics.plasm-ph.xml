      <title>Femtosecond dynamics on the nanoscale of intense laser-induced grating plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex interaction dynamics of intense femtosecond (fs) pulses and their picosecond (ps)-long leading edge with nanostructured solids occur at both the nanometer and the femtosecond scales, making them extremely difficult to measure directly. Here, we present pump-probe-based measurements that capture the ultrafast evolution of relativistically intense laser-driven grating plasma on fs time and nanometer spatial scales. We measure the transient reflectivity and spectrum of the scattered or diffracted UV-probe pulses from the grating structures with 100s of fs resolution. Our measurements capture the initial onset of the solid-to-plasma transition and the subsequent grating plasma expansion, a few ps before the peak of the intense fs pulse. We measure the instantaneous position of the electron critical surface, its velocity, and its acceleration, which are very crucial for fundamental understanding and applications in ion/electron acceleration and high harmonic generation, while also providing valuable benchmarks for simulations. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations corroborate the observations well offering further insight into this process.</description>

      <title>Stellarator Optimization with Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider the problem of optimizing a stellarator subject to hard constraints on the design variables and physics properties of the equilibrium. We survey current numerical methods for handling these constraints, and summarize a number of methods from the wider optimization community that have not been used extensively for stellarator optimization thus far. We demonstrate the utility of new methods of constrained optimization by optimizing a QA stellarator for favorable physics properties while preventing strong shaping of the plasma boundary which can be difficult to create with external current sources.</description>

      <title>Wavelength modulation laser-induced fluorescence for plasma characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) spectroscopy is an essential tool for probing ion and atom velocity distribution functions (VDFs) in complex plasmas. VDFs carry information about kinetic properties of the species critical for plasma characterization, yet their accurate interpretation is challenging due to multicomponent distributions, broadening effects, and background emissions. Our research introduces wavelength modulation (WM) LIF as a solution to enhance VDF sensitivity measurements. WM-LIF, unlike standard amplitude modulation (AM) methods, measures the derivative of the LIF signal, providing greater sensitivity to changes in VDF shape. A numerical model was developed to compare the efficacy of WM and AM signals in lock-in amplifier-based measurements. Experiments were conducted in a weakly collisional argon plasma with magnetized electrons and non-magnetized ions. The argon ion VDFs were measured using a narrow-band tunable diode laser, with its wavelength scanned across the Ar ion transition 4p^4 D_(7/2)-3d^4 F_(9/2) centered at 664.553 nm (in vacuum). A lock-in amplifier detected the second harmonic WM signal, generated by modulating the laser wavelength with an externally controlled piezo-driven mirror. Our findings indicate that WM-LIF can be used to determine VDF parameters, such as distribution components and their temperatures and velocities, serving as an independent method of obtaining such parameters, which can be used for improving analysis of conventional AM approach. This method is especially beneficial in environments with substantial light noise or background emissions e.g., thermionic cathodes and reflective surfaces.</description>

      <title>Encoding of linear kinetic plasma problems in quantum circuits via data compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm for encoding of linear kinetic plasma problems in quantum circuits. The focus is made on modeling electrostatic linear waves in one-dimensional Maxwellian electron plasma. The waves are described by the linearized Vlasov-Amp\`ere system with a spatially localized external current that drives plasma oscillations. This system is formulated as a boundary-value problem and cast in the form of a linear vector equation $A\psi = b$ to be solved by using the quantum signal processing algorithm. The latter requires encoding of the matrix $A$ in a quantum circuit as a subblock of a unitary matrix. We propose how to encode $A$ in a circuit in a compressed form and discuss how the resulting circuit scales with the problem size and the desired precision.</description>

      <title>Single-Shot Single-Beam Coherent Raman Scattering Thermometry Based on Air Lasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermometric techniques with high accuracy, fast response speed and ease of implementation are desirable for the study of dynamic combustion environments, transient reacting flows, and non-equilibrium plasmas. Herein, single-shot single-beam coherent Raman scattering (SS-CRS) thermometry is developed, for the first time to our knowledge, by using air lasing as a probe. It's proved that the air-lasing-assisted CRS signal has a high signal-to-noise ratio enabling single-shot measurements at a 1 kHz repetition rate. The SS-CRS thermometry consistently exhibits precision better than 2% at different temperatures, but the inaccuracy grows with the increase in temperature. The high detection precision, 1 kHz acquisition rate and easy-to-implement single-beam scheme are achieved thanks to the unique temporal, spectral and spatial characteristics of air lasing. This work opens a novel avenue for high-speed CRS thermometry, holding tremendous potential for fast diagnostics of transient reacting flows and plasmas.</description>

      <title>Greater than five-order-of-magnitude post-compression temporal contrast improvement with an ionization plasma grating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-intensity lasers require suppression of prepulses and other non-ideal temporal structure to avoid target disruption before the arrival of the main pulse. To address this, we demonstrate that ionization gratings act as a controllable optical switch for high-power light with a temporal contrast improvement of at least $3\times10^5$ and a switching time less than 500 fs. We also show that a grating system can run for hours at 10 Hz without degradation. The contrast improvement from an ionization grating compares favorably to that achievable with plasma mirrors.</description>

      <title>Development of neutron beamline for laser-driven neutron resonance spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress of laser science provides laser-driven neutron source (LDNS), which has remarkable features such as the short pulse width. One of the key techniques to be developed for more efficient use of the LDNS is neutron collimation tubes to increase the number of neutrons arriving at a detector in the time-of-flight method. However, when a tube with a thick wall is used as a collimator the neutron collection efficiency at the detector increases but the time resolution becomes wider because of multiple scattering inside of the tube. In the present study, we have developed a collimation tube made of Ni-0, which is optimized for the increased neutron collection efficiency and a reasonable time resolution. This collimator has been demonstrated experimentally using neutron resonance spectroscopy with neutrons provided from LFEX laser.</description>

      <title>Radiative loss and ion-neutral collisional effects in astrophysical plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the role of radiative cooling in a two-fluid model consisting of coupled neutrals and charged particles. We first analyze the linearized two-fluid equations where we include radiative losses in the energy equation for the charged particles. In a 1D geometry for parallel propagation and in the limiting cases of weak and strong coupling, it can be shown analytically that the instability conditions for the thermal mode and the sound waves, the isobaric and isentropic criteria, respectively, remain unchanged with respect to one-fluid radiative plasmas. For the parameters considered in this paper, representative for the solar corona, the radiative cooling produces growth of the thermal mode and damping of the sound waves. When neutrals are included and are sufficiently coupled to the charges, the thermal mode growth rate and the wave damping both reduce by the same factor, which depends on the ionization fraction only. For a heating function which is constant in time, we find that the growth of the thermal mode and the damping of the sound waves are slightly larger. The numerical calculation of the eigenvalues of the general system of equations in a 3D geometry confirm the analytic results. We then run 2D fully nonlinear simulations which give consistent results: a higher ionization fraction or lower coupling will increase the growth rate. The magnetic field contribution is negligible in the linear phase. Ionization-recombination effects might play an important role because the radiative cooling produces a large range of temperatures in the system. In the numerical simulation, after the first condensation phase, when the minimum temperature is reached, the fraction of neutrals increases four orders of magnitude because of the recombination.</description>

      <title>Elastic and breaking properties of epitaxial face-centered crystals in neutron star crusts and white dwarf cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystallization of dense matter in neutron star crusts and white dwarf cores may be similar to epitaxial crystal growth in terrestrial laboratories. However in stellar crystals, the spacing between horizontal planes has to gradually increase with the outward movement of the crystallization front, tracing decrease of the electron density. This process produces Coulomb crystals with stretched rather than cubic elementary cells. We extend the analysis of the elastic and breaking properties of such crystals to the face-centered (fc) lattice. Shear deformations orthogonal to the stretch direction have been studied for 22 crystallographic shear planes. A common property for all these planes is a reduction and eventual nulling of the breaking shear strain with deviation from the unstretched configuration. The effective shear moduli for deformations orthogonal to the stretch direction have been calculated. It is possible that the epitaxial crystallization in compact stars results in a formation of large-scale crystallites or, at least, in growth of the whole crystallization front perpendicular to particular crystallographic planes. For fc structure growth orthogonal to the $\{111\}$ planes, we expect that, at any density, $\sim 5\%$ ($\sim 0.5\%$) of crystallite height is occupied by layers one (two) orders of magnitude weaker than the bulk of the crystallite. This may be important for realistic modeling of crustquakes on neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Characterization of a DC glow discharge in $N_2-H_2$ with electrical measurements and neutral and ion mass spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The addition of small amounts of $H_2$ were investigated in a DC glow discharge in $N_2$, at low pressure (~1 mbar) and low power (0.05 to 0.2 $W.cm^{-3}$). We quantified the electric field, the electron density, the ammonia production and the formation of positive ions for amounts of $H_2$ varying between 0 and 5%, pressure values between 0.5 and 4 mbar, and currents between 10 and 40 mA. The addition of less than 1% $H_2$ has a strong effect on the $N_2$ plasma discharges. Hydrogen quenches the (higher) vibrational levels of $N_2$ and some of its highly energetic metastable states. This leads to the increase of the discharge electric field and consequently of the average electron energy. As a result, higher quantities of radical and excited species are suspected to be produced. The addition of hydrogen also leads to the formation of new species. In particular, ammonia and hydrogen-bearing ions have been observed: $N_2H^+$ and $NH_4^+$ being the major ones, and also $H_3^+$, $NH^+$, $NH_2^+$, $NH_3^+$, $N_3H^+$ and $N_3H_3^+$. The comparison to a radiofrequency capacitively coupled plasma (RF CCP) discharge in similar experimental conditions shows that both discharges led to similar observations. The study of $N_2-H_2$ discharges in the laboratory in the adequate ionization conditions then gives some insights on which plasma species made of nitrogen and hydrogen could be present in the ionosphere of Titan. Here, we identified some protonated ions, which are reactive species that could participate to the erosion of organic aerosols on Titan.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Effect on Potential Barrier for Nucleosynthesis II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of magnetic fields on the potential barrier between two interacting nuclei. We addressed this by solving the Boltzmann equation and Maxwell's theory in the presence of a magnetic field, resulting in the determination of magnetized permittivity. Additionally, we derived the magnetized Debye potential, which combines the conventional Debye potential with an additional magnetic component. We then compared the Boltzmann approach with the Debye method. Both methods consistently demonstrate that magnetic fields increase permittivity. This enhanced permittivity leads to a reduction in the potential barrier, consequently increasing the reaction rate for nucleosynthesis. Furthermore, the dependence on temperature and electron density in each approach is consistent. Our findings suggest that magnetized plasmas, which have existed since the Big Bang, have played a crucial role in nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17566v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, novel low-loss waveguides and power dividers for ultra-broadband surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are introduced. This article uses complementary metasurfaces in place of traditional SPP, which are typically produced as metasurface unit cells on the dielectric sublayer. It has been demonstrated that the use of complementary metasurfaces considerably improves wave confinement and inhibits wave propagation. Because of this, it is anticipated that waveguides and power dividers made from these complimentary unit cells will have significantly lower losses and greater bandwidth than SPP used in traditional devices. In the frequency range of 0 GHz to 100 GHz, waveguides and bent waveguides with complementary metasurface unit cells exhibit insertion loss greater than 0.5 dB. Utilizing complementary metasurfaces, symmetric and asymmetric power dividers have been created and researched. The results of the simulation have shown that using this type of unit cell in the construction of microwave devices is advantageous.</description>

      <title>Intermittency and Dissipative Structures Arising from Relativistic Magnetized Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kinetic simulations of relativistic turbulence have significantly advanced our understanding of turbulent particle acceleration. Recent progress has highlighted the need for an updated acceleration theory that can account for acceleration within the plasma's coherent structures. Here, we investigate how turbulent intermittency models connect statistical fluctuations in turbulence to regions of high dissipation. This connection is established by employing a generalized She-Leveque model to describe the exponents $\zeta_p$ for the structure functions $S^p \propto l^{\zeta_p}$. The fitting of the scaling exponents provide us with a measure of the co-dimension of the dissipative structures, and we subsequently measure their filling fraction. We perform our analysis for a range of magnetizations $\sigma$ and magnetic field fluctuations ${\delta B_0}/{B_0}$. We find that increasing the values of $\sigma$ and ${\delta B_0}/{B_0}$ allows the cascade to break sheets into smaller regions of dissipation that resemble chains of plasmoids. However, as their dissipation increases, the dissipative regions become less volume filling. With this work we aim to inform future turbulent acceleration theories that incorporate particle energization from interactions with coherent structures within relativistic turbulence.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional theory of superradiant free-electron lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The soliton-like superradiant regime of free-electron lasers (FEL) offers a promising path towards ultrashort pulses, beyond the natural limit dictated by the bandwidth of the high-gain FEL instability. In this work we present a three-dimensional theory of the superradiant regime. Our work takes advantage of recent developments in non-linear FEL theory to provide a fully analytical description of soliton-like superradiance. Our theory proves the existence of a diffraction-dominated steady-state regime in which the superradiant peak power grows indefinitely while leaving the pulse duration and on-axis intensity almost unchanged. These results are in excellent agreement with three-dimensional simulations and are supported by recent experimental results at the Linac Coherent Light Source. This work advances non-linear FEL theory and provides a theoretical framework for the next generation of attosecond x-ray FELs.</description>

      <title>Spectrotemporal shaping of attosecond x-ray pulses with a fresh-slice free-electron laser</title>

Abstract: We propose a scheme for coherently shaping attosecond x-ray pulses at free-electron lasers. We show that by seeding an FEL with a short coherent seed that overfills the amplification bandwidth, one can shape the wigner function of the pulse by controlling the undulator taper profile. The examples of controllable coherent pulse pairs and trains, as well as isolated spectrotemporally shaped pulses with very broad coherent bandwidths are examined in detail. Existing attosecond XFELs can achieve these experimental conditions in a two-stage cascade, in which the coherent seed is generated by a short current spike in an electron bunch and shaped in an unspoiled region within the same bunch. We experimentally demonstrate the production of pulse pairs using this method at the Linac Coherent Light Source.</description>

      <title>Parallel Diffusion Coefficient of Energetic Charged Particles in the Inner Heliosphere from the Turbulent Magnetic Fields Measured by Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion coefficients of energetic charged particles in turbulent magnetic fields are a fundamental aspect of diffusive transport theory but remain incompletely understood. In this work, we use quasi-linear theory to evaluate the spatial variation of the parallel diffusion coefficient $\kappa_\parallel$ from the measured magnetic turbulence power spectra in the inner heliosphere. We consider the magnetic field and plasma velocity measurements from Parker Solar Probe made during Orbits 5-13. The parallel diffusion coefficient is calculated as a function of radial distance from 0.062 to 0.8 AU, and the particle energy from 100 keV to 1GeV. We find that $\kappa_\parallel$ increases exponentially with both heliocentric distance and energy of particles. The fluctuations in $\kappa_\parallel$ are related to the episodes of large-scale magnetic structures in the solar wind. By fitting the results, we also provide an empirical formula of $\kappa_{\parallel}=(5.16\pm1.22) \times 10^{18} \: r^{1.17\pm0.08} \: E^{0.71\pm 0.02} \; (cm^2/s)$ in the inner heliosphere which can be used as a reference in studying the transport and acceleration of solar energetic particles as well as the modulation of cosmic rays.</description>
