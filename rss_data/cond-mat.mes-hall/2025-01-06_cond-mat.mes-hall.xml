      <title>Cavity Quantum Hall Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments, we study the coupling of quantum Hall (QH) hydrodynamics to quantum electrodynamics (QED) within a resonance cavity. In agreement with experimental observations, we find that the Hall conductivity remains unchanged. However, the coupling to the cavity induces a second-order quantum reactance effect, contributing distinctly to the longitudinal AC conductivity. This effect arises from the exchange of energy between the QH fluid and cavity photons. Beyond the topological response, we show that the cavity couples to collective excitations, resulting in a shift of the Kohn mode frequency. Our methods are broadly applicable to both integral and fractional QH liquids, and our results offer a universal perspective on the protection of topological properties against long-range interactions induced by electromagnetic cavity modes.</description>

      <title>C$_{60}$ building blocks with tuneable structures for tailored functionalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that C$_{60}$ fullerene molecules can serve as promising building blocks in the construction of versatile crystal structures with unique symmetries using first-principles calculations. These phases include quasi-2D layered structures and 3D van der Waals crystals where the molecules adopt varied orientations. The interplay of molecular arrangement and lattice symmetry results in a variety of tuneable crystal structures with distinct properties. Specifically, the electronic structures of these phases vary significantly, offering potential for fine-tuning the band gap for electronics and optoelectronics. Additionally, the optical properties of these materials are strongly influenced by their crystalline symmetry and molecular alignment, providing avenues for tailoring optical responses for photonics. Our findings highlight the potential of fullerene-based building blocks in the rational design of functional materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetoconductivity and quantum oscillations in intercalated graphite CaC$_6$ with the Fermi surface reconstructed by the uniaxial charge density wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a magnetoconductivity tensor $\sigma$ for the intercalated graphite CaC$_6$, in the ground state of the uniaxial charge density wave (CDW), under conditions of coherent magnetic breakdown due to strong external magnetic field $B$ perpendicular to the conducting plane. The uniaxial charge density wave reconstructs initially closed Fermi surface into an open one, accompanied with formation of a pseudo-gap in the electron density of states around the Fermi energy. The magnetoconductivity tensor is calculated within the quantum density matrix and semiclassical magnetic breakdown approach focused on modification of the main, so-called classical contribution to magnetoconductivity by magnetic breakdown, neglecting the higher order corrections. In the presence of magnetic breakdown, in spite of open Fermi surface configuration, all classical magnetoconductivity components, the one along the CDW apex $\sigma_{xx} \sim 1/B^2$, perpendicular to the CDW apex $\sigma_{yy} \sim const$, as well as the Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy} \sim 1/B$, undergo strong quantum oscillations vs. inverse magnetic field. Those oscillations do not appear as a mere additive correction, but rather alter the classical result becoming an inherent part of it, turning it to essentially non-classical.</description>

      <title>Generation of spin wave packets by reconfigurable magnonic heterojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nano-magnonic crystals are magnetic waveguides whose magnetic parameters are modulated at the nanoscale. The super-lattice structure enables a band structure and magnonic band-gaps. Here, we numerically investigate the field tunability of such a magnonic band-gap. By subjecting different parts of the nano-magnonic crystal to a field, we realize a magnonic heterojunction. A numerical demonstration of an active modification of the band structure leads to magnonic amplitude modulation in the linear regime and magnonic frequency combs in the nonlinear regime. Our results offer further opportunities for nano-magnonic crystals and incite their experimental realization.</description>

      <title>Anomalous skew scattering of plasma waves in a Dirac electron fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Berry phase-related nontrivial electronic band geometries can significantly influence bulk and edge plasma waves, or plasmons, resulting in their non-reciprocal propagation and opening new opportunities for plasmonics. In the present work, we extend the hydrodynamic framework to describe the scattering of plasma waves in a Dirac electron fluid off a circular region with an induced nonzero anomalous Hall response, i.e. a Berry flux target. We demonstrate that the scattering has a giant asymmetry or skewness and exhibits a series of resonances. The latter appears due to a chiral non-topological trapped mode circulating the target. We discuss possible experimental realizations, including the surface of a topological insulator film and graphene irradiated by the circularly polarized beam.</description>

      <title>Visualization of intervalley coherent phase in PtSe2/HOPG heterojunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intervalley coherent (IVC) phase in graphene systems arises from the coherent superposition of wave functions of opposite valleys, whose direct microscopic visualization provides pivotal insight into the emergent physics but remains elusive. Here, we successfully visualize the IVC phase in a heterostructure of monolayer PtSe2 on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. Using spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy, we observe a Root3 by Root3 modulation pattern superimposed on the higher-order moire superlattice of the heterostructure, which correlates with a small gap opening around the Fermi level and displays an anti-phase real-space conductance distribution of the two gap edges. Such modulation pattern and small-gap vanish on the heterostructure of monolayer PtSe2 on bilayer-graphene-covered SiC substrate, due to the increased carrier density in the bilayer graphene. We provide a theoretical mechanism that the Root3 by Root3 modulation pattern originates from the IVC phase of few-layer graphene, which is magnified by the higher-order moire superlattice. Our work achieves visualization of the IVC phase, and develops an avenue for its generation and amplification via a moir\'e interface.</description>

      <title>Decoupling the effects of ripples from tensile strain on the thermal conductivity of graphene and understanding the role of curvature on the thermal conductivity of graphene with grain boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ripples, curvature, and grain boundaries in graphene can significantly alter its thermal conductivity (TC), which is paramount in various applications including thermal management etc. In this study, we conducted extensive equilibrium MD simulations and used the Green-Kubo method to elucidate the impact of ripples on the TC of graphene and the impact of curvature and tilt angles characterizing a grain boundary (GB) on the TC of polycrystalline graphene. Although tensile and compressive strains have been known to control the amount of ripples, the effects of strain and ripple on the TC have not been decoupled. With the help of Green-Kubo simulations on larger graphene samples and simulations based on the spectral energy density method on smaller samples without ripples, we show that both samples show an approximately 30% decrease in TC between tensile strains 3% and 10% when ripples become negligible even in the larger sample. Between 0 and 3% strain, when both ripples and strains are present in the larger sample, we decouple the effect of ripples from strain on the TC and show that ripples alone reduce the TC of the larger unstrained sample by approximately 61%. We also present a unique technique to introduce curvatures in the graphene sheet containing GBs by performing MD simulations under NPT ensembles with a constant pressure of 200 bar along the x-axis. Our analysis suggests that the Green-Kubo TC linearly decreases with curvature; however, the rate of decrease depends on the tilt angles of the grain boundary. An analysis of the TC in graphene samples with GBs of varying tilt angles reveals that the TC strongly depends on the tilt angles. Thus, our research underscores the pivotal role of ripple, curvature, and GB in modulating the thermal conductivity of graphene.</description>

      <title>Out-of-plane Edelstein effects: Electric-field induced magnetization in $p$-wave magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-plane magnetization is induced by the Edelstein effect in the Rashba spin-orbit interaction system. However, out-of-plane magnetization is more useful for switching a ferromagnetic memory. We study analytically and numerically electric-field induced magnetization in $p$-wave magnets with the aid of the Rashba interaction based on a simple two-band model. The out-of-plane magnetization is induced when the N\'{e}el vector of the $p$-wave magnet is along the $z$ direction. We also show that no magnetization is induced in the absence of the Rashba interaction. The electric-field induced magnetization will be useful for future switching technology of ferromagnetic memories based on the $p$-wave magnet.</description>

      <title>Dynamic realization of emergent high-dimensional optical vortices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dimensionality of vortical structures has recently been extended beyond two dimensions, providing higher-order topological characteristics and robustness for high-capacity information processing and turbulence control. The generation of high-dimensional vortical structures has mostly been demonstrated in classical systems through the complex interference of fluidic, acoustic, or electromagnetic waves. However, natural materials rarely support three- or higher-dimensional vortical structures and their physical interactions. Here, we present a high-dimensional gradient thickness optical cavity (GTOC) in which the optical coupling of planar metal-dielectric multilayers implements topological interactions across multiple dimensions. Topological interactions in high-dimensional GTOC construct non-trivial topological phases, which induce high-dimensional vortical structures in generalized parameter space in three, four dimensions, and beyond. These emergent high-dimensional vortical structures are observed under electro-optic tomography as optical vortex dynamics in two-dimensional real-space, employing the optical thicknesses of the dielectric layers as synthetic dimensions. We experimentally demonstrate emergent vortical structures, optical vortex lines and vortex rings, in a three-dimensional generalized parameter space and their topological transitions. Furthermore, we explore four-dimensional vortical structures, termed optical vortex sheets, which provide the programmability of real-space optical vortex dynamics. Our findings hold significant promise for emulating high-dimensional physics and developing active topological photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Striped Spin Density Wave in a Graphene/Black Phosphorous Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A bilayer formed by stacking two distinct materials creates a moir\'e lattice, which can serve as a platform for novel electronic phases. In this work we study a unique example of such a system: the graphene-black phosphorus heterostructure (G/BP), which has been suggested to have an intricate band structure. Most notably, the valence band hosts a quasi-one-dimensional region in the Brillouin zone of high density of states, suggesting that various many-body electronic phases are likely to emerge. We derive an effective tight-binding model that reproduces this band structure, and explore the emergent broken-symmetry phases when interactions are introduced. Employing a mean-field analysis, we find that the favored ground-state exhibits a striped spin density wave (SDW) order, characterized by either one of two-fold degenerate wave-vectors that are tunable by gating. Further exploring the phase-diagram controlled by gate voltage and the interaction strength, we find that the SDW-ordered state undergoes a metal to insulator transition via an intermediate metallic phase which supports striped SDW correlations. Possible experimental signatures are discussed, in particular a highly anisotropic dispersion of the collective excitations which should be manifested in electric and thermal transport.</description>

      <title>Reentrant topological phases and spin density wave induced by 1D moir\'e potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exotic topological and correlated phases induced by moir\'e potentials have recently been explored in 2D twisted bilayer graphene systems. Here we investigate spin-$1/2$ interacting fermionic atoms in the 1D moir\'e optical superlattice formed by the superposition of two commensurate potentials. We reveal the reentrant topological phases and periodic-moir\'e-spin density wave (PM-SDW) of the ground states in both non-interacting and interacting cases. The reentrant topological phases are driven by the moir\'e potential with the sequent trivial-topological-trivial-topological-trivial transition. The critical exponent of topological transitions and the localization properties of the single-particle eigenstates are studied. The PM-SDW order of the many-body ground state is contributed from the moir\'e potential, and is enhanced by the on-site interaction but suppressed by the nearest-neighbor interaction. Our results enrich the topological physics with multiple transitions and spin-density orders in 1D moir\'e systems, which might be experimentally realized with ultracold atoms in tunable optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Topological Anderson insulators by latent symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological Anderson insulators represent a class of disorder-induced, nontrivial topological states. In this study, we propose a feasible strategy to unveil and design the latent-symmetry protected topological Anderson insulators. By employing the isospectral reduction approach from graph theory, we reduce a family of the disordered multi-atomic chains to the disordered dimerized chain characterized by energy-dependent potentials and hoppings, which exhibits the chiral symmetry or inversion symmetry. According to the topological invariants, bulk polarization, and the divergence of localization length of the topological bound edge states in the reduced disordered system, the gapped and ungapped topological Anderson states with latent symmetry could be identified in the original disordered multi-atomic systems. The concept of topological Anderson insulating phases protected by the geometric symmetries and tenfold-way classification is thus extended to the various types of latent symmetry cases. This work paves the way for exploiting topological Anderson insulators in terms of latent symmetries.</description>

      <title>Can structure influence hydrovoltaic energy generation? Insights from the metallic 1T' and semiconducting 2H phases of MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrovoltaic power generation from liquid water and ambient moisture has attracted considerable research efforts. However, there is still limited consensus on the optimal material properties required to maximize the power output. Here, we used laminates of two different phases of layered MoS$_2$ -- metallic 1T' and semiconducting 2H -- as representative systems to investigate the critical influence of specific characteristics, such as hydrophilicity, interlayer channels, and structure, on the hydrovoltaic performance. The metallic 1T' phase was synthesized via a chemical exfoliation process and assembled into laminates, which can then be converted to the semiconducting 2H phase by thermal annealing. Under liquid water conditions, the 1T' laminates, having a channel size of 6 angstroms, achieved a peak power density of 2.0 mW m$^{-2}$, significantly outperforming the 2H phase, lacking defined channels, that produced a power of 2.4 microW m$^{-2}$. Our theoretical analysis suggests that energy generation in these hydrophilic materials primarily arises from electro-kinetic and surface diffusion mechanisms. These findings highlight the crucial role of phase-engineered MoS$_2$ and underscore the potential of 2D material laminates in advancing hydrovoltaic energy technologies.</description>

      <title>In-operando control of sum-frequency generation in tip-enhanced nanocavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sum-frequency generation (SFG) is a second-order nonlinear process widely used for characterizing surfaces and interfaces with monolayer sensitivity. Recently, optical field enhancement in plasmonic nanocavities has enabled SFG with continuous wave (CW) lasers from nanoscale areas of molecules, promising applications like nanoscale SFG spectroscopy and coherent upconversion for mid-infrared detection at visible frequencies. Here, we demonstrate CW SFG from individual nanoparticle-on-mirror (NPoM) cavities, which are resonant at visible frequencies and filled with a monolayer of molecules, when placed beneath a metal scanning probe tip. The tip acts as an efficient broadband antenna, focusing incident CW infrared illumination onto the nanocavity. The cascaded near-field enhancement within the NPoM nanocavity yields nonlinear optical responses across a broad range of infrared frequencies, achieving SFG enhancements of up to 14 orders of magnitude. Further, nanomechanical positioning of the tip allows for in-operando control of SFG by tuning the local field enhancement rather than the illumination intensities. The versatility of tip-enhanced nanocavities allows for SFG studies of a wide range of molecular species in the few-molecule regime without the need for complex nanofabrication of doubly-resonant nanocavities. Our results also promise SFG nanoimaging with tips providing strong visible and IR field enhancement at their apex, offering a robust platform for future applications in nonlinear nanooptics.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Filamentary Conduction in Thermally Stable Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework (ZIF-8) Resistive Switching Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of digital technology has driven the need for efficient storage solutions, positioning memristors as promising candidates for next-generation non-volatile memory (NVM) due to their superior electrical properties. Organic and inorganic materials each offer distinct advantages for resistive switching (RS) performance, while hybrid materials like metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) combine the strengths of both. In this study, we present a resistive random-access memory (ReRAM) device utilizing zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8), a MOF material, as the resistive switching layer. The ZIF-8 film was synthesized via a simple solution process method at room temperature and subsequently characterized. The Al/ZIF-8/ITO device demonstrates bipolar resistive switching behaviour with an on/off resistance ratio of 100, stable retention up to 10000 seconds, and consistent performance across 60 cycles while exhibiting robust thermal stability from -20 C to 100 C. Low-frequency noise and impedance spectroscopy measurements suggest a filamentary switching mechanism. Additionally, the memory state can be tuned by adjusting the reset voltage, pointing to potential as multi-level memory. Potentiation and depression experiments further highlight the devices promise for neuromorphic applications. With high stability, tunability, and strong performance, the ZIF-8 based ReRAM shows great promise for advanced NVM and neuromorphic computing applications.</description>

      <title>Quasi-topological fractons: a 3D dipolar gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the theory of a generic rank-2 tensor field in three spacetime dimensions, which involves a symmetric tensor field transforming under infinitesimal diffeomorphisms, and a vector field, whose gauge transformation depends on a local vector parameter. The gauge fixing shows a non-trivial structure, and some non-intuitive possibilities are listed. Despite the fact that the theory is not topological, the energy-momentum tensor vanishes on-shell, which justifies the quasi-topological appellation we give to this theory. We show that the theory has three degrees of freedom. Moreover we find an interesting physical interpretation, which consists in a generalized planar electromagnetism and in the emergence of two vector charges with restricted mobility. These are typical fractonic behaviours which can be related to the so called traceless scalar and vector charge theories.</description>

      <title>Linear-in-temperature conductance in two-dimensional electron fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08556v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear temperature dependence of transport coefficients in metals is often ascribed to non-Fermi-liquid physics. Here we demonstrate the $T$-linear behavior of nonlocal conductivity in a clean 2D electron fluid, where carrier collisions assist conduction and lead to hydrodynamic transport with conductance rather than resistance growing with temperature. The key aspect is the occurrence of multiple hydrodynamic modes representing odd-parity modulations of the Fermi surface evolving in space and time. A cascade of such modes results in a linear $T$ dependence that extends to lowest temperatures, as well as a Kolmogorov-like fractional power $-5/3$ scaling of conductivity vs. wavenumber. These dependences provide a smoking gun for nonclassical hydrodynamics driven by such modes, expected to be generic for 2D electron fluids with simple near-circular Fermi surfaces.</description>

      <title>Back-action supercurrent diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14503v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Back-action refers to a response that retro-acts on a system to tailor its properties with respect to an external stimulus. This effect is at the heart of many electronic devices such as amplifiers, oscillators, and sensors. Here, we demonstrate that back-action can be exploited to achieve non-reciprocal transport in superconducting circuits. In our devices, dissipationless current flows in one direction whereas dissipative transport occurs in the opposite direction. Supercurrent diodes presented so far rely on magnetic elements or vortices to mediate charge transport or external magnetic fields to break time-reversal symmetry. Back-action solely turns a conventional reciprocal superconducting weak link with no asymmetry between the current bias directions into a rectifier, where the critical current amplitude depends on the bias sign. The self-interaction of the supercurrent stems from the gate tunability of the critical current in metallic and semiconducting systems, which promotes nearly ideal magnetic field-free rectification with selectable polarity.</description>

      <title>Exciton Condensation in Landau Levels of Quantum Spin Hall Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically study the quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) in a perpendicular magnetic field. In the noninteracting case, the QSHI with space inversion and/or uniaxial spin rotation symmetry undergoes a topological transition into a normal insulator phase at a critical magnetic field $B_{\rm c}$. The exciton condensation in the lowest Landau levels is triggered by Coulomb interactions in the vicinity of $B_{\rm c}$ at low temperature and spontaneously breaks the inversion and the spin rotation symmetries. We propose that the electron spin resonance spectroscopy with the ac magnetic field also aligned in the perpendicular direction can directly probe the exciton condensation order. Our results should apply to QSHIs such as the InAs/GaSb quantum wells and monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Theory of spin and orbital charge conversion at the surface states of Bi_{1-x}Sb_x topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03120v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological insulators are quantum materials involving Time-reversal protected surface states(TSS) making them appealing candidates for the design of next generation of highly efficient spintronic devices. The very recent observation of large transient spin-charge conversion (SCC) and subsequent powerful THz emission from Co|Bi_{1-x}Sb_x bilayers clearly demonstrates such potentiality and feasibility for the near future. Amongst the exotic properties appearing in and at the surface of such quantum materials, spin-momentum locking (SML) and Rashba-Edelstein effects remain as key ingredients to effectively convert the spin degree of freedom into a charge or a voltage signal. In this work, we extend our analyses to the quantification of orbital momentum-locking and related orbital charge conversion effects in Bi_{0.85}Sb_{0.15} via orbital Rashba-Edelstein effects. In that sense, we will provide some clear theoretical and numerical insights implemented by multi-orbital and multi-layered tight-binding methods (TB) to clarify our recent experimental results obtained by THz-TDS spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Deformation of a one dimensional ferromagnetic domain wall due to double exchange interaction with a free electron system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using an S-matrix formulation we evaluate the energy and conductance of a Bloch or N\'eel magnetic wall interacting with a one dimensional free electron system via a double exchange interaction. Minimization of the total energy indicates that for chemical potential larger than the magnetic interaction the domain wall is generally deformed to a thin wall, while for magnetic field larger than the chemical potential tends towards wide walls. In contrast, for a double wall system the deformation is always towards wide walls. For the single as well as the double magnetic wall systems the conductance monotonically decreases with decreasing wall width. The energy and conductance are identical for Bloch and N\'eel magnetic domain walls within this prototype model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By implementing a charge pumping scheme for one-dimensional aperiodic chains, we confirm the existence of topological phases in these systems whenever their finite-size realizations admit inversion symmetry. These phases are usually characterized by an anomalous edge response as a result of the bulk-boundary correspondence. We show that these signatures are all present in various chains, each representing a different class of structural aperiodicity: the Fibonacci quasicrystal, the Tribonacci quasicrystal, and the Thue-Morse chain. More specifically, we calculate three quantities: the Berry phase of the crystalline approximation of the finite-size systems, the polarization response to an inifintesimal static and constant electric field in systems with open boundary conditions, and the degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum. We find that all of them provide signatures of a topologically nontrivial phase.</description>

      <title>Lindbladian dynamics with loss of quantum jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11812v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lindblad master equation (LME) describing the Markovian dynamics of the quantum open system can be understood as the evolution of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian balanced with random quantum jumps. Here we investigate the balance-breaking dynamics by partly eliminating jumps from postselection experiments. To describe this dynamics, a non-linear Lindblad master equation (NLME) is derived from quantum trajectory method. However, the NLME shows significant advantages in analytical analysis over quantum trajectory method. Using the NLME, we classify the dynamics into two classes. In the trivial class, the process of reducing jumps is completely equivalent to weakening the coupling from the environment. In contrast, the nontrivial class presents more complex dynamics. We study a prototypical model within this class and demonstrate the existence of the postselected skin effect whose steady state is characterized by the accumulation of particles on one side. The steady-state distribution can be fitted by a scale-invariant tanh function which is different from the uniform distribution of LME. Furthermore, the NLME can give a reasonable framework for studying the interplay and competition between the non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and dissipative terms. We show this by capturing the characteristics of the trajectory-averaged entanglement entropy influenced by non-Hermitian skin effect and Zeno effect in the model of postselected skin effect.</description>

      <title>Effective short distance interaction in Calogero-Sutherland quantum fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the effective conformal field theory with symmetry W-infinity x W-infinity that describes the thermodynamic limit of the Calogero-Sutherland model. In the repulsive regime of the free fermion formulation, we identify an attractive interaction between opposite moving particle-hole pairs that dominates the short distance behavior and that is proposed as responsible for the destabilization of the ground state, leading to a new one of bosonic nature. The process is described by a Bogoliubov transformation of the free fermion bilinear operators into bosonic ones, preserving the form of the W-infinity algebra but decoupling the opposite chirality terms in the hamiltonian, as expected in the low energy limit. In coordinate space this interaction has a short range component that arises due to the quantum regularization of the theory. The described dynamical process may be considered as a mechanism of the emergence of the known charge and quantum statistics fractionalization of the low lying excitations of the theory, as predicted in both first and second quantization studies.</description>

      <title>Realizing Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov pairing driven topological Majorana zero modes and superconducting diode effect in helical Shiba chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework for the realization of Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) pairing in a helical Shiba chain subjected to an out-of-plane Zeeman field, analyzed through a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (BDG) mean-field formalism approach. A chain of magnetic adatoms with helical spin texture deposited on the surface of a common $s$-wave superconductor, has emerged as a pivotal platform for realizing topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Our study reveals the crucial role of finite momentum pairing of Cooper pairs in the form of FFLO state which also supports topological MZMs at the ends of the chain. Interestingly, we demonstrate that FFLO pairing facilitates non-reciprocal charge transport, giving rise to superconducting diode effect in Shiba chain where both time-reversal and inversion symmetries are broken. Such diode effect stems directly from the asymmetric FFLO state. Our comprehensive analysis highlights the intricate interplay between the richness of helical Shiba chain, the out-of-plane Zeeman field, and FFLO pairing in the emergence of MZMs and driving the diode effect. These findings offer valuable insights into the design and realization of topological superconducting devices with diode-like properties, potentially advancing technological applications in quantum computing and superconducting electronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an architecture for bit flip error correction of Andreev spins that is protected by Kramers' degeneracy. Specifically, we show that a coupling network of linear inductors results in a static Hamiltonian composed of the stabilizers of a bit flip code. Thereby, without detuning from the Kramers' point, reflectometry off a single coupled resonator accomplishes a projective measurement of multiple stabilizers. We further show how circuit-mediated spin couplings enable error correction operations and a complete set of logical quantum gates. The concept is experimentally feasible.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an Ultra-Stable Antiferromagnetic Two-Dimensional CrF3 Phase with Anisotropic Quasi-1D Mechanical, Electronic, and Thermal Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19118v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an ultra-stable antiferromagnetic two-dimensional (2D) CrF3 phase that is energetically more favorable than the traditionally assumed hexagonal structure. Using first-principles calculations and evolutionary structure searches, we identify a new low-energy rectangular configuration of CrF3 with remarkable anisotropic properties. Mechanically, this phase exhibits zero in-plane Poisson's ratio, a rare negative out-of-plane Poisson's ratio, and quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) behavior characterized by minimal coupling between orthogonal directions. Electronically, CrF3 shows quasi-1D transport with two independent conduction bands near the Fermi level, tunable via uniaxial strain. The calculated bandgap is 3.05 eV, which can be modulated under strain, enabling control over its electronic properties. The material also displays out-of-plane antiferromagnetic ordering with a magnetic anisotropy energy of 0.098 meV per Cr atom and an estimated Neel temperature of 20 K. Additionally, we investigate the thermal conductivity of monolayer rectangular CrF3 (r-CrF3), revealing significant anisotropy in heat transport. The thermal conductivity along the y-axis is approximately 60.5 W/mK at 300 K, much higher than along the x-axis at 13.2 W/mK. The thermal anisotropic factor is 4.58, surpassing that of other 2D materials like black phosphorene, WTe2, and arsenene, highlighting r-CrF3's potential for advanced directional heat management. Consequently, the rectangular CrF3 phase is a promising candidate for applications in spintronics, strain-engineered nanoelectronics, mechanical metamaterials, and thermal management technologies.</description>
