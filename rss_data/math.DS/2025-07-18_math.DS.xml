      <title>Simple Lyapunov spectrum of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the simplicity of the Lyapunov spectrum of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms. We prove that a class of volume-preserving partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms is $C^r$-accumulated by $C^2$-open sets with simple spectrum. Also we prove that a class of partially hyperbolic maps has simple spectrum generically for the measures of maximal entropy. In order to prove these results, we give a criterion for simplicity of the Lyapunov spectrum in terms of periodic points homoclinically related to the invariant measure.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Regions of Attraction for Nonlinear Systems via Coordinate-Transformed TS Models and Piecewise Quadratic Lyapunov Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for computing enlarged Region of Attractions (ROA) for nonlinear dynamical systems through the integration of multiple coordinate transformations and piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions within the Takagi-Sugeno (TS) modeling framework. While existing methods typically follow a single-path approach of original system $\rightarrow$ TS model $\rightarrow$ ROA computation, the proposed methodology systematically applies a sequence of coordinate transformations to generate multiple system representations, each yielding distinct ROA estimations. Specifically, the approach transforms the original nonlinear system using transformation matrices $T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_N$ to obtain $N$ different coordinate representations, constructs corresponding TS models for each transformed system, and computes individual ROAs using piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions. The final ROA estimate is obtained as the union of all computed regions, leveraging the flexibility inherent in piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions compared to traditional quadratic approaches. The enhanced methodology demonstrates significant improvements in ROA size estimation compared to conventional single-transformation techniques, as evidenced through comparative analysis with existing TS-based stability methods.</description>

      <title>Finitude of physical measures for Markovian random maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the finiteness of physical measures for skew-product transformations $F$ associated with discrete-time random dynamical systems driven by ergodic Markov chains. We develop a framework, using an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) representation of the Markov process, that facilitates transferring results from the well-studied Bernoulli (i.i.d.) setting to the Markovian context.
  Specifically, we establish conditions for the existence of finitely many ergodic, $F$-invariant measures, absolutely continuous with respect to a reference measure, such that their statistical basins of attraction for measurable bounded observables cover the phase space almost everywhere. Furthermore, we investigate a weaker notion, which demands finitely many physical measures (not necessarily absolutely continuous) whose weak$^*$ basins of attraction cover the phase space almost everywhere. We show that for random maps on compact metric spaces driven by Markov chains on finite state spaces, this property holds if the system is mostly contracting, i.e., if all the Markovian invariant measures have negative maximal Lyapunov exponents. This result is applied to random $C^1$ diffeomorphisms of the circle and the interval under conditions based on the absence of invariant probability measures or finite invariant sets, respectively. We also connect our result to the quasi-compactness of the Koopman operator on the space of H\"older continuous functions.</description>

      <title>Thick-Thin non-Autonomous Julia Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hereditarily non uniformly perfect (HNUP) sets were introduced by Stankewitz, Sugawa, and Sumi in \cite{SSS} who gave several examples of such sets based on Cantor set-like constructions using nested intervals. For non-autonomous iteration where one considers compositions of polynomials from a sequence which is in general allowed to vary, the Julia set is uniformly perfect for all sequences with suitably bounded coefficients, while Comerford, Stankewitz and Sumi showed in \cite{CSS} that for certain sequences of polynomials with unbounded coefficients, it is possible to have Julia sets which are HNUP. In this manuscript we give an example of a non-autonomous polynomial sequences whose Julia sets lie in between these two extremes in that they are not uniformly perfect, but also not HNUP. In addition we show that these Julia sets can be expressed as a `thick-thin' decomposition consisting of a ${\mathrm F}_\sigma$ subset which is a countable union of uniformly perfect sets and a ${\mathrm G}_\delta$ subset which is HNUP.</description>

      <title>Analytic pseudo-rotations displaying ergodicity or emergence on the sphere and disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct analytic pseudo-rotations on the sphere and the disk with specific properties. We obtain analytic pseudo-rotations which are ergodic. Then, in opposition to ergodicity, we construct analytic pseudo-rotations which exhibit a maximum order of local emergence. To achieve this, we apply a principle introduced by Berger, based on the Approximation by Conjugacy method of Anosov-Katok.</description>

      <title>Measurable entire functions II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{E}$ denote the space of entire functions with the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets. The action of $\mathbb C$ by translations on $\mathcal E$ is defined by $T_zf(w) = f(w+z)$. Let $\mathcal{U}$ denote the set of entire functions whose orbit under $T$ is dense. Birkhoff showed, in [B], that $\mathcal{U}$ is not empty. One of the problems in the collection by T-C Dinh and N. Sibony [DS] asks whether there exists an invariant probability measure on $\mathcal{E}$ whose support is contained in $\mathcal U$. We will show how an old construction of the second author can be modified to provide a positive answer to their question. Furthermore, we modify the construction to produce a wealth of ergodic measures on the space of entire functions of several complex variables.</description>

      <title>Explicit linearization of multi-dimensional germs and vector fields through Ecalle's tree expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide explicit formulas of non-recursive type for the
  linearizing transformations of a non-resonant analytic germ of
  diffeomorphism at a fixed point or a non-resonant analytic germ of
  vector field at a singular point, in any complex dimension.
  The formal expressions we obtain rely on a part of Ecalle's
  tree-based combinatorics called ``armould calculus" and they have
  the same shape for dynamical systems with discrete or continuous
  time.
  They allow us to recover in a straightforward manner, under Bruno's
  arithmetical condition,
  the best known estimates for the domains of convergence of the
  analytic linearizing changes of variables
  in terms of the value of the Bruno series,
  including a new precise dependence with respect to the dimension of
  the problem.</description>

      <title>N Bugs on a Circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe and analyze a generalization of the classic ``Four Bugs on a Square'' cyclic pursuit problem. Instead of allowing the bugs to spiral towards one another, we constrain $N$ bugs to the perimeter of the unit circle. Depending on their configuration, each bug moves either clockwise or counterclockwise with a constant angular speed, or remains stationary. Unlike the original problem where bugs always coalesce, this generalization produces three possible steady states: all bugs coalescing to a single point, clusters of bugs located at two antipodal points, or bugs entering a stable infinite chase cycle where they never meet. We analyze the stability of these steady states and calculate the probability that randomly initialized bugs reach each state. For $N \leq 4$, we derive exact analytical expressions for these probabilities. For larger values, we employ Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the probability of coalescing, finding it approximately follows an inverse square root relationship with the number of bugs. This generalization reveals rich dynamical behaviors that are absent in the classic problem. Our analysis provides insight into how restricting the bugs to the circle's perimeter fundamentally alters the long-term behavior of pursuing agents compared to unrestricted pursuit problems.</description>

      <title>On the factorization of matrices into products of positive definite ones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work revisits and provides a new approach on a result by Charles Ballantine, on the factorization of a square matrix with positive determinant into a product of positive definite factors. {\em Ballantine-type} factorizations, that bound the number of positive definite factors, proved central in solving a basic, yet elusive control problem--the strong controllability of a linear system via control in the form of state feedback. Ballantine's result transcends control engineering, and highlights the little appreciated fact that rotations can be realized by the successive application of irrotational motions. Our approach is constructive and is based on the theory of optimal mass transport, specifically, it relates successive rotations of Gaussian distributions to corresponding optimal transport maps that constitute the sought factors.</description>

      <title>Improving physics-informed neural network extrapolation via transfer learning and adaptive activation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are deep learning models that incorporate the governing physical laws of a system into the learning process, making them well-suited for solving complex scientific and engineering problems. Recently, PINNs have gained widespread attention as a powerful framework for combining physical principles with data-driven modeling to improve prediction accuracy. Despite their successes, however, PINNs often exhibit poor extrapolation performance outside the training domain and are highly sensitive to the choice of activation functions (AFs). In this paper, we introduce a transfer learning (TL) method to improve the extrapolation capability of PINNs. Our approach applies transfer learning (TL) within an extended training domain, using only a small number of carefully selected collocation points. Additionally, we propose an adaptive AF that takes the form of a linear combination of standard AFs, which improves both the robustness and accuracy of the model. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves an average of 40% reduction in relative L2 error and an average of 50% reduction in mean absolute error in the extrapolation domain, all without a significant increase in computational cost. The code is available at https://github.com/LiuzLab/PINN-extrapolation .</description>

      <title>Detecting the most probable transition phenomenon of a nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The population biology model holds a significant position within ecosystems. Introducing stochastic perturbations into the model can more accurately depict real biological processes. In this paper, we primarily investigate the most probable transition phenomenon in a three-dimensional nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton (NPZ) plankton model. With appropriate parameter values, the system coexists with a stable equilibrium point and a stable limit cycle. Under noise perturbations, transitions occur between these two steady states. Based on the Onsager-Machlup action functional and the neural shooting method, we have studied the most probable transition time, the most probable transition pathway and the most probable transition probability of the NPZ system. The transition between these metastable states plays a crucial role in stochastic ecosystems, providing guidance for a better understanding of complex biological processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a connection between barcode entropy and metric entropy. Namely, we show that the barcode entropy bounds the metric entropy from below for a measure from a specific class of invariant measures associated with a pair of Lagrangian or Legendrian submanifolds, which we call pseudo-chord measures. This inequality refines, via the variational principle, the previously known upper bound of barcode entropy by topological entropy.</description>

      <title>Quantitative contact Hamiltonian dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic quantitative study of contact rigidity phenomena based on the contact Hamiltonian Floer theory established by Merry-Uljarevi\'c. Our quantitative approach applies to arbitrary admissible contact Hamiltonian functions on the contact boundary $M = \partial W$ of a ${\rm weakly}^{+}$-monotone symplectic manifold $W$. From a theoretical standpoint, we develop a comprehensive contact spectral invariant theory. As applications, the properties of these invariants enable us to establish several fundamental results: the contact big fiber theorem, sufficient conditions for orderability, a partial result on the zero-infinity conjecture, and existence results of translated points. Furthermore, we uncover a non-traditional filtration structure on contact Hamiltonian Floer groups, which we formalize through the introduction of a novel type of persistence modules, called gapped modules, that are only parametrized by a partially ordered set. Among the various properties of contact spectral invariants, we highlight that the triangle inequality is derived through an innovative analysis of a pair-of-pants construction in the contact-geometric framework.</description>

      <title>Modelling the spillover from online engagement to offline protest: stochastic dynamics and mean-field approximations on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media is transforming various aspects of offline life, from everyday decisions such as dining choices to the progression of conflicts. In this study, we propose a coupled modelling framework with an online social network layer to analyse how engagement on a specific topic spills over into offline protest activities. We develop a stochastic model and derive several mean-field models of varying complexity. These models allow us to estimate the reproductive number and anticipate when surges in activity are likely to occur. A key factor is the transmission rate between the online and offline domains; for offline outbursts to emerge, this rate must fall within a critical range, neither too low nor too high. Additionally, using synthetic networks, we examine how network structure influences the accuracy of these approximations. Our findings indicate that low-density networks need more complex approximations, whereas simpler models can effectively represent higher-density networks. When tested on two real-world networks, however, increased complexity did not enhance accuracy.</description>

Abstract: A popular approach to designing finite-dimensional boundary controllers for partial differential equations (PDEs) is to decompose the PDE into independent modes and focus on the dominant ones while neglecting highly damped residual modes. However, the neglected modes can adversely affect the overall system performance, causing spillover. The $L^2$ residue separation method was recently introduced to eliminate spillover in the state-feedback control design. In this paper, we extend this method to finite-dimensional output-feedback control, where the output is contaminated by the residual modes. To deal with the output residue, we introduce a new harmonic inequality that optimally bounds it. We develop the approach for a 1D heat equation with unknown nonlinearity, where boundary temperature measurements are used to control heat flux at the opposite boundary. By exploiting the connection between $L^2$ residue separation and $H_\infty$ theory, we show that the class of admissible nonlinearities can only increase with higher controller order.</description>

      <title>Really perverse periodic solutions of the planar N-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Examples are given of solutions of the planar N-body problem which remain the same for at least two systems of masses with the same sum and same center of mass. The least value of N achieved up to now with this property is 474, a number which had been announced in the first author's thesis.</description>

      <title>Besicovitch covering numbers for $\mathcal B$-free and other shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a finite alphabet $A$ define by $d_1(x,y):=\limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{2n+1}\#\{|i|\le n: x_i\neq y_i\}$ the Besicovitch pseudo-metric on $A^{\mathbb Z}$. It is well known that a closed subshift of $A^{\mathbb Z}$ has finite covering numbers w.r.t. $d_1$ if and only if it is mean-equicontinuous. Here we study, more generally, the scaling behavior of these covering numbers for individual orbits which are generic for an ergodic measure $\mu$ on $A^{\mathbb Z}$ with discrete spectrum, and we explore their usefulness as invariants for block code equivalence. We illustrate this by developing tools to determine these covering numbers for various classes of $\mathcal B$-free numbers (in particular also for square-free numbers), and we provide a continuous family of measures $\mu_s$, all with the same discrete spectrum generated by a single number, but such that $\mu_s$- and $\mu_{s'}$-typical $x$ resp. $x'\in A^{\mathbb Z}$ have sufficiently different growth of covering numbers such that there are no finite block codes mapping $x\to x'$ and $x'\to x$. (Indeed, both orbits have different amorphic complexities.)</description>

      <title>Pugh's global linearization for the nonautonomous unbounded system with $\mu$-dichotomy via Lyapunov theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical global linearization theorem for autonomous system given in [C. Pugh, Amer. J. Math., 91 (1969) 363-367] requires that nonlinear system with hyperbolicity satisfies boundedness and Lipschitz continuity.In this paper, we establish an {\em unbounded} global linearization theorem for nonautonomous systems subject to unbounded Lipschitz perturbations, under the assumption that the linear system admits a nonuniform $\mu$-dichotomy (more general than classical exponential dichotomy). To this end, we first develop a comprehensive Lyapunov function framework for systems exhibiting nonuniform $\mu$-dichotomy. Subsequently, we establish a characterization of nonuniform $\mu$-dichotomy in terms of strict quadratic Lyapunov functions. Building upon these theoretical foundations, we then employ these Lyapunov functions to derive a linearization result under the nonuniform $\mu$-dichotomy assumption. In the proof, we give a splitting lemma for nonuniform $\mu$-dichotomy to decouple hyperbolic system into a contractive system and an expansive system. Then we construct a transformation to linearize contractive/expansive system, which is defined by the crossing time with respect to the unit sphere.</description>

      <title>Effective atypical intersections and applications to orbit closures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a unifying setting for dealing with monodromically atypical intersections that goes beyond the usual Zilber-Pink conjecture. In particular we obtain a new proof of finiteness of the maximal atypical orbit closures in each stratum of translation surfaces $\Omega \mathcal{M}_g (\kappa)$, as given by Eskin, Filip, and Wright. We also describe a concrete algorithm, implementable in principle on a computer, which provably computes all maximal orbit closures which are 'atypical' in a sense described by Filip. The same methods also give a general algorithm for computing atypical special loci associated to systems of differential equations, and in particular give an effective and o-minimal free proof of the geometric Zilber-Pink conjecture for variations of mixed Hodge structures.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Dynamical Stability of Stochastic Gradient Descent in Overparameterized Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20209v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For overparameterized optimization tasks, such as those found in modern machine learning, global minima are generally not unique. In order to understand generalization in these settings, it is vital to study to which minimum an optimization algorithm converges. The possibility of having minima that are unstable under the dynamics imposed by the optimization algorithm limits the potential minima that the algorithm can find. In this paper, we characterize the global minima that are dynamically stable/unstable for both deterministic and stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In particular, we introduce a characteristic Lyapunov exponent that depends on the local dynamics around a global minimum and rigorously prove that the sign of this Lyapunov exponent determines whether SGD can accumulate at the respective global minimum.</description>

      <title>Rigidity for Patterson--Sullivan systems with applications to random walks and entropy rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce Patterson--Sullivan systems, which consist of a group action on a compact metrizable space and a quasi-invariant measure which behaves like a classical Patterson--Sullivan measure. For such systems we prove a generalization of Tukia's measurable boundary rigidity theorem. We then apply this generalization to (1) study the singularity conjecture for Patterson--Sullivan measures (or, conformal densities) and stationary measures of random walks on isometry groups of Gromov hyperbolic spaces, mapping class groups, and discrete subgroups of semisimple Lie groups; (2) prove versions of Tukia's theorem for word hyperbolic groups, Teichm\"uller spaces, and higher rank symmetric spaces; and (3) prove an entropy rigidity result for pseudo-Riemannian hyperbolic spaces.</description>
