      <title>Engineering Rydberg-pair interactions in divalent atoms with hyperfine-split ionization thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information processing with neutral atoms relies on Rydberg excitation for entanglement generation. While the use of heavy divalent or open-shell elements, such as strontium or ytterbium, has benefits due to their optically active core and a variety of possible qubit encodings, their Rydberg structure is generally complex. For some isotopes in particular, hyperfine interactions are relevant even for highly excited electronic states. We employ multi-channel quantum defect theory to infer the Rydberg structure of isotopes with non-zero nuclear spin and perform non-perturbative Rydberg-pair interaction calculations. We find that due to the high level density and sensitivities to external fields, experimental parameters must be precisely controlled. Specifically in ${}^{87}$Sr, we study an intrinsic F\"orster resonance, unique to divalent atoms with hyperfine-split thresholds, which simultaneously provides line stability with respect to external field fluctuations and enhanced long-range interactions. Additionally, we provide parameters for pair states that can be effectively described by single-channel Rydberg series. The explored pair states provide exciting opportunities for applications in the blockade regime as well as for more exotic long-range interactions such as largely flat, distance-independent potentials.</description>

      <title>Extracting doubly-excited state lifetimes in helium directly in the time domain with attosecond noncollinear four-wave-mixing spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The helium atom, with one nucleus and two electrons, is a prototypical system to study quantum many-body dynamics. Doubly-excited states, or quantum states in which both electrons are excited by one photon, are showcase scenarios of electronic-correlation mediated effects. In this paper, the natural lifetimes of the doubly-excited $^1$P$^o$ 2s$n$p Rydberg series and the $^1$S$^e$ 2p$^2$ dark state in helium in the 60 eV to 65 eV region are measured directly in the time domain with extreme-ultraviolet/near-infrared noncollinear attosecond four-wave-mixing (FWM) spectroscopy. The measured lifetimes are in agreement with lifetimes deduced from spectral linewidths and theoretical predictions, and the roles of specific decay mechanisms are considered. While complex spectral line shapes in the form of Fano resonances are common in absorption spectroscopy of autoionizing states, the background-free and thus homodyned character of noncollinear FWM results exclusively in Lorentzian spectral features in the absence of strong-field effects. The onset of strong-field effects that would affect the extraction of accurate natural lifetimes in helium by FWM is determined to be approximately 0.3 Rabi cycles. This study provides a systematic understanding of the FWM parameters necessary to enable accurate lifetime extractions, which can be utilized in more complex quantum systems such as molecules in the future.</description>

      <title>A neural network approach to running high-precision atomic computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern applications of atomic physics, including the determination of frequency standards, and the analysis of astrophysical spectra, require prediction of atomic properties with exquisite accuracy. For complex atomic systems, high-precision calculations are a major challenge due to the exponential scaling of the involved electronic configuration sets. This exacerbates the problem of required computational resources for these computations, and makes indispensable the development of approaches to select the most important configurations out of otherwise intractably huge sets. We have developed a neural network (NN) tool for running high-precision atomic configuration interaction (CI) computations with iterative selection of the most important configurations. Integrated with the established pCI atomic codes, our approach results in computations with significantly reduced computational requirements in comparison with those without NN support. We showcase a number of NN-supported computations for the energy levels of Fe$^{16+}$ and Ni$^{12+}$, and demonstrate that our approach can be reliably used and automated for solving specific computational problems for a wide variety of systems.</description>

      <title>Diffracting molecular matter-waves at deep-ultraviolet standing-light waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matter-wave interferometry with molecules is intriguing both because it demonstrates a fundamental quantum phenomenon and because it opens avenues to quantum-enhanced measurements in physical chemistry. One great challenge in such experiments is to establish matter-wave beam splitting mechanisms that are efficient and applicable to a wide range of particles. In the past, continuous standing light waves in the visible spectral range were used predominantly as phase gratings, while pulsed vacuum ultraviolet light found applications in photo-ionisation gratings. Here, we explore the regime of continuous, intense deep-ultraviolet ($\rm &gt;1 MW/cm^2$, $\rm 266\,nm$) light masks, where a rich variety of photo-physical and photo-chemical phenomena and relaxation pathways must be considered. The improved understanding of the mechanisms in this interaction opens new potential pathways to protein interferometry and to matter-wave enhanced sensing of molecular properties.</description>

      <title>Emergent $s$-wave interactions in orbitally active quasi-two-dimensional Fermi gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the scattering properties and bound states of a quasi-two-dimensional (q2D) spin-polarized Fermi gas near a $p$-wave Feshbach resonance. Strong confinement promotes the out-of-plane spatial wave functions to a discrete, gapped orbital degree of freedom. Exchange-antisymmetric orbital pair wave functions are predicted to give rise to low-energy q2D interactions with $s$-wave symmetry. Using radiofrequency (rf) spectroscopy, we observe the signature power-law scaling and the dimensional-crossover feature anticipated for the emergent $s$-wave channel. Additionally, we demonstrate that two types of low-energy dimers, with either $s$-wave and $p$-wave symmetry, could be formed via rf spin-flip association from an orbital mixture. These findings illustrate how gapped orbital degrees of freedom can provide additional control over scattering symmetries in strongly confined ultracold gases.</description>

      <title>Tunneling dynamics of $^{164}$Dy supersolids and droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tunneling dynamics of a magnetic $^{164}$Dy quantum gas in an elongated or pancake skewed double-well trap is investigated with a time-dependent extended Gross-Pitaevskii approach. Upon lifting the energy offset, different tunneling regimes can be identified. In the elongated trap and for sufficiently large offset, the different configurations exhibit collective macroscopic tunneling. For smaller offset, partial reflection from and transmission through the barrier lead to density accumulation in both wells, and eventually to tunneling-locking. One can also reach the macroscopic self-trapping regime for increasing relative dipolar interaction strength, while tunneling vanishes for large barrier heights. A richer dynamical behavior is observed for the pancake-like trap. For instance, the supersolid maintains its shape, while the superfluid density gets distorted signifying the emergence of peculiar excitation patterns in the macroscopic tunneling regime. The findings reported here may offer new ways to probe distinctive dynamical features in the supersolid and droplet regimes.</description>

      <title>Progress toward a zero-magnetic-field environment for ultracold-atom experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19565v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The minimization of the magnetic field plays a crucial role in ultracold gas research. For instance, the contact interaction dominates all the other energy scales in the zero magnetic field limit, giving rise to novel quantum phases of matter. However, lowering magnetic fields well below the mG level is often challenging in ultracold gas experiments. In this article, we apply Landau-Zener spectroscopy to characterize and reduce the magnetic field on an ultracold gas of sodium atoms to a few tens of {\mu}G. The lowest magnetic field achieved here opens to observing novel phases of matter with ultracold spinor Bose gases.</description>
