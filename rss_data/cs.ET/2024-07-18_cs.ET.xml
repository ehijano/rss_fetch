      <title>Voltage-Controlled Magnetoelectric Devices for Neuromorphic Diffusion Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic diffusion processes are pervasive in nature, from the seemingly erratic Brownian motion to the complex interactions of synaptically-coupled spiking neurons. Recently, drawing inspiration from Langevin dynamics, neuromorphic diffusion models were proposed and have become one of the major breakthroughs in the field of generative artificial intelligence. Unlike discriminative models that have been well developed to tackle classification or regression tasks, diffusion models as well as other generative models such as ChatGPT aim at creating content based upon contexts learned. However, the more complex algorithms of these models result in high computational costs using today's technologies, creating a bottleneck in their efficiency, and impeding further development. Here, we develop a spintronic voltage-controlled magnetoelectric memory hardware for the neuromorphic diffusion process. The in-memory computing capability of our spintronic devices goes beyond current Von Neumann architecture, where memory and computing units are separated. Together with the non-volatility of magnetic memory, we can achieve high-speed and low-cost computing, which is desirable for the increasing scale of generative models in the current era. We experimentally demonstrate that the hardware-based true random diffusion process can be implemented for image generation and achieve comparable image quality to software-based training as measured by the Frechet inception distance (FID) score, achieving ~10^3 better energy-per-bit-per-area over traditional hardware.</description>

      <title>StoX-Net: Stochastic Processing of Partial Sums for Efficient In-Memory Computing DNN Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crossbar-based in-memory computing (IMC) has emerged as a promising platform for hardware acceleration of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, the energy and latency of IMC systems are dominated by the large overhead of the peripheral analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). To address such ADC bottleneck, here we propose to implement stochastic processing of array-level partial sums (PS) for efficient IMC. Leveraging the probabilistic switching of spin-orbit torque magnetic tunnel junctions, the proposed PS processing eliminates the costly ADC, achieving significant improvement in energy and area efficiency. To mitigate accuracy loss, we develop PS-quantization-aware training that enables backward propagation across stochastic PS. Furthermore, a novel scheme with an inhomogeneous sampling length of the stochastic conversion is proposed. When running ResNet20 on the CIFAR-10 dataset, our architecture-to-algorithm co-design demonstrates up to 22x, 30x, and 142x improvement in energy, latency, and area, respectively, compared to IMC with standard ADC. Our optimized design configuration using stochastic PS achieved 666x (111x) improvement in Energy-Delay-Product compared to IMC with full precision ADC (sparse low-bit ADC), while maintaining near-software accuracy at various benchmark classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Profiling quantum circuits for their efficient execution on single- and multi-core architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Application-specific quantum computers offer the most efficient means to tackle problems intractable by classical computers. Realizing these architectures necessitates a deep understanding of quantum circuit properties and their relationship to execution outcomes on quantum devices. Our study aims to perform for the first time a rigorous examination of quantum circuits by introducing graph theory-based metrics extracted from their qubit interaction graph and gate dependency graph alongside conventional parameters describing the circuit itself. This methodology facilitates a comprehensive analysis and clustering of quantum circuits. Furthermore, it uncovers a connection between parameters rooted in both qubit interaction and gate dependency graphs, and the performance metrics for quantum circuit mapping, across a range of established quantum device and mapping configurations. Among the various device configurations, we particularly emphasize modular (i.e., multi-core) quantum computing architectures due to their high potential as a viable solution for quantum device scalability. This thorough analysis will help us to: i) identify key attributes of quantum circuits that affect the quantum circuit mapping performance metrics; ii) predict the performance on a specific chip for similar circuit structures; iii) determine preferable combinations of mapping techniques and hardware setups for specific circuits; and iv) define representative benchmark sets by clustering similarly structured circuits.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Multigrid Ansatz for Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is an emerging topic in engineering that promises to enhance supercomputing using fundamental physics. In the near term, the best candidate algorithms for achieving this advantage are variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). We design and numerically evaluate a novel ansatz for VQAs, focusing in particular on the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). As our ansatz is inspired by classical multigrid hierarchy methods, we call it "multigrid" ansatz. The multigrid ansatz creates a parameterized quantum circuit for a quantum problem on $n$ qubits by successively building and optimizing circuits for smaller qubit counts $j &lt; n$, reusing optimized parameter values as initial solutions to next level hierarchy at $j+1$. We show through numerical simulation that the multigrid ansatz outperforms the standard hardware-efficient ansatz in terms of solution quality for the Laplacian eigensolver as well as for a large class of combinatorial optimization problems with specific examples for MaxCut and Maximum $k$-Satisfiability. Our studies establish the multi-grid ansatz as a viable candidate for many VQAs and in particular present a promising alternative to the QAOA approach for combinatorial optimization problems.</description>
