      <title>Broadband Cavity-Enhanced Absorption Spectroscopy (BBCEAS) Coupled with an Interferometer for On-Band and Off-Band Detection of Glyoxal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glyoxal CHOCHO is a trace gas in the atmosphere, often used as an indicator of biogenic emissions. It is frequently compared to formaldehyde concentrations, which serve as indicators of anthropogenic emissions, to gain insights into the characteristics of the environmental source. This study employed broadband cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy to detect gaseous CHOCHO, methylglyoxal, and $\mathrm{NO_2}$. Two different detection methods are compared. Spectrograph and CCD Detection: This approach involves coupling the system to a spectrograph with a charge-coupled device (CCD) detector. It achieved a 1 min 1-$\sigma$ detection limit of $2.5 \times 10^8$ molecules/cm$^3$, or 10 parts per trillion (ppt). Methylglyoxal and $\mathrm{NO_2}$ achieved 1 min 1-$\sigma$ detection limits of 34 ppt and 22 ppt, respectively. Interferometer and PMT Detection: In this method, an interferometer is used in conjunction with a photomultiplier tube (PMT) detector. It resulted in a 2 min 1-$\sigma$ detection limit of $1.5 \times 10^{10}$ molecules/cm$^3$, or 600 ppt. The $\mathrm{NO_2}$ 2 min 1-$\sigma$ detection limit was determined to be 900 ppt. Concentrations of methylglyoxal were difficult to determine using this method, as they appeared to be below the detection limit of the instrument. This study discusses the advantages and limitations of each of these detection methods.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Role of Lewis Base Strength in Small-Molecule Passivation of Defect Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite materials are highly promising for a range of optoelectronic applications including energy conversion technologies, owing to their high charge-carrier mobilities, adaptability of bandgap tuning, and exceptional light-harvesting capabilities. Yet, defects that arise during manufacturing often lead to performance limitations such as hindered efficiency and stability. This is primarily due to significant deviations in crystal geometry and band structure elements such as the Fermi level, work function, and density of states, compared to pristine perovskite. To mitigate these issues, this study explored the passivation of surface iodide-vacancy defect in perovskite using small-molecule Lewis bases, an approach aims to counteract these detrimental effects. Among the examined N-, P- and O-coordinated benzyl derivatives, those featuring a phosphonic acid group as a passivator for the undercoordinated Pb(II) sites demonstrated outstanding electronic structure properties. This was notably achieved by lowering the Fermi level, increasing the work function, and suppressing surface trap states. The effective restoration of electronic properties achieved by targeted small molecule passivation provides crucial insights into enhanced functionality and efficiency for defect perovskite materials.</description>

      <title>A Note on Spectral Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, transitions between states are often rare events due to energy barriers that exceed the thermal temperature. Because of their infrequent occurrence and the huge number of degrees of freedom in molecular systems, understanding the physical properties that drive rare events is immensely difficult. A common approach to this problem is to propose a collective variable (CV) that describes this process by a simplified representation. However, choosing CVs is not easy, as it often relies on physical intuition. Machine learning (ML) techniques provide a promising approach for effectively extracting optimal CVs from MD data. Here, we provide a note on a recent unsupervised ML method called spectral map, which constructs CVs by maximizing the timescale separation between slow and fast variables in the system.</description>

      <title>Method-independent cusps for atomic orbitals in quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an approach for augmenting Gaussian atomic orbitals with correct nuclear cusps. Like the atomic orbital basis set itself, and unlike previous cusp corrections, this approach is independent of the many-body method used to prepare wave functions for quantum Monte Carlo. Once the basis set and molecular geometry are specified, the cusp-corrected atomic orbitals are uniquely specified, regardless of which density functionals, quantum chemistry methods, or subsequent variational Monte Carlo optimizations are employed. We analyze the statistical improvement offered by these cusps in a number of molecules and find them to offer similar advantages as molecular-orbital-based approaches while maintaining independence from the choice of many-body method.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Sampling of Protein Conformational Changes via True Reaction Coordinates from Energy Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bottleneck in enhanced sampling lies in finding collective variables (CVs) that can effectively accelerate protein conformational changes. True reaction coordinates (tRCs) that can predict the committor are considered the optimal CVs, but identifying them requires unbiased natural reactive trajectories, which, paradoxically, depend on effective enhanced sampling. Using the generalized work functional method, we found that tRCs control both conformational changes and energy relaxation, enabling us to compute tRCs from energy relaxation simulations. Applying bias to tRCs accelerated conformational changes and ligand dissociation in HIV-1 protease and the PDZ2 domain by 10^5 to 10^15-fold. The resulting trajectories follow natural transition pathways, enabling efficient generation of natural reactive trajectories. In contrast, biased trajectories from empirical CVs often display non-physical features. Furthermore, by computing tRCs from a single protein structure, our method enables predictive sampling of conformational changes. These findings significantly broaden the range of protein functional processes accessible to molecular dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>PLUMED Tutorials: a collaborative, community-driven learning ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In computational physics, chemistry, and biology, the implementation of new techniques in a shared and open source software lowers barriers to entry and promotes rapid scientific progress. However, effectively training new software users presents several challenges. Common methods like direct knowledge transfer and in-person workshops are limited in reach and comprehensiveness. Furthermore, while the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the benefits of online training, traditional online tutorials can quickly become outdated and may not cover all the software's functionalities. To address these issues, here we introduce ``PLUMED Tutorials'', a collaborative model for developing, sharing, and updating online tutorials. This initiative utilizes repository management and continuous integration to ensure compatibility with software updates. Moreover, the tutorials are interconnected to form a structured learning path and are enriched with automatic annotations to provide broader context. This paper illustrates the development, features, and advantages of PLUMED Tutorials, aiming to foster an open community for creating and sharing educational resources.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Optimal Control of Electron Dynamics within Hartree-Fock Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the problem of determining the optimal applied electric field to drive a molecule from an initial state to a desired target state. For even moderately sized molecules, solving this problem directly using the exact equations of motion -- the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) -- is numerically intractable. We present a solution of this problem within time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory, a mean field approximation of the TDSE. Optimality is defined in terms of minimizing the total control effort while maximizing the overlap between desired and achieved target states. We frame this problem as an optimization problem constrained by the nonlinear TDHF equations; we solve it using trust region optimization with gradients computed via a custom-built adjoint state method. For three molecular systems, we show that with very small neural network parametrizations of the control, our method yields solutions that achieve desired targets within acceptable constraints and tolerances.</description>

      <title>Water under hydrophobic confinement: entropy and diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of liquid water are known to change drastically in confined geometries. A most interesting and intriguing phenomenon is that the diffusion of water is found to be strongly enhanced by the proximity of a hydrophobic confining wall relative to the bulk diffusion. We report a molecular dynamics simulation using a classical water model investigating the water diffusion near a non-interacting smooth confining wall, which is assumed to imitate a hydrophobic surface. A pronounced diffusion enhancement is observed in the water layers adjacent to the wall. We present evidence that the observed diffusion enhancement can be accounted for, with numerical accuracy, using the universal scaling law for liquid diffusion that relates the liquid diffusion rate to the excess entropy. These results show that the scaling law, that has so far only been used for the description of the diffusion in simple liquids, can successfully describe the diffusion in water. It is thus shown that the law can be used for the description of water dynamics under nano-scale confinement which is currently a subject of intense research activity.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuit and mapping algorithms for wavepacket dynamics: case study of anharmonic hydrogen bonds in protonated and hydroxide water clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate computational study of wavepacket nuclear dynamics is considered to be a classically intractable problem, particularly with increasing dimensions. Here we present two algorithms that, in conjunction with other methods developed by us, will form the basis for performing quantum nuclear dynamics in arbitrary dimensions. For one algorithm, we present a direct map between the Born-Oppenheimer Hamiltonian describing the wavepacket time-evolution and the control parameters of a spin-lattice Hamiltonian that describes the dynamics of qubit states in an ion-trap quantum computer. This map is exact for three qubits, and when implemented, the dynamics of the spin states emulate those of the nuclear wavepacket. However, this map becomes approximate as the number of qubits grow. In a second algorithm we present a general quantum circuit decomposition formalism for such problems using a method called the Quantum Shannon Decomposition. This algorithm is more robust and is exact for any number of qubits, at the cost of increased circuit complexity. The resultant circuit is implemented on IBM's quantum simulator (QASM) for 3-7 qubits. In both cases the wavepacket dynamics is found to be in good agreement with the classical result and the corresponding vibrational frequencies obtained from the wavepacket density time-evolution, are in agreement to within a few tenths of a wavenumbers.</description>

      <title>A large language model-type architecture for high-dimensional molecular potential energy surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing high dimensional potential surfaces for molecular and materials systems is considered to be a great challenge in computational chemistry with potential impact in a range of areas including fundamental prediction of reaction rates. In this paper we design and discuss an algorithm that has similarities to large language models in generative AI and natural language processing. Specifically, we represent a molecular system as a graph which contains a set of nodes, edges, faces etc. Interactions between these sets, which represent molecular subsystems in our case, are used to construct the potential energy surface for a reasonably sized chemical system with 51 dimensions. Essentially a family of neural networks that pertain to the graph-based subsystems, get the job done for this 51 dimensional system. We then ask if this same family of lower-dimensional neural networks can be transformed to provide accurate predictions for a 186 dimensional potential surface. We find that our algorithm does provide reasonably accurate results for this larger dimensional problem with sub-kcal/mol accuracy for the higher dimensional potential surface problem.</description>

      <title>Utilizing redundancies in Qubit Hilbert Space to reduce entangling gate counts in the Unitary Vibrational Coupled-Cluster Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method for state preparation using the Unitary Vibrational Coupled-Cluster (UVCC) technique. Our approach utilizes redundancies in the Hilbert space in the direct mapping of vibrational modes into qubits. By eliminating half of the qubit controls required in the Trotterized UVCC ansatz, our method achieves up to a 50% theoretical reduction in the entangling gate count compared to other methods and up to a 28% reduction compared practically useful approaches. This improvement enhances the fidelity of UVCC state preparation, enabling more efficient and earlier implementation of complex quantum vibrational structure calculations on near-term quantum devices. We experimentally demonstrate our method on Quantinuum's H1-1 quantum hardware, achieving significantly higher fidelities for 6- and 8-qubit systems compared to existing implementations. For fault-tolerant architectures, eliminating half of the control qubits in multi-controlled rotations incurs an additional Toffoli gate overhead elsewhere in the circuit. Thus, the overall performance gain depends on the specific decomposition method used for multi-controlled gates.</description>

      <title>PDMD: Potential-free Data-driven Molecular Dynamics for Variable-sized Water Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulation approaches, such as ab initio MD and empirical force field MD, face significant trade-offs between physical accuracy and computational efficiency. This work presents a novel Potential-free Data-driven Molecular Dynamics (PDMD) framework for predicting system energy and atomic forces of variable-sized water clusters. Specifically, PDMD employs the smooth overlap of atomic positions descriptor to generate high-dimensional, equivariant features before leveraging ChemGNN, a graph neural network model that adaptively learns the atomic chemical environments without requiring a priori knowledge. Through an iterative self-consistent training approach, the converged PDMD achieves a mean absolute error of 7.1 meV/atom for energy and 59.8 meV/angstrom for forces, outperforming the state-of-the-art DeepMD by ~80% in energy accuracy and ~200% in force prediction. As a result, PDMD can reproduce the ab initio MD properties of water clusters at a tiny fraction of its computational cost. These results demonstrate that the proposed PDMD offers multiple-phase predictive power, enabling ultra-fast, general-purpose MD simulations while retaining ab initio accuracy.</description>

      <title>DFT and Model Hamiltonian Study of Optoelectronic Properties of Some Low-Symmetry Graphene Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied the electronic and optical properties of three low-symmetry graphene quantum dots (GQDs), with the point-group symmetries $C_{2v}$, and $C_{2h}$. For the calculations of linear optical absorption spectra, we employed both the first-principles time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT), and the electron-correlated Pariser-Parr-Pople (PPP) model coupled with the configuration-interaction (CI) approach. In the PPP-CI approach, calculations were performed using both screened and standard parameters, along with efficiently incorporating electron correlation effects using multi-reference singles-doubles configuration-interaction for both ground and excited states. We assume that the GQDs are saturated by hydrogen atoms at the edges, making them effectively polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) dibenzo[bc,ef]coronene (also known as benzo(1,14)bisanthene, C$_{30}$H$_{14}$), and two isomeric compounds, dinaphtho[8,1,2abc;2,1,8klm]coronene and dinaphtho[8,1,2abc;2,1,8jkl]coronene with the chemical formula C$_{36}$H$_{16}$. The two isomers have different point group symmetries, therefore, this study will also help us understand the influence of symmetry on optical properties. A common feature of the absorption spectra of the three GQDs is that the first peak representing the optical gap is of low to moderate intensity, while the intense peaks appear at higher energies. For each GQD, PPP model calculations performed with the screened parameters agree well with the experimental results of the corresponding PAH, and also with the TDDFT calculations. To further quantify the influence of electron-correlation effects, we also computed the singlet-triplet gap (spin gap) of the three GQDs, and we found them to be significant.</description>

Abstract: This article solves two major tasks that frequently arise in the theory of electron collisions with a target molecular cation. First, it extends the energy-dependent frame transformation treatment(EDFT), which is needed to map fixed-nuclei electron-molecule scattering matrices into an energy-dependent laboratory frame scattering matrix with vibrational channel indices. The EDFT mapping can now be carried out even when the target molecule possesses multiple low energy potential curves, significantly transcending previous applications. Secondly, it implements a method to extract the rest of the full lab-frame scattering matrix, i.e. the columns and rows describing input and/or output dissociation channels. The treatment is benchmarked in this article against the essentially exact solution of a refined two-dimensional model of the singlet gerade $\Sigma$ symmetry of H$_2$. Our tests demonstrate that the theory accurately maps fixed-nuclei scattering information, of the type provided by existing electron-molecule computer codes, into a laboratory-frame scattering matrix that includes both ionization and dissociation. This treatment can provide a general framework applicable to a broad class of electron collision processes involving diatomic target ions, suitable for an accurate description of challenging processes such as dissociative recombination.</description>

Abstract: Bosonic quantum devices, which utilize harmonic oscillator modes to encode information, are emerging as a promising alternative to conventional qubit-based quantum devices, especially for the simulation of vibrational dynamics and spectroscopy. We present a framework for digital quantum simulation of vibrational dynamics under anharmonic potentials on these bosonic devices. In our approach the vibrational Hamiltonian is decomposed into solvable fragments that can be used for Hamiltonian simulation on currently available bosonic hardware. Specifically, we extended the Cartan subalgebra approach [T.C. Yen, A.F. Izmaylov, PRX Quantum 2, 040320 (2021)] -- a method for decomposing quantum Hamiltonians into solvable parts -- to bosonic operators, enabling us to construct anharmonic Hamiltonian fragments that can be efficiently diagonalized using Bogoliubov transforms. The approach is tested using a simulation of tunneling dynamics in a model two-dimensional double-well potential and calculations of vibrational eigenenergies for small molecules. Our fragmentation scheme provides a new approach for digital quantum simulations on bosonic quantum hardware for multi-mode anharmonic vibrational dynamics.</description>

      <title>Perspective: Time irreversibility in systems observed at coarse resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02675</link>

Abstract: A broken time-reversal symmetry, i.e. broken detailed balance, is central to non-equilibrium physics and is a prerequisite for life. However, it turns out to be quite challenging to unambiguously define and quantify time-reversal symmetry (and violations thereof) in practice, that is, from observations. Measurements on complex systems have a finite resolution and generally probe low-dimensional projections of the underlying dynamics, which are well known to introduce memory. In situations where many microscopic states become "lumped" onto the same observable "state" or when introducing "reaction coordinates" to reduce the dimensionality of data, signatures of a broken time-reversal symmetry in the microscopic dynamics become distorted or masked. In this perspective we highlight why in defining and discussing time-reversal symmetry, and quantifying its violations, the precise underlying assumptions on the microscopic dynamics, the coarse graining, and further reductions, are not a technical detail. These assumptions decide whether the conclusions that are drawn are physically sound or inconsistent. We summarize recent findings in the field and reflect upon key challenges.</description>
