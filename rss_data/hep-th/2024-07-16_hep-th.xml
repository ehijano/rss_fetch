      <title>A non-local way around the no-global-symmetries conjecture in quantum gravity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The no-global-symmetries conjecture is central to the swampland program that delineates the boundary between effective field theories that can be obtained from a quantum theory of gravity to those that cannot. The conjecture states that virtual black-hole configurations in the path integral generate terms which violate all global symmetries in the effective action for matter. Because of its central role, it is crucial to understand limitations to the validity of this conjecture. In the context of the Lorentzian path integral over spacetime geometries, we explore whether virtual black-hole configurations can be suppressed dynamically. To that end, we work in a spherically symmetric setting and make use of horizon-detecting curvature invariants which vanish on the horizon. By constructing a non-local action from the inverse of such curvature invariants, we can achieve destructive interference of black-hole configurations in the path integral.</description>

      <title>Non-supersymmetric non-tachyonic heterotic vacua with reduced rank in various dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct rigid non-supersymmetric heterotic vacua with reduced rank and no tachyons in six and four dimensions. These configurations are based on asymmetric orbifold compactifications which do not admit deformation moduli and represent, to the best of our knowledge, the first instances of non-tachyonic non-supersymmetric heterotic vacua with reduced rank.</description>

      <title>The particle content of $R^2$ gravity revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the spectrum of (pure) $R^2$ gravity on Minkowski background inevitably results into a Catch-22: any consistent interpretation of its particle dynamics dictates that no accidental gauge symmetries emerge, a requirement that cannot be fulfilled when the theory is studied on Minkowski.
  For the case at hand, there is an emergent gauge redundancy corresponding to a transverse-traceless shift of the graviton. This has detrimental consequences since it empties the spectrum from all particle states. Being an artifact of the linearized approximation on top of Minkowski background, the symmetry does not persist at higher orders and degrees of freedom are reintroduced via interactions, making $R^2$ gravity infinitely strongly-coupled.
  Provided that the theory is considered on appropriate backgrounds -- for instance de Sitter spacetime -- or is supplemented with the Einstein-Hilbert term, $R^2$ gravity propagates the two usual graviton polarizations plus one additional (massless or massive) scalar field. We explicitly demonstrate that in a fully covariant manner.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity and chaos in deformed SYK models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Krylov complexity has recently been proposed as a quantum probe of chaos. The Krylov exponent characterising the exponential growth of Krylov complexity is conjectured to upper-bound the Lyapunov exponent. We compute the Krylov and the Lyapunov exponents in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and in some of its deformations. We do this analysis both at infinite and finite temperatures, in models where the number of fermionic interactions is both finite and infinite. We consider deformations that interpolate between two regions of near-maximal chaos and deformations that become nearly-integrable at low temperatures. In all cases, we find that the Krylov exponent upper-bounds the Lyapunov one. However, we find that while the Lyapunov exponent can have non-monotonic behaviour as a function of temperature, in all studied examples the Krylov exponent behaves monotonically. For instance, we find models where the Lyapunov exponent goes to zero at low temperatures, while the Krylov exponent saturates to its maximal bound. We speculate on the possibility that this monotonicity might be a generic feature of the Krylov exponent in quantum systems evolving under unitary evolution.</description>

      <title>Spinning up the spool: Massive spinning fields in 3d quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to incorporate massive spinning fields into the Euclidean path integral of three-dimensional quantum gravity via its Chern-Simons formulation. The coupling of the spinning fields to gravity is captured by a Wilson spool, a collection of Wilson loops winding around closed paths of the geometry, and generalizes the proposal of [1,2]. We present a robust derivation of the Wilson spool by providing a new group-theoretic perspective of the quasinormal mode method for one-loop determinants. We test our proposal on Euclidean BTZ and $S^3$ backgrounds. We also evaluate explicitly the quantum corrections to the path integral on $S^3$, and report on how $G_N$ and the mass are renormalized to leading order in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Multi-kinks in scalar field theories with non-degenerate vacua: The commensurable and non degenerate double sine-Gordon model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers generic scalar fields models in one space dimension,the potentials of which have several vacuum states. It is shown that the partial breaking of the vacuum degeneracy provides a mechanism for the appearance of static multi-kinks, whenever some false vacuum states appear between two true vacuum states. A multi-kink is a stable field configuration with an internal structure, consisting of various localized energy packages with well-defined separations between them. General results for multi-kinks properties are presented. We introduce the commensurable and non degenerate double sine-Gordon model as a specific realization of this mechanism, supporting the existence of multi-kinks with an arbitrary $n$-number of subkinks. The multi-kinks properties are thoroughly analyzed including the novel phenomenology displayed when two of them collide.</description>

      <title>A Property of Geodesics in Special K\"ahler Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stable geodesics of the QFT special K\"ahler geometry ($\equiv$ Seiberg-Witten geometry of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ QFT) using the Myers argument. Complete stable geodesics are quite restricted, and can be described very explicitly. In particular no closed stable geodesic exists. We comment on the application of the Myers method to related problems, including geodesics in moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau 3-folds.</description>

      <title>Holographic complexity and residual entropy of a rotating charged BTZ black hole within Horndeski gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the holographic complexity and residual entropy of a rotating charged BTZ black hole within Horndeski gravity. The motivation for considering these two fields of investigation is related to the emission of information from the black hole encoded by quantum complexity; even at zero temperature, information is still emitted. In this case, the death of the black hole only occurs classically. In this sense, the entropy of the black hole at zero temperature must still be a minimum of information that is not entirely zero. In recent investigations regarding Horndeski gravity in the AdS/BCFT correspondence, we showed a minimum entropy (residual/remaining entropy) for zero temperature. In this sense, complexity and entropy, as we will show throughout this work, provide information about the emission from a black hole even after its classical death.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a gravitational dual of a Josephson junction constructed from the AdS/BCFT correspondence. On the gravity side, we consider a planar AdS-Schwarzschild black hole. Our junction is connected by the boundary $Q$ with tension $\Sigma$ of the boundary CFT. Our computations on the gravity side reproduce the standard relation between the current across the junction and the phase difference of the condensate controlled by the tension $\Sigma$. We also study the maximum current's dependence on the junction's tension and size and reproduce familiar results.</description>

      <title>On the supersymmetries of branes with fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dirac-Born-Infled action that describes the dynamics of D branes also allows one to compute the supersymmetries they preserve using the Kappa-symmetry projector. The ''Lagrangian'' expression of this projector depends on the velocity and electric fields of the branes, but not on the corresponding conserved charges. One can also construct the projector in a ''Hamiltonian'' approach, by multiplying the conserved string, brane and momentum charges with the corresponding gamma matrix involutions, adding them to the mass of the brane multiplied by the unit matrix, and normalizing the resulting expression. We show that these two procedures are equivalent.</description>

      <title>Gauss Relations in Feynman Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embedding Feynman integrals in Grassmannians, we express Feynman integrals as linear combinations of generalized hypergeometric functions. Here we present general methods to obtain Gauss relations among those generalized hypergeometric functions. The hypergeometric expressions of Feynman integral are analytically continued from some connected component to another by the Gauss inverse relations, then continued to the whole domain of definition by the Gauss-Kummer relations. The Laurant series of the Feynman integral around the time-space dimension $D=4$ is obtained by the Gauss adjacent relations where the coefficients of powers of $D-4$ are given as some finite linear combinations of hypergeometric functions with integer parameters. As an example, we illustrate how to use the method to obtain the analytic expression of the Feynman integral of one-loop self energy in its whole domain of definition.</description>

      <title>Courant algebroid without constraints on fluxes on its Dirac structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the standard Courant algebroid and show how the $O(D,D)$ group elements give rise to the family of Courant algebroids, defined with different twisted Courant brackets. With the appropriate transformation of the anchor, we show that all Courant algebroid relations are a priori satisfied. We analyze a couple of Courant algebroids relevant for string theory and their respective Dirac structures, obtaining constraints they impose on fluxes. In the end, we show that the Courant algebroid that is simultaneously twisted by both $B$ and $\theta$ is characterized by Dirac structures with no restrictions imposed on fluxes.</description>

      <title>Centripetal force on Casimir energies in $\kappa$-deformed rotating frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the implications of a fundamental length scale on the centripetal force on a rotating Casimir apparatus in $\kappa$-space-time. We model the Casimir apparatus rotating with constant angular speed using appropriate $\kappa$-deformed coordinates. We find the $\kappa$-deformed centripetal force on a single plate, as well as for parallel plates. We show that the Casimir energy, including the divergent part (self energies of the plates) experiences centripetal forces like a conventional mass. We also find centripetal force on oriented parallel plates rotating with constant angular speed in $\kappa$-space-time. Results show that the mass-energy equivalence principle holds in the $\kappa$-space-time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triply Special Relativity is a deformation of Special Relativity based on three fundamental parameters, that describes a noncommutative geometry on a curved spacetime, preserving the Lorentz invariance and the principle of relativity. Its symmetries are generated by a 14-parameter nonlinear algebra.
  In this paper, we discuss a generalization of the original model and construct its realizations on a canonical phase space. We also investigate in more detail its classical limit, obtained by replacing the commutators by Poisson brackets.</description>

      <title>Vacuum energy density from the form factor bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The form-factor bootstrap is incomplete until one normalizes the zero-particle form factor. For the stress energy tensor we describe how to obtain the vacuum energy density $\rho_{\rm vac}$, defined as $\langle 0| T_{\mu\nu} | 0 \rangle = \rho_{\rm vac} \, g_{\mu\nu}$, from the form-factor bootstrap. Even for integrable QFT's in D=2 spacetime dimensions, this prescription is new, although it reproduces previously known results obtained in a different and more difficult thermodynamic Bethe ansatz computation. We propose a version of this prescription in D=4 dimensions. For these even dimensions, the vacuum energy density has the universal form $\rho_{\rm vac} \propto m^D/\mathfrak{g}$ where $\mathfrak{g}$ is a dimensionless interaction coupling constant which can be determined from the high energy behavior of the S-matrix. In the limit $\mathfrak{g} \to 0$, $\rho_{\rm vac} $ diverges due to well understood UV divergences in free quantum field theories. If we assume the the observed Cosmological Constant originates from the vacuum energy density $\rho_{\rm vac}$ computed as proposed here, then this suggests there must exist a particle which does not obtain its mass from spontaneous symmetry breaking in the electro-weak sector, which we designate as the ``zeron". A strong candidate for the zeron is a massive Majorana neutrino.</description>

      <title>SVD Entanglement Entropy of Chiral Dirac Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the SVD entanglement entropy, which has recently come up as a successor to the pseudo entropy. This paper is a first-of-its-kind application of SVD entanglement entropy to a system of chiral Dirac oscillators which prove to be natural to study the SVD formalism because the two chiral oscillator ground states can be taken as the pre-selected and post-selected states. We argue how this alternative for entanglement entropy is better and more intuitive than the von Neumann one to study quantum phase transition. We also provide as an illustrative example, a new generalized proof of the SVD entanglement entropy being $\log2$ for a pair of Bell states that differ from each other by relative phases.</description>

      <title>Conservative Spin Magnitude Change in Orbital Evolution in General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that physical scattering observables for compact spinning objects in general relativity can depend on additional degrees of freedom in the spin tensor beyond those described by the spin vector alone. The impulse, spin kick, and leading-order waveforms exhibit such a nontrivial dependence. A signal of this additional structure is the change in the magnitude of the spin vector under conservative Hamiltonian evolution, similar to our previous studies in electrodynamics. These additional degrees of freedom describe dynamical mass multipoles of compact objects and decouple for black holes. We also show that the conservative impulse, spin kick and change of the additional degrees of freedom are encoded in the eikonal phase.</description>

      <title>Constraining Parameters for the Accelerating Universe in $f(R,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the paper, we present an accelerating cosmological model in $f(R,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ gravity with the parameter constrained through the cosmological data sets. At the beginning, we have employed a functional form of $f(R,\mathcal{L}_{m}) =\frac{R}{2}+\alpha R^2+\mathcal{L}_{m}^\beta$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are model parameters. This model is well motivated from the Starobinsky model in $f(R)$ gravity and the power law form of $f(\mathcal{L}_{m})$. The Hubble parameter has been derived with some algebraic manipulation and constrained by Hubble data and Pantheon$^{+}$ data. With the constraint parameters, present value of deceleration parameter has been obtained to as $q_{0}\approx-0.63$ with the transition at $z_{t}\approx0.7$. It shows the early deceleration and late time acceleration behaviour. The present value of other geometric parameters such as the jerk and snap parameter are obtained to be $j_{0}\approx0.78$ and $s_{0}\approx 0.1$ respectively. The state finder diagnostic test gives the quintessence behaviour at present and converging to $\Lambda$CDM at late times. Moreover the $Om(z)$ diagnostics gives negative slope which shows that the model favours the state finder diagnostic result. Also the current age of Universe has been obtained as, $t_{0} = 13.64~~Gyrs$. The equation of state parameter also shows the quintessence behaviour. Based on the present analysis, it indicates that the $f(R,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ gravitational theory may be another alternative to study the dark energy models.</description>

      <title>Ellis wormhole with nonlinear electromagnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the spherically symmetric wormhole in Einstein's gravity coupling phantom field and nonlinear electromagnetic field. Numerical results show that this solution violates the Null Energy Condition (NEC), and as the parameters change, the ADM mass of the entire spacetime changes from positive to negative. In addition, we analyze the light ring (LR) of the solution and demonstrate the astronomical observation properties. Especially when negative mass appears, the general LR will not appear, only a ``special unstable LR" exists at the throat, which is caused by the repulsive effect of the negative mass on both sides of the wormhole. Finally, we draw the embedding diagram to reflect the geometric characteristics of the wormhole.</description>

      <title>Axion Interactions with Domain and Bubble Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that interactions between axion-like particles (ALPs) and co-dimension one defects, such as phase-transition bubble walls and solitonic domain walls, can lead to important changes in the evolution of both walls and ALPs. The leading effect arises from the change in the ALP decay constant across the interface, which naturally follows from shift-symmetric interactions with the corresponding order parameter. Specifically, we show that for thin walls moving relativistically, an ALP background -- such as e.g. axion dark matter -- gives rise to a frictional force on the interface that is proportional to $\gamma^2$, with $\gamma$ the Lorentz factor of the wall, and that this effect is present in both the oscillating and frozen axion regimes. We explore the broader consequences of this effect for bubble and domain walls in the early universe, and show that this source of friction can be present even in the absent of a conventional medium such as radiation or matter. Possible implications include modifications to the dynamics of bubble and domain walls and their corresponding gravitational wave signatures, as well as the generation of a dark radiation component of ALPs in the form of ultra-relativistic `axion shells' with Lorentz factor $\gamma_\text{shell} \simeq 2\gamma^2 \gg 1$ that may remain relativistic until the present day.</description>

      <title>Generating Kerr-anti-de Sitter thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work we study the construction of different thermodynamic descriptions for the Kerr-anti-de Sitter (KadS) black holes. The early versions of the KadS thermodynamics are briefly discussed, highlighting some of its strong points and shortcomings. Isohomogeneous transformations, a procedure for generating new thermodynamics, are presented and geometrically interpreted for KadS. This tool is used to determine possible KadS thermodynamics that can be constructed to satisfy a Smarr formula, and the validity of the first law in the generated thermodynamics. The connection between new thermodynamic theories and early Hawking's approach is considered. In this new framework, the usual KadS thermodynamics is complemented with its geometric construction, and Hawking's proposal, which does not satisfy the first law, is improved to an alternative thermodynamic theory. With the quantum statistical relation, Hawking's and this alternative KadS thermodynamics are also generalized from four to higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a simplified version of the standard model with a single quark doublet, I derive a transcendental equation for the complex Higgs boson mass. The equation involves a divergent integral which is regularized and renormalized conventionally. Setting the Higgs mass to its observed value, the decay width is narrow and within experimental limits. The mass equation has additional roots on other sheets in the complex energy plane. The first two are at 186 and 219 GeV. The lightest excitations are well defined though wider than the 125 GeV Higgs because decays to $W^{+}W^{-}$ and $ZZ$ are allowed.</description>

      <title>Coupling and Recoupling Coefficients for Wigner's U(4) Supermultiplet Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel procedure for evaluating Wigner coupling coefficients and Racah recoupling coefficients for U(4) in two group-subgroup chains is presented. The canonical U(4)-&gt;U(3)-&gt;U(2)-&gt;U(1) coupling and recoupling coefficients are applicable to any system that possesses U(4) symmetry, while the physical U(4)-&gt;SU_S(2)xSU_T(2) coupling coefficients are more specific to nuclear structure studies that utilize Wigner's Supermultiplet Symmetry concept. The procedure that is proposed sidesteps the use of binomial coefficients and alternating sum series, and consequently enables fast and accurate computation of any and all U(4)-underpinned features. The inner multiplicity of a (S,T) pair within a single U(4) irreducible representation is obtained from the dimension of the null space of the SU(2) raising generators; while the resolution for the outer multiplicity follows from the work of Alex et al. on U(N). It is anticipated that a C++ library will ultimately be available for determining generic coupling and recoupling coefficients associated with both the \textit{canonical} and the \textit{physical} group-subgroup chains of U(4).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the Casimir-Lifshitz effect associated with the electromagnetic field in the presence of a rectangular waveguide consisting of two distinct dielectric materials in a (3 + 1)-dimensional spacetime. We employ the surface mode technique to derive a generalized Lifshitz formula for this specific geometry. Our formulation accounts for the unique dielectric properties of the materials composing the waveguide, leading to a precise calculation of the Casimir-Lifshitz energy. In the asymptotic limit, our results recover the classical expressions for perfect reflecting boundaries. The behavior of the force on the rectangular cavity walls admit us to identify the system as a Casimir-Lifshitz anharmonic oscillator, that may vibrate due only the to vacuum stress if we allow two parallel non-fixed walls.</description>

      <title>Influence of magnetic field-induced anisotropic gluon pressure during pre-equilibrium in heavy-ion collisions: A faster road towards isotropization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields of a large intensity can be generated in peripheral high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Although their intensity drops fast and, moreover, it is not clear whether these fields last long enough to induce a magnetization during the quark-gluon plasma phase, most of the models and simulations predict a significant intensity that lasts up to proper times of order 1 fm after the beginning of the reaction, which is a typical time for the hydrodynamical phase to start. This interval of time is referred to as the pre-equilibrium stage. The evolution of the reaction during pre-equilibrium is thus likely to be influenced by these fields. In this work we adopt a strong field approximation to study the effects of the magnetic field-induced anisotropy on the gluon pressure. We include this anisotropy within the description obtained by means of Effective Kinetic Theory and explore the consequences to reach isotropization at proper times of order 1 fm. We show that when including the magnetic field effects, isotropization is achieved faster.</description>

      <title>The worldsheet skein D-module and basic curves on Lagrangian fillings of the Hopf link conormal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HOMFLYPT polynomials of knots in the 3-sphere in symmetric representations satisfy recursion relations. Their geometric origin is holomorphic curves at infinity on knot conormals that determine a $D$-module with characteristic variety the Legendrian knot conormal augmention variety and with the recursion relations as operator polynomial generators [arXiv:1304.5778, arXiv:1803.04011]. We consider skein lifts of recursions and $D$-modules corresponding to skein valued open curve counts [arXiv:1901.08027] that encode HOMFLYPT polynomials colored by arbitrary partitions. We define a worldsheet skein module which is the universal target for skein curve counts and a corresponding $D$-module.
  We then consider the concrete example of the Legendrian conormal of the Hopf link. We show that the worldsheet skein $D$-module for the Hopf link conormal is generated by three operator polynomials that annihilate the skein valued partition function for any choice of Lagrangian filling and recursively determine it uniquely. We find Lagrangian fillings for any point in the augmentation variety and show that their skein valued partition functions admit quiver-like expansions where all holomorphic curves are generated by a small number of basic holomorphic disks and annuli and their multiple covers.</description>

      <title>Bulk viscous cosmological model in $f(T,\mathcal{T})$ modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article explores the impact of bulk viscosity on understanding the universe's accelerated expansion within the context of modified $f(T,\mathcal{T})$ gravity, which is an extension of the $f(T)$ gravitational theory, allowing a broad coupling between the energy-momentum scalar $\mathcal{T}$ and the torsion scalar $T$. We consider two $f(T,\mathcal{T})$ functions, specifically $f(T,\mathcal{T})=\alpha T + \beta \mathcal{T}$ and $f(T,\mathcal{T})=\alpha \sqrt{-T} + \beta \mathcal{T}$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are arbitrary constants, along with the fluid part incorporating the coefficient of bulk viscosity $\zeta=\zeta_0 &gt; 0$. We calculate the analytical solutions of the corresponding field equations for a flat FLRW environment, and then we constrain the free parameters of the obtained solution using CC, Pantheon+, and the CC+Pantheon+ samples. We perform the Bayesian statistical analysis to estimate the posterior probability utilizing the likelihood function and the MCMC random sampling technique. Further, to assess the effectiveness of our MCMC analysis, we estimate the corresponding AIC and BIC values, and we find that there is strong evidence supporting the assumed viscous modified gravity models for all three data sets. Also, we find that the linear model precisely mimics the $\Lambda$CDM model. We also investigate the evolutionary behavior of some prominent cosmological parameters. We observe that the effective equation of state parameter for both models predict the accelerating behavior of the cosmic expansion phase. In addition, from the statefinder test, we find that the parameters of the considered MOG models favor the quintessence-type behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study closed string evolution in the pp-wave spacetime assuming different pulse shapes (square and sech-squared) in the exact gravitational wave metric. It is shown that the shape of a circular closed string changes permanently to an elliptical form after the pulse has departed. The worldsheet geometry also displays characteristic permanent changes caused by the gravitational wave pulse. The above effects collectively demonstrate features akin to what is known as `memory' in gravitational wave physics.</description>

      <title>Warm inflation in a Universe with a Weylian boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of boundary terms in the warm inflationary scenario, by considering that in the Einstein-Hilbert action the boundary can be described in terms of a Weyl-type geometry. The gravitational action, as well as the field equations, are thus extended to include new geometrical terms, coming from the non-metric nature of the boundary, and depending on the Weyl vector, and its covariant derivatives. We investigate the effects of these new boundary terms by considering the warm inflationary scenario of the early evolution of the Universe, in the presence of a scalar field. We obtain the generalized Friedmann equations in the Universe with a Weylian boundary by considering the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric. We consider the simultaneous decay of the scalar field, and of the creation of radiation, by appropriately splitting the general conservation equation through the introduction of the dissipation coefficient, which can depend on both the scalar field, and the Weyl vector. We consider three distinct warm inflationary models, in which the dissipation coefficients are chosen as different functions of the scalar field and of the Weyl vector. The numerical solutions of the cosmological evolution equations show that the radiation is created during the very early phases of expansion, and, after the radiation reaches its maximum value, the transition from an accelerating inflationary phase to a decelerating one takes place. Moreover, it turns out that the the Weyl vector, describing the boundary effects on the cosmological evolution, plays a significant role during the process of radiation creation.</description>

      <title>Role of Complexity on the Minimal Deformation of Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate spherically symmetric classes of anisotropic solutions within the realm of a schematic gravitational decoupling scheme, primarily decoupling through minimal geometric deformation, applied to non-rotating, ultra-compact, self-gravitational fluid distributions. In this respect, we employ the minimal complexity factor scheme to generate physically realistic models for anisotropic matter distributions, using a well-behaved model. The zero-complexity factor condition enables us to determine the deformation function for solving the decoupled system. We explore all the structure-defining scalar variables, such as density inhomogeneity, strong energy condition, density homogeneity, and the complexity factor (an alloy of density inhomogeneity and pressure anisotropy) for the decoupling constant ranging between $0$ and $1$. We observe that the anisotropy vanishes when the coupling constant is set to unity. This finding holds significance as it implies that, in the context of a zero-complexity factor approach, an anisotropic matter distribution becomes perfect without requiring any isotropy requirements. This work effectively explored the impact of complexity on the composition of self-gravitational stellar distributions. This effective approach enables the development of new, physically realistic isotropic stellar models for anisotropic matter distributions. Additionally, our findings indicate that the complexity factor in static, spherically symmetric self-gravitational objects can significantly affect the nature of the matter distribution within these systems. It is concluded that the minimally deformed Durgapal-IV model features an increasing pressure profile, and the local anisotropy of pressure vanishes throughout the model under complexity-free conditions.</description>

      <title>Nucleation of de Sitter from the anti de Sitter spacetime in scalar field models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, in the framework of Einstein-scalar gravity, the de Sitter (dS) spacetime can be nucleated out of the anti de Sitter (AdS) one. This is done by using a scalar lump solution, which has an $\text{AdS}_4$ spacetime in the core, allows for $\text{dS}_4$ vacua and was found to be plagued by tachyonic instabilities. Using the Euclidean action formalism, we compute and compare the probability amplitudes and the free energies of the lump and the $\text{dS}_4$ vacua. Our results show that the former is generally less favored than the latter, with the most preferred state being a $\text{dS}_4$ vacuum. The lump, thus, describes a metastable state which eventually decays into the true $\text{dS}_4$ vacuum. This nucleation mechanism of dS spacetime may provide insights into the short-distance behavior of gravity, in particular for the characterization of string-theory vacua, cosmological inflation and the black-hole singularity problem.</description>

Abstract: In the present paper, the dual symmetries of dense quark matter phase diagram found in some massless three- and two-color NJL models in the mean field approximation have been shown to exist at a more fundamental level as a dual transformations of fields and chemical potentials leaving the Lagrangian invariant. As a result, the corresponding dual symmetries of the full phase diagram can be shown without any approximation. And it has been shown not only in the NJL models, but also in framework of two- and three-color massless QCD itself. This is quite interesting, since one might say that it is not very common to show something completely non-perturbatively in QCD.</description>

      <title>From bordisms of three-manifolds to domain walls between topological orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a correspondence between spin three-manifolds and bosonic abelian topological orders. Let $N$ be a spin three-manifold. We can define a $(2+1)$-dimensional topological order $\mathrm{TO}_N$ as follows: its anyons are the torsion elements in $H_1(N)$, the braiding of anyons is given by the linking form, and their topological spins are given by the quadratic refinement of the linking form obtained from the spin structure. Under this correspondence, a surgery presentation of $N$ gives rise to a classical Chern--Simons description of the associated topological order $\mathrm{TO}_N$. We then extend the correspondence to spin bordisms between three-manifolds, and domain walls between topological orders. In particular, we construct a domain wall $\mathcal{D}_M$ between $\mathrm{TO}_N$ and $\mathrm{TO}_{N'}$, where $M$ is a spin bordism from $N$ to $N'$. This domain wall unfolds to a composition of a gapped boundary, obtained from anyon condensation, and a gapless Narain boundary CFT.</description>

While their low-energy properties are known to be universal and are described well by the Nambu--Got\=o action, a non-trivial dependence on the gauge group is encoded in a series of undetermined subleading corrections in an expansion around the limit of an arbitrarily long string. We quantify the first two of these corrections by means of high-precision Monte Carlo simulations of Polyakov-loop correlators in the lattice regularization. We compare the results of novel lattice simulations for theories with $N=3$ and $6$ color charges, and report an improved estimate for the $N=2$ case, discussing the approach to the large-$N$ limit. Our results are compatible with analytical bounds derived from the S-matrix bootstrap approach. In addition, we also present a new test of the Svetitsky--Yaffe conjecture for the $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ theory in three dimensions, finding that the lattice results for the Polyakov-loop correlation function are in excellent agreement with the predictions of the Svetitsky--Yaffe mapping, which are worked out quantitatively applying conformal perturbation theory to the three-state Potts model in two dimensions. The implications of these results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Unitary tetrahedron quantum gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of many-body systems using 2-qubit Yang-Baxter gates offer a benchmark for quantum hardware. This can be extended to the higher dimensional case with $n$-qubit generalisations of Yang-Baxter gates called $n$-simplex operators. Such multi-qubit gates potentially lead to shallower and more efficient quantum circuits as well. Finding them amounts to identifying unitary solutions of the $n$-simplex equations, the building blocks of higher dimensional integrable systems. These are a set of highly non-linear and over determined system of equations making it notoriously hard to solve even when the local Hilbert spaces are spanned by qubits. We systematically overcome this for higher simplex operators constructed using two methods: from Clifford algebras and by lifting Yang-Baxter operators. The $n=3$ or the tetrahedron case is analyzed in detail. For the qubit case our methods produce 13 inequivalent families of unitary tetrahedron operators. 12 of these families are obtained by appending the 5 unitary families of 4 by 4 constant Yang-Baxter operators of Dye-Hietarinta, with a single qubit operator. As applications, universal sets of single, two and three qubit gates are realized using such unitary tetrahedron operators. The ideas presented in this work can be naturally extended to the higher simplex cases.</description>

Abstract: Zel'dovich and Polnarev, in their seminal paper on the displacement memory effect [1], suggested that particles hit by a burst of gravitational waves generated by flyby would be merely displaced. Their prediction is confirmed numerically for the wave profile which is the derivative of a Gaussian proposed by Gibbons and Hawking [2]. The study is extended to higher-order derivative profiles as proposed e.g. for gravitational collapse, etc.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new lattice QCD calculation of the leading order hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment $a_\mu$. We reduce uncertainties compared to our earlier computation by $40\%$, arXiv:2002.12347. We perform simulations on finer lattices allowing for an even more accurate continuum extrapolation. We also include a small, long-distance contribution obtained using input from experiments in a low-energy regime where they all agree. Combined with other standard model contributions our result leads to a prediction that differs from the measurement of $a_\mu$ by only 0.9 standard deviations. This provides a remarkable validation of the standard model to 0.37ppm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a correspondence, for Riemannian manifolds with self-dual Weyl tensor, between twistor functions and solutions to the Teukolsky equations for any conformal and spin weights. In particular, we give a contour integral formula for solutions to the Teukolsky equations, and we find a recursion operator that generates an infinite family of solutions and leads to the construction of Cech representatives and sheaf cohomology classes on twistor space. Apart from the general conformally self-dual case, examples include self-dual black holes, scalar-flat K\"ahler surfaces, and quaternionic-K\"ahler metrics, where we map the Teukolsky equation to the conformal wave equation, establish new relations to the linearised Przanowski equation, and find new classes of quaternionic deformations.</description>

      <title>Corrected Thermodynamics and Stability of Magnetic charged AdS Black Holes surrounded by Quintessence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the corrected thermodynamics of non-linear magnetic charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes surrounded by quintessence, incorporating thermal fluctuations and deriving the corrected thermodynamic potentials. We analyze the effects of corrections due to thermal fluctuations on various thermodynamic potentials, including enthalpy, Helmholtz free energy, and Gibbs free energy. Our results show significant impacts on smaller black holes, with first-order corrections destabilizing them, while second-order corrections enhance stability with increasing parameter values. The specific heat analysis further elucidates the stability criteria, indicating that the large black holes ensure stability against phase transitions. However, the thermal fluctuations do not affect the physical limitation points as well as the second-order phase transition points of the black hole. Our findings highlight the intricate role of thermal fluctuations in black hole thermodynamics and their influence on stability, providing deeper insights into the behaviour of black holes under corrected thermodynamic conditions.</description>

      <title>Induction of non-Fermi liquids by critical cavity photons at the onset of superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid (NFL) at a putative quantum critical point signalling the onset of superradiance, in a set-up involving cavity quantum electrodynamics. Although the finiteness of the cavity, being bounded by reflecting mirrors, endows the cavity photons with an effective mass, they become massless at the continuous phase transition point. We consider the matter part coming from the fermions hopping on a honeycomb lattice near half-filling, featuring doped Dirac cones at two sets of inequivalent valleys. This choice is dictated by the presence of a fermion-boson interaction vertex which can give rise to Landau damping of the critical bosons, eventually leading to an NFL phase for the fermions. To set up the quantum effective action, we identify the hot spots of the generically anisotropic (trigonally-warped) Fermi surfaces, which are the set of points having parallel/antiparallel tangent vectors. The cavity photons act as charge density wave (CDW) order parameters, connecting pairs of hot spots belonging to the Fermi surface of a single valley. With these ingredients, we have set upon identifying NFL phases, using the tools of dimensional regularization and renormalization-group-flow equations. Our final results indicate that stable NFL phases exist in the low-energy limit.</description>

Abstract: We study entanglement negativity for evaporating black hole based on the holographic model with defect brane. We introduce a defect extremal surface formula for entanglement negativity. Based on partial reduction, we show the equivalence between defect extremal surface formula and island formula for entanglement negativity in AdS$_3$/BCFT$_2$. Extending the study to the model of eternal black hole plus CFT bath, we find that black hole-black hole negativity decreases until vanishing, left black hole-left radiation negativity is always a constant, radiation-radiation negativity increases and then saturates at a time later than Page time. In all the time dependent cases, defect extremal surface formula agrees with island formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study superradiant scattering for a charged scalar field subject to Robin (mixed) boundary conditions on a charged BTZ black hole background. Scalar field modes having a real frequency do not exhibit superradiant scattering, independent of the boundary conditions applied. For scalar field modes with a complex frequency, no superradiant scattering occurs if the black hole is static. After exploring some regions of the parameter space, we provide evidence for the existence of superradiantly scattered modes with complex frequencies for a charged and rotating BTZ black hole. Most of the superradiantly scattered modes we find satisfy Robin (mixed) boundary conditions, but there are also superradiantly scattered modes with complex frequencies satisfying Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. We explore the effect of the black hole and scalar field charge on the outgoing energy flux of these superradiantly scattered modes, and also investigate their stability.</description>

Abstract: Hamiltonian theory for collective longitudinally polarized gluon excitations (plasmons) interacting with classical high-energy test color-charged particle propagating through a high-temperature gluon plasma is developed. A generalization of the Lie-Poisson bracket to the case of a continuous medium involving bosonic normal field variable $a^{\hspace{0.03cm}a}_{{\bf k}}$ and a non-Abelian color charge $Q^{\hspace{0.03cm}a}$ is performed and the corresponding Hamilton equations are presented. The canonical transformations including simultaneously both bosonic degrees of freedom of the soft collective excitations and degree of freedom of hard test particle connecting with its color charge in the hot gluon plasma are written out. A complete system of the canonicity conditions for these transformations is derived. The notion of the plasmon number density ${\mathcal N}^{\hspace{0.03cm}aa^{\prime}_{\phantom{1}}\!}_{{\bf k}}$, which is a nontrivial matrix in the color space, is introduced. An explicit form of the effective fourth-order Hamiltonian describing the elastic scattering of a plasmon off a hard color particle is found and the self-consistent system of Boltzmann-type kinetic equations taking into account the time evolution of the mean value of the color charge of the hard particle is obtained. On the basis of these equations, a model problem of the interaction of two infinitely narrow wave packets is considered. A system of nonlinear first-order ordinary differential equations defining the dynamics of the interaction of the colorless $N^{\hspace{0.01cm}l}_{\bf k}$ and color $W^{\hspace{0.01cm}l}_{\bf k}$ components of the plasmon number density is derived. The problem of determining the third- and fourth-order coefficient functions entering into the canonical transformations of the original bosonic variable $a^{\hspace{0.03cm}a}_{{\bf k}}$ and color charge $Q^{a}$ is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of hydrodynamic theories for superfluids with dipole symmetry. Taking diffusion as an example, we systematically construct a hydrodynamic framework that incorporates an intrinsic dipole degree of freedom in analogy to spin density in micropolar (spinful) fluids. Subsequently, we study a dipole condensed phase and propose a model that captures the spontaneous breaking of the $U(1)$ charge. The theory explains the role of the inverse Higgs constraint for this class of theories, and naturally generates the gapless field. Next, we introduce finite temperature theory using the Hamiltonian formalism and study the hydrodynamics of ideal fracton superfluids. Finally, we postulate a derivative counting scheme and incorporate dissipative effects using the method of irreversible thermodynamics. We verify the consistency of the dispersion relations and argue that our counting is systematic.</description>

Abstract: We construct a gauge theory model on the 4-dimensional $\rho$-Minkowski space-time, a particular deformation of the Minkowski space-time recently considered. The corresponding star product results from a combination of Weyl quantization map and properties of the convolution algebra of the special Euclidean group. We use noncommutative differential calculi based on twisted derivations together with a twisted notion of noncommutative connection. The twisted derivations pertain to the Hopf algebra of $\rho$-deformed translations, a Hopf subalgebra of the $\rho$-deformed Poincar\'e algebra which can be viewed as defining the quantum symmetries of the $\rho$-Minkowski space-time. The gauge theory model is left invariant under the action of the $\rho$-deformed Poincar\'e algebra. The kinetic part of the action is found to coincide with the one of the usual (commutative) electrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find out the complex geometries corresponding to the semi-classical saddles of threedimensional quantum gravity by making use of the known results of dual conformal field theory (CFT), which is effectively given by Liouville field theory. We examine both the cases with positive and negative cosmological constants. We determine the set of semi-classical saddles to choose from the homotopy argument in the Chern-Simons formulation combined with CFT results and provide strong supports from the mini-superspace approach to the quantum gravity. For the case of positive cosmological constant, partial results were already obtained in our previous works, and they are consistent with the current ones. For the case of negative cosmological constant, we identify the geometry corresponding a semi-classical saddle with three-dimensional Euclidean anti-de Sitter space dressed with imaginary radius three-dimensional spheres. The geometry is generically unphysical, but we argue that the fact itself does not lead to any problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02283v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work and in the companion paper arXiv:2403.02301, we initiate an approach to holography based on the AKSZ formalism. As the first step, we refine Vasiliev's holography proposal in arXiv:1203.5554 by obtaining 4D higher-spin gravity (HSG) and 3D coloured conformal higher-spin gravity (CCHSG) -- i.e., coloured conformal matter fields coupled to conformal higher-spin gauge fields and colour gauge fields -- as two distinct and classically consistent reductions of a single parent theory. The latter consists, on-shell, of a flat superconnection valued in a fractional-spin extension of Vasiliev's higher-spin algebra. The HSG and CCHSG reductions are characterized by dual structure groups and two-form cohomology elements, and their embedding in a common parent model provides a rationale for deriving holographic relations from multi-dimensional AKSZ partition functions on cylinders with dual boundary conditions, to appear separately. In this work we i) construct the underlying non-commutative geometry as a metaplectic operator algebra represented in a Hermitian module of a pair of conformal particles; ii) identify a discrete modular group, arising from twisted boundary conditions of the first-quantized system, and connecting different boundary conditions of the second-quantized system; and iii) identify the holonomies, structure groups and two-form cohomology elements that characterize the HSG and CCHSG reductions, and equate the dual second Chern classes.</description>

Abstract: This paper completes the analysis initiated in the companion work arXiv:2403.02283 -- referred to as Paper I -- by showing how Vasiliev's 4D higher-spin gravity (HSG) and 3D coloured conformal matter fields coupled to conformal higher-spin gauge fields and colour gauge fields (coloured conformal HSG, or CCHSG) emerge as consistent reductions of a common parent model. The latter is a Frobenius-Chern-Simons model with superconnection valued in a fractional-spin extension of Vasiliev's higher-spin algebra, and was defined and studied in Paper I. Here, we i) realize HSG as a subcase of a more general 4D reduction, describing HSG coupled to coloured, fractional-spin matter, which we refer to as 4D fractional-spin gravity; ii) study the CCHSG model, in particular exhibiting the crucial role played by novel colour gauge fields in coupling conformal matter to conformal HSG, thereby completing the models due to Vasiliev and Nilsson; iii) extract conformal currents and composite coloured sources in an expansion of the CCHSG model around 3D Minkowskian leaves; and iv) compare our results with Vasiliev's holography proposal of arXiv:1203.5554. The common origin of HSG and CCHSG, besides relating the two models directly, is the starting point for establishing the holographic correspondence between the two models via overlap conditions, to be presented separately.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we extend the surface growth scheme in AdS spacetime with a boundary in the AdS/BCFT correspondence. We show that the entanglement wedge with a boundary can be constructed from the direct growth of bulk extremal surfaces layer by layer. In addition, we find that the surface growth configuration in BCFT can be connected with the defect multi scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) tensor network. Furthermore, we also investigate the entanglement of purification within the surface growth process, which reveals more refined structure of entanglement entropy and indicates a selection rule for surface growth in the bulk reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Discrete Gauge Anomalies and Instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit anomalous phases related to large gauge transformations, such as the Witten anomaly. The latter, known to plague $d=4$ $Sp(k)$ theories, is well-understood in terms of $\pi_4(Sp(k))=\mathbb{Z}_2$, but it also has an oblique relation to the instantons, labeled by $\pi_3(G)=\mathbb{Z}$, via the fermion zero mode counting. We revisit this relation and point out how $SU(N)$ theories escape an anomalous sign of the latter type, only thanks to the perturbative anomaly cancelation condition that restricts the chiral fermion spectrum. This leads to the question of what happens if the latter, more mundane anomaly is canceled by an inflow instead. After raising an open question about fractional D3 probe theories, we explore the simplest bottom-up model of such a kind, due to Witten and Yonekura, from which we find the relevant chiral theories to be free of such a disease despite the unrestricted chiral spectra. We close with a simple but often-overlooked observation about how fermionic zero modes enter physics differently between Euclidean and Lorentzian descriptions and point out a related issue in $d=3$.</description>

      <title>To curve, or not to curve: Is curvature-assisted quintessence observationally viable?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-field models of accelerated expansion with nearly flat potentials, despite being able to provide observationally viable explanations for the early-time cosmic inflation and the late-time cosmic acceleration, are in strong tension with string theory evidence and the associated de Sitter swampland constraints. It has recently been argued that in an open universe, where the spatial curvature is negative (i.e., with $\Omega_k&gt;0$), a new stable fixed point arises, which may lead to viable single-field-based accelerated expansion with an arbitrarily steep potential. Here we show, through a dynamical systems analysis and a Bayesian statistical inference of cosmological parameters, that the additional cosmological solutions based on the new fixed point do not render steep-potential, single-field, accelerated expansion observationally viable. We mainly focus on quintessence models of dark energy, but we also argue that a similar conclusion can be drawn for cosmic inflation.</description>

Abstract: A recent numerical evaluation of the spherical universal log coefficient in the Maxwell free--energy and its decomposition into bulk and edge contributions via a bounded hyperbolic geometry mode calculation is shown to be equivalent to an existing compact formulation for $p$--forms, at $p=1$, on a conically deformed sphere. The edge mode seems to be a ghost (p-1)-form. Some numbers are given. Conformally covariant, higher derivative propagation is treated and a dynamical origin for the bulk contribution is suggested, The degrees of freedom of the Kalb--Ramond field are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>3d Gravity as a random ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give further evidence that the matrix-tensor model studied in \cite{belin2023} is dual to AdS$_{3}$ gravity including the sum over topologies. This provides a 3D version of the duality between JT gravity and an ensemble of random Hamiltonians, in which the matrix and tensor provide random CFT$_2$ data subject to a potential that incorporates the bootstrap constraints. We show how the Feynman rules of the ensemble produce a sum over all three-manifolds and how surgery is implemented by the matrix integral. The partition functions of the resulting 3d gravity theory agree with Virasoro TQFT (VTQFT) on a fixed, hyperbolic manifold. However, on non-hyperbolic geometries, our 3d gravity theory differs from VTQFT, leading to a difference in the eigenvalue statistics of the associated ensemble. As explained in \cite{belin2023}, the Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equations of the matrix-tensor integral play a crucial role in understanding how gravity emerges in the limit that the ensemble localizes to exact CFT's. We show how the SD equations can be translated into a combinatorial problem about three-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Light transformation: A Celestial and Carrollian perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we first study the consequence of spacetime translations and Lorentz transformations on Celestial CFT OPEs. Working with the light transforms of the operators belonging to the modified Mellin basis, we found that the leading order singularity in the OPE of such operators could be fixed purely using Poincar\'e symmetries owing to the non-trivial action of the translations on these operators. The OPE coefficient is then fixed using the soft limit of the correlation functions. We check that this singular structure obtained from symmetries is consistent with the OPE limit of three-point functions. This approach could potentially be useful for studying Celestial CFT without adverting to bulk physics. As another goal, we explore the significance of light transformation in Carrollian CFTs. In the special cases we considered, we show that light transformation equips us with a map between two branches of Carroll CFT in $d=3$ dimension at the level of correlation functions in the near coincident limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We quantise from first principles field theories living on the background of a bubble wall in the planar limit with particular focus on the case of spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry. Using these tools, we compute the average momentum transfer from transition radiation: the soft emission of radiation by an energetic particle passing across the wall, with a particular focus on the longitudinal polarisation of vectors. We find these to be comparable to transverse polarisations in symmetry-breaking transitions with mild super-cooling, and dominant in broken to broken transitions with thin wall. Our results have phenomenological applications for the expansion of bubbles during first order phase transitions. Our general framework allows for the robust calculation of any particle processes of interest in such translation breaking backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Resummation schemes for high-electric-charge objects leading to improved experimental mass limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17452v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-Electric-Charge compact Objects (HECOs) appear in several theoretical particle physics models beyond the Standard Model, and are actively searched for in current colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. In such searches, mass bounds of these objects have been placed, using Drell-Yan and photon-fusion processes at tree level so far. However, such mass-bound estimates are not reliable, given that, as a result of the large values of the electric charge of the HECO, perturbative Quantum Electrodynamics calculations break down. In this work, we perform a Dyson-Schwinger resummation scheme (as opposed to lattice strong-coupling approach), which makes the computation of the pertinent HECO-production cross sections reliable, thus allowing us to extract improved mass bounds for such objects from ATLAS and MoEDAL searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the present state and planned updates of CosmoLattice, a cutting-edge code for lattice simulations of non-linear dynamics of scalar-gauge field theories in an expanding background. We first review current capabilities of the code, including the simulation of interacting singlet scalars and of Abelian and non-Abelian scalar-gauge theories. We also comment on new features recently implemented, such as the simulation of gravitational waves from scalar and gauge fields. Secondly, we discuss new extensions of CosmoLattice that we plan to release publicly. On the one hand, we comment on new physics modules, which include axion-gauge interactions $\phi F \widetilde{F}$, non-minimal gravitational couplings $\phi^2 R$, creation and evolution of cosmic defect networks, and magneto-hydro-dynamics (MHD). On the other hand, we discuss new technical features, including evolvers for non-canonical interactions, arbitrary initial conditions, simulations in 2+1 dimensions, and higher accuracy spatial derivatives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we fix the complex structure and explore the moduli space of the heterotic system by considering two different yet "dual" deformation paths starting from a K\"ahler solution. They correspond to deformation along the Bott-Chern cohomology class and the Aeppli cohomology class respectively. Using the implicit function theorem, we prove the local existence of heterotic solutions along these two paths and hence establish an initial step to construct local moduli coordinates around a K\"ahler solution.</description>

      <title>Disorder-free Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models: Integrability and a precursor of chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13154v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce two disorder-free variants of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, demonstrate their integrability, and study their static and dynamical properties. Unlike diagrammatic techniques, the integrability of these models allows us to obtain dynamical correlation functions even when the number of Majorana fermions is finite. From the solutions, we find that out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in these models exhibit exponential growth at early times, resembling that of quantum chaotic systems such as those with disorder or external kick terms. Conversely, our analysis shows no evidence of random-matrix behavior in level statistics or the spectral form factor. Our findings illustrate that the clean versions of the SYK models represent simple but nontrivial examples of disorder-free quantum many-body systems displaying chaos-like behavior of OTOCs.</description>

      <title>Stable non-Fermi liquid fixed point at the onset of incommensurate $2k_F$ charge density wave order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02322v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid fixed point in a two-dimensional metal, at the onset of a quantum phase transition from a Fermi liquid state to an incommensurate charge density wave (CDW) ordered phase. The momentum of the CDW boson is centred at the wavevector $ \boldsymbol{ \mathcal Q} $, which connects a single pair of antipodal points on the Fermi surface with antiparallel tangent vectors. We employ the dimensional regularization technique in which the co-dimension of the Fermi surface is extended to a generic value, while keeping the dimension of the Fermi surface itself fixed at one. Although the system is strongly coupled at dimension $d=2$, the interactions become marginal at the upper critical dimension $d=d_c$, whose value is found to be $ 5/2$. Using a controlled perturbative expansion in the parameter $\epsilon = d_c - d $, we compute the critical exponents of the stable infrared fixed point characterizing the quantum critical point. The scalings of the original theory are determined by setting $\epsilon =1/2$, where the fermion self-energy is seen to scale with the frequency with a fractional power law of $2/3$, which is the telltale signature of a typical non-Fermi liquid phase.</description>

      <title>Impact of The Newly Revised Gravitational Redshift of X-ray Burster GS 1826-24 on The Equation of State of Supradense Neutron-Rich Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thanks to the recent advancement in producing rare isotopes and measuring their masses with unprecedented precision, the updated nuclear masses around the waiting-point nucleus $^{64}$Ge in the rapid-proton capture process have led to a significant revision of the surface gravitational redshift of the neutron star (NS) in GS 1826-24 by re-fitting its X-ray burst light curve ({\it X. Zhou et al., Nature Physics {\bf 19}, 1091 (2023)}) using Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). The resulting NS compactness $\xi$ is between 0.244 and 0.342 at 95\% confidence level and its upper boundary is significantly smaller than the maximum $\xi$ previously known. Incorporating this new data within a comprehensive Bayesian statistical framework, we investigate its impact on the Equation of State (EOS) of supradense neutron-rich matter and the required spin frequency for GW190814's minor $m_2$ with mass $2.59\pm 0.05$M$_{\odot}$ to be a rotationally stable pulsar. We found that the EOS of high-density symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) has to be softened significantly while the symmetry energy at supersaturation densities stiffened compared to our prior knowledge from earlier analyses using data from both astrophysical observations and terrestrial nuclear experiments. In particular, the skewness $J_0$ characterizing the stiffness of high-density SNM decreases significantly, while the slope $L$, curvature $K_{\rm{sym}}$, and skewness $J_{\rm{sym}}$ of nuclear symmetry energy all increase appreciably compared to their fiducial values. We also found that the most probable spin rate for the $m_2$ to be a stable pulsar is very close to its mass-shedding limit once the revised redshift data from GS 1826-24 is considered, making the $m_2$ unlikely the most massive NS observed so far.</description>

      <title>Graviton mass due to dark energy as a superconducting medium: theoretical and phenomenological aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the cosmological constant term in the Einstein field equations can be interpreted as a stress tensor for dark energy. This stress tensor is formally analogous to an elastic constitutive equation in continuum mechanics. As a result, the cosmological constant leads to a "shear modulus" and "bulk modulus" affecting all gravitational fields in the universe. The form of the constitutive equation is also analogous to the London constitutive equation for a superconductor. Treating dark energy as a type of superconducting medium for gravitational waves leads to a Yukawa-like gravitational potential and a massive graviton within standard General Relativity. We discuss a number of resulting phenomenological aspects such as a screening length scale that can also be used to describe the effects generally attributed to dark matter. In addition, we find a gravitational wave plasma frequency, index of refraction, and impedance. The expansion of the universe is interpreted as a Meissner-like effect as dark energy causes an outward "expulsion" of space-time similar to a superconductor expelling a magnetic field. The fundamental cause of these effects is interpreted as a type of spontaneous symmetry breaking of a scalar field. There is an associated chemical potential, critical temperature, and an Unruh-Hawking effect associated with the formulation.</description>

Abstract: We present a detailed description of a quantum scalar field theory within a flat spacetime confined to a cavity with perfectly reflecting moving boundaries. Moreover, we establish an equivalence between this time-dependent setting and a field theory on an acoustic metric with static Dirichlet boundary conditions. We discuss the classical and quantum aspects of the theory from the latter perspective, accompanied by the introduction of novel numerical techniques designed for the (nonperturbative) computation of particle production attributed to the Dynamical Casimir effect, applicable to arbitrary boundary trajectories. As an illustrative example of these methodologies, we compute the particle production for a massless field in 1+1 dimensions. Notably, our approaches readily extend to encompass scenarios involving massive fields and higher dimensions</description>

      <title>Measurable Krylov Spaces and Eigenenergy Count in Quantum State Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a quantum-mechanically measurable basis for the computation of spread complexity. Current literature focuses on computing different powers of the Hamiltonian to construct a basis for the Krylov state space and the computation of the spread complexity. We show, through a series of proofs, that time-evolved states with different evolution times can be used to construct an equivalent space to the Krylov state space used in the computation of the spread complexity. Afterwards, we introduce the effective dimension, which is upper-bounded by the number of pairwise distinct eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian. The computation of the spread complexity requires knowledge of the Hamiltonian and a classical computation of the different powers of the Hamiltonian. The computation of large powers of the Hamiltonian becomes increasingly difficult for large systems. The first part of our work addresses these issues by defining an equivalent space, where the original basis consists of quantum-mechanically measurable states. We demonstrate that a set of different time-evolved states can be used to construct a basis. We subsequently verify the results through numerical analysis, demonstrating that every time-evolved state can be reconstructed using the defined vector space. Based on this new space, we define an upper-bounded effective dimension and analyze its influence on finite-dimensional systems. We further show that the Krylov space dimension is equal to the number of pairwise distinct eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian, enabling a method to determine the number of eigenenergies the system has experimentally. Lastly, we compute the spread complexities of both basis representations and observe almost identical behavior, thus enabling the computation of spread complexities through measurements.</description>

      <title>Violation of Hod's Conjecture and Probing it with Optical properties of a 5-D black hole in Einstein Gauss-Bonnet Bumblebee theory of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, the quasinormal modes of a $5$-D black hole in Einstein Gauss-Bonnet Bumblebee theory of gravity have been investigated with the help of the Pad\'e averaged higher order WKB approximation method and the validity of Hod's conjecture has been studied. It is found that the presence of Lorentz symmetry breaking due to the Bumblebee field favours Hod's conjecture. But in the case of the Gauss-Bonnet term, an increase in the coupling parameter increases the chances of violation of Hod's conjecture. We further investigated the optical properties of the black hole {\it viz.}, shadow and emission rate. It is found that a black hole with a lower lifetime favours Hod's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Modified gravity/entropic gravity correspondence due to graviton mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05269v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some time ago, it has been suggested that gravitons can acquire mass in the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking of diffeomorphisms through the condensation of scalar fields [Chamseddine and Mukhanov, JHEP, 2010]. Taking this possibility into account, in the present paper, first we show how the graviton mass intricately reshapes the gravitational potential akin to a Yukawa-like potential at large distances. Notably, this long-range force modifies the Newton's law in large distances and might explain the phenomena of dark matter. The most important finding in the present paper is the derivation of a modified Newtons law of gravity by modifying the Verlindes entropic force relation due to the graviton contribution. The graviton contribution to the entropy basically measures the correlation of graviton and matter fields which then reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy at the horizon. This result shows the dual description of gravity: in the language of quantum information and entropy the gravity can be viewed as an entropic force, however in terms of particles and fields, it can be viewed as a longe range force. Further we have recovered the corrected Einstein field equations as well as the $\Lambda$CDM where dark matter emerges as an apparent effect.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phases and Transitions in Spin Chains with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized symmetries often appear in the form of emergent symmetries in low energy effective descriptions of quantum many-body systems. Non-invertible symmetries are a particularly exotic class of generalized symmetries, in that they are implemented by transformations that do not form a group. Such symmetries appear generically in gapless states of quantum matter, constraining the low-energy dynamics. To provide a UV-complete description of such symmetries, it is useful to construct lattice models that respect these symmetries exactly. In this paper, we discuss two families of one-dimensional lattice Hamiltonians with finite on-site Hilbert spaces: one with (invertible) $S^{\,}_3$ symmetry and the other with non-invertible $\mathsf{Rep}(S^{\,}_3)$ symmetry. Our models are largely analytically tractable and demonstrate all possible spontaneous symmetry breaking patterns of these symmetries. Moreover, we use numerical techniques to study the nature of continuous phase transitions between the different symmetry-breaking gapped phases associated with both symmetries. Both models have self-dual lines, where the models are enriched by so-called intrinsically non-invertible symmetries generated by Kramers-Wannier-like duality transformations. We provide explicit lattice operators that generate these non-invertible self-duality symmetries. We show that the enhanced symmetry at the self-dual lines is described by a 2+1D symmetry-topological-order (SymTO) of type $\mathrm{JK}^{\,}_4\boxtimes \overline{\mathrm{JK}}^{\,}_4$. The condensable algebras of the SymTO determine the allowed gapped and gapless states of the self-dual $S^{\,}_3$-symmetric and $\mathsf{Rep}(S^{\,}_3)$-symmetric models.</description>

      <title>Growth of cosmic perturbations in the modified $f(R,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the generalized $f(R,T)$ modified theory of gravity, where the gravitational Lagrangian is a function of Ricci scalar $R$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$. We derive modified field equations to the linear order of perturbations in the context of $f(R,T)$ model. We then investigate the growth of perturbations in the context of $f(R,T)$ modified gravity. Primary numerical investigations based on matter power spectra diagrams indicates a structure growth suppression in $f(R,T)$ gravity, which exhibits consistency with local measurements. Also, we notice that matter-geometry interaction in $f(R,T)$ model would results in the specific feature named as "matter acoustic oscillations" appeared in matter power spectra diagrams. Moreover, we put constraints on the cosmological parameters of $f(R,T)$ model, utilizing current observations, chiefly cosmic microwave background, weak lensing, supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and redshift-space distortions data. Numerical results based on MCMC calculations imply that $f(R,T)$ is a qualified theory of modified gravity in reconciling Planck CMB data with local probes of large scale structures, by reporting lower values for the structure growth parameter $\sigma_8$ compared to the standard model of cosmology.</description>

      <title>A quantum Monte Carlo algorithm to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy and its derivative in high precision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) scheme able to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy (EE) and its derivative with high precision and low technical barrier. It opens a way to numerically detect the novel phases and phase transitions by scanning EE in a wide parameter-region in two and higher dimensional systems. In other words, in the same order of computational time, the previous methods could only get one EE data point, but we can obtain thousands (even more) of times EE data points along a physical parameter path. We then show the feasibility of using EE and its derivative to find phase transition points and to probe novel phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent development of the Field Correlator Method (FCM) is discussed, with applications to the most interesting areas of QCD physics obtained in the lattice data and experiment. These areas include: a) the connection of colorelectric confinement with the basic quark and gluon condensates; b) the explicit form of the colorelectric deconfinement at a growing temperature $T$; c) the theory of the colormagnetic confinement at all temperatures; d) the theory of strong decays, the theory of pdf and jets in the instantaneous formalism with confinement. We demonstrate that the FCM with instantaneous formalism and confinement (instead of the light cone formalism and pure perturbation theory) can provide the way to the theory of QCD, which helps to describe world data without phenomenological parameters.</description>

      <title>Generalized Entropy Implies Varying-G: Horizon Area Dependent Field Equations and Black Hole-Cosmology Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is modified, ambiguity often arises concerning whether the Hawking temperature or the thermodynamic mass should be modified. The common practice, however, is to keep the black hole solution the same as that in general relativity. On the other hand, if Jacobson's method of deriving Einstein equations from thermodynamic is valid in the general settings, then given a generalized entropy one should first derive the corresponding modified gravity, and then look for the compatible black hole solution before investigating its thermodynamics. We comment on some properties and subtleties in this approach. In particular, we point out that generically generalized entropy would lead to a varying effective gravitational "constant" theory, where $G_\text{eff}$ depends on the horizon area. We discuss in what ways such theories are discernible from general relativity despite its seemingly jarring differences, and how to make sense of area-dependent field equations. As a consequence we show that in the Jacobson's approach, the standard quantum gravitational logarithmic correction to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is equivalent to a running gravitational "constant". A horizon area dependent $G_\text{eff}$ could also lead to a coupling between black hole masses and cosmological expansion, a scenario that has been studied recently in the literature, but so far lacks strong theoretical motivation. In the Tsallis case, we show that the thermodynamic mass for a Schwarzschild black hole is just a constant multiple of its ADM mass, which is considerably simpler than the approach not utilizing the Jacobson's method.</description>

      <title>Teukolsky equation for near-extremal black holes beyond general relativity: near-horizon analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study gravitational perturbations on the near-horizon region of extremal and near-extremal rotating black holes in a general higher-derivative extension of Einstein gravity. We find a decoupled modified Teukolsky equation that rules the gravitational perturbations and that separates into an angular and a radial equation. The angular equation leads to a deformation of the spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics, while the radial equation takes the same form as in Kerr except for a modification of the angular separation constants. We provide a detailed analysis of the corrections to these angular separation constants and find analytic results for axisymmetric modes as well as in the eikonal limit. As an application, we reproduce recent results that show that extremal Kerr black holes in higher-derivative gravity become singular under certain deformations and extend them by including parity-breaking corrections, which we show lead to the same effect. Finally, we obtain constraints on the form of the full modified Teukolsky radial equation by demanding that it has the right near-horizon limit. These results serve as an stepping stone towards the study of quasinormal modes of near-extremal black holes in higher-derivative extensions of GR.</description>

      <title>Higher-Dimensional MOG dark compact object: shadow behavior in the light of EHT observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06393v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consideration of extra spatial dimensions is motivated by the unification of gravity with other interactions, the achievement of the ultimate framework of quantum gravity, and fundamental problems in particle physics and cosmology. Much attention has been focused on the effect of these extra dimensions on the modified theories of gravity. Analytically examining astrophysical phenomena like black hole shadows is one approach to understand how extra dimensions would affect the modified gravitational theories. The purpose of this study is to derive a higher dimensional metric for a dark compact object in STVG theory and then examine the behavior of the shadow shapes for this solution in STVG theory in higher dimensions. We apply the Carter method to formulate the geodesic equations and the Hamilton Jacobi method to find photon orbits around this higher dimensional MOG dark compact object. We investigate the effects of extra dimensions and the STVG parameter alpha on the black hole shadow size. Next, we compare the shadow radius of this higher dimensional MOG dark compact object to the shadow size of the supermassive black hole M87, which has been realized by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaborations, in order to restrict these parameters. We find that extra dimensions in the STVG theory typically lead to a reduction in the shadow size of the higher dimensional MOG dark compact object, whereas the effect of parameter alpha on this black hole shadow is suppressible. Remarkably, given the constraints from EHT observations, we find that the shadow size of the four dimensional MOG dark compact object lies in the confidence levels of the EHT data. Finally, we investigate the issue of acceleration bounds in higher dimensional MOG dark compact object in confrontation with EHT data of M87.</description>

      <title>Shadow of slowly rotating Kalb-Ramond black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real astronomical objects possess spin, yet deriving exact solutions for rotating black holes within gravitational theories is a formidable challenge. To understand the shadow of rotating black holes in Lorentz-violating spacetimes induced by antisymmetric tensor fields, known as Kalb-Ramond (KR) fields, we have focused on the slow-rotation approximation framework. Using this approach, we have obtained first-order rotation series solutions, which describe slowly rotating KR black holes. For this solutions, we have plotted the black hole shadow contours under various parameters using the numerical backward ray-tracing method. As the Lorentz-violating parameter increases, not only the apparent size of the black hole shadow decreases, but also the effects of rotation, such as the D-shaped structure and frame-dragging, are amplified. Furthermore, the KR field also enhances gravitational lensing, causing the shadow to occupy a larger area within the photon ring. This distinctive feature can differentiate KR gravity from general relativity. Additionally, using the latest observational data from EHT on M87* and Sgr A*, we have provided constraints on the Lorentz-violating parameter of rotating KR black holes. We found that, compared to static black holes, rotating black holes allow for the presence of stronger Lorentz violation effects.</description>

      <title>Notes on A-infinity algebras, A-infinity categories and non-commutative geometry. I</title>

      <description>arXiv:math/0606241v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop geometric approach to A-infinity algebras and A-infinity categories based on the notion of formal scheme in the category of graded vector spaces. Geometric approach clarifies several questions, e.g. the notion of homological unit or A-infinity structure on A-infinity functors. We discuss Hochschild complexes of A-infinity algebras from geometric point of view. The paper contains homological versions of the notions of properness and smoothness of projective varieties as well as the non-commutative version of Hodge-to-de Rham degeneration conjecture. We also discuss a generalization of Deligne's conjecture which includes both Hochschild chains and cochains. We conclude the paper with the description of an action of the PROP of singular chains of the topological PROP of 2-dimensional surfaces on the Hochschild chain complex of an A-infinity algebra with the scalar product. This action is essentially equivalent to the structure of 2-dimensional Topological Field Theory associated with a Calabi-Yau category.</description>
