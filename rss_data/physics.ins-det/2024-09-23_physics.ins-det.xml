      <title>Ortho-positronium Lifetime For Soft-tissue Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this work is to showcase the ortho-positronium lifetime as a probe for soft-tissue characterization. We employed positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy to experimentally measure the three components of the positron annihilation lifetime para-positronium (p-Ps), positron, and ortho-positronium (o-Ps) for three types of porcine, non-fixated soft tissues ex vivo: adipose, hepatic, and muscle.Then, we benchmarked our measurements with X-ray phase-contrast imaging, which is the current state-of-the-art for soft-tissue analysis. We found that the o-Ps lifetime in adipose tissues (2.54+/-0.12) ns was approximately 20\% longer than in hepatic (2.04+/-0.09 ns) and muscle (2.03+/-0.12 ns) tissues .In addition, the separation between the measurements for adipose tissue and the other tissues was better from o-Ps lifetime measurement than from X-ray phase-contrast imaging. This experimental study proved that the o-Ps lifetime is a viable non-invasive probe for characterizing and classifying the different soft tissues. Specifically, o-Ps lifetime as a soft-tissue characterization probe had a strong sensitivity to the lipid content that can be potentially implemented in commercial positron emission tomography scanners that feature list-mode data acquisition.</description>

      <title>A Ray Tracing Survey of Asymmetric Operation of the X-ray Rowland Circle Using Spherically Bent Crystal Analyzers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spherically bent crystal analyzer (SBCA) is a widely-adopted hard x-ray optic, renowned for its good energy resolution and large collection solid angle. It is frequently employed in synchrotron-based techniques like Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) and X-ray Emission Spectroscopy, as well as in the rebirth of laboratory-based X-ray Absorption Fine Strucure (XAFS) and XES, and its predominant use has been in 'symmetric' operation on the Rowland circle. The recent study of Gironda et al. (J. Anal. At. Spectrom., 2024, 39, 1375) emphasizes the benefits of 'asymmetric' SBCA operation, demonstrating the use of multiple crystal reflections from a single SBCA to broaden its accessible energy range. Furthermore, Gironda et al. demonstrate that asymmetric operation frequently mitigates energy broadening intrinsic to Johann optics and propose that under a specific Rowland circle configuration, designated here the Johann Normal Alignment (JNA), such broadening is eradicated altogether. We report extensive ray tracing simulations to scrutinize the impact of asymmetric configurations on energy broadening and detector plane defocusing. We find that the performance of asymmetric SBCA operation generally exceeds its symmetric counterpart in energy resolution when no analyzer masking is used and, with strategic detector placement, the decrease in detection efficiency due to defocusing can be minimized. Spectroscopic imaging is adversely affected by the detector plane blurring, but rejection of scattering from special environment windows in x-ray Raman imaging is still feasible. These results help inform future, more common implementation of asymmetric reflections with SBCA.</description>

      <title>Redesign of the AD820 Single-Channel Circuit for the Development of the aRD820 Low-Noise Rail-to-Rail Operational Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of this work was to design and later produce a low-power (single supply 5 - 30 V, dual supply +-2.5 V and +-15 V) rail-to-rail operational amplifier aRD820 with low voltage noise (&lt;4 uV, p-p. 0.1 to 10 Hz), ultralow input bias current (&lt; 15 pA), and low offset voltage (&lt; 500 uV) characteristics. Similar characteristics are presented by Analog Devices chip AD820. Thus, the task of the design team was to adapt the prototype circuity of AD820 to our technological capabilities, modify the circuit, if necessary, to eliminate any deficiency of the prototype. The input stage module got source followers at the input of the operational amplifier. Second stage module was modified to be more symmetric. The output stage module obtained additional resistors and capacitors to achieve a frequency compensation. One FET transistor in the current reference module was substituted by other elements. Simplified electric schemes of these modules of AR820 and aRD820 are presented. The performance of modified electric schemes of modules was tested in Simulink software. Simulations of the full electric scheme for aRD820 were made and showed that it demonstrates similar characteristics as AD820 data tables. Later production of the aRD820 chip and measurements demonstrated that the planned characteristics of the operational amplifier were met.</description>

      <title>Improvement and Characterisation of the ArCLight Large Area Dielectric Light Detector for Liquid Argon TPCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection of scintillation light in noble liquid detectors is necessary for identifying neutrino interaction candidates from beam, astrophysical, or solar sources. Large monolithic detectors typically have highly efficient detectors, like photomultipliers, mounted outside their electric field. This option is not available for modular detectors that wish to maximize their active volume. The ArgonCube light readout system detectors (ArCLights) are large-area thin wavelength shifting (WLS) panels that can operate in highly proximate modular detectors and within the electric field. The WLS plastic forming the bulk structure of the ArCLight has Tetraphenyl Butadiene (TPB) and sheets of dichroic mirror layered across its surface. It is coupled to a set of six silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). This publication compares TPB coating techniques for large surface areas and describes quality control methods for large scale production.</description>

      <title>Direct spin imaging detector based on freestanding magnetic nanomembranes with electron optical amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An analog of the optical polarizer/analyzer for electrons, a spin filter based on freestanding ferromagnetic (FM) nanomembrane covering the entrance of the microchannel plate (MCP) was applied for efficient spin filtering and electron amplification in the 2D field of view. To study the spin dependent transmission, we constructed a spin-triode device (spintron), which consists of a compact proximity focused vacuum tube with the Na2KSb spin-polarized electron source, the FM-MCP and phosphor screen placed to run parallel to each other. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of FM nanomembranes consisting of a Co/Pt superlattice deposited on a freestanding 3 nm SiO2 layer with a total thickness of 10 nm. The FM-MCP has 10e6 channels with a single-channel Sherman function S=0.6 and a transmission of 1.5x10e-3 in the low electron energy range. The FM-MCP-based device provides a compact optical method for measuring the spin polarization of free electron beams in the imaging mode and is well suited for photoemission spectroscopy and microscopy methods.</description>

      <title>An Accessible Instrument for Measuring Soft Material Mechanical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft material research has seen significant growth in recent years, with emerging applications in robotics, electronics, and healthcare diagnostics where understanding material mechanical response is crucial for precision design. Traditional methods for measuring nonlinear mechanical properties of soft materials require specially sized samples that are extracted from their natural environment to be mounted on the testing instrument. This has been shown to compromise data accuracy and precision in various soft and biological materials. To overcome this, the Volume Controlled Cavity Expansion (VCCE) method was developed. This technique tests soft materials by controlling the formation rate of a liquid cavity inside the materials at the tip of an injection needle, and simultaneously measuring the resisting pressure which describes the material response. Despite VCCE's early successes, expansion of its application beyond academia has been hindered by cost, size, and expertise. In response to this, the first portable, bench-top instrument utilizing VCCE is presented here. This device, built with affordable, readily available components and open-source software, streamlines VCCE experimentation without sacrificing performance or precision. It is especially suitable for space-limited settings and designed for use by non-experts, promoting widespread adoption. The instrument's efficacy was demonstrated through testing Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) samples of varying stiffness. This study not only validates instrument performance, but also sets the stage for further advancements and broader applications in soft material testing. All data, along with acquisition, control, and post-processing scripts, are made available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>An indirect geometry crystal time-of-flight spectrometer for FRM II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a concept for an indirect geometry crystal time-of-flight spectrometer, which we propose for a source similar to the FRM-II reactor in Garching. Recently, crystal analyzer spectrometers at modern spallation sources have been proposed and are under construction. The secondary spectrometers of these instruments are evolutions of the flat cone multi-analyzer for three-axis spectrometers (TAS). The instruments will provide exceptional reciprocal space coverage and intensity to map out the excitation landscape in novel materials. We will discuss the benefits of combining a time-of-flight primary spectrometer with a large crystal analyzer spectrometer at a continuous neutron source. The dynamical range can be very flexibly matched to the requirements of the experiment without sacrificing the neutron intensity. At the same time, the chopper system allows a quasi-continuous variation of the initial energy resolution. The neutron delivery system of the proposed instrument is based on the novel nested mirror optics, which images neutrons from the position of the pulse cutting chopper representing a bright virtual source onto the sample. The spot size of less than 1 cm x 1 cm at the virtual source allows the realization of very short neutron pulses by the choppers, while the small and well-defined spot size at the sample position provides an excellent energy resolution of the secondary spectrometer.</description>

      <title>Squeezing the quantum noise of a gravitational-wavedetector below the standard quantum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precision measurements of space and time, like those made by the detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), are often confronted with fundamental limitations imposed by quantum mechanics. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle dictates that the position and momentum of an object cannot both be precisely measured, giving rise to an apparent limitation called the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL). Reducing quantum noise below the SQL in gravitational-wave detectors, where photons are used to continuously measure the positions of freely falling mirrors, has been an active area of research for decades. Here we show how the LIGO A+ upgrade reduced the detectors' quantum noise below the SQL by up to 3 dB while achieving a broadband sensitivity improvement, more than two decades after this possibility was first presented.</description>

      <title>Computing virtual dark-field X-ray microscopy images of complex discrete dislocation structures from large-scale molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark-field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) is a novel diffraction-based imaging technique that non-destructively maps the local deformation from crystalline defects in bulk materials. While studies have demonstrated that DFXM can spatially map 3D defect geometries, it is still challenging to interpret DFXM images of the high dislocation density systems relevant to macroscopic crystal plasticity. This work develops a scalable forward model to calculate virtual DFXM images for complex discrete dislocation (DD) structures obtained from atomistic simulations. Our new DD-DFXM model integrates a non-singular formulation for calculating the local strain from the DD structures and an efficient geometrical optics algorithm for computing the DFXM image from the strain. We apply the model to complex DD structures obtained from a large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of compressive loading on a single-crystal silicon. Simulated DFXM images exhibit prominent feature contrast for dislocations between the multiple slip systems, demonstrating the DFXM's potential to resolve features from dislocation multiplication. The integrated DD-DFXM model provides a toolbox for DFXM experimental design and image interpretation in the context of bulk crystal plasticity for the breadth of measurements across shock plasticity and the broader materials science community.</description>
