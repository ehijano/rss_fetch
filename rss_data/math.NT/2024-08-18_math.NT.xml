      <title>Quartic del Pezzo surfaces without quadratic points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous work of the authors showed that every quartic del Pezzo surface over a number field has index dividing $2$, and asked whether such surfaces always have a closed point of degree $2$. We resolve this by constructing infinitely many quartic del Pezzo surfaces over $\mathbb{Q}$ without degree $2$ points. These are the first examples of smooth intersections of two quadrics with index strictly less than the minimal degree of a closed point.</description>

      <title>Convolution monodromy groups and the Shafarevich conjecture for hypersurfaces in tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Shafarevich conjecture for a class of varieties over a number field posits the finitude of those with good reduction outside a finite set of primes. In the case of hypersurfaces in the torus $\mathbb{G}_m^n$, a natural class to consider are those with a fixed Newton polyhedron that are nondegenerate with respect to it. Using an approach similar to that of Lawrence-Sawin for abelian varieties (arXiv:2004.09046), we prove the Shafarevich conjecture for certain classes of Newton polyhedra. In the course of our proof we construct a fiber functor for the Tannakian category of perverse sheaves on the torus in positive characteristic and compute the weights of the Frobenius on it, which leads to the big monodromy results which are key to this method.</description>

      <title>Higher Moments for Polynomial Chowla</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\lambda(n)$ be the Liouville function. We study the distribution of
  \[
  \frac{1}{x^{1/2}}\sum_{x\leq n\leq 2x}\lambda(f(n))
  \]
  over random polynomials $f$ of fixed degree $d$ and coefficients bounded in magnitude by $H$. In particular we prove that the first $d+1$ moments are Gaussian.</description>

      <title>Traces of partition Eisenstein series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study "partition Eisenstein series", extensions of the Eisenstein series $G_{2k}(\tau),$ defined by $$\lambda=(1^{m_1}, 2^{m_2},\dots, k^{m_k}) \vdash k \ \ \ \ \ \longmapsto \ \ \ \ \ G_{\lambda}(\tau):= G_2(\tau)^{m_1} G_4(\tau)^{m_2}\cdots G_{2k}(\tau)^{m_k}. $$ For functions $\phi: \mathcal{P}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ on partitions, the weight $2k$ "partition Eisenstein trace" is the quasimodular form $$ {\mathrm{Tr}}_k(\phi;\tau):=\sum_{\lambda \vdash k} \phi(\lambda)G_{\lambda}(\tau). $$ These traces give explicit formulas for some well-known generating functions, such as the $k$th elementary symmetric functions of the inverse points of 2-dimensional complex lattices $\mathbb{Z}\oplus \mathbb{Z}\tau,$ as well as the $2k$th power moments of the Andrews-Garvan crank function. To underscore the ubiquity of such traces, we show that their generalizations give the Taylor coefficients of generic Jacobi forms with torsional divisor.</description>

      <title>Supercongruences arising from Ramanujan-Sato Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the authors with Lea Beneish established a recipe for constructing Ramanujan-Sato series for $1/\pi$, and used this to construct 11 explicit examples of Ramanujan-Sato series arising from modular forms for arithmetic triangle groups of non-compact type. Here, we use work of Chisholm, Deines, Long, Nebe and the third author to prove a general $p$-adic supercongruence theorem through an explicit connection to CM hypergeometric elliptic curves that provides $p$-adic analogues of these Ramanujan-Sato series. We further use this theorem to construct explicit examples related to each of our explicit Ramanujan-Sato series examples.</description>

      <title>On sets of rational functions which locally represent all of $\mathbb{Q}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate finite sets of rational functions $\{ f_{1},f_{2}, \dots, f_{r} \}$ defined over some number field $K$ satisfying that any $t_{0} \in K$ is a $K_{p}$-value of one of the functions $f_{i}$ for almost all primes $p$ of $K$. We give strong necessary conditions on the shape of functions appearing in a minimal set with this property, as well as numerous concrete examples showing that these necessary conditions are in a way also close to sufficient. We connect the problem to well-studied concepts such as intersective polynomials and arithmetically exceptional functions.</description>

      <title>Number of solutions to $a^x+b^y=c^z$ with $\gcd(a,b)&gt;1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that there are at most two solutions in positive integers $(x,y,z)$ to the equation $a^x+b^y=c^z$ for positive integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ all greater than one, where at least one of $a$, $b$, $c$ is not a power of 2, and $(\{a,b\},c) \ne (\{3,5\},2)$ (two solutions $(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2,z_2)$ are considered the same solution if $\{ a^{x_1}, b^{y_1} \} = \{ a^{x_2}, b^{y_2} \}$). The case in which $\gcd(a,b)=1$ has been handled in a series of successive results by Scott and Styer, Hu and Le, and Miyazaki and Pink, who showed that there are at most two solutions, excepting $(\{a,b\},c) = (\{3,5\},2)$, which gives three solutions. So here we treat the case $\gcd(a,b)&gt;1$, showing that there are at most two solutions in this case if at least one of $a$, $b$, $c$ is not a power of 2. This generalizes work of Bennett, who proved the equivalent result (for both $\gcd(a,b)=1$ and $\gcd(a,b)&gt;1$) for the case in which one of $x$ or $y$ is a fixed positive integer.
  For both $\gcd(a,b)=1$ and $\gcd(a,b)&gt;1$, there are an infinite number of cases with exactly two solutions $(x,y,z)$, which are described in detail in this and a cited previous paper.
  In a further result, in which we no longer consider two solutions $(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2,z_2)$ to be the same solution if $\{ a^{x_1}, b^{y_1} \} = \{ a^{x_2}, b^{y_2} \}$, we list all cases with more than two solutions.</description>

      <title>On power monoids and their automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Endowed with the binary operation of set addition, the family $\mathcal P_{{\rm fin},0}(\mathbb N)$ of all finite subsets of $\mathbb N$ containing $0$ forms a monoid, with the singleton $\{0\}$ as its neutral element.
  We show that the only non-trivial automorphism of $\mathcal P_{{\rm fin},0}(\mathbb N)$ is the involution $X \mapsto \max X - X$. The proof leverages ideas from additive number theory and proceeds through an unconventional induction on what we call the boxing dimension of a finite set of integers, that is, the smallest number of (discrete) intervals whose union is the set itself.</description>
