      <title>Complementarity between Brillouin signature and Scholte wave for controlled elasticity in fibrillated collagen medium for culture cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modulating extracellular matrix (ECM) elasticity with fibrillar collagen offers great potential for regenerative medicine, drug discovery, and disease modeling by replicating invivo mechanical signals. This enhances understanding of cellular responses and fosters therapeutic innovation. However, precise ECM elasticity measurements are still lacking. This study couples time-resolved Brillouin spectroscopy and pulsed laser-induced Scholtes wave generation. We measure how collagen fibrillation affects sound velocity and refractive index. These insights are advancing tissue engineering and cellular biomechanics.</description>

Abstract: Molecular machines transduce free energy between different forms throughout all living organisms. While truly machines in their own right, unlike their macroscopic counterparts molecular machines are characterized by stochastic fluctuations, overdamped dynamics, and soft components, and operate far from thermodynamic equilibrium. In addition, information is a relevant free-energy resource for molecular machines, leading to new modes of operation for nanoscale engines. Towards the objective of engineering synthetic nanomachines, an important goal is to understand how molecular machines transduce free energy to perform their functions in biological systems. In this review we discuss the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of free-energy transduction within molecular machines, with a focus on quantifying energy and information flows between their components. We review results from theory, modeling, and inference from experiments that shed light on the internal thermodynamics of molecular machines, and ultimately explore what we can learn from considering these interactions.</description>

      <title>A stochastic field theory for the evolution of quantitative traits in finite populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infinitely many distinct trait values may arise in populations bearing quantitative traits, and modelling their population dynamics is thus a formidable task. While classical models assume fixed or infinite population size, models in which the total population size fluctuates due to demographic noise in births and deaths can behave qualitatively differently from constant or infinite population models due to density-dependent dynamics. In this paper, I present a stochastic field theory for the eco-evolutionary dynamics of finite populations bearing one-dimensional quantitative traits. I derive stochastic field equations that describe the evolution of population densities, trait frequencies, and the mean value of any trait in the population. These equations recover well-known results such as the replicator-mutator equation, Price equation, and gradient dynamics in the infinite population limit. For finite populations, the equations describe the intricate interplay between natural selection, noise-induced selection, eco-evolutionary feedback, and neutral genetic drift in determining evolutionary trajectories. My methods use ideas from statistical physics and present an alternative to some recently proposed measure-theoretic frameworks.</description>

      <title>Statistical description of mobile oscillators in embryonic pattern formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization of mobile oscillators occurs in numerous contexts, including physical, chemical, biological and engineered systems. In vertebrate embryonic development, a segmental body structure is generated by a population of mobile oscillators. Cells in this population produce autonomous gene expression rhythms, and interact with their neighbors through local signaling. These cells form an extended tissue where frequency and cell mobility gradients coexist. Gene expression kinematic waves travel through this tissue and pattern the segment boundaries. It has been shown that oscillator mobility promotes global synchronization. However, in vertebrate segment formation, mobility may also introduce local fluctuations in kinematic waves and impair segment boundaries. Here we derive a general framework for mobile oscillators that relates local mobility fluctuations to synchronization dynamics and pattern robustness. We formulate a statistical description of mobile phase oscillators in terms of a probability density. We obtain and solve diffusion equations for the average phase and variance, revealing the relationship between local fluctuations and global synchronization in a homogeneous population of oscillators. Analysis of the probability density for large mobility identifies a mean-field transition, where locally coupled oscillators start behaving as if each oscillator was coupled with all the others. We extend the statistical description to inhomogeneous systems to address the gradients present in the vertebrate segmenting tissue. The theory relates pattern stability to mobility, coupling and pattern wavelength. The general approach of the statistical description may be applied to mobile oscillators in other contexts, as well as to other patterning systems where mobility is present.</description>

      <title>Integer defects, flow localization, and bistability on curved active surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological surfaces, such as developing epithelial tissues, exhibit in-plane polar or nematic order and can be strongly curved. Recently, integer (+1) topological defects have been identified as morphogenetic hotspots in living systems. Yet, while +1 defects in active matter on flat surfaces are well-understood, the general principles governing curved active defects remain unknown. Here, we study the dynamics of integer defects in an extensile or contractile polar fluid on two types of morphogenetically-relevant substrates : (1) a cylinder terminated by a spherical cap, and (2) a bump on an otherwise flat surface. Because the Frank elastic energy on a curved surface generically induces a coupling to $\textit{deviatoric}$ curvature, $\mathcal{D}$ (difference between squared principal curvatures), a +1 defect is induced on both surface types. We find that $\mathcal{D}$ leads to surprising effects including localization of orientation gradients and active flows, and particularly for contractility, to hysteresis and bistability between quiescent and flowing defect states.</description>

      <title>Geometrical characterization of healthy red blood cells using digital holographic microscopy and parametric shape models for biophysical studies and diagnostic applications</title>

Abstract: Modeling of the red blood cell (RBC) shape is an integral part of the experimental and computer simulation investigations of light scattering by these cells for fundamental studies as well as diagnostic applications in techniques like cytometry and quantitative phase imaging. In the present work, a comprehensive study of the geometrical characterization of healthy human RBCs using digital holographic microscopy (DHM) and six frequently employed parametric shape models is reported. It is shown that the comparison of the optical phase profiles, and the thickness profiles given by the models with the DHM results gives a better judgment of the appropriateness of the parametric shape models. It is also shown that the RBC parametric models offer a simpler solution to RI-thickness decoupling problem in QPI methods. Results of geometrical characterization of 500 healthy RBCs in terms of volume, surface area (SA), and sphericity index (SI) led to the classification of the parametric models in two categories based on the nature of variation of these quantities with the cell diameter. In light of the variability of the healthy RBC shapes, our findings suggest that the parametric models exhibiting a negative correlation between the SI and the cell diameter would provide more reliable estimates of the RBC parameters in diagnostic applications. Statistical distributions and descriptive statistics of the RBC volume, SA and SI serve as a guide for the assessment of the capability of the studied parametric models to give a reliable account of the variability of the healthy RBC shape and size.</description>

      <title>Emergence of bacterial glass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.10436v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Densely packed, motile bacteria can adopt collective states not seen in conventional, passive materials. These states remain in many ways mysterious, and their physical characterization can aid our understanding of natural bacterial colonies and biofilms as well as materials in general. Here, we overcome challenges associated with generating uniformly growing, large, quasi-two-dimensional bacterial assemblies by a membrane-based microfluidic device and report the emergence of glassy states in two-dimensional suspension of Escherichia coli. As the number density increases by cell growth, populations of motile bacteria transition to a glassy state, where cells are packed and unable to move. This takes place in two steps, the first one suppressing only the orientational modes and the second one vitrifying the motion completely. Characterizing each phase through statistical analyses and investigations of individual motion of bacteria, we find not only characteristic features of glass such as rapid slowdown, dynamic heterogeneity and cage effects, but also a few properties distinguished from those of thermal glass. These distinctive properties include the spontaneous formation of micro-domains of aligned cells with collective motion, the appearance of an unusual signal in the dynamic susceptibility, and the dynamic slowdown with a density dependence generally forbidden for thermal systems. Our results are expected to capture general characteristics of such active rod glass, which may serve as a physical mechanism underlying dense bacterial aggregates.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Neural Network Estimation of Material Properties in Soft Tissue Nonlinear Biomechanical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09787v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of biophysical models for clinical applications is rapidly advancing in the research community, thanks to their predictive nature and their ability to assist the interpretation of clinical data. However, high-resolution and accurate multi-physics computational models are computationally expensive and their personalisation involves fine calibration of a large number of parameters, which may be space-dependent, challenging their clinical translation. In this work, we propose a new approach which relies on the combination of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with three-dimensional soft tissue nonlinear biomechanical models, capable of reconstructing displacement fields and estimating heterogeneous patient-specific biophysical properties. The proposed learning algorithm encodes information from a limited amount of displacement and, in some cases, strain data, that can be routinely acquired in the clinical setting, and combines it with the physics of the problem, represented by a mathematical model based on partial differential equations, to regularise the problem and improve its convergence properties. Several benchmarks are presented to show the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method and its great potential to enable the robust and effective identification of patient-specific, heterogeneous physical properties, s.a. tissue stiffness properties. In particular, we demonstrate the capability of the PINN to detect the presence, location and severity of scar tissue, which is beneficial to develop personalised simulation models for disease diagnosis, especially for cardiac applications.</description>

      <title>Identification of spatial dynamic patterns of behavior using weighted Voronoi diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes an innovative approach to analyze spatial patterns of behavior by integrating information in weighted Voronoi diagrams. The objective of the research is to analyze the temporal distribution of an experimental subject in different regions of a given space, with the aim of identifying significant areas of interest. The methodology employed involves dividing the experimental space, determining representative points, and assigning weights based on the cumulative time the subject spends in each region. This process results in a set of generator points along with their respective weights, thus defining the Voronoi diagram. The study also presents a detailed and advanced perspective for understanding spatial behavioral patterns in experimental contexts.</description>

      <title>Synergy as the failure of distributivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A physical system is synergistic if it cannot be reduced to its constituents. Intuitively this is paraphrased into the common statement that 'the whole is greater than the sum of its parts'. In this manner, many basic elements in combination may give rise to some unexpected collective behavior. A paradigmatic example of such phenomenon is information. Several sources, which are already known individually, may provide some new knowledge when joined together. Here we take the trivial case of discrete random variables and explore whether and how it is possible get more information out of lesser parts. Our approach is inspired by set theory as the fundamental description of part-whole relations. If taken unaltered, synergistic behavior is forbidden by the set theoretical axioms. Indeed, the union of sets cannot contain extra elements not found in any particular one of them. However, random variables are not a perfect analogy of sets. We formalise the distinction, finding a single broken axiom - union/intersection distributivity. Nevertheless, it remains possible to describe information using Venn-type diagrams. We directly connect the existence of synergy to the failure of distributivity for random variables. When compared to the partial information decomposition framework (PID), our technique fully reproduces previous results while resolving the self-contradictions that plagued the field and providing additional constraints on the solutions. This opens the way towards quantifying emergence in large systems.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram and coarsening dynamics in dry apolar active nematics with reciprocal local alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Lebwohl-Lasher interaction for reciprocal local alignment, we present a comprehensive phase diagram for a dry, apolar, active nematic system using its stochastic dynamics. The nematic-isotropic transition in this system is first-order and fluctuation-dominated. Our phase diagram identifies three distinct regions based on activity and orientational noise relative to alignment strength: a homogeneous isotropic phase, a nematic phase with giant density fluctuations, and a coexistence region. Using mean-field analysis and hydrodynamic theory, we demonstrate that reciprocal interactions lead to a density fluctuation-induced first-order transition and derive a phase boundary consistent with numerical results. Quenching from the isotropic to nematic phase reveals coarsening dynamics with nematic ordering preceding particle clustering and similar scaling behaviors for density and nematic fields, exhibiting dynamic exponents between 2 and 3.</description>
