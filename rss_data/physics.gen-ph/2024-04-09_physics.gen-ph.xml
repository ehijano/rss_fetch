      <title>Physical mechanism for the geometric phases in optics and angular momentum holonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vast literature on the experiments and mathematical formulations on the geometric phases signifies the importance of this subject. Physical mechanism for the origin of the geometric phases in optics was suggested in 1992 by the author in terms of the exchange of the angular momentum. Some of the literature has taken notice of it, however, the real import of the suggested mechanism and the angular momentum holonomy conjecture has remained elusive. The present contribution delineates the prevailing confusions and offers a thorough discussion on the nature of the light waves to resolve the conceptual issues. It is argued that at a fundamental level there exist only two types of geometric phases arising from (i) the geometry of the wave vector space, and (ii) the polarization state space. For the light beams of definite polarization spatial modes (HG or LG modes) the geometric phase has origin in the wave vector space that is different than the spin redirection phase for the polarized light. Angular momentum holonomy is proposed to be equivalent to the geometric phase in general.</description>

      <title>The Schwarzschild-de Sitter Metric of Nonlocal $\sqrt{dS}$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is already known that a simple nonlocal de Sitter gravity model, which we denote as $\sqrt{dS}$ gravity, contains an exact vacuum cosmological solution which mimics dark energy and dark matter and is in very good agreement with the standard model of cosmology. This success of $\sqrt{dS}$ gravity motivated us to investigate how it works at lower than cosmic scale -- galactic and the solar system. This paper contains our investigation of the corresponding Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric of the $\sqrt{dS}$ gravity model. To get exact solution, it is necessary to solve the corresponding nonlinear differential equation, what is a very complicated and difficult problem. What we obtained is a solution of linearized equation, which is related to space metric far from the massive body, where gravitational field is weak. The obtained approximate solution is of particular interest for examining the possible role of non-local de Sitter gravity $\sqrt{dS}$ in describing the effects in galactic dynamics that are usually attributed to dark matter. The solution has been tested on the Milky Way and the spiral galaxy M33 and is in good agreement with observational measurements.</description>
