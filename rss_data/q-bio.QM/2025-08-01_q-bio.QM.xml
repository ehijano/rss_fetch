      <title>The Lipid Interactome: An interactive and open access platform for exploring cellular lipid-protein interactomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lipid-protein interactions play essential roles in cellular signaling and membrane dynamics, yet their systematic characterization has long been hindered by the inherent biochemical properties of lipids. Recent advances in functionalized lipid probes -- equipped with photoactivatable crosslinkers, affinity handles, and photocleavable protecting groups -- have enabled proteomics-based identification of lipid interacting proteins with unprecedented specificity and resolution. Despite the growing number of published lipid interactomes, there remains no centralized effort to harmonize, compare, or integrate these datasets.
  The Lipid Interactome addresses this gap by providing a structured, interactive web portal that adheres to FAIR data principles -- ensuring that lipid interactome studies are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. Through standardized data formatting, interactive visualizations, and direct cross-study comparisons, this resource enables researchers to systematically explore the protein-binding partners of diverse bioactive lipids. By consolidating and curating lipid interactome proteomics data from multiple studies, the Lipid Interactome database serves as a critical tool for deciphering the biological functions of lipids in cellular systems.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Language Models are Prone to Reasoning Errors for Complex Computational Phenotyping Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Although computational phenotyping is a central informatics activity with resulting cohorts supporting a wide variety of applications, it is time-intensive because of manual data review. We previously assessed the ability of LLMs to perform computational phenotyping tasks using computable phenotypes for ARF respiratory support therapies. They successfully performed concept classification and classification of single-therapy phenotypes, but underperformed on multiple-therapy phenotypes. To understand issues with these complex tasks, we expanded PHEONA, a generalizable framework for evaluation of LLMs, to include methods specifically for evaluating faulty reasoning. Materials and Methods: We assessed the responses of three lightweight LLMs (DeepSeek-r1 32 billion, Mistral Small 24 billion, and Phi-4 14 billion) both with and without prompt modifications to identify explanation correctness and unfaithfulness errors for phenotyping. Results: For experiments without prompt modifications, both errors were present across all models although more responses had explanation correctness errors than unfaithfulness errors. For experiments assessing accuracy impact after prompt modifications, DeepSeek, a reasoning model, had the smallest overall accuracy impact when compared to Mistral and Phi. Discussion: Since reasoning errors were ubiquitous across models, our enhancement of PHEONA to include a component for assessing faulty reasoning provides critical support for LLM evaluation and evidence for reasoning errors for complex tasks. While insights from reasoning errors can help prompt refinement, a deeper understanding of why LLM reasoning errors occur will likely require further development and refinement of interpretability methods. Conclusion: Reasoning errors were pervasive across LLM responses for computational phenotyping, a complex reasoning task</description>

      <title>Enabling Few-Shot Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis on Tabular Biomarker Data with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex neurodegenerative disorder, requires analysis of heterogeneous biomarkers (e.g., neuroimaging, genetic risk factors, cognitive tests, and cerebrospinal fluid proteins) typically represented in a tabular format. With flexible few-shot reasoning, multimodal integration, and natural-language-based interpretability, large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities for prediction with structured biomedical data. We propose a novel framework called TAP-GPT, Tabular Alzheimer's Prediction GPT, that adapts TableGPT2, a multimodal tabular-specialized LLM originally developed for business intelligence tasks, for AD diagnosis using structured biomarker data with small sample sizes. Our approach constructs few-shot tabular prompts using in-context learning examples from structured biomedical data and finetunes TableGPT2 using the parameter-efficient qLoRA adaption for a clinical binary classification task of AD or cognitively normal (CN). The TAP-GPT framework harnesses the powerful tabular understanding ability of TableGPT2 and the encoded prior knowledge of LLMs to outperform more advanced general-purpose LLMs and a tabular foundation model (TFM) developed for prediction tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first application of LLMs to the prediction task using tabular biomarker data, paving the way for future LLM-driven multi-agent frameworks in biomedical informatics.</description>

      <title>Deciphering interventional dynamical causality from non-intervention complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting and quantifying causality is a focal topic in the fields of science, engineering, and interdisciplinary studies. However, causal studies on non-intervention systems attract much attention but remain extremely challenging. Delay-embedding technique provides a promising approach. In this study, we propose a framework named Interventional Dynamical Causality (IntDC) in contrast to the traditional Constructive Dynamical Causality (ConDC). ConDC, including Granger causality, transfer entropy and convergence of cross-mapping, measures the causality by constructing a dynamical model without considering interventions. A computational criterion, Interventional Embedding Entropy (IEE), is proposed to measure causal strengths in an interventional manner. IEE is an intervened causal information flow but in the delay-embedding space. Further, the IEE theoretically and numerically enables the deciphering of IntDC solely from observational (non-interventional) time-series data, without requiring any knowledge of dynamical models or real interventions in the considered system. In particular, IEE can be applied to rank causal effects according to their importance and construct causal networks from data. We conducted numerical experiments to demonstrate that IEE can find causal edges accurately, eliminate effects of confounding, and quantify causal strength robustly over traditional indices. We also applied IEE to real-world tasks. IEE performed as an accurate and robust tool for causal analyses solely from the observational data. The IntDC framework and IEE algorithm provide an efficient approach to the study of causality from time series in diverse non-intervention complex systems.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Cancer Stem Cell Marker Networks: A Hypergraph Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel computational framework leveraging hypergraph theory to analyse cancer stem cell markers (CSCMs) across multiple organs. Hypergraphs provide a robust representation of CSCM co-expression patterns, capturing their complex multi-organ relationships more comprehensively than traditional graph-based methods. By integrating mutual information analysis and Markov models, we identify key markers driving tumour heterogeneity and metastasis, offering detailed insights into their interdependencies. This approach establishes hypergraphs as a computationally powerful tool to model cancer progression and metastatic dynamics, contributing to the understanding of complex biological systems and supporting the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.</description>
