      <title>Exact Statistics of Helical Wormlike Chains with Twist-Bend Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a solution for the Green's function for the general case of a helical wormlike chain with twist-bend coupling, and demonstrate the applicability of our solution for evaluating general structural and mechanical chain properties. We find that twist-bend coupling renormalizes the persistence length and the force-extension curves relative to worm-like chains. Analysis of intrinsically twisted polymers shows that incorporation of twist-bend coupling results in the oscillatory behavior in principal tangent correlations that are observed in some studies of synthetic polymers. The exact nature of our solution provides a framework to evaluate the role of twist-bend coupling on polymer properties and motivates the reinterpretation of existing bio-polymer experimental data.</description>

      <title>Strain stiffening due to stretching of entangled particles in random packings of granular materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stress-strain relations for random packings of entangling chains under triaxial compression can exhibit strain stiffening and sustain stresses several orders-of-magnitude beyond typical granular materials. X-ray tomography reveals the transition to this strong strain stiffening occurs when chains are long enough to entangle an average of about one chain each, which results in system-filling clusters of entangled chains. The number of entanglements is nearly proportional to the area surrounded by entangling particles with an excluded volume effect. A tendency was found for chain links to stretch when the packing was strained. The slope of the stress-strain relation of the packing can be calculated from a mean-field model consisting of the product of the effective extensional modulus of the chain, packing fraction, probability of stretched links, and the ratio of strain of stretched links to packing strain. The stress-strain model requires as input measurements of the ratio between local particle deformation and global average strain, and the probability of stretching for non-rigid particles. This results in a quadratic prediction for the stress-strain curve, with a curvature that agrees with experiments within the model uncertainties. This model explains that the strength of these packings comes from stretching of the links of chains, but only when the system-filling network of entanglements provides constraints that prevents failure by shear banding, so that particles must be deformed to move further under strain. In this model, the increasing slope of the stress-strain curve is mainly due to the fraction of stretched links increasing with strain. This model for the stress-strain relation is shown to be generalizable to different shapes of entangling particles by applying it to staples.</description>

      <title>Mean-field theory of the uniaxial ferroelectric smectic A liquid crystal phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the groundbreaking discovery of the ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal phase (NF), a series of closely-related new polar phases have also been found. An especially interesting one is the ferroelectric smectic A phase (SmAF) with spontaneous polarization along the layer normal observed in a few materials of the NF realm. Here, we present a mean-field molecular model that successfully captures the rich phase diagrams experimentally observed in the literature in terms of two parameters. Additionally, we carry out second harmonic generation, X-ray diffraction and birefringence measurements in a compound exhibiting the SmAF phase to determine the appropriate order parameters and compare with the model predictions.</description>

      <title>Tuning the mechanical properties of organophilic clay dispersions: particle composition and preshear history effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clay minerals are abundant natural materials used widely in coatings, construction materials, ceramics, as well as being a component of drilling fluids. Here, we present the effect of steady and oscillatory preshear on organophilic modified clay gels in synthetic oil. Both platelet and needle-like particles are used as viscosifiers in drilling fluid formulations. For both particles the plateau modulus exhibits a similar concentration dependence, G_P ~ c^3.9, whereas the yield strain is {\gamma}_y ~ c^(-1) for the platelets and {\gamma}_y ~ c^-1.7 for the needles. Mixtures of the two follow an intermediate behavior: at low concentrations their elasticity and yield strain follows that of needle particles while at higher concentrations it exhibits a weaker power law dependence. Furthermore, upon varying the preshear history, the gel viscoelastic properties can be significantly tuned. At lower (higher) clay concentrations, preshear at specific oscillatory strain amplitudes or steady shear rates, may induce a hardening (softening) of the dispersions and, at all concentrations, a lowering of the shear strain. Hence, in needle dispersions preshear resulted in changes in the volume fraction dependence of the elastic modulus from G_P ~ c^3.9 to G_P ~ c^2.5 and of the yield strain from {\gamma}_y ~ c^-1.7 to {\gamma}_y ~ c^-1. However, small angle X-ray scattering showed not much structural changes, within the q-range covered. Our findings indicate ways to design colloidal organoclay dispersions with a mechanical response that can be tuned at will.</description>

      <title>Shape effects in binary mixtures of PA12 powder in additive manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quality of the powder spread in additive manufacturing devices depends sensitively on the particles' shapes. Here, we study powder spreading for mixtures of spherical and irregularly shaped particles in Polyamide 12 powders. Using DEM simulations, including heat transfer, we find that spherical particles exhibit better flowability. Thus, the particles are deposited far ahead of the spreading blade. In contrast, a large fraction of non-spherical particles hinders the flow. Therefore, the cold particles are deposited near the front of the spreading blade. This results in a temperature drop of the deposited particles near the substrate, which cannot be seen with spherical particles. The particles of both shapes are homogeneously distributed in the deposited powder layer.</description>

      <title>Stochastic process model for interfacial gap of purely normal elastic rough surface contact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In purely normal elastic rough surface contact problems, Persson's theory of contact shows that the evolution of the probability density function (PDF) of contact pressure with the magnification is governed by a diffusion equation. However, there is no partial differential equation describing the evolution of the PDF of the interfacial gap. In this study, we derive a convection--diffusion equation in terms of the PDF of the interfacial gap based on stochastic process theory, as well as the initial and boundary conditions. A finite difference method is developed to numerically solve the partial differential equation. The predicted PDF of the interfacial gap agrees well with that by Green's Function Molecular Dynamics (GFMD) and other variants of Persson's theory of contact at high load ranges. At low load ranges, the obvious deviation between the present work and GFMD is attributed to the overestimated mean interfacial gap and oversimplified magnification-dependent diffusion coefficient used in the present model. As one of its direct application, we show that the present work can effectively solve the adhesive contact problem under the DMT limit. The current study provides an alternative methodology for determining the PDF of the interfacial gap and a unified framework for solving the complementary problem of random contact pressure and random interfacial gap based on stochastic process theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the statistical behavior of a system comprising fore-aft symmetric rods confined between two vertically vibrating plates using numerical simulations closely resembling the experimental setup studied by Narayan et al., Science 317, 105 (2007). Our focus lies in studying the phase transition of the system from an isotropic phase to a nematic phase as we increase either the rod length or the rod concentration. Our simulations confirm the presence of long-range ordering in the ordered phase. Furthermore, we identify a phase characterized by a periodic ordering profile that disrupts translation symmetry. We also provide a detailed analysis of the translational and rotational diffusive dynamics of the rods. Interestingly, the translational diffusivity of the rods is found to increase with the rod concentration.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric Smectic C Liquid Crystal Phase with Spontaneous Polarization in the Direction of the Director</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous study, we demonstrated the existence of an unidentified ferroelectric smectic phase in the low-temperature region of the ferroelectric smectic A phase, where the layer spacing decreases with decreasing temperature. In the present study, we identified the phase by taking 2D X-ray diffraction images of a magnetically oriented sample while allowing it to rotate and constructed a 3D reciprocal space with the sample rotation angle as the third axis for the whole picture of the reciprocal lattice vectors originating from the smectic structure. Consequently, circular diffraction images were obtained when the reciprocal lattice vectors were evenly distributed on the conical surface at a certain inclination angle in the reciprocal space. This result provides clear evidence that the phase in question was smectic C. The polarization properties also showed that the observed smectic C phase had spontaneous polarization in the direction parallel to the director and was identified as ferroelectric smectic C. These results provide a new type of classification for liquid crystalline phases that has been established over many years and is a significant contribution to the basic science of soft matter research.</description>

      <title>Effect of the background flow on the motility induced phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate active Brownian particles (ABPs) with soft-repulsive interactions subjected to a four-roll-mill flow. In the absence of flow, this system exhibits motility-induced phase separation (MIPS). To investigate the interplay between MIPS and flow-induced mixing, we introduce dimensionless parameters: a scaled time, $\tau$, and a scaled velocity, ${\rm v}$, characterizing the ratio of ABP to fluid time and velocity scales, respectively. The parameter space defined by $\tau$ and ${\rm v}$ reveals three distinct ABP distribution regimes. At low velocities ${\rm v} \ll 1$, flow dominates, leading to a homogeneous mixture. Conversely, at high velocities ${\rm v} \gg 1$, motility prevails, resulting in MIPS. In the intermediate regime (${\rm v} \sim 1$), the system's behavior depends on $\tau$. For $\tau &lt;1$, a moderately mixed homogeneous phase emerges, while for $\tau &gt;1$, a novel phase, termed flow-induced phase separation (FIPS), arises due to the combined effects of flow topology and ABP motility and size. To characterize these phases, we analyze drift velocity, diffusivity, mean-squared displacement, giant number fluctuations, radial distribution function, and cluster-size distribution.</description>

      <title>On the origins of reverse Janssen effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider experimentally and computationally the phenomenon of the reverse Janssen effect, involving the counterintuitive finding that the force on the base of a column containing granular particles may be larger than the weight of the granular material itself. This finding is in contrast to the common Janssen effect, for which the force on the base is smaller than the particle weight, illustrating one of the best-known differences between granular and liquid systems. We find that the reverse Janssen effect is strongly influenced by the pouring protocol: under Earth's gravitational field, and for pouring heights that are measured in tens of particle diameters, dynamic reverse Janssen effect is found. Dynamic reverse Janssen effect is an order of magnitude stronger than static one, found for small pouring heights. This differentiation between static and dynamic effects allows for the development of a better understanding of the general features of reverse Janssen effect, and of the comparison between experiments and simulations reported in this and previous works.</description>

      <title>Tunable Hyperuniformity in Cellular Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperuniform materials, characterized by their suppressed density fluctuations and vanishing structure factors as the wave number approaches zero, represent a unique state of matter that straddles the boundary between order and randomness. These materials exhibit exceptional optical, mechanical, and acoustic properties, making them of great interest in materials science and engineering. Traditional methods for creating hyperuniform structures, including collective-coordinate optimization and centroidal Voronoi tessellations, have primarily been computational and face challenges in capturing the complexity of naturally occurring systems. This study introduces a comprehensive theoretical framework to generate hyperuniform structures inspired by the collective organization of biological cells within an epithelial tissue layer. By adjusting parameters such as cell elasticity and interfacial tension, we explore a spectrum of hyperuniform states from fluid to rigid, each exhibiting distinct mechanical properties and types of density fluctuations. Our results not only advance the understanding of hyperuniformity in biological tissues but also demonstrate the potential of these materials to inform the design of novel materials with tailored properties.</description>

      <title>Current rectification via Photosystem I monolayers induced by their orientation on hydrophilic self-assembled monolayers on titanium nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photosystem I (PSI) is a photosynthetic protein which evolved to efficiently transfer electrons through the thylakoid membrane. This remarkable process attracted the attention of the biomolecular electronics community, which aims to study and understand the underlying electronic transport through these proteins by contacting ensembles of PSI with solid-state metallic contacts. This paper extends published work of immobilizing monolayers of PSI with a specific orientation, by using organophosphonate self-assembled molecules with hydrophilic heads on ultra-flat titanium nitride. Electrical measurements carried out with eutectic GaIn top contacts showed current rectification ratios of up to ~200. The previously proposed rectification mechanism, relying on the protein's internal electric dipole, was inquired by measuring shifts in the work function. Our straightforward bottom-up fabrication method may allow for further experimental studies on PSI molecules, such as embedding them in solid-state, transparent top contact schemes for optoelectronic measurements.</description>

      <title>Mono-exponential Current Attenuation with Distance across 16 nm Thick Bacteriorhodopsin Multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable ability of natural proteins to conduct electricity in the dry state over long distances remains largely inexplicable despite intensive research. In some cases, a (weakly) exponential length-attenuation, as in off-resonant tunneling transport, extends to thicknesses even beyond 10 nm. This report deals with such charge transport characteristics observed in self-assembled multilayers of the protein bacteriorhodopsin (bR). About 7.5 nm to 15.5 nm thick bR layers were prepared on conductive titanium nitride (TiN) substrates using aminohexylphosphonic acid and poly-diallyl-dimethylammonium electrostatic linkers. Using conical EGaIn top contacts, an intriguing, mono-exponential conductance attenuation as a function of the bR layer thickness with a small attenuation coefficient $\beta \approx 0.8 \space {\rm nm}^{-1}$ is measured at zero bias. Variable-temperature measurements using evaporated Ti/Au top contacts yield effective energy barriers of about 100 meV from fitting the data to tunneling, hopping, and carrier cascade transport models. The observed temperature-dependence is assigned to the protein-electrode interfaces. The transport length and temperature dependence of the current densities are consistent with tunneling through the protein-protein and protein-electrode interfaces, respectively. Importantly, our results call for new theoretical approaches to find the microscopic mechanism behind the remarkably efficient, long-range electron transport within bR.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Brownian particles in asymmetric confinement: Insights into Entropic Stochastic Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the effect of asymmetry in the thermodynamic response (work done) of an overdamped Brownian system driven by a time-periodic field when the particle is confined inside a bilobal irregular structure. The spatial irregularity of the asymmetric confinement results in an effective asymmetric entropic bistable potential along the direction of transport. We investigate how the frequency of the periodic field and the intensity of the noise impact the average work done, focusing on its potential as a key metric for examining Entropic Stochastic Resonance (ESR). The study highlights the impact of confinement asymmetry on reducing the average work done. Furthermore, we observe a transition of average work done from a state dominated by energy to one dominated by entropy, as we manipulate the magnitude of the transverse force. In addition, an alternative quantity called the mean free flight time ($T_{MFFT}$) is proposed to describe the ESR in the presence of asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann approach to collective motion via non-local visual interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual cues play crucial roles in the collective motion of animals, birds, fish, and insects. The interaction mediated by visual information is essentially non-local and has many-body nature due to occlusion, which poses a challenging problem in modeling the emergent collective behavior. In this Letter, we introduce a Boltzmann-equation approach incorporating non-local visual interaction. Occlusion is treated in a self-consistent manner via a coarse-grained density field, which renders the interaction effectively pairwise. Our model also incorporates the recent finding that each organism stochastically selects a neighbor to interact at each instant. We analytically derive the order-disorder transition point, and show that the visual screening effect substantially raises the transition threshold, which does not vanish when the density of the agents or the range of the intrinsic interaction is taken to infinity. Our analysis suggests that the model exhibits a discontinuous transition as in the local interaction models, and but the discontinuity is weakened by the non-locality. Our study clarifies the essential role of non-locality in the visual interactions among moving organisms.</description>

      <title>Shape Evolution of Fluid Deformable Surfaces under Active Geometric Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models for fluid deformable surfaces provide valid theories to describe the dynamics of thin fluidic sheets of soft materials. To use such models in morphogenesis and development requires to incorporate active forces. We consider active geometric forces which respond to mean curvature gradients. Due to these forces perturbations in shape can induce tangential flows which can enhance the perturbation leading to shape instabilities. We numerically explore these shape instabilities and analyse the resulting dynamics of closed surfaces with constant enclosed volume. The numerical approach considers surface finite elements and a semi-implicit time stepping scheme and shows optimal convergence properties, which have been proven for Stokes flow on stationary surfaces.</description>

      <title>Accessing the Free Expansion of a Crystalline Colloidal Drop by Optical Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study poly-crystalline spherical drops of an aqueous suspension of highly charged colloidal spheres exposed to a colloid-free aqueous environment. Crystal contours were obtained from standard optical imaging. The crystal spheres first expand to nearly four times their initial volume before slowly shrinking due to dilution-induced melting. Exploiting coherent multiple-scattering by (110) Bragg reflecting crystals, time-dependent density profiles were recorded deep within the drop interior. These show a continuously flattening radial density gradient and a decreasing central density. Expansion curves and density profiles are qualitatively consistent with theoretical expectations based on dynamical density functional theory for the expansion of a spherical crystallite made of charged Brownian spheres. We anticipate that our study opens novel experimental access to densi-ty determination in turbid crystals.</description>

      <title>Ideal noncrystals: A possible new class of ordered matter without apparent broken symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Order and disorder constitute two fundamental and opposite themes in condensed matter physics and materials science. Crystals are considered the epitome of order, characterised by long-range translational order. The discovery of quasicrystals, which exhibit rotational symmetries forbidden in crystals and lack periodicity, led to a paradigm shift in solid-state physics. Moving one step forward, it is intriguing to ask whether ordered matter can exist without apparent symmetry breaking. The same question arises considering how ordered amorphous (noncrystalline) solids can be structured. Here, we present the discovery of ideal noncrystals in two dimensions, which are disordered in the conventional sense, lacking Bragg peaks, but exhibit high orderliness based on the steric order, i.e., they are ideally packed. A path-integral-like scheme reveals the underlying long-range structural correlation. We find that these ideal noncrystals are characterised by phononic vibrational modes following the Debye law, fully affine elastic responses, and suppressed density fluctuations at longer wavelengths, reminiscent of hyperuniformity -- all characteristics typically associated with crystals. Therefore, ideal noncrystals represent a peculiar form of matter with a mixed nature -- noncrystalline yet possessing crystal-like properties. Notably, these states are found to be thermodynamically favourable, indicating them as a possible new class of ordered matter without apparent symmetry breaking. Our findings significantly broaden the conceptualization of ordered states of matter and may contribute to a deeper understanding of entropy-driven ordering, particularly in generic amorphous materials.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of colloidal rods rotating in viscoelastic media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the in-plane rotational motion of ferromagnetic colloidal rods immersed in viscoelastic media and subjected to a rotating magnetic field. Unexpectedly, we observe significant angular velocity even at field frequencies an order of magnitude exceeding the step-out frequency, a regime where rods typically cease rotating in Newtonian fluids. This anomalous behavior arises from the interplay between the rapid rod actuation driven by the external field and the slower microstructural relaxation of the viscoelastic fluid. A minimal model incorporating memory effects quantitatively captures our experimental findings. Our study demonstrate a rather general case of microrheological probe dynamics in viscoelastic media where the behavior beyond step-out frequency depends strongly on the rheological parameters medium. Additionally, we derive an analytical expression for the rod orientation in the high-frequency limit, providing a potential method for extracting rheological parameters.</description>

      <title>Inspection paradox and jump detection in glassy systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamics in glassy systems near the phase transition is characterized by particle jumps. Approaches to describe these dynamics are based on models in which the time and length scales defining the jumps are parameters to be determined. We instead propose a model-independent method to detect these jumps. Our method uses the theory of the inspection paradox to analyze particle trajectories and reveals the time and length scales defining a jump without free parameters. Given its simplicity and generality, our method can be applied to resolve hopping motion in a broad class of systems, including experimental ones.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation of a bilayer composed by amphipathic molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigated the properties of bilayer fluctuations using molecular dynamics. We modeled the amphipathic molecules as a diatomic molecule, constructed a bilayer in the solvent, and observed the Fourier spectrum of its fluctuations. The results showed that $q^4$ behavior was dominant at the high temperature, whereas a crossover from $q^4$ to $q^2$ was observed at the low temperature. This behavior is complementary to the results for monolayer membranes, where $q^2$ behavior was dominant when the interfacial tension was high, whereas a crossover from $q^2$ to $q^4$ was observed when the interfacial tension was lowered~[S. Kikuchi and H. Watanabe, J. Chem. Phys., $\bm{158}$ 12 (2023)]. These results suggest that the restoring force is dominated by elasticity at high temperatures and by interfacial tension at low temperatures. We also observed radial distribution functions to investigate the structure of amphipathic molecules in bilayers. The structure of the amphipathic molecules depends on temperature in the direction horizontal to the interface, while it does not depend on temperature in the direction perpendicular to the interface. This result suggests that bilayers increase fluctuations while maintaining the membrane structure in high temperature.</description>

      <title>Self-similarity in partial differential equations and critical phenomena: renormalization group theory for interfacial hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01793v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-similar dynamics, often described by partial differential equations (PDEs) without noise terms, have been widely observed in nature and have attracted considerable attention from researchers in various fields, including physics, fluid mechanics, applied mathematics, and chemical engineering. The concept of universality class and the renormalization group (RG) theory, emerged from critical phenomena, which also have been widely observed in nature, are pillars of modern physics, with guiding the recent development of physics. While self-similarity appearing in fluid dynamics reminds physicists of critical phenomena, deep connections between them have not been explored. Here, we focus on a variation of a daily phenomenon, a drop falling from a faucet, and demonstrate self-similar dynamics for the shape of liquid-air interface in confined space with a scaling law for a characteristic length scale, which leads to a clear correspondence between the present self-similar dynamics and critical phenomena by identifying critical exponents, which define a universality class. We not only show that the observed master curve describing the self-similar shape is a solution to the Navier-Stokes equations, but also develop a renormalization group (RG) theory for the governing PDE to show the fixed point of RG corresponds to the solution, which becomes stable with time due to a scaling crossover. Our results will impact on our understanding of critical, scaling, and singular behaviors widely observed in nature.</description>

      <title>In-situ tunneling control in photonic potentials by Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tunability of individual coupling amplitudes in photonic lattices is highly desirable for photonic Hamiltonian engineering and for studying topological transitions in situ. In this work, we demonstrate the tunneling control between individual lattice sites patterned inside an optical microcavity. The tuning is achieved by applying a voltage to a liquid crystal microcavity possessing photonic Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling. This type of spin-orbit coupling emerges due to the high birefringence of the liquid crystal material and constitutes an artificial gauge field for photons. The proposed technique can be combined with strong-light matter coupling and non-Hermitian physics already established in liquid crystal microcavities.</description>
