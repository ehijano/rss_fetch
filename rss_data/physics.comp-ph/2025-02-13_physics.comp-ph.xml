      <title>Consistent Solutions of the Radiation Diffusion Equation in Spherical and Cylindrical Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have extended the radiation diffusion model of Hammer and Rosen to diverging spher- ical and cylindrical geometries. The effect of curvilinear geometry on the supersonic, expanding wavefront increases as the internal radius of a spherical or cylindrical shell ap- proaches zero. Small spherical geometries are important for modeling systems at the size scale of ICF capsules, at these scales existing quasi-analytic models for planar geometry significantly disagree with the results of simulation. With this method, the benefits of rapid iteration can be applied to common spherical systems at much smaller length scales. We present comparisons between numerical diffusion solutions and the analytic model to give ranges of applicability for the model.</description>

      <title>Simple demonstration of different types of coupling in multiphysics numerical problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical modelling of coupled multiphysics phenomena is becoming an increasingly important subject in applied mathematics. The main challenge in teaching this subject is the complexity of both the mathematical models and their numerical implementation. In this note, a simple demonstrator is proposed that enables demonstration of and some hands-on experience with three types of coupling commonly used in computational science: one-way coupling, explicit sequential coupling, and full coupling. It makes use of a familiar nonlinear heat equation in 1D, with the solution being a propagating heat wave.</description>

      <title>Building Neutron Stars with the MUSES Calculation Engine</title>

Abstract: Exploring the equation of state of dense matter is an essential part of interpreting the observable properties of neutron stars. We present here the first results for dense matter in the zero-temperature limit generated by the MUSES Calculation Engine, a composable workflow management system that orchestrates calculation and data processing stages comprising a collection of software modules designed within the MUSES framework. The modules presented in this work calculate equations of state using algorithms spanning three different theories/models: (1) Crust Density Functional Theory, valid starting at low densities, (2) Chiral Effective Field Theory, valid around saturation density, and (3) the Chiral Mean Field model, valid beyond saturation density. Lepton contributions are added through the Lepton module to each equation of state, ensuring charge neutrality and the possibility of $\beta$-equilibrium. Using the Synthesis module, we match the three equations of state using different thermodynamic variables and different methods. We then couple the complete equation of state to a novel full-general-relativity solver (QLIMR) module that calculates neutron star properties. We find that the matching performed using different thermodynamic variables affects differently the range obtained for neutron star masses and radii (although never beyond a few percent difference). We also investigate the universality of equation of state-independent relations for our matched stars. Finally, for the first time, we use the Flavor Equilibration module to estimate bulk viscosity and flavor relaxation charge fraction and rates (at low temperature) for Chiral Effective Field Theory and the Chiral Mean Field model.</description>

      <title>Interpretable and Equation-Free Response Theory for Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Response theory provides a pathway for understanding the sensitivity of a system and, more in general, to predict how its statistical properties change as a possibly time-dependent perturbation is applied. Recently discovered general forms of the celebrated Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem allow for expressing response operators as correlation functions of suitably defined observables in the unperturbed state, also when such a state is far from equilibrium. In the case of complex and multiscale systems, to achieved enhanced practical applicability, response theory must be interpretable, capable of focusing of relevant timescales, and amenable to implemented by data-driven approaches that are potentially equation-agnostic. Complex systems typically exhibit a hierarchy of temporal behaviors, and unresolved or undesired timescales can obscure the dominant mechanisms driving macroscopic responses. As an element of this desired framework, in the spirit of Markov state modelling, we propose here a comprehensive analysis of the linear and nonlinear response of Markov chains to general time-dependent perturbations. We obtain simple and easily implementable formulas that can be used to predict the response of observables as well as higher-order correlations of the system. The methodology proposed here can be implemented in a purely data-driven setting and even if we do not know the underlying evolution equations. The use of algebraic expansions inspired by Koopmanism allow to elucidate the role of different time scales and find explicit and interpretable expressions for the Green's functions at all orders. We illustrate our methodology in a very simple yet instructive metastable system. Finally, our results provide a dynamical foundation for the Prony method, which is commonly used for the statistical analysis of discrete time signals.</description>

      <title>Automated Microsolvation for Minimum Energy Path Construction in Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Describing chemical reactions in solution on a molecular level is a challenging task due to the high mobility of weakly interacting solvent molecules which requires configurational sampling. For instance, polar and protic solvents can interact strongly with solutes and may interfere in reactions. However, to define and identify representative arrangements of solvent molecules modulating a transition state is a non-trivial task. Here, we propose to monitor their active participation in the decaying normal mode at a transition state, which defines active solvent molecules. Moreover, it is desirable to prepare a low-dimensional microsolvation model in a well-defined, fully automated, high-throughput, and easy-to-deploy fashion, which we propose to derive in a stepwise protocol. First, transition state structures are optimized in a sufficiently solvated quantum-classical hybrid model, which are then subjected to a re-definition of a then reduced quantum region. From the reduced model, minimally microsolvated structures are extracted that contain only active solvent molecules. Modeling the remaining solvation effects is deferred to a continuum model. To establish an easy-to-use free-energy model, we combine the standard thermochemical gas-phase model with a correction for the cavity entropy in solution. We assess our microsolvation and free-energy models for methanediol formation from formaldehyde, for the hydration of carbon dioxide (which we consider in a solvent mixture to demonstrate the versatility of our approach), and, finally, for the chlorination of phenol with hypochlorous acid.</description>

      <title>Learning Effective Dynamics across Spatio-Temporal Scales of Complex Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling and simulation of complex fluid flows with dynamics that span multiple spatio-temporal scales is a fundamental challenge in many scientific and engineering domains. Full-scale resolving simulations for systems such as highly turbulent flows are not feasible in the foreseeable future, and reduced-order models must capture dynamics that involve interactions across scales. In the present work, we propose a novel framework, Graph-based Learning of Effective Dynamics (Graph-LED), that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs), as well as an attention-based autoregressive model, to extract the effective dynamics from a small amount of simulation data. GNNs represent flow fields on unstructured meshes as graphs and effectively handle complex geometries and non-uniform grids. The proposed method combines a GNN based, dimensionality reduction for variable-size unstructured meshes with an autoregressive temporal attention model that can learn temporal dependencies automatically. We evaluated the proposed approach on a suite of fluid dynamics problems, including flow past a cylinder and flow over a backward-facing step over a range of Reynolds numbers. The results demonstrate robust and effective forecasting of spatio-temporal physics; in the case of the flow past a cylinder, both small-scale effects that occur close to the cylinder as well as its wake are accurately captured.</description>

      <title>Finite difference alternative WENO schemes with Riemann invariant-based local characteristic decompositions for compressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes are widely used for hyperbolic conservation laws due to the ability to resolve discontinuities and maintain high-order accuracy in smooth regions at the same time. For hyperbolic systems, the WENO procedure is usually performed on local characteristic variables that are obtained by local characteristic decompositions to avoid oscillation near shocks. However, such decompositions are often computationally expensive. In this paper, we study a Riemann invariant-based local characteristic decomposition for the compressible Euler equations that reduces the cost. We apply the WENO procedure to the local characteristic fields of the Riemann invariants, where the eigenmatrix is sparse and thus the computational cost can be reduced. It is difficult to obtain the cell averages of Riemann invariants from those of the conserved variables due to the nonlinear relation between them, so we only focus on the finite difference alternative WENO versions. The efficiency and non-oscillatory property of the proposed schemes are well demonstrated by our numerical results.</description>

      <title>The chemisorption thermodynamics of O$_2$ and H$_2$O on AFM UO$_2$ surfaces unraveled by DFT+U-D3 study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unraveling the adsorption mechanism and thermodynamics of O$_2$ and H$_2$O on uranium dioxide surfaces is critical for the nuclear fuel storage and uranium corrosion. Based on the first-principles DFT+U-D3 calculations, we carefully test the effect of antiferromagnetic order arrangements on the thermodynamic stability of UO$_2$ surfaces and propose the 1k AFM surface computational model. The chemisorption states of O$_2$ and H$_2$O on UO$_2$ (111) surface, suggested by previous experiments, are accurately calculated for the first time. The adsorption properties of O$_2$ and H$_2$O on UO$_2$(111) and (110) surfaces are discussed in detail to reveal the different interaction mechanisms. Combined with ab initio atomistic thermodynamics method, we systematically calculate the chemisorption phase diagram and isotherm of O$_2$ and H$_2$O on UO$_2$ surfaces. Due to the different intermolecular interactions, the monolayer and multilayer adsorption models are identified for O$_2$ and H$_2$O, respectively. This study has comprehensively revealed the different adsorption mechanisms of O$_2$ and H$_2$O on UO$_2$ surfaces, bridging the electronic structure calculations to the interpretation of experimental results and providing a solid foundation for future theoretical studies of uranium corrosion mechanism in humid air.</description>

      <title>A numerical method for low Mach number compressible flows by simultaneous relaxation of dependent variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density varies spatiotemporally in low Mach number flows. Hence, incompressibility cannot be assumed, and the density must be accurately solved. Various methods have been proposed to analyze low Mach number flows, but their energy conservation properties have not been investigated in detail. This study proposes a new method for simultaneously relaxing velocity, pressure, density, and internal energy using a conservative finite difference scheme with excellent energy conservation properties to analyze low Mach number flows. In the analysis for sound wave propagation in an inviscid compressible flow, the amplitude amplification ratio and frequency of sound wave obtained by this numerical method agree well with the theoretical values. In the analysis for a three-dimensional periodic inviscid compressible flow, each total amount for the momentum, total energy, and entropy are discretely conserved. When no approximation, such as low Mach number approximations, is applied to the fundamental equations, the excellent conservation properties of momentum, total energy, and entropy are achieved. In decaying compressible isotropic turbulence, this computational method can capture turbulence fluctuations. Analyzing the Taylor-Green decaying vortex, we confirmed the validity of this computational scheme for compressible viscous flows. In the calculation for the natural convection in a cavity, the validity of this numerical method was presented even in incompressible flows considering density variation. In a three-dimensional Taylor decaying vortex problem, it was shown that this numerical method can accurately calculate incompressible flows. We clarified the accuracy and validity of the present numerical method by analyzing various flow models and demonstrated the possibility of applying this method to complex flow fields.</description>

Abstract: The pertinent need for microscopic understanding of magnetic exchange motivated us to go beyond the existing theories and develop a systematic method to quantify all possible mechanisms that contribute to magnetic exchange for an arbitrary pair of atoms in a given material. We apply it to the archetypal 2D magnetic monolayers CrI3 and NiI2, to reveal the previously underrated dx2-y2,dx2-y2 contribution as either the leading or the second largest contribution to the total magnetic exchange. We proceed to explore the microscopic mechanisms behind all the non-zero orbital contributions in both CrI3 and NiI2, and generalize the findings to other magnetic monolayers dominated by d8 and d3 electronic configurations of the magnetic atoms.</description>

      <title>Dendrite suppression in fast-charging high-energy metal-ion batteries: a Bayesian optimization approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal anodes provide the highest possible energy density in batteries. However, challenges associated with electrode/electrolyte interface side reactions and dendrite growth remain unsolved, especially under fast-charging conditions. In this paper, we consider a phase-field model of electrodeposition and optimize its parameters for suppressing dendrite growth and accelerating charging speed under constant voltage. We identify interfacial mobility as a key parameter, which should be maximized to inhibit dendrites without compromising the charging speed. The proposed approach provides a versatile tool for designing battery cells by optimizing an arbitrary objective function using an arbitrary set of parameters. This approach is based on Bayesian optimization and explores the parameters space with a high sample efficiency and a low computation complexity. The results are verified using extended simulations of dendrite evolution in charging half cells with lithium-metal anodes.</description>

      <title>CO2 Hydration at the Air-Water Interface: A Surface-Mediated 'In and Out' Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An understanding of the CO2 + H2O hydration reaction is crucial for modeling the effects of ocean acidification, for enabling novel carbon storage solutions, and as a model process in the geosciences. While the mechanism of this reaction has been investigated extensively in the condensed phase, its mechanism at the air-water interface remains elusive, leaving uncertain the contribution that surface-adsorbed CO2 makes to the overall acidification reaction. In this study, we employ state-of-the-art machine-learned potentials to provide a molecular-level understanding of CO2 hydration at the air-water interface. We show that reaction at the interface follows a surface-mediated `In and Out' mechanism: CO2 diffuses into the aqueous surface layer, reacts to form carbonic acid, and is subsequently expelled from solution. We show that this surface layer provides a bulk-like solvation environment, engendering similar modes of reactivity and near-identical free energy profiles for the bulk and interfacial processes. Our study unveils a new, unconventional reaction mechanism that underscores the dynamic nature of the molecular reaction site at the air-water interface. The similarity between bulk and interfacial profiles shows that CO2 hydration is equally as feasible under these two solvation environments and that acidification rates are likely enhanced by this additional surface contribution.</description>

Abstract: Computer simulations have long been key to understanding and designing phase-change materials (PCMs) for memory technologies. Machine learning is now increasingly being used to accelerate the modelling of PCMs, and yet it remains challenging to simultaneously reach the length and time scales required to simulate the operation of real-world PCM devices. Here, we show how ultra-fast machine-learned interatomic potentials, based on the atomic cluster expansion (ACE) framework, enable simulations of PCMs reflecting applications in devices with excellent scalability on high-performance computing platforms. We report full-cycle simulations -- including the time-consuming crystallisation process (from digital "zeroes" to "ones") -- thus representing the entire programming cycle for cross-point memory devices. We also showcase a simulation of full-cycle operations, relevant to neuromorphic computing, in a mushroom-type device geometry. Our work provides a springboard for the atomistic modelling of PCM-based memory and neuromorphic computing devices -- and, more widely, it illustrates the power of highly efficient ACE ML models for materials science and engineering.</description>

Abstract: D-Wave quantum annealers offer reverse annealing as a feature allowing them to refine solutions to optimization problems. This paper investigates the influence of key parameters, such as annealing times and reversal distance, on the behavior of reverse annealing by studying models containing up to 1000 qubits. Through the analysis of theoretical models and experimental data, we explore the interplay between quantum and classical processes. Our findings provide a deeper understanding that can better equip users to fully harness the potential of the D-Wave annealers</description>

      <title>Constructing optimal Wannier functions via potential theory: isolated single band for matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a rapidly convergent scheme for computing globally optimal Wannier functions of isolated single bands for matrix models in two dimensions. The scheme proceeds first by constructing provably exponentially localized Wannier functions directly from parallel transport (with simple analytically computable corrections) when topological obstruction is absent. We prove that the corresponding Wannier functions are real when the matrix model possesses time-reversal symmetry. When a band has nonzero Berry curvature, the resulting Wannier function is not optimal, but it is transformed into the global optimum by a single gauge transformation that eliminates the divergence of the Berry connection. Complete analysis of the construction is presented, paving the way for further improvements and generalization. The performance of the scheme is illustrated with several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>twoPhaseInterTrackFoam: an OpenFOAM module for Arbitrary Lagrangian/Eulerian Interface Tracking with Surfactants and Subgrid-Scale Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an implementation of the unstructured Finite-Volume Arbitrary Lagrangian / Eulerian (ALE) Interface-Tracking method for simulating incompressible, immiscible two-phase flows as an OpenFOAM module. In addition to interface-tracking capabilities that include tracking of two fluid phases, an implementation of a Subgrid-Scale (SGS) modeling framework for increased accuracy when simulating sharp boundary layers is enclosed. The SGS modeling framework simplifies embedding subgrid-scale profiles into the unstructured Finite Volume discretization. Our design of the SGS model library significantly simplifies adding new SGS models and applying SGS modeling to Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) in OpenFOAM.</description>

      <title>Closure Discovery for Coarse-Grained Partial Differential Equations Using Grid-based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliable predictions of critical phenomena, such as weather, wildfires and epidemics often rely on models described by Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, simulations that capture the full range of spatio-temporal scales described by such PDEs are often prohibitively expensive. Consequently, coarse-grained simulations are usually deployed that adopt various heuristics and empirical closure terms to account for the missing information. We propose a novel and systematic approach for identifying closures in under-resolved PDEs using grid-based Reinforcement Learning. This formulation incorporates inductive bias and exploits locality by deploying a central policy represented efficiently by a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN). We demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of our framework through numerical solutions of the advection equation and the Burgers' equation. Our results show accurate predictions for in- and out-of-distribution test cases as well as a significant speedup compared to resolving all scales.</description>
