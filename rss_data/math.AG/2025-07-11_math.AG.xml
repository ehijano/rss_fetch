      <title>Spectral Fingerprints of Algebraic Cycles on K3 Surfaces: A Hodge-Theoretic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework, the "Spectral Fingerprint Philosophy," for extracting intrinsic algebraic information from Hodge cycles, particularly divisors, on K3 surfaces. We depart from traditional geometric spectral analysis, which relies on the Laplace-Beltrami operator and faces significant computational challenges for Ricci-flat Kahler metrics. Instead, we leverage the powerful machinery of Hodge theory, variation of Hodge structures (VHS), and arithmetic geometry. We demonstrate how the "spectral fingerprint" of an algebraic cycle on a K3 surface is encoded in the algebraic coefficients of the Picard-Fuchs differential equations that govern the surface's periods. Furthermore, this fingerprint is also found in the arithmetic properties of these periods themselves, which frequently manifest as Fourier coefficients of automorphic forms on the moduli space of K3 surfaces. We provide theoretical proofs for these foundational claims, grounding the philosophy in established mathematical results. Through a preliminary exploration of genus-2 Riemann surfaces, utilizing the Frobenius endomorphism as an "arithmetic spectral operator," and a detailed case study of Kummer K3 surfaces, we present concrete results. These results illustrate how algebraic cycles lead to specific, algebraically defined constraints on this "spectrum," thereby offering a new perspective on the Hodge Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Non-algebraicity of foliations via reduction modulo $2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the Jouanolou foliation problem, we investigate the non-algebraicity of foliations by curves on $\mathbb{P}^2_{\mathbb{C}}$. We present a criterion to show that such a foliation has no algebraic invariant curves, using a method of reduction modulo $2$. Finally, using this criterion, we give a new proof that the Jouanolou foliation of odd degree has no algebraic invariant curves. We also present other classes of foliations without algebraic invariant curves.</description>

      <title>Intersections of the automorphism and the Ekedahl-Oort strata in $M_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the intersections between the automorphism strata and the pullback by the Torelli map of the Ekedahl-Oort strata inside the moduli space of genus two curves. We first describe explicitly which possible automorphism groups a genus two curve can have over a field of positive characteristic, and parametrise the families of curves with a prescribed automorphism group. Then, we describe an algorithm to compute the strata of genus two curves whose Jacobian variety has a fixed Ekedahl-Oort type. Finally, we compute the dimension and number of irreducible components of the intersections between the strata.</description>

      <title>Orbifold Saito theory of A and D type singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Saito theory associates to an isolated singularity rich structure that plays an important role in mirror symmetry. In this note we construct Saito theory for A and D type Landau--Ginzburg orbifolds. Namely, for the pairs $(f,G)$, where $f$ defines an isolated singularity of A and D type and $G$ is a group of symmetries of $f$. In total we consider five families of such pairs. In particular, we construct the orbifold versions of Brieskorn lattice and the Gauss--Manin connection computing them explicitly for the A and D type Landau--Ginzburg orbifolds.</description>

      <title>The $\mathcal{D}$-Geometric Hilbert Scheme -- Part I: Involutivity and Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a moduli space of formally integrable and involutive ideal sheaves arising from systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) in the algebro-geometric setting, by introducing the $\mathcal{D}$-Hilbert and $\mathcal{D}$-Quot functors in the sense of Grothendieck and establishing their representability. Central to this construction is the notion of Spencer (semi-)stability, which presents an extension of classical stability conditions from gauge theory and complex geometry, and which provides the boundedness needed for our moduli problem. As an application, we show that for flat connections on compact K\"ahler manifolds, Spencer poly-stability of the associated PDE ideal is equivalent to the existence of a Hermitian-Yang-Mills metric. This result provides a refinement of the classical Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau correspondence, and identifies Spencer cohomology and stability as a unifying framework for geometric PDEs.</description>

      <title>Spectral networks for polynomial cubic differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study cubic differentials and their spectral networks on Riemann surfaces, focusing on the polynomial case on the Riemann sphere. We introduce the notion of spectral core as the primary tool for our study, refining the classical notion of core in the theory of flat surfaces, and show that it controls the birthing process of spectral network trajectories. As an application, we completely characterize the polynomial cubic differentials having saddle connections or critical tripods when the degree $d$ is at most $3$; in particular, we obtain the relevant degenerations as the phase is varied and determine explicitly the wall-and-chamber structure. In this case, we obtain the BPS structure according to Gaiotto-Moore-Neitzke's algorithm, and verify that it satisfies the Kontsevich-Soibelman wall-crossing formula. In physics language, this corresponds to computing the BPS spectrum of a certain four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ quantum field theory, known as the $(A_{2},A_{d-1})$ generalized Argyres-Douglas theory.</description>

Abstract: We prove the Pierce--Birkhoff conjecture for splines, i.e., continuous piecewise polynomials of degree $d$ in $n$ variables on a hyperplane partition of $\mathbb{R}^n$, can be written as a finite lattice combination of polynomials. We will provide a purely existential proof, followed by a more in-depth analysis that yields effective bounds.</description>

      <title>The Geometric P=W conjecture and Thurston's compactification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive an explicit formula for a well-known embedding of the set of isotopy classes of multicurves on a closed surface of genus $g$ into $\mathbb{N}^{9g - 9}$. More significantly, we relate this result and established facts about Thurston's compactification of Teichm\"uller space to the geometric P = W conjecture for $\tn{SL}(2,\C)$, which concerns projective compactifications of character varieties of closed surfaces. In particular, we construct a projective compactification of the $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$-character variety for any closed surface of genus $g &gt; 1$, in which the boundary divisors are toric orbifolds and their dual intersection complex is a sphere.</description>

      <title>Linearizing Algebraic Matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although algebraic matroids were discovered in the 1930s, interest in them was largely dormant until their recent use in applications of algebraic geometry. Because nonlinear algebra is computationally challenging, it is easier to work with an isomorphic linear matroid if one exists. We describe an explicit construction that produces a linear representation over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero starting with the data used in applications. We will also discuss classical examples of algebraic matroids in the modern language of polynomial ideals, illustrating how the existence of an isomorphic linear matroid depends on properties of the field.</description>

      <title>A co-operational bivariant theory derived from cohomology operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A co-operational bivariant theory is a ``dual" version of Fulton--MacPherson's operational bivaiant theory.
  For a given contravariant functor we define a generalized cohomology operation for continuous maps having sections, using cohomology operations. This generalized cohomology operation is related to Quillen's Steenrod power operation. Using this generalized cohomology operation, we define \emph{a co-operational bivariant theory derived from cohomology operations},
  which is a subtheory of the co-operational bivariant theory associated to the contravariant functor.</description>

      <title>The Seshadri Constants of Tangent Sheaves on Toric Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.17172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Seshadri constant $\varepsilon(X,T_X;p)$ of the tangent sheaf $T_X$ on a complete $\mathbb Q$-factorial toric variety $X$. We show that $\varepsilon(X,T_X;1)&gt;0$ if and only if the following statement holds true: if $a_1v_1+\cdots +a_kv_k=0$ where $a_i$'s are positive real numbers and $v_i$'s are primitive generators of some rays in the fan $\Delta$ that defines $X$, then $k\geq \dim X+1$. Based on the result, we show that a smooth projective toric variety $X$ with $\varepsilon(X,T_X;p)&gt;0$ for some $p\in X$ is isomorphic to the projective space, confirming a special case of the conjecture proposed by M. Fulger and T. Murayama.</description>

      <title>Affine Deligne-Lusztig Varieties of Positive Coxeter Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02630v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a class of elements of the Iwahori-Weyl group of a reductive group that we call positive Coxeter type elements. This class consists of elements which are linked to partial Coxeter elements in the finite Weyl group in a certain canonical way, extending the more restrictive notion of finite Coxeter part previously introduced by He-Nie-Yu. We show that the affine Deligne-Lusztig varieties associated with such elements have a very simple and explicitly described geometric structure. Conversely, we explain how some of these geometric properties can be used to characterize elements of positive Coxeter type.</description>

      <title>Hodge structures on conformal blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove existence and uniqueness of complex Hodge structures on modular functors. The proof is based on the non-Abelian Hodge correspondence and Ocneanu rigidity. Given a modular functor, we explain how its Hodge numbers fit into a Frobenius algebra and the Chern characters of its Hodge decompositions into a new cohomological field theory (CohFT). In the case of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ modular functors of level $2$ times an odd number, we give explicit formulas for all Hodge numbers, in any genus $g$.</description>

      <title>Automatic meromorphy in non-archimedean geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20915v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this text we prove that if X is a reduced non-archimedean analytic space and f is a analytic function on a dense Zariski-open subspace of X whose zero-locus is closed in X, then f is a meromorphic function on X. As a corollary, we deduce that every invertible analytic function on the analytification of a reduced scheme of finite type over an affinoid algebra is algebraic.</description>

      <title>K-stablity of Fano threefold hypersurfaces of index 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We settle the problem of K-stability of quasi-smooth Fano 3-fold hypersurfaces with Fano index 1 by providing lower bounds for their delta invariants. We use the method introduced by Abban and Zhuang for computing lower bounds of delta invariants on flags of hypersurfaces in the Fano 3-fold.</description>

      <title>The $\mathcal{D}$-Geometric Hilbert Scheme -- Part II: Hilbert and Quot DG-Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the second in a series of two papers developing a moduli-theoretic framework for differential ideal sheaves associated with formally integrable, involutive systems of algebraic partial differential equations (PDEs). Building on earlier work, which established the existence of moduli stacks for such systems with prescribed regularity and stability conditions, we now construct a derived enhancement of these moduli spaces. We prove the derived $\mathcal{D}$-Quot functor admits a global differential graded refinement representable by a suitable differential graded $\mathcal{D}$-manifold. We further analyze the finiteness, representability, and functoriality properties of these derived moduli spaces, establishing foundations for a derived deformation theory of algebraic differential equations.</description>

      <title>Maximal Curves With Respect To Quadratic Extensions Over Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a detailed study of a canonical bound which relates the numbers of rational points of a curve over a finite field with that over its quadratic extension. Alternative proofs which relate to the variance enable to complete the inequality in a symmetrical way and to obtain optimal refinements. We focus on the curves reaching the bound, which we call Diophantine-maximal curves. We provide different characterizations and stress natural links with the curves which attain the Ihara bound. As consequences, we establish the list of such curves with low genus and we outline a maximality result which involves the Suzuki curves.  At last we determine which polynomials correspond to the Jacobian of a Diophantine-maximal curve of genus 2.</description>

      <title>Bourbaki modules and the module of Jacobian derivations of projective hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two properties of projective hypersurfaces related to the module of Jacobian derivations, namely being tame and being plus-one generated, are discussed in this paper. Tame hypersurfaces are related to Bourbaki ideals, and free hypersurfaces are the simplest examples of tame hypersurfaces. Plus-one generated hypersurfaces are the non free hypersurfaces which are closest to the free ones, and it is an open question whether all of them are tame.</description>

      <title>Singularities of orbit closures in loop spaces of symmetric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20006v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the singularities of closures of Iwahori orbits on loop spaces of symmetric varieties extending the celebrated work of Lusztig-Vogan to the affine setting. We show that the IC-complexes of orbit closures (with possible non-trivial coefficients) are pointwise pure and satisfy a parity vanishing property. We apply those geometric results to study the affine Lusztig-Vogan modules and obtain fundational results about them including the positivity properties of the affine Kazhdan-Lusztig-Vogan polynomials. Along the way, we construct conical transversal slices inside loop spaces of symmetric varieties generalizing the work of Mars-Springer in the finite dimensional setting. Our results answer a question of Lusztig.
  We deduce results for singularities of spherical orbit closures and provide applications to relative Langlands duality including the positivity for the relative Kostka-Foulkes polynomials and the formality conjecture.</description>

      <title>Hochschild (Co)homology of D-modules on rigid analytic spaces II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth $p$-adic Stein space with free tangent sheaf. We use the notion of Hochschild cohomology for sheaves of Ind-Banach algebras developed in our previous work to study the Hochschild cohomology of the algebra of infinite order differential operators $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap. In particular, we show that the Hochschild cohomology complex of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap is a strict complex of nuclear Fr\'echet spaces which is quasi-isomorphic to the de Rham complex of $X$. We then use this to compare the first Hochschild cohomology group of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap with a wide array of Ext functors. Finally, we investigate the relation of the Hochschild cohomology of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap with the deformation theory of $\mathcal{D}_X(X)$-cap. Assuming some finiteness conditions on the de Rham cohomology of $X$, we define explicit isomorphisms between the first Hochschild cohomology group of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap and the space of bounded outer derivations of $\mathcal{D}_X(X)$-cap, and between the second Hochschild cohomology group of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap and the space of infinitesimal deformations of $\mathcal{D}_X(X)$-cap.</description>
