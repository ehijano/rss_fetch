      <title>Stopping Dark Mesons in Their Tracks with Long-Lived Particle and Resonant Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark sectors with confining gauge interactions can provide both simple dark matter candidates and striking signals at colliders. We recast Large Hadron Collider searches for two different signatures of dark mesons that arise from a strongly-coupled theory with vector-like dark quarks that are in some non-trivial representation of Standard Model SU(2)$_L$. For any such electroweak representation, there is a 3-plet of dark mesons whose charged components are long-lived, and we reinterpret searches for disappearing tracks to place a lower bound on their mass of $\sim 1.2$ TeV. When the dark quarks are in SU(2)$_L$ representations larger than the fundamental, there is also a 5-plet of dark mesons that interacts with the electroweak gauge bosons via a chiral anomaly. We show that the 5-plet is the unique non-trivial meson multiplet with this anomaly and recast searches for the resulting diboson resonances to place bounds on model parameters. With additional measurements, the anomaly also enables one to reconstruct some ultraviolet parameters (the numbers of dark flavors and colors) while only measuring states in the infrared. Each of these signals represents an exciting opportunity for future searches using higher luminosity.</description>

      <title>INTEGRAL, eROSITA and Voyager Constraints on Light Bosonic Dark Matter: ALPs, Dark Photons, Scalars, $B-L$ and $L_{i}-L_{j}$ Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decay of light bosonic dark matter particles can produce a bright electron/positron ($e^+e^-$) flux that can be strongly constrained by local Voyager observations of the direct $e^+e^-$ flux, as well as 511 keV Line and X-ray continuum observations of $e^+e^-$ emission. We carefully analyze the $e^+e^-$ yield and resulting cosmic-ray and X-ray spectra from theoretically well-motivated light dark matter models, including: (a) electrophilic axion-like particles, (b) dark photons, (c) scalars, and (d) $B-L$ and $L_{i}-L_{j}$ vector bosons. We use the morphology and spectrum of the INTEGRAL 511 keV line data, the eROSITA X-ray continuum spectrum and the Voyager $e^+e^-$ spectrum to constrain the decay lifetime and coupling of each dark matter model. We find that 511 keV observations typically set world-leading limits on bosonic dark matter decay below masses of $\sim$1 GeV, while eROSITA observations provide the strongest constraints in the range from 1--10 GeV. Finally, we forecast future limits from 21 cm line searches with next-generation HERA data.</description>

      <title>CP violation in $K\to\mu^+\mu^-$ with and without time dependence through a tagged analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out that using current knowledge of ${\cal B}(K^0_L\to\mu^+\mu^-)$ and $ {\cal B}(K^0_L\to \gamma\gamma)$, one can extract short-distance information from the combined measurement of the time-integrated CP asymmetry, $A_{\rm CP}(K^0\to\mu^+\mu^-)$, and of ${\cal B}(K^0_S\to\mu^+\mu^-)$. We discuss the interplay between this set of observables, and demonstrate that determining ${\rm sign}[A_{\rm CP}(K^0\to\mu^+\mu^-)]$ would eliminate the discrete ambiguity in the Standard Model prediction for ${\cal B}(K^0_L\to\mu^+\mu^-)$. We then move on to feasibility studies within an LHCb-like setup, using both time-integrated and time-dependent information, employing $K^0$ and $\overline K{}^0$ tagging methods. We find that, within an optimistic scenario, the short-distance amplitude, proportional to the CKM parameter combination $|A^2\lambda^5\bar\eta|$, could be constrained by LHCb at the level of about $35\%$ of its Standard Model value, and the discrete ambiguity in ${\cal B}(K^0_L\to\mu^+\mu^-)_{\rm SM}$ could be resolved at more than $3\sigma$ by the end of the high luminosity LHC.</description>

      <title>Theory-informed neural networks for particle physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theory-informed reinforcement-learning framework that recasts the combinatorial assignment of final-state particles in hadron collider events as a Markov decision process. A transformer-based Deep Q-Network, rewarded at each step by the logarithmic change in the tree-level matrix element, learns to map final-state particles to partons. Because the reward derives solely from first-principles theory, the resulting policy is label-free and fully interpretable, allowing every reconstructed particle to be traced to a definite partonic origin. The method is validated on event reconstruction for $t\bar{t}$, $t\bar{t}W$, and $t\bar{t}t\bar{t}$ processes at the Large Hadron Collider. The method maintains robust performance across all processes, demonstrating its scaling with increasing combinatorial complexity. We demonstrate how this method can be used to build a theory-informed classifier for effective discrimination of longitudinal $W^{+}W^{-}$ pairs, and show that we can construct theory-informed anomaly-detection tools using background process matrix elements. Building on theoretical calculations, this method offers a transparent alternative to black-box classifiers. Being built on the matrix element, the classification and anomaly scores naturally respect all physical symmetries and are much less susceptible to the implicit biases common to other methods. Thus, it provides a framework for precision measurements, hypothesis testing, and anomaly searches at the High-Luminosity LHC.</description>

      <title>Quark + Diquark Description of Nucleon Elastic Electromagnetic Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Working with a Poincar\'e-covariant quark + diquark, $q(qq)$, Faddeev equation approach to nucleon structure, a refined symmetry preserving current for electron + nucleon elastic scattering is developed. The parameters in the interaction current are chosen to ensure that the $q(qq)$ picture reproduces selected results from contemporary $3$-body analyses of nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors. Although the subset of fitted results is small, the $q(qq)$ picture reproduces almost all the $3$-body predictions and often results in better agreement with available data. Notably, the $q(qq)$ framework predicts a zero in $G_E^p/G_M^p$, the absence of such a zero in $G_E^n/G_M^n$, and a zero in the proton's $d$-quark Dirac form factor. Derived $q(qq)$ results for proton flavour-separated light-front-transverse number and anomalous magnetisation densities are also discussed. With the $q(qq)$ framework thus newly benchmarked, one may proceed to comparisons with a broader array of $3$-body results. This may enable new steps to be made toward answering an important question, viz. is the quark + fully-interacting diquark picture of baryon structure only a useful phenomenology or does it come close to expressing robust features of baryon structure?</description>

      <title>$\pi^0\rightarrow 2\gamma$ decay under strong magnetic fields in the NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the anomalous $\pi^0 \to \gamma\gamma$ decay under an external uniform magnetic field in the framework of a two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. It is seen that the full decay width gets strongly reduced with the external field, and that the differential width is almost independent of thedirection of the outgoing photons. We also find that the result for the total width can be very well approximated by a simple expression obtained at the lowest order in the chiral limit, which is just a direct extension to finite magnetic fields of the well known $B=0$ result that follows from the anomalous Wess-Zumino-Witten action. As a result, the magnetic suppression of the width can be understood in terms of the evolution of both the neutral pion mass and decay constant with the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Range of topological fluctuations in the three-flavor linear sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological charge density two-point function is computed in a three-flavor effective linear meson model, including contributions from topological sectors with arbitrary charge. A corresponding composite field is introduced via a Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. In the $\eta$-$\eta$' sector, the model yields very accurate spectroscopy with negligible mixing with the composite field. The resulting topological susceptibility allows for the extraction of a surprisingly large absolute scale for the range of topological fluctuations. When compared with various QCD-based estimates, this indirectly suggests the dominance of higher topologically charged configurations in the ground state.</description>

      <title>Gluon Wigner distributions with transverse polarization at non-zero skewness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the gluon Wigner distributions at non-zero skewness using light-front wave functions (LFWFs) in the dressed quark model, where the target state is a quark dressed with a gluon in the leading-order Fock space expansion. The analysis is for the configurations where either the gluon or the target is transversely polarized. We construct the Wigner distributions in a boost-invariant longitudinal space, characterized by the variable $\sigma=\frac{1}{2}b^-P^+$, which is conjugate to the skewness parameter $\xi$. We observe a diffraction-like pattern in $\sigma-$ space, reminiscent of the single-slit interference phenomenon in optics, highlighting quantum interference effects in the gluon phase-space distribution.</description>

      <title>The equation of state and surface tension of QCD in the first order phase transition region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build up a complete description of QCD phase structure by applying the parametrization of the chiral and deconfinement order parameters upon the calculations from functional QCD approaches. In particular in the first order phase transition region at high chemical potential, both the phase transition line using Maxwell construction and the coexistence boundary lines from the spinodal decompostion are determined. We compute the thermodynamic quantities including the number density, the energy density, the pressure and also the free energy for both stable and unstable phases of QCD. Additionally, after applying a phenomenological description of the inhomogeneity of the QCD free energy, we obtain the surface tension of the first order phase transition of QCD.</description>

      <title>Triply heavy tetraquarks $\bar{b}c\bar{q}c$ and $\bar{c}b\bar{q}b$ in a constituent quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systematic investigation of $S$-wave triply heavy tetraquark systems with quark content $\bar{b}c\bar{q}c$ and $\bar{c}b\bar{q}b$ $(q = u,\,d,\,s)$, spin-parity quantum numbers $J^P=0^+$, $1^+$, $2^+$ and isospin $I=0,\,\frac{1}{2}$, is carried out within the constituent quark model framework. The four-body bound and resonance states are determined by solving the Schr\"odinger equation employing the high-precision and efficient Gaussian Expansion Method (GEM) in conjunction with the powerful Complex Scaling Method (CSM). Besides, a comprehensive coupled-channel analysis of the $S$-wave tetraquark systems is performed, taking into account meson-meson, diquark-antidiquark and K-type configurations, as well as all allowed color structures. Several narrow resonant states are identified in each $I(J^P)$ channel. In particular, resonances for the $\bar{b}c\bar{q}c$ system are found in the mass range of $8.87-9.36$ GeV, while those for the $\bar{c}b\bar{q}b$ system lie between $12.13-12.45$ GeV. Most of the predicted resonances are compact tetraquark states with sizes smaller than $1.0$ fm, although four states exhibit more extended structures with sizes around $1.3$ fm, suggesting a more loosely bound nature. Magnetic moments and dominant wave function components of these exotic states are also analyzed. The results indicate that K-type configurations play a major role in the structure of the observed resonances. Finally, possible strong decay channels (golden modes) for these states are theoretically proposed.</description>

      <title>Form factors and phenomenology of $\boldsymbol{B_{(s)}}$ and $\boldsymbol{D_{(s)}}$ semileptonic decays to $\boldsymbol{\eta}$ and $\boldsymbol{\eta^\prime}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by more precise recent measurements of the $B \to \eta \ell \nu$ and $D_{(s)} \to \eta^{(\prime)}\ell \nu$ decays, we employ state-of-the-art parametrizations to describe the $B_{(s)}, D_{(s)} \to \eta^{(\prime)}$ form factors across the full $q^2$ range, fitting them to the latest light-cone sum rule results. Using these results, we compute the branching ratios for all relevant decays and compare them with experimental data, finding good agreement. Additionally, we examine the validity and precision of the extracted $\eta$-$\eta'$ mixing angle in the context of heavy meson decays. By combining our predictions for the $B, D, D_s \to \eta^{(\prime)}$ form factors with recent semileptonic decay measurements, we extract the CKM elements $|V_{ub}|$, $|V_{cs}|$, and $|V_{cd}|$. Our findings indicate that the extracted values are becoming comparable in precision to those obtained from more conventional semileptonic decay analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first review the theoretical and experimental studies of the process $\Lambda_c^+ \to \pi^+ \eta \Lambda$. Motivated by the recent BESIII and Belle measurements, we have conducted a theoretical study of the process $\Lambda_c^+ \to \pi^+ \eta \Lambda$, where the $a_0(980)$ and $\Lambda(1670)$ resonances are dynamically generated from the $S$-wave meson meson and meson baryon interaction, respectively. Our results give a reasonable description of the invariant mass distributions, which implies that the spin flip contribution in the $\Sigma(1385)$ excitation plays an important role.</description>

      <title>Charged lepton flavor violating decays with a pair of light dark matter and muonium invisible decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we initiate the study of lepton flavor violating (LFV) dark matter (DM) interactions, expanding our focus beyond the flavor-conserving DM interactions typically considered in conventional direct and indirect detections. We work on an effective field theory (EFT) framework, focusing on the leading-order local operators of the form, $\bar \ell_j \Gamma \ell_i\,{\tt DM}^2$, where $(ij)=(e\mu, e\tau, \mu\tau)$ and the DM includes the three well-known scenarios: a scalar, a fermion, and a vector. We derive the invariant-mass distribution for the three-body decay $\ell_i \to \ell_j +{\tt DM+DM}$ and demonstrate that it can be used to distinguish between different operator structures and to determine the DM mass. By utilizing current experimental bounds on the charged LFV decays involving neutrinos or single invisible particles, we establish stringent limits on the effective scale associated with each operator. Additionally, for the $e\mu$ flavor combination, we investigate the muon four-body radiative decay ($\mu\to e +{\tt DM+DM}+\gamma$) to complement our probe of such interactions. Finally, we examine muonium invisible decays based on the derived bounds on the effective operators and find that the branching ratios can be significantly enhanced compared to the predictions of the standard model. In particular, any future observation of the para-muonium invisible decay serves as a compelling signature for these flavored DM interactions.</description>

      <title>$\Upsilon(5S)$ in the unquenched quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of the $\Upsilon(10753)$ state by Belle II Collaboration has sparked significant interest in the theoretical understanding of such states within the context of hadron physics. Considering the similar mass and the decay with, as well as the same quantum numbers $J^{PC}=1^{--}$ with the $\Upsilon(10860)$ state, which is referred to be the $\Upsilon(5S)$ in PDG, in this work, we try to calculate the mass of the $\Upsilon(5S)$ state. The model used to predict the high-energy spectrum of these states generally involves a constituent quark model, which can describe a variety of properties of hadrons containing heavy quarks. In the framework of the unquenched quark model, a coupled-channel calculation is employed to explore the effect of open-bottom meson-meson thresholds on the $\Upsilon(10860)$ state. The hypothesis is that coupled-channel effects could be large enough to create new dynamically generated states, thus potentially explaining the nature of the $\Upsilon(10860)$ state, as well as whether the $\Upsilon(10860)$ and $\Upsilon(10753)$ is the same state. The results indicate that unquenched effects play a crucial role in explaining the $\Upsilon(10860)$ state, providing a plausible mechanism for its formation.

      <title>Freeze-in gravitational waves and dark matter in warm inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent study[1] has suggested that warm inflation may be realized with Standard Model gauge interaction alone. Motivated by this framework, we investigate the gravitational wave spectrum and graviton-portal dark matter production through the freeze-in process generated during warm inflation scenarios. We perform a comparative analysis for different dissipation terms, focusing on their distinct gravitational wave signatures in the high-frequency regime. Our findings reveal qualitative and quantitative differences in the spectral behavior, offering a preliminary pathway for discriminating among various inflationary and dark matter models through high-frequency gravitational wave signals.</description>

      <title>Probing dark-state electromagnetic form factors at future linear electron-positron colliders with polarized beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the electromagnetic form factors of electrically neutral dark-sector particles in this paper. Concretely speaking, we focus on operators that can lead to interactions of fermionic dark states with the Standard-Model (SM) photon, including both dimension-5 (the magnetic and electric dipole moments) and dimension-6 (the anapole moment and charge radius) operators. Correspondingly, instead of the SM-photon form factors, we employ hypercharge gauge-field form factors that can induce additional couplings to the SM $Z$-boson. Utilizing the mono-photon production channel at future linear electron-positron colliders, the International Linear Collider (ILC) and the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC), we demonstrate that tuning beam polarization allows for simultaneous enhancement of signal-event rates and suppression of dominant SM background events, i.e. neutrino-induced processes, and hence improvement of sensitivity reach. Our analysis reveals that ILC and CLIC can probe electromagnetic form factors of dark-sector particles up to about two orders of magnitude beyond existing experimental limits.</description>

      <title>Neutron emission associated with $\gamma\gamma\to\gamma\gamma$ scattering in UPC of heavy ions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate cross sections for the production of different neutron classes $0n 0n$, $0nXn+Xn0n$ and $Xn Xn$, possible to measure in Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDCs), associated with photon-photon scattering in UPC of lead on lead. The calculations are performed for the ATLAS kinematics. Our calculations for neutron classes are tested against existing data for $\rho^0$ production in UPC. We get a good agreement for absolute cross section as well as very good results for fractional cross section which gives confidence to the analogous calculation for diphoton production, corresponding to $\gamma \gamma \to \gamma \gamma$ scattering. We present both absolute as well as fractional cross sections for the different neutron classes. We also show different distributions in impact parameter, photon rapidity, transverse momentum, diphoton invariant mass and photon rapidity difference. The shapes of the photon distributions depend on the neutron classes which we quantify in this paper. It would be valuable to test our predictions using the ATLAS main detector and the ATLAS ZDCs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the impact of the anomalous magnetic moment (AMM) of Dirac fermions on the fermionic Casimir effect under magnetic fields. We formulate it as an extension of the well-known Lifshitz formula. From our formula, we find that the AMM increases the fermionic Casimir energy. In particular, when the AMM is large enough, the Casimir energy is significantly enhanced by the gapless behavior of the lowest Landau level. We also quantitatively estimate the Casimir energy from electron, muon, and constituent quark fields under magnetic fields and propose possible phenomena at finite temperature and fermion density.</description>

      <title>Deep Image Reconstruction for Background Subtraction in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jet reconstruction in an ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collision suffers from a notoriously large, fluctuating thermal background. Traditional background subtraction methods struggle to remove this soft background while preserving the jet's hard substructure. In this Letter, we present DeepSub, the first machine learning-based approach for full-event background subtraction. DeepSub utilizes a model based on Swin Transformer layers to denoise jet images and disentangle hard jets from the heavy-ion background. DeepSub significantly outperforms existing subtraction techniques by reproducing key jet observables such as jet $p_\mathrm{T}$ and mass, and substructure observables such as girth and the energy correlation function, at the sub-percent to percent level. As such, DeepSub paves the way for precision heavy-ion measurements in hitherto inaccessible kinematic regimes.</description>

      <title>Global Bayesian Analysis of $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ Photoproduction on Proton and Lead Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a global Bayesian analysis of diffractive $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ production in $\gamma+p$ and $\gamma+\mathrm{Pb}$ collisions using a color glass condensate (CGC) based calculation framework. As past calculations have shown that CGC-based models typically overpredict the $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ production in $\gamma+\mathrm{Pb}$ collisions at high center of mass energy, we address the question of whether it is possible to describe coherent and incoherent diffractive $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ data from $\gamma+p$ collisions at HERA and the LHC, and from $\gamma+\mathrm{Pb}$ collisions at the LHC simultaneously. Our results indicate that a simultaneous description of $\gamma+p$ and $\gamma+\mathrm{Pb}$ data is challenging, with results improving when an overall $K$-factor -- scaling $\gamma+p$ and $\gamma+\mathrm{Pb}$ cross sections to absorb model uncertainties -- is introduced.</description>

      <title>Symmetrizing relativistic three-body partial wave amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: S matrix principles and symmetries impose constraints on three-particle scattering amplitudes, which can be formulated as a class of integral equations for their partial wave projections. However, these amplitudes are typically expressed in an asymmetric basis, where one of the initial and final state particles is singled out, and all quantum numbers are defined relative to this spectator. In this work, we show how to construct symmetric partial wave amplitudes, which have been symmetrized over all possible spectator combinations, using their asymmetric counterparts and sets of recoupling coefficients. We derive these recoupling coefficients for arbitrary angular momentum and isospin for arbitrary systems of spinless particles with SU(2) flavor symmetry. We propose a simple intensity observable suitable for visualizing the structure of three-body dynamics in Dalitz distributions. Finally, we provide some numerical examples of Dalitz distributions relevant for future lattice QCD calculations of $3\pi$ systems and provide numerical evidence that the symmetrization procedure is consistent with expected symmetries of Dalitz plots.</description>

      <title>Observation of a dynamic magneto-chiral instability in photoexcited tellurium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a system of charged chiral fermions driven out of equilibrium, an electric current parallel to the magnetic field can generate a dynamic instability by which electromagnetic waves become amplified. Whether a similar instability can occur in chiral solid-state systems remains an open question. Using time-domain terahertz (THz) emission spectroscopy, we detect signatures of what we dub a ``dynamic magneto-chiral instability" in elemental tellurium, a structurally chiral crystal. Upon transient photoexcitation in a moderate external magnetic field, tellurium emits THz radiation consisting of coherent modes that amplify over time. An explanation for this amplification is proposed using a theoretical model based on a dynamic instability of electromagnetic waves interacting with infrared-active oscillators of impurity acceptor states in tellurium to form an amplifying polariton. Our work not only uncovers the presence of a magneto-chiral instability but also highlights its promise for THz-wave amplification in chiral materials.</description>

      <title>Electron-neutrino lepton number crossings: variations with the supernova core physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A crucial ingredient affecting fast neutrino flavor conversion in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) is the shape of the angular distribution of the electron-neutrino lepton number (ELN). The presence of an ELN crossing signals favorable conditions for flavor conversion. However, the dependence of ELN crossings on the SN properties is only partially understood. We investigate a suite of 12 spherically symmetric neutrino-hydrodynamics simulations of the core collapse of a SN with a mass of $18.6 M_\odot$; each model employs different microphysics (i.e., three different nuclear equations of state, with and without muon creation) and includes or not a mixing-length treatment for proto-neutron star convection. We solve the Boltzmann equations to compute the neutrino angular distributions relying on static fluid properties extracted from each of the SN simulations in our suite for six selected post-bounce times. We explore the dependence of the ELN distributions on the SN microphysics and proto-neutron star convection. We find that the latter shifts the proto-neutron star radius outwards, favoring the appearance of ELN crossings at larger radii. On the other hand, muon creation causes proto-neutron star contraction, facilitating the occurrence of ELN crossings at smaller radii. These effects mildly depend on the nuclear equation of state. Our findings highlight the subtle impact of the SN microphysics, proto-neutron star convection, and neutrino transport on the ELN angular distributions.</description>

      <title>Reanalyzing DESI DR1: 1. $\Lambda$CDM Constraints from the Power Spectrum and Bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first independent re-analysis of the galaxy clustering data from DESI Data Release 1, utilizing an effective field theory (EFT)-based full-shape model. We analyze the power spectra and bispectra of the public catalogs using a custom-built pipeline based on window-deconvolved quasi-optimal estimators, carefully accounting for all relevant systematic effects. Compared to the official collaboration analysis, we add the galaxy power spectrum hexadecapole and the bispectrum monopole, and also introduce a novel stochastic estimator for fiber collisions, which facilitates robust bispectrum analyses. As a first application, we perform an EFT-based full-shape analysis of the DESI power spectra and bispectra in the context of the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM. Using external priors on the physical baryon density and the primordial power spectrum tilt, we constrain the matter density fraction to $\Omega_m=0.284\pm 0.011$, the Hubble constant to $h=0.707\pm 0.011$, and the mass fluctuation amplitude to $\sigma_8=0.811\pm 0.030$. The bispectrum has a noticeable effect on parameter estimation: it sharpens the constraints on $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$ by $\approx 10$\% and shifts $\Omega_m$ by $\approx 1\sigma$ towards the Planck $\Lambda$CDM value. Combining our full-shape likelihood with the official DESI DR2 BAO measurements, cosmological parameters shift further towards the \textit{Planck} values, with $\Omega_m=0.296\pm 0.007$, $h=0.688\pm 0.006$, $\sigma_8=0.818\pm 0.029$ (with tighter constraints obtained in joint analyses). Finally, the galaxy bispectrum data dramatically improves measurements of quadratic bias parameters, which are consistent with predictions from halo occupation distribution models. Our work highlights the importance of higher-order statistics and sets the stage for upcoming full-shape analyses of non-minimal cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Functional inference on deviations from General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensions of general relativity often predict modifications to gravitational waveform morphology that depend functionally on source parameters, such as the masses and spins of coalescing black holes. However, current analyses of strong-field gravity lack robust, data-driven methods to infer such functional dependencies. In this work, we introduce GRANITA, a non-perturbative, theory-agnostic framework to characterize parameter-dependent deviations from general relativity using Gaussian process regression. Leveraging the flexibility of this method, we analyze both simulated data and real events from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA public catalog. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to detect and quantify waveform deviations across the parameter space. Furthermore, we show that the method can identify stochastic (non-deterministic) deviations, potentially arising from environmental effects or subdominant unmodeled physics. As gravitational-wave tests of strong gravity advance in precision, our framework provides a principled approach to constrain modified gravity and to mitigate contamination from astrophysical or instrumental systematics.</description>

      <title>Historical origins of quantum entanglement in particle physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the historical origins of quantum entanglement in particle physics are systematically and thoroughly investigated. 1957, Bohm and Aharonov noted that the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlation had been experimentally realised in the 1949 experiment of Chien-Shiung Wu and Shaknov. This was the first time in history that spatially separated quantum entanglement was explicitly realised in a controlled experiment. Wheeler first proposed such an experiment as a test of quantum electrodynamics, but his calculation was in error; the correct theoretical calculations came from Ward and Price, as well as from Snyder, Pasternack and Hornbostel, and the result was in accordance with Yang's 1949 selection rule. After the publication of Bell's inequality in 1964, it was considered whether it could be tested by using the Wu-Shaknov experiment. This gave an impetus to the field, and a new experiment was done by Wu's group, though it was not successful as a test of Bell inequality violation. In 1957, Tsung-Dao Lee, Reinhard Oehme and Chen Ning Yang established the quantum mechanical description of the kaons and found that the neutral kaon is a two-state system. In 1958, based on an approach similar to Yang's 1949 selection rule, Goldhaber, Lee and Yang were the first to write down the entangled states of kaon pairs, in which a single kaon can be charged or neutral. This gave, for the first time, quantum entanglement of internal degrees of freedom of high-energy particles other than photons. In 1960, as unpublished work, Lee and Yang discussed the consequences of quantum entanglement of neutral kaon pairs. We also describe several physicists in the past, especially Ward. A Chinese version of this paper was published in early 2023.</description>

      <title>Testing the cosmic distance duality relation with baryon acoustic oscillations and supernovae data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most fundamental relationships in modern cosmology is the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR), which describes the relationship between the angular diameter distance ($D_{\rm A}$) and the luminosity distance ($D_{\rm L}$), and is expressed as: $\eta(z)=D_{\rm L}(z)(1+z)^{-2}/D_{\rm A}(z)=1$. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive test of the CDDR by combining baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the SDSS and DESI surveys with type Ia supernova (SN) data from PantheonPlus and DESY5. We utilize an artificial neural network approach to match the SN and BAO data at the same redshift. To explore potential violations of the CDDR, we consider three different parameterizations: (i) $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0z$; (ii) $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0z/(1+z)$; (iii) $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0\ln(1+z)$. Our results indicate that the calibration of the SN absolute magnitude $M_{\rm B}$ plays a crucial role in testing potential deviations from the CDDR, as there exists a significant negative correlation between $\eta_0$ and $M_{\rm B}$. For PantheonPlus analysis, when $M_{\rm B}$ is treated as a free parameter, no evidence of CDDR violation is found. In contrast, fixing $M_{\rm B}$ to the $M_{\rm B}^{\rm D20}$ prior with $-19.230\pm0.040$ mag leads to a deviation at approximately the $2\sigma$ level, while fixing $M_{\rm B}$ to the $M_{\rm B}^{\rm B23}$ prior with $-19.396\pm0.016$ mag remains in agreement with the CDDR. Furthermore, overall analyses based on the SDSS+DESY5 and DESI+DESY5 data consistently show no evidence of the deviation from the CDDR.</description>

      <title>Gravity and the Higgs boson mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to usual calculations in quantum field theory, both in flat and curved spacetime, the mass $m^2$ of a scalar particle is quadratically sensitive to the ultimate scale of the theory, the UV physical cutoff $\Lambda$. In the present work, paying attention to the path integral measure and to the way $\Lambda$ is introduced, we calculate the one-loop effective action $\Gamma^{1l}$ for a scalar field on a non-trivial gravitational background. We find that $m^2$ presents only a (mild) logarithmic sensitivity to $\Lambda$. This is obtained without resorting to a supersymmetric embedding of the theory, nor to regularization schemes (as dimensional or zeta-function regularization) where power-like divergences are absent by construction. In view of the results of the present work, we finally speculate on the way the Minkowski limit should be approached.</description>

      <title>Magnetic monopoles with an internal degree of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of spontaneously broken $SU(2)$ gauge theories with adjoint scalar and look for exact magnetic monopole solutions in the Bogomol'nyi--Prasad--Sommerfield (BPS) limit. We find that some of the resulting solutions exhibit a new internal degree of freedom (a moduli space parameter) that controls the energy density profile of the monopole while keeping the total energy (mass) constant.</description>

      <title>Exotic Dark Matter and the DESI Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exotic dark matter (EDM) refers to a dark matter species whose equation of state deviates from zero at late times. This behavior enables it to model a variety of non-standard late-time cosmologies, offering alternatives to various dark energy (DE) models, especially when the DE sector violates the null energy condition. In this work, by fitting to CMB, BAO, and Supernovae (SNe) data and comparing models in a Bayesian approach, we show that simple models of exotic dark matter are statistically comparable to the $w_0w_a$CDM DE model in explaining the recent anomaly in the late-time cosmological evolution suggested by DESI and supernova observations, although in both classes of models the evidence against the $\Lambda$CDM model only appears when the DES-Y5 or Union3 SNe dataset is included. The value of $H_0$ remains similar to that in the DE model, except in the no-SNe case, where the DE model predicts lower values than $\Lambda$CDM, thereby worsening the Hubble tension, whereas the EDM models yield values closer to that of $\Lambda$CDM, albeit with larger uncertainty. In addition, the EDM models predict a drastically different energy budget for the present-day universe compared to the standard model, and provide an explanation for a coincident problem in the DE-model explanation of the DESI anomaly.</description>

      <title>Strangeon Matter: from Stars to Nuggets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fact that strange sea quarks are abundant in the nucleons, but without strangeness, is of great importance for understanding the nature of dense matter condensed by the strong interaction, particularly in the context of the ``gigantic nucleus'' formed by the gravitational collapse of an evolved massive star. We hypothesize that the basic unit of bulk strong matter with the light-flavor symmetry of valence quarks is ``strangeon'', which is the counterpart of the nucleon found in atomic nuclei. In addition to strangeon stars (SnSs) with large baryon number of $A\approx 10^{57}$, strange nuggets (SnNs) with $A\gtrsim 10^{10}$ could also exist in the Universe. Both the SnS and the SnN are explained, with attention to their observational evidence.</description>

      <title>Testing Signatures of Phantom Crossing through Full-Shape Galaxy Clustering Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey, when combined with measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernovae (SNIa), provide compelling evidence for a phantom crossing at late times, along with statistically significant deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. In this work, we investigate the role of redshift-space galaxy clustering data by employing the pre-reconstruction full-shape (FS) galaxy power spectrum from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) data release 12 (DR12) sample. This dataset is analyzed in combination with BAO measurements from DESI data release 2 (DR2) and various SNIa samples. Our analysis demonstrates that the joint combination of these datasets can yield deviations from $\Lambda$CDM at a significance level of up to $\sim 5\sigma$, suggesting strong indications that the dark energy equation of state parameter $w(z)$ may have crossed the phantom divide ($w = -1$) in the redshift range $z \sim 0.4$--$0.5$. The precise location and strength of this crossing depend on the adopted theoretical parameterizations. Importantly, our results reveal that this trend persists even in the absence of CMB data, underscoring the robustness of the FS power spectrum as a powerful and independent probe for testing dark energy models and for distinguishing between competing cosmological scenarios.</description>

Abstract: The recent paper "The asymptotically-free gauge theories" by Ben Gripaios and Khoi Le Nguyen Nguyen [arXiv:2507.12348] presents a proposed classification of gauge theories valid down to arbitrarily short scales. In this comment, we aim to clarify several points and address some statements that may be misleading. We also provide additional context by discussing relevant prior literature and existing classifications.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos from the Sun can discover dark matter-electron scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We probe dark matter-electron scattering using high-energy neutrino observations from the Sun. Dark matter (DM) interacting with electrons can get captured inside the Sun. These captured DM may annihilate to produce different Standard Model (SM) particles. Neutrinos produced from these SM states can be observed in IceCube and DeepCore. Although there is no excess of neutrinos in the solar direction, we find that the current datasets of IceCube and DeepCore set the strongest constraint on the DM-electron scattering cross section in the DM mass range $10$\,GeV to $10^5$\,GeV. Therefore our work implies that future observations of the Sun by neutrino telescopes have the potential to discover the DM-electron interaction.</description>

      <title>Constraining scalars of $16_H$ through proton decays in non-renormalisable $SO(10)$ models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-renormalisable versions of $SO(10)$\, based on irreducible representations with lesser degrees of freedom, are free of running into the catastrophe of non-perturbativity of standard model gauge couplings in contrast to the renormalisable versions having tensors with many degrees of freedom. $16_H$ is the smallest representation, participates in Yukawa Lagrangian at the non-renormalisable level, contributing to the charged and neutral fermion masses, and has six distinct scalars with different $B-L$ charges. We computed the leptoquark and diquark couplings of different pairs of scalars stemming from all possible decomposition of the term resulting from the coupling of $16_{H}$ with the ${\mathbf{16}}$ dimensional fermion multiplet of $SO(10)$,\, i.e. $\frac{{\mathbf{16}}\,{\mathbf{16}}\,16_{H}\,16_{H}}{\Lambda}$. Computing the tree and loop level contribution of different pairs to the effective dimension six, $B-L$ conserving operators, it turns out only three pairs, viz $\sigma\big(1,1,0\big)- T\big(3,1,\frac{1}{3}\big)$, and $H\big(1,2,-\frac{1}{2}\big)-\Delta\big(3,2,\frac{1}{6}\big)$, and $H-T$ can induce proton decay at tree level. Assuming that the Yukawa couplings of the $16_{H}$ are comparable to those of the $\overline{126}_{H}$ of a realistic $SO(10)$ model and setting the cutoff scale to the Planck scale typically constrains the $B-L$ breaking scale to be $4\sim 5$ orders of magnitude less than the cutoff scale $(\Lambda)$. Moreover, analysing the branching pattern of the leading two-body decay modes of the proton, we observed a preference for the proton to decay into second-generation mesons due to the hierarchical nature of Yukawa couplings. In a realistic $SO(10)$\, scenario, we find that $M_T &gt;10^{8}$ TeV, while $M_\Delta$ could be as light as a few TeV$s$.</description>

      <title>Novel structures and collapse of solitons in nonminimally gravitating dark matter halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter simulations predict condensates with short-range correlation, known as solitons or boson stars, at the centers of dark matter halos. This paper investigates the formation and collapse of dark matter solitons influenced by nonminimal gravitational effects, characterized by gradient-dependent self-interactions of dark matter and an additional source in Poisson's equation for gravity. Our simulations suggest that the initial evolution of dark matter resembles that without nonminimal gravitational effects. However, regions with negative potential curvature may develop, and solitons will collapse when their densities reach certain critical values for both positive and negative coupling constants. With strong nonminimal gravitational effects, we verify that linear density perturbations could grow on both large and small scales, potentially enhancing structure formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the volume and lifetime of the high baryon-density matter created in heavy-ion collisions and estimate the optimal collision-energy range to realize the high baryon-density region over a large spacetime volume. We simulate central collisions of gold ions for the center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.4 - 19.6\;{\rm GeV}$ with a microscopic transport model JAM. We discover that the optimal range is around $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3 - 5\;{\rm GeV}$, where a baryon density exceeding three times the normal nuclear density is realized with a substantially large spacetime volume. Higher and lower energies are disfavored due to short lifetime and low density, respectively. We also point out that event-by-event fluctuations of the spacetime density profile are large, indicating the importance of the event selection in the experimental analysis.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Analysis of Radiative Decays to Dark Matter at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for weakly interacting matter particles (WIMPs) is one of the main objectives of the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). In this work we use Machine-Learning (ML) techniques to explore WIMP radiative decays into a Dark Matter (DM) candidate in a supersymmetric framework. The minimal supersymmetric WIMP sector includes the lightest neutralino that can provide the observed DM relic density through its co-annihilation with the second lightest neutralino and lightest chargino. Moreover, the direct DM detection cross section rates fulfill current experimental bounds and provide discovery targets for the same region of model parameters in which the radiative decay of the second lightest neutralino into a photon and the lightest neutralino is enhanced. This strongly motivates the search for radiatively decaying neutralinos which, however, suffers from strong backgrounds. We investigate the LHC reach in the search for these radiatively decaying particles by means of cut-based and ML methods and estimate its discovery potential in this well-motivated, new physics scenario. We demonstrate that using ML techniques would enable access to most of the parameter space unexplored by other searches.</description>

      <title>PDFxTMDLib: A High-Performance C++ Library for Collinear and Transverse Momentum Dependent Parton Distribution Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16680v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collinear parton distribution functions (cPDFs) and transverse momentum dependent distributions (TMDs) are essential for calculating cross sections in high-energy physics, particularly within collinear and $k_t$-factorization frameworks. Currently, there exists two libraries, such as \texttt{LHAPDF} and \texttt{TMDLib}, to obtain these physical objects. However, there are limitations in both libraries, especially for TMDs, such as restricted customization and extensibility. Users are limited to the implementations provided by these libraries and cannot easily support unconventional PDFs. Additionally, no standard TMD library currently supports calculations of QCD coupling and uncertainties, which are crucial for precise phenomenological studies.
  To address these shortcomings, we introduce \texttt{PDFxTMDLib}, a modern C++ library designed to offer a robust and flexible solution. This library supports both collinear PDFs and TMDs while allowing greater customization. It also opens the way to support higher-order distributions. In this article, we describe the structure of \texttt{PDFxTMDLib}. We also demonstrate its validity and performance by integrating it into the PYTHIA Monte Carlo event generator to compute Drell-Yan cross sections. Additionally, comparisons of PDFs obtained from \texttt{PDFxTMDLib} with those from \texttt{LHAPDF} and \texttt{TMDLib} confirm the reliability of \texttt{PDFxTMDLib}'s results.</description>

Abstract: We present a systematic comparison of theoretical predictions and various high-precision experimental measurements, specifically of differential cross sections performed by the LHC run II for Drell-Yan gauge boson, top-quark pair, single-inclusive jet and di-jet production, and by HERA for single-inclusive jet and di-jet production. Theoretical predictions are computed at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) accuracy in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics. The most widely employed sets of Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) are used, and PDF, strong coupling, and missing higher order uncertainties are taken into account. We quantitatively assess the predictive power of each PDF set and the contribution of the different sources of experimental and theoretical uncertainty to the agreement between data and predictions. We show that control over all of these aspects is crucial to precision physics studies, such as the determination of Standard Model parameters at the LHC.</description>

Abstract: Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) is a key process for probing Standard Model and beyond the Standard Model (BSM) properties. Following its first detection by the COHERENT Collaboration, recent reactor-based experiments provide a unique opportunity to refine our current understanding. In particular, the high-precision data from CONUS+, combined with the strong bounds from TEXONO, not only validate the CE$\nu$NS process at low energies but also provide improved constraints on the weak mixing angle, neutrino electromagnetic properties (including the charge radius, millicharge, and magnetic moment), and nonstandard interactions and light mediators. We also examine the role of elastic neutrino-electron scattering, which gains significance in certain BSM scenarios and allows us to obtain the best limit for the millicharge of the electron neutrinos. By combining reactor and higher-energy spallation neutron source measurements, this work strengthens CE$\nu$NS as a precision tool for testing the Standard Model and beyond.</description>

      <title>Insights on the Scale of Leptogenesis from Neutrino Masses and Neutrinoless Double-Beta Decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the thermal leptogenesis scenario in the type-I seesaw framework featuring three heavy Majorana neutrinos with a hierarchical mass spectrum. We focus on low energy observables, specifically the lightest neutrino mass $m_{\nu}^{\rm lightest}$ and the neutrinoless double-beta decay effective mass parameter $m^{\rm eff}_{\beta\beta}$. In particular, we numerically calculate the minimum mass of the lightest heavy Majorana neutrino, $M_1^{\rm min}$, required for successful leptogenesis as a function of $m_{\nu}^{\rm lightest}$ and $m_{\beta\beta}^{\rm eff}$, considering both normal and inverted light neutrino mass orderings. Flavour effects are taken into account within the flavoured density matrix formalism. We also examine the interplay between fine-tuned cancellations in the seesaw relation and $M_1^{\rm min}$. Recent and forthcoming searches for neutrinoless double-beta decay, along with cosmological probes of the sum of neutrino masses, motivate this analysis, as they can provide key insights into the minimal scale of thermal leptogenesis and its broader implications.</description>

      <title>Testing the dark origin of neutrino masses with oscillation experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of neutrino masses remains unknown to date. One popular idea involves interactions between neutrinos and ultralight dark matter, described as fields or particles with masses $m_\phi \ll 10\,\mathrm{eV}$. Due to the large phase-space number density, this type of dark matter exists in coherent states and can be effectively described by an oscillating classical field. As a result, neutrino mass-squared differences undergo field-induced interference in spacetime, potentially generating detectable effects in oscillation experiments. We demonstrate that if $m_\phi\gg 10^{-14}\,\mathrm{eV}$, the mechanism becomes sensitive to dark matter density fluctuations, which suppresses the oscillatory behavior of flavor-changing probabilities as a function of neutrino propagation distance in a model-independent way, thereby ruling out this regime. Furthermore, by analyzing data from the Kamioka Liquid Scintillator Antineutrino Detector (KamLAND), a benchmark long-baseline reactor experiment, we show that the hypothesis of a dark origin for the neutrino masses is disfavored for $m_\phi \ll 10^{-14}\,\mathrm{eV}$, compared to the case of constant mass values in vacuum. This result holds at more than the 4$\sigma$ level across different datasets and parameter choices. The mass range $10^{-17}\,\mathrm{eV} \lesssim m_\phi \lesssim 10^{-14}\,\mathrm{eV}$ can be further tested in current and future oscillation experiments by searching for time variations (rather than periodicity) in oscillation parameters.</description>

      <title>$D^{(*)}\bar{B}^{(*)}$ Dynamics in Chiral Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically study the interactions of the $S$-wave $D^{(*)}\bar{B}^{(*)}$ systems within the framework of chiral effective field theory in heavy hadron formalism. We calculate the $D^{(*)}\bar{B}^{(*)}$ effective potentials up to next-to-leading order, explore the bound state formations, and investigate the $D^{(*)}\bar{B}^{(*)}$ scattering properties such as scattering rate, scattering length, and effective range. Our results show that all $I=1$ $D^{(*)}\bar{B}^{(*)}$ potentials are repulsive, preventing the formation of bound states, while the $I=0$ potentials are generally attractive. Specifically, we get two important observations: first, the shallow bound state is more likely to exist in the $D\bar{B}[I(J^{P})=0(0^{+})]$ system than in the $D\bar{B}^{*}[I(J^{P})=0(1^{+})]$ system; second, $D^{*}\bar{B}^{*}[I(J^{P})=0(0^{+})]$ and $D^{*}\bar{B}^{*}[I(J^{P})=0(1^{+})]$ systems possess relatively large binding energies and positive scattering lengths, which suggests strong bound state formations in these channels. So the attractions in the $D^{*}\bar{B}^{*}[I=0]$ systems are deeper than those in the $D\bar{B}^{(*)}[I=0]$ systems, thus we strongly recommend the future experiment to search for the $D^{*}\bar{B}^{*}[I=0]$ tetraquark systems. We also investigate the coupled-channel effects on the $J=0, 1$ systems and conclude that the inclusion of the coupled channels introduces small but visible influences. In addition, we also investigate the dependencies of the $D\bar{B}^{(*)}$ binding energies on the contact low-energy coupling constants (LECs).</description>

      <title>Mass spectrum and magnetic moments of singly-charmed baryons: a quark-diquark model analysis of $\Omega_{c}(3185)^0$ and $\Omega_c(3327)^0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research on singly-heavy baryons, especially those with a charm quark, offers a distinct perspective on the non-perturbative behavior of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In this work, we investigate the recently observed $\Omega_{c}(3185)^{0}$ and $\Omega_{c}(3327)^{0}$ as singly-charmed baryons within the framework of the quark-diquark model. By employing a non-relativistic method with a Cornell-like potential, we systematically determine magnetic moments and mass spectra. Our analysis reveals that the $\Omega_{c}(3185)^{0}$ can be effectively described as a $2S$ state with quantum numbers $J^{P}=\frac{1}{2}^{+}$ or $\frac{3}{2}^{+}$, or alternatively as a $1P$ state with $J^{P}=\frac{1}{2}^{-}$ or $\frac{3}{2}^{-}$, depending on the diquark configuration. Similarly, the $\Omega_{c}(3327)^{0}$ is consistent with a $2S$ configuration. We also investigate their magnetic moments, emphasizing the critical role of diquark correlations in shaping the electromagnetic properties of these states. Our results not only validate existing theoretical models but also offer new insights into the nature of singly-heavy baryons, setting the stage for future experimental and theoretical investigations in heavy baryon spectroscopy. This paper emphasizes the importance of diquark configurations in elucidating the mass spectrum and electromagnetic characteristics of singly-charmed baryons, aiding in the broader effort to decipher QCD intricacies.</description>

Abstract: A relativistic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is studied within the complex scalar field theory using the functional renormalization group (FRG) under the local potential approximation. We investigate fluctuation effects on the relativistic BEC through numerical analyses for various spatial dimensions and chemical potentials. Our numerical results are consistent with the Mermin-Wagner theorem, and this consistency is also analytically confirmed from the flow equation. We also discuss a numerical instability of the FRG in lower spatial dimensions, which is evadable for certain parameter choices.</description>

      <title>Fate of the scalar quartic couplings in the inert models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we consider three inert models, namely the inert singlet model (ISM), inert triplet model (ITM), and inert doublet model (IDM) as beyond Standard Model scenarios, and look into the running of the scalar quartic couplings at one- and two-loop levels. Interestingly, the Landau poles at one-loop and Fixed points at two-loop have been observed for these scenarios, very similar to the $\phi^4$ theory, which is absent in the Standard Model. The role of Higgs portal couplings in attaining these features has been examined. For inert singlet and triplet models, the portal couplings give rise to terms without any residual phases, enhancing this Fixed point behaviour. In the case of the inert doublet model, $\lambda_{4,5}$ terms which have the residual phases, spoil this behaviour. Finally, we consider perturbative unitarity constraints to put limits on the scalar quartic couplings for various perturbativity scales in both one- and two-loop. Larger portal couplings, i.e. $\gsim 2$, get strong perturbative bounds as low as $10^{2-3}$ GeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some time ago it was claimed in "Spontaneous Breaking of Lepton Number and Cosmological Domain Wall Problem" (Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 151301 (2019)) that non perturbative instantons of the weak interaction $\text{SU}(2)_\text{W}$ lead to the formation of domain walls in Majoron models owing to the anomaly of the spontaneously broken global lepton number $L$ symmetry $\text{U}(1)_L$ with respect to $\text{SU}(2)_\text{W}$. We point out that it has long been known, that this effect can be completely rotated away unless there is a source of explicit $B+L$ breaking present, where $B$ denotes baryon number. We further estimate the tiny instanton induced Majoron mass from $B+L$ breaking and analyze the cosmological impact of such domain walls including possible finite temperature effects. In general this scenario does not lead to a cosmological catastrophe.</description>

Abstract: The future circular $e^+ e^-$ collider (FCC-ee) stands out as the next flagship project in particle physics, dedicated to uncovering the microscopic origin of the Higgs boson. In this context, we assess indirect probes of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), a well-established benchmark hypothesis, exploring the complementarity between Higgs measurements and electroweak precision tests at the $Z$-pole. We study three key sectors: the heavy Higgs doublet, scalar top partners, and light gauginos and higgsinos, focusing on the parameter space favored by naturalness. Remarkably, the Tera-$Z$ program consistently offers significantly greater indirect sensitivity than the Mega-$h$ run. While promising, these prospects hinge on reducing SM uncertainties. Accordingly, we highlight key precision observables for targeted theoretical work.</description>

Abstract: We explore the phenomenology of the ``Dark Walker'' -- an $\text{SU}(3)$ theory with eight flavors of massless fundamental fermions in the dark sector. During inflation, its walking dynamics generate primordial non-Gaussianities through the exchange of unparticles, while accounting for the current dark matter relic abundance if the resulting massive pseudoscalars behave as strongly interacting massive particles (SIMPs). This provides a simple yet concrete example of a strongly coupled sector during inflation.</description>

Abstract: Recent parameterizations of parton distribution functions (PDFs) have led to the determination of the gravitional form factors of the nucleon's dependence on generalized parton distributions of nucleons in the limit $\xi$$\to 0$. This paper aims to obtain the flavor division of nucleon electromagnetic and gravitional form factors using the VS24 Ansatz and two PDFs at $N^3L0$ approximation in GPDs. The PDFs and GPDs formalism enable the calculation of various form factors of nucleons in different approximations, as well as the calculation of the electric radius of nucleons. The study, despite its high approximation complexity, enhances the accuracy of calculations and brings them closer to the experimental values.</description>

      <title>Constraining lepton flavor violating $2q 2\ell$ operators from low-energy cLFV processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charged lepton flavour-violating (cLFV) processes, which are definite proof of new physics beyond the Standard Model, have remained elusive experimentally till now. Effective Field Theory (EFT) has been very useful in providing information about such new physics through the higher-dimensional operators. These operators respect SM gauge invariance, and they are suppressed by appropriate powers of the energy scale $\Lambda$. In regard to lepton flavour violating (LFV) processes, the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is shown to be a useful tool for estimating any new physics effect at the scale $\Lambda$. It is worth noticing that a large class of cLFV processes involve both quarks and leptons and thus low-energy observables play a significant role in providing bounds on lepton-flavour-violating 2-quark-2-lepton ($2q2\ell$) operators. Therefore, in this work, we have collected several low-energy cLFV processes that can be addressed within the SMEFT framework and also collected the set of operators responsible for such processes. Keeping in mind the correlation that exists among the SMEFT operators, we want to extract the strongest constraints on these $2q2\ell$ operators.</description>

      <title>Thermal Radiation from an Analytic Hydrodynamic Model with Hadronic and QGP Sources in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In high-energy heavy-ion collisions, a nearly perfect fluid is formed, known as the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP). After a short thermalization period, the evolution of this medium can be described by the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics. As the system expands and cools, the QGP undergoes a transition into hadronic matter, marking the onset of quark confinement. Direct photons offer insights into an essential stage of evolution, spanning from the onset of thermalization to the suppression of thermal photon production, which occurs within the hadronic phase. This paper builds upon and extends a previously published solution of relativistic hydrodynamics, incorporating an equation of state that falls within the same class as that predicted by lattice QCD. Based on this solution, a completely analytic model is constructed to describe thermal photon production, accounting for the quark-hadron transition. The model is tested against PHENIX measurements of non-prompt direct photon spectra in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV. Good agreement is observed between the model predictions and the experimental data, enabling the investigation of the centrality dependence of the initial temperature. These results provide a benchmark for future theoretical and experimental studies of thermal radiation in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14299v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Without invoking any cumulant determination at the input level, we present here the first calculations of direct estimates of the Lee-Yang zeros of QCD partition function in (2+1)-flavor QCD. These zeros are obtained in complex isospin chemical potential $\mu_I$ plane using the unbiased exponential resummation formalism on $N_\tau=8$ lattices and with physical quark masses. For different temperatures, we illustrate the stability of the zeros closest to the origin from which, we subsequently procure the radius of convergence estimates. From the temperature-dependence study of the real and imaginary parts of these zeros, we try estimating one of the possible critical points forming the second order pion condensate critical line in the isospin phase diagram. Further, we compare these resummed estimates with the corresponding Mercer-Roberts estimates of the subsequent Taylor series expansions of the first three partition function cumulants. We also outline comparisons between resummed and Taylor series results of these cumulants for real and imaginary values of $\mu_I$ and highlight the behavior of different expansion orders within and beyond the obtained resummed estimates of radius of convergence. We also re-establish that this resummed radius of convergence can efficiently capture the onset of overlap problem for finite real $\mu_I$ simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum field theory (QFT) for interacting many-electron systems is fundamental to condensed matter physics, yet achieving accurate solutions confronts computational challenges in managing the combinatorial complexity of Feynman diagrams, implementing systematic renormalization, and evaluating high-dimensional integrals. We present a unifying framework that integrates QFT computational workflows with an AI-powered technology stack. A cornerstone of this framework is representing Feynman diagrams as computational graphs, which structures the inherent mathematical complexity and facilitates the application of optimized algorithms developed for machine learning and high-performance computing. Consequently, automatic differentiation, native to these graph representations, delivers efficient, fully automated, high-order field-theoretic renormalization procedures. This graph-centric approach also enables sophisticated numerical integration; our neural-network-enhanced Monte Carlo method, accelerated via massively parallel GPU implementation, efficiently evaluates challenging high-dimensional diagrammatic integrals. Applying this framework to the uniform electron gas, we determine the quasiparticle effective mass to a precision significantly surpassing current state-of-the-art simulations. Our work demonstrates the transformative potential of integrating AI-driven computational advances with QFT, opening systematic pathways for solving complex quantum many-body problems across disciplines.</description>

In particular, they argued that in quantum gravity causal diamonds have an uncertainty in their size that scales as $\delta L \sim \sqrt{\ell_p L}$, i.e. fluctuations are enhanced from the Planck scale. In this work, we explore the origin of the VZ scaling by studying scalar perturbations in inflationary cosmology. We reinterpret these cosmological perturbations as fluctuations of the modular Hamiltonian associated with a causal diamond, establishing a connection between modular fluctuations and observable primordial perturbations. Independent of assumptions about the modular Hamiltonian or the background spacetime, our results show that -- whenever an (effective) spherically symmetric perturbation is quantized -- it can lead to the VZ scaling. However, whether such a mode exists in the vacuum of any theory of quantum gravity remains an open question.</description>

      <title>Results from an Einstein@Home search for continuous gravitational waves from Cassiopeia A and Vela Jr. using LIGO O2 data</title>

Abstract: We conduct two searches for continuous, nearly monochromatic gravitational waves originating from the central compact objects in the supernova remnants Cassiopeia A and Vela Jr. using public LIGO data. The search for Cassiopeia A targets signal frequencies between 20 Hz and 400 Hz; the Vela Jr. search between 400 Hz and 1700 Hz, and both investigate the broadest set of waveforms ever considered with highly sensitive deterministic search methods. Above 1500 Hz the Vela Jr. search is the most sensitive carried out thus far, improving on previous results by over 300\%. Above 976 Hz these results improve on existing ones by 50\%. In all we investigate over $10^{18}$ waveforms, leveraging the computational power donated by thousands of Einstein@Home volunteers. We perform a 4-stage follow-up on more than 6 million waveforms. None of the considered waveforms survives the follow-up scrutiny, indicating no significate detection candidate. Our null results constrain the maximum amplitude of continuous signals as a function of signal frequency from the targets. The most stringent 90\% confidence upper limit for Cas A is $h_0^{90 \%}\approx 7.3\times10^{-26}$ near 200 Hz, and for Vela Jr. it is $h_0^{90 \%}\approx 8.9\times10^{-26}$ near 400 Hz. Translated into upper limits on the ellipticity and r-mode amplitude, our results probe physically interesting regions: for example the ellipticity of Vela Jr. is constrained to be smaller than $10^{-7}$ across the frequency band, with a tighter constraint of less than $2\times10^{-8}$ at the highest frequencies.</description>

      <title>Prospects for probing dark matter particles and primordial black holes with the Square Kilometre Array using the 21 cm power spectrum at cosmic dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02651</link>

Abstract: Probing the nature of dark matter (DM) remains an outstanding problem in modern cosmology. The 21 cm signal, as a sensitive tracer of neutral hydrogen during cosmic dawn, provides a unique means to investigate DM nature during this critical epoch. Annihilation and decay of DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation of primordial black holes (PBHs), can modify the thermal and ionization histories of the early universe, leaving distinctive imprints on the 21 cm power spectrum. Therefore, the redshifted 21 cm power spectrum serves as a powerful tool to investigate such DM processes. In this work, we systematically assess the potential of the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) to constrain DM and PBH parameters using the 21 cm power spectrum. Assuming $10,000$ hours of integration time, the SKA is projected to reach sensitivities of $\langle\sigma v\rangle \leq 10^{-28}\,{\rm cm}^{3}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ and $\tau\geq 10^{28}\,{\rm seconds}$, for $10\,{\rm GeV}$ DM particles. It can also probe PBHs with masses of $10^{16}\,\mathrm{g}$ and abundances $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \leq 10^{-6}$. These results indicate that the SKA could place constraints on DM annihilation, decay, and PBH Hawking radiation that are up to two to three orders of magnitude stronger than current limits. Furthermore, the SKA is expected to exceed existing bounds on sub-GeV DM and to probe Hawking radiation from PBHs with masses above $10^{17}\,{\rm g}$, which are otherwise inaccessible by conventional cosmological probes. Overall, the SKA holds great promise for advancing our understanding of both DM particles and PBHs, potentially offering new insights into the fundamental nature of DM.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of spin-spin correlators weighted by fermion number measurements with low rapidity threshold in the 2D Ising free-fermion QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the work, we study the averaged number of massive fermions above a low rapidity threshold $Y$, underlying the form-factor expansions of the spin-spin two-point correlators at an Euclidean distance $r$, in the 2D Ising QFT at the free massive fermion point. Despite the on-shell freeness, the spin operators are still far away from being Gaussian, and create particles in the asymptotic states with complicated correlations. We show how the number observables can still be incorporated into the integrable Sinh-Gordon/Painleve-III framework and controlled by linear differential equations with two variables $(r,Y)$. We show how the differential equations and the information of two crucial scaling functions arising in the $r\rightarrow 0$, $e^{Y}r={\cal O}(1)$ scaling limit, can be combined to fully determine the small-$r$ asymptotics of the observables, in the $\lambda$-extended form. The scaling functions, on the other hand, are analyzed by summing the exponential form-factor expansions directly, generalizing the traditional Ising connecting computations. We show carefully, how the singularities cancel in the physical value limit $\lambda \pi \rightarrow 1$ and how the power-corrections that collapse at this value can be resummed. In particular, we show for the physical $\lambda$-value, the scaling functions are related to an integrated four-point function in the Ising CFT and continue to control the asymptotics of the number-observables in the scaling limit up to ${\cal O}(r^3)$.</description>
