      <title>Forking in valued fields and related structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis is a contribution to the model theory of valued fields. We study forking in valued fields and some of their reducts. We focus particularly on pseudo-local fields, the ultraproducts of residue characteristic zero of the p-adic valued fields. First, we look at the value groups of the valued fields we are interested in, the regular ordered Abelian groups. We establish for these ordered groups a geometric description of forking, as well as a full classification of the global extensions of a given type which are non-forking or invariant. Then, we prove an Ax-Kochen-Ershov principle for forking and dividing in expansions of pure short exact sequences of Abelian structures, as studied by Aschenbrenner-Chernikov-Gehret-Ziegler in their article about distality. This setting applies in particular to the leading-term structure of (expansions of) valued fields. Lastly, we give various sufficient conditions for a parameter set in a Henselian valued field of residue characteristic zero to be an extension base. In particular, we show that forking equals dividing in pseudo-local fields of residue characteristic zero. Additionally, we discuss results by Ealy-Haskell-Simon on forking in separated extensions of Henselian valued fields of residue characteristic zero. We contribute to the question in the setting of Abhyankar extensions, where we show that, with some additional conditions, if a type in a pseudo-local field does not fork, then there exists some global invariant Keisler measure whose support contains that type. This behavior is well-known in pseudo-finite fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if there exists a countable Borel equivalence relation which is hyper-hyperfinite but not hyperfinite then the complexity of hyperfinite countable Borel equivalence relations is as high as possible, namely, $\Sigma^1_2$-complete.</description>

      <title>Analogues of the countable Borel equivalence relations in the setting of computable reducibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coskey, Hamkins, and Miller [CHM12] proposed two possible analogues of the class of countable Borel equivalence relations in the setting of computable reducibility of equivalence relations on the computably enumerable (c.e.) sets. The first is based on effectivizing the Lusin-Novikov theorem while the latter is based on effectivizing the Feldman-Moore theorem. They asked for an analysis of which degrees under computable reducibility are attained under each of these notions. We investigate these two notions, in particular showing that the latter notion has a strict dichotomy theorem: Every such equivalence relation is either equivalent to the relation of equality ($=^{ce}$) or almost equality ($E_0^{ce}$) between c.e. sets. For the former notion, we show that this is not true, but rather there are both chains and antichains of such equivalence relations on c.e. sets which are between $=^{ce}$ and $E_0^{ce}$. This gives several strong answers to [CHM12, Question 3.5] showing that in general there is no analogue of the Glimm-Efros dichotomy for equivalence relations on the c.e. sets.</description>

      <title>Informed deep hierarchical classification: a non-standard analysis inspired approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a novel approach to the deep hierarchical classification task, i.e., the problem of classifying data according to multiple labels organized in a rigid parent-child structure. It consists in a multi-output deep neural network equipped with specific projection operators placed before each output layer. The design of such an architecture, called lexicographic hybrid deep neural network (LH-DNN), has been possible by combining tools from different and quite distant research fields: lexicographic multi-objective optimization, non-standard analysis, and deep learning. To assess the efficacy of the approach, the resulting network is compared against the B-CNN, a convolutional neural network tailored for hierarchical classification tasks, on the CIFAR10, CIFAR100 (where it has been originally and recently proposed before being adopted and tuned for multiple real-world applications) and Fashion-MNIST benchmarks. Evidence states that an LH-DNN can achieve comparable if not superior performance, especially in the learning of the hierarchical relations, in the face of a drastic reduction of the learning parameters, training epochs, and computational time, without the need for ad-hoc loss functions weighting values.</description>

      <title>Formal conjugacy and asymptotic differential algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study conjugacy of formal derivations on fields of generalised power series in characteristic 0. Casting the problem of Poincar\'e resonance in terms of asymptotic differential algebra, we give conditions for conjugacy of parabolic flat log-exp transseries, flat grid-based transseries, logarithmic transseries, power series with exponents and coefficients in an ordered field, and formal Puiseux series.</description>

      <title>On some Fraisse limits with free amalgamation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07616v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the first part of this work the notion of stable Kim-forking is discussed and some context on this matter is given. In the second part a general way of building some examples of NSOP1 theories as the limit of some Fraisse class satisfying stronger conditions is given. These limits will satisfy existence, that Kim-independence coincide with algebraic independence, and that forking independence is obtained by forcing base monotonicity on Kim-forking over arbitrary sets. These theories also come with a stationary independence relation. This study is based on the results of Baudisch, Ramsey, Chernikov and Kruckman.</description>
