      <title>LLM-ABM for Transportation: Assessing the Potential of LLM Agents in System Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agent-based modeling approaches represent the state-of-art in modeling travel demand and transportation system dynamics and are valuable tools for transportation planning. However, established agent-based approaches in transportation rely on multi-hierarchical mathematical models to simulate travel behavior, which faces theoretical and practical limitations. The advent of large language models (LLM) provides a new opportunity to refine agent-based modeling in transportation. LLM agents, which have impressive reasoning and planning abilities, can serve as a proxy of human travelers and be integrated into the modeling framework. However, despite evidence of their behavioral soundness, no existing studies have assessed the impact and validity of LLM-agent-based simulations from a system perspective in transportation. This paper aims to address this issue by designing and integrating LLM agents with human-traveler-like characteristics into a simulation of a transportation system and assessing its performance based on existing benchmarks. Using the classical transportation setting of the morning commute, we find that not only do the agents exhibit fine behavioral soundness, but also produce system dynamics that align well with standard benchmarks. Our analysis first verifies the effectiveness and potential of LLM-agent-based modeling for transportation planning on the system level.</description>

      <title>Policy Optimization and Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning for Mean-variance Team Stochastic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a long-run mean-variance team stochastic game (MV-TSG), where each agent shares a common mean-variance objective for the system and takes actions independently to maximize it. MV-TSG has two main challenges. First, the variance metric is neither additive nor Markovian in a dynamic setting. Second, simultaneous policy updates of all agents lead to a non-stationary environment for each individual agent. Both challenges make dynamic programming inapplicable. In this paper, we study MV-TSGs from the perspective of sensitivity-based optimization. The performance difference and performance derivative formulas for joint policies are derived, which provide optimization information for MV-TSGs. We prove the existence of a deterministic Nash policy for this problem. Subsequently, we propose a Mean-Variance Multi-Agent Policy Iteration (MV-MAPI) algorithm with a sequential update scheme, where individual agent policies are updated one by one in a given order. We prove that the MV-MAPI algorithm converges to a first-order stationary point of the objective function. By analyzing the local geometry of stationary points, we derive specific conditions for stationary points to be (local) Nash equilibria, and further, strict local optima. To solve large-scale MV-TSGs in scenarios with unknown environmental parameters, we extend the idea of trust region methods to MV-MAPI and develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm named Mean-Variance Multi-Agent Trust Region Policy Optimization (MV-MATRPO). We derive a performance lower bound for each update of joint policies. Finally, numerical experiments on energy management in multiple microgrid systems are conducted.</description>

      <title>A Constrained Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach to Autonomous Traffic Signal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic congestion in modern cities is exacerbated by the limitations of traditional fixed-time traffic signal systems, which fail to adapt to dynamic traffic patterns. Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) algorithms have emerged as a solution by dynamically adjusting signal timing based on real-time traffic conditions. However, the main limitation of such methods is that they are not transferable to environments under real-world constraints, such as balancing efficiency, minimizing collisions, and ensuring fairness across intersections. In this paper, we view the ATSC problem as a constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem and propose a novel algorithm named Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization with Lagrange Cost Estimator (MAPPO-LCE) to produce effective traffic signal control policies. Our approach integrates the Lagrange multipliers method to balance rewards and constraints, with a cost estimator for stable adjustment. We also introduce three constraints on the traffic network: GreenTime, GreenSkip, and PhaseSkip, which penalize traffic policies that do not conform to real-world scenarios. Our experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MAPPO-LCE outperforms three baseline MARL algorithms by across all environments and traffic constraints (improving on MAPPO by 12.60%, IPPO by 10.29%, and QTRAN by 13.10%). Our results show that constrained MARL is a valuable tool for traffic planners to deploy scalable and efficient ATSC methods in real-world traffic networks.

      <title>InfoBid: A Simulation Framework for Studying Information Disclosure in Auctions with Large Language Model-based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In online advertising systems, publishers often face a trade-off in information disclosure strategies: while disclosing more information can enhance efficiency by enabling optimal allocation of ad impressions, it may lose revenue potential by decreasing uncertainty among competing advertisers. Similar to other challenges in market design, understanding this trade-off is constrained by limited access to real-world data, leading researchers and practitioners to turn to simulation frameworks. The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers a novel approach to simulations, providing human-like reasoning and adaptability without necessarily relying on explicit assumptions about agent behavior modeling. Despite their potential, existing frameworks have yet to integrate LLM-based agents for studying information asymmetry and signaling strategies, particularly in the context of auctions. To address this gap, we introduce InfoBid, a flexible simulation framework that leverages LLM agents to examine the effects of information disclosure strategies in multi-agent auction settings. Using GPT-4o, we implemented simulations of second-price auctions with diverse information schemas. The results reveal key insights into how signaling influences strategic behavior and auction outcomes, which align with both economic and social learning theories. Through InfoBid, we hope to foster the use of LLMs as proxies for human economic and social agents in empirical studies, enhancing our understanding of their capabilities and limitations. This work bridges the gap between theoretical market designs and practical applications, advancing research in market simulations, information design, and agent-based reasoning while offering a valuable tool for exploring the dynamics of digital economies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Communication encryption is crucial in computer technology, but existing algorithms struggle with balancing cost and security. We propose EncGPT, a multi-agent framework using large language models (LLM). It includes rule, encryption, and decryption agents that generate encryption rules and apply them dynamically. This approach addresses gaps in LLM-based multi-agent systems for communication security. We tested GPT-4o's rule generation and implemented a substitution encryption workflow with homomorphism preservation, achieving an average execution time of 15.99 seconds.</description>

      <title>SPIO: Ensemble and Selective Strategies via LLM-Based Multi-Agent Planning in Automated Data Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized automated data analytics and machine learning by enabling dynamic reasoning and adaptability. While recent approaches have advanced multi-stage pipelines through multi-agent systems, they typically rely on rigid, single-path workflows that limit the exploration and integration of diverse strategies, often resulting in suboptimal predictions. To address these challenges, we propose SPIO (Sequential Plan Integration and Optimization), a novel framework that leverages LLM-driven decision-making to orchestrate multi-agent planning across four key modules: data preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, and hyperparameter tuning. In each module, dedicated planning agents independently generate candidate strategies that cascade into subsequent stages, fostering comprehensive exploration. A plan optimization agent refines these strategies by suggesting several optimized plans. We further introduce two variants: SPIO-S, which selects a single best solution path as determined by the LLM, and SPIO-E, which selects the top k candidate plans and ensembles them to maximize predictive performance. Extensive experiments on Kaggle and OpenML datasets demonstrate that SPIO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing a robust and scalable solution for automated data science task.</description>

      <title>Get the Agents Drunk: Memory Perturbations in Autonomous Agent-based Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model-based agents are increasingly used in recommender systems (Agent4RSs) to achieve personalized behavior modeling. Specifically, Agent4RSs introduces memory mechanisms that enable the agents to autonomously learn and self-evolve from real-world interactions. However, to the best of our knowledge, how robust Agent4RSs are remains unexplored. As such, in this paper, we propose the first work to attack Agent4RSs by perturbing agents' memories, not only to uncover their limitations but also to enhance their security and robustness, ensuring the development of safer and more reliable AI agents.
  Given the security and privacy concerns, it is more practical to launch attacks under a black-box setting, where the accurate knowledge of the victim models cannot be easily obtained. Moreover, the practical attacks are often stealthy to maximize the impact. To this end, we propose a novel practical attack framework named DrunkAgent. DrunkAgent consists of a generation module, a strategy module, and a surrogate module. The generation module aims to produce effective and coherent adversarial textual triggers, which can be used to achieve attack objectives such as promoting the target items. The strategy module is designed to `get the target agents drunk' so that their memories cannot be effectively updated during the interaction process. As such, the triggers can play the best role. Both of the modules are optimized on the surrogate module to improve the transferability and imperceptibility of the attacks. By identifying and analyzing the vulnerabilities, our work provides critical insights that pave the way for building safer and more resilient Agent4RSs. Extensive experiments across various real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DrunkAgent.</description>

      <title>GenSwarm: Scalable Multi-Robot Code-Policy Generation and Deployment via Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of control policies for multi-robot systems traditionally follows a complex and labor-intensive process, often lacking the flexibility to adapt to dynamic tasks. This has motivated research on methods to automatically create control policies. However, these methods require iterative processes of manually crafting and refining objective functions, thereby prolonging the development cycle. This work introduces \textit{GenSwarm}, an end-to-end system that leverages large language models to automatically generate and deploy control policies for multi-robot tasks based on simple user instructions in natural language. As a multi-language-agent system, GenSwarm achieves zero-shot learning, enabling rapid adaptation to altered or unseen tasks. The white-box nature of the code policies ensures strong reproducibility and interpretability. With its scalable software and hardware architectures, GenSwarm supports efficient policy deployment on both simulated and real-world multi-robot systems, realizing an instruction-to-execution end-to-end functionality that could prove valuable for robotics specialists and non-specialists alike.The code of the proposed GenSwarm system is available online: https://github.com/WindyLab/GenSwarm.</description>

      <title>Consensus on Open Multi-Agent Systems Over Graphs Sampled from Graphons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how graphons can be used to model and analyze open multi-agent systems, which are multi-agent systems subject to arrivals and departures, in the specific case of linear consensus. First, we analyze the case of replacements, where under the assumption of a deterministic interval between two replacements, we derive an upper bound for the disagreement in expectation. Then, we study the case of arrivals and departures, where we define a process for the evolution of the number of agents that guarantees a minimum and a maximum number of agents. Next, we derive an upper bound for the disagreement in expectation, and we establish a link with the spectrum of the expected graph used to generate the graph topologies. Finally, for stochastic block model (SBM) graphons, we prove that the computation of the spectrum of the expected graph can be performed based on a matrix whose dimension depends only on the graphon and it is independent of the number of agents.</description>

      <title>Towards Scientific Intelligence: A Survey of LLM-based Scientific Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As scientific research becomes increasingly complex, innovative tools are needed to manage vast data, facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration, and accelerate discovery. Large language models (LLMs) are now evolving into LLM-based scientific agents that automate critical tasks, ranging from hypothesis generation and experiment design to data analysis and simulation. Unlike general-purpose LLMs, these specialized agents integrate domain-specific knowledge, advanced tool sets, and robust validation mechanisms, enabling them to handle complex data types, ensure reproducibility, and drive scientific breakthroughs. This survey provides a focused review of the architectures, design, benchmarks, applications, and ethical considerations surrounding LLM-based scientific agents. We highlight why they differ from general agents and the ways in which they advance research across various scientific fields. By examining their development and challenges, this survey offers a comprehensive roadmap for researchers and practitioners to harness these agents for more efficient, reliable, and ethically sound scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Ride-Sourcing Vehicle Rebalancing with Service Accessibility Guarantees via Constrained Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of ride-sourcing services such as Uber, Lyft, and Didi Chuxing has fundamentally reshaped urban transportation by offering flexible, on-demand mobility via mobile applications. Despite their convenience, these platforms confront significant operational challenges, particularly vehicle rebalancing - the strategic repositioning of thousands of vehicles to address spatiotemporal mismatches in supply and demand. Inadequate rebalancing results in prolonged rider waiting times, inefficient vehicle utilization, and inequitable distribution of services, leading to disparities in driver availability and income.
  To tackle these complexities, we introduce scalable continuous-state mean-field control (MFC) and reinforcement learning (MFRL) models that explicitly represent each vehicle's precise location and employ continuous repositioning actions guided by the distribution of other vehicles. To ensure equitable service distribution, an accessibility constraint is integrated within our optimal control formulation, balancing operational efficiency with equitable access to the service across geographic regions. Our approach acknowledges realistic conditions, including inherent stochasticity in transitions, the simultaneous occurrence of vehicle-rider matching, vehicles' rebalancing and cruising, and variability in rider behaviors. Crucially, we relax the traditional mean-field assumption of equal supply-demand volume, better reflecting practical scenarios. Extensive empirical evaluation using real-world data-driven simulation of Shenzhen demonstrates the real-time efficiency and robustness of our approach at the scale of tens of thousands of vehicles.

      <title>PAARS: Persona Aligned Agentic Retail Shoppers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In e-commerce, behavioral data is collected for decision making which can be costly and slow. Simulation with LLM powered agents is emerging as a promising alternative for representing human population behavior. However, LLMs are known to exhibit certain biases, such as brand bias, review rating bias and limited representation of certain groups in the population, hence they need to be carefully benchmarked and aligned to user behavior. Ultimately, our goal is to synthesise an agent population and verify that it collectively approximates a real sample of humans. To this end, we propose a framework that: (i) creates synthetic shopping agents by automatically mining personas from anonymised historical shopping data, (ii) equips agents with retail-specific tools to synthesise shopping sessions and (iii) introduces a novel alignment suite measuring distributional differences between humans and shopping agents at the group (i.e. population) level rather than the traditional "individual" level. Experimental results demonstrate that using personas improves performance on the alignment suite, though a gap remains to human behaviour. We showcase an initial application of our framework for automated agentic A/B testing and compare the findings to human results. Finally, we discuss applications, limitations and challenges setting the stage for impactful future work.</description>

      <title>Pro-Routing: Proactive Routing of Autonomous Multi-Capacity Robots for Pickup-and-Delivery Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a multi-robot setting, where we have a fleet of multi-capacity autonomous robots that must service spatially distributed pickup-and-delivery requests with fixed maximum wait times. Requests can be either scheduled ahead of time or they can enter the system in real-time. In this setting, stability for a routing policy is defined as the cost of the policy being uniformly bounded over time. Most previous work either solve the problem offline to theoretically maintain stability or they consider dynamically arriving requests at the expense of the theoretical guarantees on stability. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by proposing a novel proactive rollout-based routing framework that adapts to real-time demand while still provably maintaining the stability of the learned routing policy. We derive provable stability guarantees for our method by proposing a fleet sizing algorithm that obtains a sufficiently large fleet that ensures stability by construction. To validate our theoretical results, we consider a case study on real ride requests for Harvard's evening Van System. We also evaluate the performance of our framework using the currently deployed smaller fleet size. In this smaller setup, we compare against the currently deployed routing algorithm, greedy heuristics, and Monte-Carlo-Tree-Search-based algorithms. Our empirical results show that our framework maintains stability when we use the sufficiently large fleet size found in our theoretical results. For the smaller currently deployed fleet size, our method services 6% more requests than the closest baseline while reducing median passenger wait times by 33%.</description>

Abstract: We introduce UniOcc, a comprehensive, unified benchmark for occupancy forecasting (i.e., predicting future occupancies based on historical information) and current-frame occupancy prediction from camera images. UniOcc unifies data from multiple real-world datasets (i.e., nuScenes, Waymo) and high-fidelity driving simulators (i.e., CARLA, OpenCOOD), which provides 2D/3D occupancy labels with per-voxel flow annotations and support for cooperative autonomous driving. In terms of evaluation, unlike existing studies that rely on suboptimal pseudo labels for evaluation, UniOcc incorporates novel metrics that do not depend on ground-truth occupancy, enabling robust assessment of additional aspects of occupancy quality. Through extensive experiments on state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate that large-scale, diverse training data and explicit flow information significantly enhance occupancy prediction and forecasting performance.</description>

      <title>Teams of LLM Agents can Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM agents have become increasingly sophisticated, especially in the realm of cybersecurity. Researchers have shown that LLM agents can exploit real-world vulnerabilities when given a description of the vulnerability and toy capture-the-flag problems. However, these agents still perform poorly on real-world vulnerabilities that are unknown to the agent ahead of time (zero-day vulnerabilities).
  In this work, we show that teams of LLM agents can exploit real-world, zero-day vulnerabilities. Prior agents struggle with exploring many different vulnerabilities and long-range planning when used alone. To resolve this, we introduce HPTSA, a system of agents with a planning agent that can launch subagents. The planning agent explores the system and determines which subagents to call, resolving long-term planning issues when trying different vulnerabilities. We construct a benchmark of 14 real-world vulnerabilities and show that our team of agents improve over prior agent frameworks by up to 4.3X.</description>

      <title>Collisionless and Decentralized Formation Control for Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.13621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A decentralized feedback controller for multi-agent systems, inspired by vehicle platooning, is proposed. The closed loop resulting from the decentralized control action has three distinctive features: the generation of collision-free trajectories, flocking of the system towards a consensus state in velocity, and asymptotic convergence to a prescribed pattern of distances between agents. For each feature, a rigorous dynamical analysis is provided, yielding a characterization of the set of parameters and initial configurations where collision avoidance, flocking, and pattern formation are guaranteed. Numerical tests assess the theoretical results presented.</description>

      <title>An impossibility theorem concerning positive involvement in voting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05657v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In social choice theory with ordinal preferences, a voting method satisfies the axiom of positive involvement if adding to a preference profile a voter who ranks an alternative uniquely first cannot cause that alternative to go from winning to losing. In this note, we prove a new impossibility theorem concerning this axiom: there is no ordinal voting method satisfying positive involvement that also satisfies the Condorcet winner and loser criteria, resolvability, and a common invariance property for Condorcet methods, namely that the choice of winners depends only on the ordering of majority margins by size.</description>

      <title>Distributed Fractional Bayesian Learning for Adaptive Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a distributed adaptive optimization problem, where all agents only have access to their local cost functions with a common unknown parameter, whereas they mean to collaboratively estimate the true parameter and find the optimal solution over a connected network. A general mathematical framework for such a problem has not been studied yet. We aim to provide valuable insights for addressing parameter uncertainty in distributed optimization problems and simultaneously find the optimal solution. Thus, we propose a novel Prediction while Optimization scheme, which utilizes distributed fractional Bayesian learning through weighted averaging on the log-beliefs to update the beliefs of unknown parameters, and distributed gradient descent for renewing the estimation of the optimal solution. Then under suitable assumptions, we prove that all agents' beliefs and decision variables converge almost surely to the true parameter and the optimal solution under the true parameter, respectively. We further establish a sublinear convergence rate for the belief sequence. Finally, numerical experiments are implemented to corroborate the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Learning Multi-Agent Loco-Manipulation for Long-Horizon Quadrupedal Pushing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07104v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, quadrupedal locomotion has achieved significant success, but their manipulation capabilities, particularly in handling large objects, remain limited, restricting their usefulness in demanding real-world applications such as search and rescue, construction, industrial automation, and room organization. This paper tackles the task of obstacle-aware, long-horizon pushing by multiple quadrupedal robots. We propose a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with three levels of control. The high-level controller integrates an RRT planner and a centralized adaptive policy to generate subgoals, while the mid-level controller uses a decentralized goal-conditioned policy to guide the robots toward these sub-goals. A pre-trained low-level locomotion policy executes the movement commands. We evaluate our method against several baselines in simulation, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline approaches, with 36.0% higher success rates and 24.5% reduction in completion time than the best baseline. Our framework successfully enables long-horizon, obstacle-aware manipulation tasks like Push-Cuboid and Push-T on Go1 robots in the real world.</description>

      <title>Controllable Latent Diffusion for Traffic Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11771v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The validation of autonomous driving systems benefits greatly from the ability to generate scenarios that are both realistic and precisely controllable. Conventional approaches, such as real-world test drives, are not only expensive but also lack the flexibility to capture targeted edge cases for thorough evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose a controllable latent diffusion that guides the training of diffusion models via reinforcement learning to automatically generate a diverse and controllable set of driving scenarios for virtual testing. Our approach removes the reliance on large-scale real-world data by generating complex scenarios whose properties can be finely tuned to challenge and assess autonomous vehicle systems. Experimental results show that our approach has the lowest collision rate of $0.098$ and lowest off-road rate of $0.096$, demonstrating superiority over existing baselines. The proposed approach significantly improves the realism, stability and controllability of the generated scenarios, enabling more nuanced safety evaluation of autonomous vehicles.</description>

      <title>Data Spatial Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel programming model, Data Spatial Programming, which extends the semantics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by introducing new class-like constructs called archetypes. These archetypes encapsulate the topological relationships between data entities and the execution flow in a structured manner, enabling more expressive and semantically rich computations over interconnected data structures or finite states. By formalizing the relationships between data elements in this topological space, our approach allows for more intuitive modeling of complex systems where a topology of connections is formed for the underlying computational model. This paradigm addresses limitations in traditional OOP when representing a wide range of problems in computer science such as agent-based systems, social networks, processing on relational data, neural networks, distributed systems, finite state machines, and other spatially-oriented computational problems.</description>
