      <title>Information flow in multilayer perceptrons: an in-depth analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysing how information flows along the layers of a multilayer perceptron is a topic of paramount importance in the field of artificial neural networks. After framing the problem from the point of view of information theory, in this position article a specific investigation is conducted on the way information is processed, with particular reference to the requirements imposed by supervised learning. To this end, the concept of information matrix is devised and then used as formal framework for understanding the aetiology of optimisation strategies and for studying the information flow. The underlying research for this article has also produced several key outcomes: i) the definition of a parametric optimisation strategy, ii) the finding that the optimisation strategy proposed in the information bottleneck framework shares strong similarities with the one derived from the information matrix, and iii) the insight that a multilayer perceptron serves as a kind of "adaptor", meant to process the input according to the given objective.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving Error-Correcting Codes for Polynomial Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern FFT/NTT analytics, coded computation, and privacy-preserving ML interface routinely move polynomial frames across NICs, storage, and accelerators. However, even rare silent data corruption (SDC) can flip a few ring coefficients and cascade through downstream arithmetic. Conventional defenses are ill-matched to current low-latency pipelines: detect-and-retransmit adds RTTs, while byte-stream ECC ignores the algebraic structure and forces format conversions. To that end, we propose a structure-preserving reliability layer that operates in the encoded data's original polynomial ring, adds a small amount of systematic redundancy, and corrects symbol errors/flagged erasures without round-trip or format changes. We construct two complementary schemes: one for odd length $N_{odd}$ via a Hensel-lifted BCH ideal with an idempotent encoder, and one for power-of-two length $N_{2^m}$ via a repeated-root negacyclic code with derivative-style decoding. In particular, to stay robust against clustered errors, a ring automorphism provides in-place interleaving to disperse bursts. Implementation wise, on four frame sizes $N\!=\!1024, 2048, 4096, 8192$, we meet a per-frame failure target of $10^{-9}$ at symbol error rates $10^{-6}\text{--}10^{-5}$ with $t\!=\!8\text{--}9$, incurring only $0.20\%\text{--}1.56\%$ overhead and tolerating $\sim\!32\text{--}72$\,B unknown-error bursts (roughly doubled when flagged as erasures) after interleaving. By aligning error correction with ring semantics, we take a practical step toward deployable robustness for polynomial-frame computations from an algebraic coding perspective.</description>

      <title>Location-Aided Distributed Beamforming for Near-Field Communications with Element-Wise RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) emerges as an effective technique to resist the double-fading attenuation of passive RIS. By embedding with power harvesting function, it further evolves to zero-power active RIS, which can effectively enhance the flexibility of RIS deployment without external power demand. Nevertheless, existing works neglected the inherent difficulty of channel estimation (CE) for RIS-assisted systems, and the discrete phase shift constraint in practical deployment. In this paper we design a new element-wise RIS architecture and propose a distributed location-aided transmission scheme with low complexity to enhance the reflected gain for channel state information (CSI)-limited RIS-assisted near-field communications. Specifically, the new element-wise RIS provides dynamic element selection capability with low hardware resources. Based on Fresnel diffraction theory, we construct the mapping from locations in space-domain to phase distributions of waves in phase-domain and reveal the priority of elements for harvesting and reflecting. {Then, the distributed beamforming design with the phase of determine-then-align is proposed, where the estimation overhead reduction stems from exempted requirements of RIS-associated CE at base station (BS).} The asymptotic analysis indicates that the proposed scheme can achieve the optimal gain with a fixed proportion of reflective elements when RIS is large, followed by simulations to verify its superiority to other protocols.</description>

      <title>Spatial Computing Communications for Multi-User Virtual Reality in Distributed Mobile Edge Computing Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Immersive virtual reality (VR) applications impose stringent requirements on latency, energy efficiency, and computational resources, particularly in multi-user interactive scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of spatial computing communications (SCC), a framework designed to meet the latency and energy demands of multi-user VR over distributed mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. SCC jointly represents the physical space, defined by users and base stations, and the virtual space, representing shared immersive environments, using a probabilistic model of user dynamics and resource requirements. The resource deployment task is then formulated as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) problem that simultaneously minimizes system latency and energy consumption across distributed MEC resources. To solve this problem, we propose MO-CMPO, a multi-objective consistency model with policy optimization that integrates supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning guided by preference weights. Leveraging a sparse graph neural network (GNN), MO-CMPO efficiently generates Pareto-optimal solutions. Simulations with real-world New Radio base station datasets demonstrate that MO-CMPO achieves superior hypervolume performance and significantly lower inference latency than baseline methods. Furthermore, the analysis reveals practical deployment patterns: latency-oriented solutions favor local MEC execution to reduce transmission delay, while energy-oriented solutions minimize redundant placements to save energy.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Enabled Channel Signature Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes RIS-enabled channel signature modulation (RIS-CSM), a lightweight index modulation scheme for reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS). An N-element RIS is partitioned into disjoint groups, each employing predetermined binary reflection patterns to generate distinct channel signatures at an $n_R$-antenna receiver, without RIS-side beamforming. Information is embedded in the indices of these signatures, enabling simple channel estimation and scalable spectral efficiency. A closed-form upper bound on error probability and capacity analysis are derived, revealing diversity order $n_R$ and coding gain proportional to N. Simulation results under Rayleigh fading validate the theoretical analysis. Moreover, simulations indicate that spatial correlation among RIS elements can improve system performance at low spectral efficiency.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic number of equivalence classes of linear codes with given dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic number of equivalence classes of linear codes with prescribed length and dimension. While the total number of inequivalent codes of a given length has been studied previously, the case where the dimension varies as a function of the length has not yet been considered. We derive explicit asymptotic formulas for the number of equivalence classes under three standard notions of equivalence, for a fixed alphabet size and increasing length. Our approach also yields an exact asymptotic expression for the sum of all q-binomial coefficients, which is of independent interest and answers an open question in this context. Finally, we establish a natural connection between these asymptotic quantities and certain discrete Gaussian distributions arising from Brownian motion, providing a probabilistic interpretation of our results.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Antenna-Enhanced Beamforming: Signal Enhancement and Interference Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional beamforming with fixed-orientation antenna (FOA) arrays may struggle to effectively enhance signal and/or suppress interference due to significant variations in antenna directive gains over different steering angles. To break this limitation, we investigate in this paper the rotatable antenna (RA)-enhanced single/multi-beam forming by exploiting the new spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) via antennas' rotation optimization. Specifically, the antenna rotation vector (ARV) and antenna weight vector (AWV) are jointly optimized to maximize the minimum array gain over signal directions, subject to a given constraint on the maximum array gain over interference directions. For the special case of single-beam forming without interference, the optimal ARV is derived in closed-form with the maximum ratio combining (MRC) beamformer applied to the AWV. For the general case of multi-beam forming, we propose an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to find a high-quality suboptimal solution by iteratively optimizing one of the ARV and AWV with the other being fixed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RA-based scheme can significantly outperform the traditional FOA-based and isotropic antenna (IA)-based schemes in terms of array gain.</description>

      <title>Task-Based Quantization for Channel Estimation in RIS Empowered MmWave Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate channel estimation for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) empowered millimeter-wave (mmWave) multi-user single-input multiple-output communication systems using low-resolution quantization. Due to the high cost and power consumption of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) in large antenna arrays and for wide signal bandwidths, designing mmWave systems with low-resolution ADCs is beneficial. To tackle this issue, we propose a channel estimation design using task-based quantization that considers the underlying hybrid analog and digital architecture in order to improve the system performance under finite bit-resolution constraints. Our goal is to accomplish a channel estimation task that minimizes the mean squared error distortion between the true and estimated channel. We develop two types of channel estimators: a cascaded channel estimator for an RIS with purely passive elements, and an estimator for the separate RIS-related channels that leverages additional information from a few semi-passive elements at the RIS capable of processing the received signals with radio frequency chains. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed channel estimation designs exploiting task-based quantization outperform purely digital methods and can effectively approach the performance of a system with unlimited resolution ADCs. Furthermore, the proposed channel estimators are shown to be superior to baselines with small training overhead.</description>

      <title>Rate-Adaptive Spatially Coupled MacKay-Neal Codes with Thresholds Close to Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze by density evolution the asymptotic performance of rate-adaptive MacKay-Neal (MN) code ensembles, where the inner code is a protograph spatially coupled (SC) low-density parity-check code. By resorting to a suitably-defined parallel channel model, we compute belief propagation decoding thresholds, showing that SC MN code ensembles can perform within 0.15 dB from the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise capacity over the full [0,1] rate range.</description>

      <title>Rate-Adaptive Protograph-Based MacKay-Neal Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rate-adaptive MacKay-Neal (MN) codes based on protographs are analyzed. The code construction employs an outer distribution matcher (DM) to adapt the rate of the scheme. The DM is coupled with an inner protograph-based low-density parity-check (LDPC) code. The performance achievable by the resulting code structure, that is nonlinear, is studied by means of an equivalent communication model that reduces the problem to the analysis of the inner (linear) LDPC code with transmission that takes place in parallel over the communication channel, and over a suitably defined binary symmetric channel. A density evolution analysis of protograph MN code ensembles is outlined, and it is complemented by an error floor analysis that relies on the derivation of the average input-output weight distribution of the inner LDPC code ensemble. Conditions on the shape of the normalized logarithmic asymptotic input-output weight distribution are defined, which allow discarding code ensembles with bad error floor properties during the code design phase. Examples of code designs are provided, showing how the use of a single LDPC code ensemble allows operating within 1 dB from the Shannon limit over a wide range of code rates, where the code rate is selected by tuning the DM parameters. By enabling rate flexibility with a constant blocklength, and with a fixed LDPC code as inner code, the construction provides an appealing solution for very high-throughput wireless (optical) links that employ binary-input modulations.</description>

      <title>The Whole Is Less than the Sum of Parts: Subsystem Inconsistency in Partial Information Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial Information Decomposition (PID) was proposed by Williams and Beer in 2010 as a tool for analyzing fine-grained interactions between multiple random variables, and has since found numerous applications ranging from neuroscience to privacy. However, a unified theoretical framework remains elusive due to key conceptual and technical challenges. We identify and illustrate a crucial problem: PID violates the set-theoretic principle that the whole equals the sum of its parts (WESP). Through a counterexample in a three-variable system, we demonstrate how such violations naturally arise, revealing a fundamental limitation of current lattice-based PID frameworks. To address this issue, we introduce a new axiomatic framework, termed System Information Decomposition (SID), specifically tailored for three-variable systems. SID resolves the WESP violation by redefining the summation rules of decomposed information atoms based on synergistic relationships. However, we further show that for systems with four or more variables, no partial summation approach within the existing lattice-based structures can fully eliminate WESP inconsistencies. Our results thus highlight the inherent inadequacy of (antichain) lattice-based decompositions for general multivariate systems.</description>

      <title>Minimum Hellinger Distance Estimators for Complex Survey Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable inference from complex survey samples can be derailed by outliers and high-leverage observations induced by unequal inclusion probabilities and calibration. We develop a minimum Hellinger distance estimator (MHDE) for parametric superpopulation models under complex designs, including Poisson PPS and fixed-size SRS/PPS without replacement, with possibly stochastic post-stratified or calibrated weights. Using a Horvitz-Thompson-adjusted kernel density plug-in, we show: (i) $L^1$-consistency of the KDE with explicit large-deviation tail bounds driven by a variance-adaptive effective sample size; (ii) uniform exponential bounds for the Hellinger affinity that yield MHDE consistency under mild identifiability; (iii) an asymptotic Normal distribution for the MHDE with covariance $\mathbf A^{-1}\boldsymbol\Sigma \mathbf A^{\intercal}$ (and a finite-population correction under without-replacement designs); and (iv) robustness via the influence function and $\alpha$-influence curves in the Hellinger topology. Simulations under Gamma and lognormal superpopulation models quantify efficiency-robustness trade-offs relative to weighted MLE under independent and high-leverage contamination. An application to NHANES 2021-2023 total water consumption shows that the MHDE remains stable despite extreme responses that markedly bias the MLE. The estimator is simple to implement via quadrature over a fixed grid and is extensible to other divergence families.</description>

      <title>Generalized Pinching-Antenna Systems: A Tutorial on Principles, Design Strategies, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems have emerged as a novel and transformative flexible-antenna architecture for next-generation wireless networks. They offer unprecedented flexibility and spatial reconfigurability by enabling dynamic positioning and activation of radiating elements along a signal-guiding medium (e.g., dielectric waveguides), which is not possible with conventional fixed antenna systems. In this paper, we introduce the concept of generalized pinching antenna systems, which retain the core principle of creating localized radiation points on demand, but can be physically realized in a variety of settings. These include implementations based on dielectric waveguides, leaky coaxial cables, surface-wave guiding structures, and other types of media, employing different feeding methods and activation mechanisms (e.g., mechanical, electronic, or hybrid). Despite differences in their physical realizations, they all share the same inherent ability to form, reposition, or deactivate radiation sites as needed, enabling user-centric and dynamic coverage. We first describe the underlying physical mechanisms of representative generalized pinching-antenna realizations and their associated wireless channel models, highlighting their unique propagation and reconfigurability characteristics compared with conventional antennas. Then, we review several representative pinching-antenna system architectures, ranging from single- to multiple-waveguide configurations, and discuss advanced design strategies tailored to these flexible deployments. Furthermore, we examine their integration with emerging wireless technologies to enable synergistic, user-centric solutions. Finally, we identify key open research challenges and outline future directions, charting a pathway toward the practical deployment of generalized pinching antennas in next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Integrated Massive Communication and Target Localization in 6G Cell-Free Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an initial investigation into the combination of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) and massive communication, both of which are largely regarded as key scenarios in sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. Specifically, we consider a cell-free network comprising a large number of users, multiple targets, and distributed base stations (BSs). In each time slot, a random subset of users becomes active, transmitting pilot signals that can be scattered by the targets before reaching the BSs. Unlike conventional massive random access schemes, where the primary objectives are device activity detection and channel estimation, our framework also enables target localization by leveraging the multipath propagation effects introduced by the targets. However, due to the intricate dependency between user channels and target locations, characterizing the posterior distribution required for minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimation presents significant computational challenges. To handle this problem, we propose a hybrid message passing-based framework that incorporates multiple approximations to mitigate computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high-accuracy device activity detection, channel estimation, and target localization simultaneously, validating the feasibility of embedding localization functionality into massive communication systems for future 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Decoding Balanced Linear Codes With Preprocessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prange's information set algorithm is a decoding algorithm for arbitrary linear codes. It decodes corrupted codewords of any $\mathbb{F}_2$-linear code $C$ of message length $n$ up to relative error rate $O(\log n / n)$ in $\mathsf{poly}(n)$ time. We show that the error rate can be improved to $O((\log n)^2 / n)$, provided: (1) the decoder has access to a polynomial-length advice string that depends on $C$ only, and (2) $C$ is $n^{-\Omega(1)}$-balanced.
  As a consequence we improve the error tolerance in decoding random linear codes if inefficient preprocessing of the code is allowed. This reveals potential vulnerabilities in cryptographic applications of Learning Noisy Parities with low noise rate.
  Our main technical result is that the Hamming weight of $Hw$, where $H$ is a random sample of *short dual* codewords, measures the proximity of a word $w$ to the code in the regime of interest. Given such $H$ as advice, our algorithm corrects errors by locally minimizing this measure. We show that for most codes, the error rate tolerated by our decoder is asymptotically optimal among all algorithms whose decision is based on thresholding $Hw$ for an arbitrary polynomial-size advice matrix $H$.</description>

      <title>Anti-Interference Communication Using Computational Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter proposes a novel anti-interference communication method leveraging computational antennas, utilizing time averaging and 1-bit reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) to achieve robust signal modulation with minimal hardware complexity. We develop a communication model for computational antennas and propose an efficient signal processing algorithm optimized for temporal modulation. A USRP-based experimental platform is established to validate the approach under strong interference conditions (e.g., 5 dB jamming-to-signal ratio). Experimental results reveal up to an 80.9\% reduction in bit error rate (BER) and effective restoration of distorted images in transmission tests. Compared to conventional techniques like spread spectrum or frequency hopping, which require significant spectral resources, our method offers superior anti-interference performance without additional spectral overhead. This research provides valuable insights for radar detection, military communications, and next-generation wireless networks.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the error rate performance and low-complexity receiver design for zero-padded affine frequency division multiplexing (ZP-AFDM) systems. By exploiting the unique ZP-aided lower triangular structure of the time domain (TD) channel matrix, we propose {a novel low-complexity} minimum mean square error (MMSE) detector and {a} maximum ratio combining-based TD (MRC-TD) detector. Furthermore, the theoretical bit error rate (BER) {performance} of both MMSE and maximum likelihood detectors {is} analyzed. Simulation results demonstrate {that} the proposed detectors can achieve identical BER performance to that of {the conventional MMSE detector based on matrix inversion} while {enjoying significantly reduced complexity.}</description>

      <title>The Gatekeeper Knows Enough</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents, yet their practical utility is fundamentally constrained by a limited context window and state desynchronization resulting from the LLMs' stateless nature and inefficient context management. These limitations lead to unreliable output, unpredictable behavior, and inefficient resource usage, particularly when interacting with large, structured, and sensitive knowledge systems such as codebases and documents. To address these challenges, we introduce the Gatekeeper Protocol, a novel, domain-agnostic framework that governs agent-system interactions. Our protocol mandates that the agent first operate and reason on a minimalist, low-fidelity "latent state" representation of the system to strategically request high-fidelity context on demand. All interactions are mediated through a unified JSON format that serves as a declarative, state-synchronized protocol, ensuring the agent's model of the system remains verifiably grounded in the system's reality. We demonstrate the efficacy of this protocol with Sage, a reference implementation of the Gatekeeper Protocol for software development. Our results show that this approach significantly increases agent reliability, improves computational efficiency by minimizing token consumption, and enables scalable interaction with complex systems, creating a foundational methodology for building more robust, predictable, and grounded AI agents for any structured knowledge domain.</description>

      <title>The Principle of Uncertain Maximum Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09868v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Principle of Maximum Entropy is a rigorous technique for estimating an unknown distribution given partial information while simultaneously minimizing bias. However, an important requirement for applying the principle is that the available information be provided error-free (Jaynes 1982). We relax this requirement using a memoryless communication channel as a framework to derive a new, more general principle. We show our new principle provides an upper bound on the entropy of the unknown distribution and the amount of information lost due to the use of a given communications channel is unknown unless the unknown distribution's entropy is also known. Using our new principle we provide a new interpretation of the classic principle and experimentally show its performance relative to the classic principle and other generally applicable solutions. Finally, we present a simple algorithm for solving our new principle and an approximation useful when samples are limited.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Rank-$1$ Regularization for Iterative Inversion of Ill-Conditioned MIMO Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15334v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While iterative matrix inversion methods excel in computational efficiency, memory optimization, and support for parallel and distributed computing when managing large matrices, their limitations are also evident in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading channels. These methods encounter challenges related to slow convergence and diminished accuracy, especially in ill-conditioned scenarios, hindering their application in future MIMO networks such as extra-large aperture array. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel matrix regularization method termed symmetric rank-$1$ regularization (SR-$1$R). The proposed method functions by augmenting the channel matrix with a symmetric rank-$1$ matrix, with the primary goal of minimizing the condition number of the resultant regularized matrix. This significantly improves the matrix condition, enabling fast and accurate iterative inversion of the regularized matrix. Then, the inverse of the original channel matrix is obtained by applying the Sherman-Morrison transform on the outcome of iterative inversions. Our eigenvalue analysis unveils the best channel condition that can be achieved by an optimized SR-$1$R matrix. Moreover, a power iteration-assisted (PIA) approach is proposed to find the optimum SR-$1$R matrix without need of eigenvalue decomposition. The proposed approach exhibits logarithmic algorithm-depth in parallel computing for MIMO precoding. Finally, computer simulations demonstrate that SR-$1$R has the potential to reduce the required iteration by up to $35\%$ while achieving the performance of regularized zero-forcing.</description>

      <title>Generating High Dimensional User-Specific Wireless Channels using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN)-based algorithms are emerging as an important tool for many physical and MAC layer functions in future wireless communication systems, including for large multi-antenna channels. However, training such models typically requires a large dataset of high-dimensional channel measurements, which are very difficult and expensive to obtain. This paper introduces a novel method for generating synthetic wireless channel data using diffusion-based models to produce user-specific channels that accurately reflect real-world wireless environments. Our approach employs a conditional denoising diffusion implicit model (cDDIM) framework, effectively capturing the relationship between user location and multi-antenna channel characteristics. We generate synthetic high fidelity channel samples using user positions as conditional inputs, creating larger augmented datasets to overcome measurement scarcity. The utility of this method is demonstrated through its efficacy in training various downstream tasks such as channel compression and beam alignment. Our diffusion-based augmentation approach achieves over a 1-2 dB gain in NMSE for channel compression, and an 11dB SNR boost in beamforming compared to prior methods, such as noise addition or the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs).</description>

      <title>Frequency-Selective Modeling and Analysis for OFDM-Integrated Wideband Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20636v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter investigates the integration of pinching-antenna systems (PASS) with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) to ensure their compatibility and to explore the frequency-selective behavior inherent to PASS. First, an end-to-end channel model for OFDM PASS is proposed based on electromagnetic-compliant modeling of waveguides and coupled-mode theory, which includes frequency-dependent waveguide attenuation, dispersion and antenna coupling effect. Furthermore, a critical dependence of the OFDM cyclic prefix (CP) overhead on the proximity of the operating frequency to the waveguide cutoff is revealed. Moreover, the phase misalignment effect across subcarriers in OFDM PASS is derived for an approximate pinching antenna location strategy based on path loss minimization, which reveals the phase misalignment is exacerbated for wider bandwidths and larger array size. Numerical results show that: 1) frequency-selective effects in OFDM PASS lead to substantial variations in subcarrier achievable rates, highlighting the necessity of operating above the waveguide cutoff frequency for effective communications; 2) waveguide dispersion mandates considerable CP overhead when operating near the cutoff frequency, severely impacting the spectral efficiency of OFDM PASS; and 3) the gentle linear waveguide attenuation in a practical PASS significantly more advantageous than the severe logarithmic path loss characteristic of fixed-location antennas.</description>

      <title>On Theoretical Interpretations of Concept-Based In-Context Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as an important new paradigm in natural language processing and large language model (LLM) applications. However, the theoretical understanding of the ICL mechanism remains limited. This paper aims to investigate this issue by studying a particular ICL approach, called concept-based ICL (CB-ICL). In particular, we propose theoretical analyses on applying CB-ICL to ICL tasks, which explains why and when the CB-ICL performs well for predicting query labels in prompts with only a few demonstrations. In addition, the proposed theory quantifies the knowledge that can be leveraged by the LLMs to the prompt tasks, and leads to a similarity measure between the prompt demonstrations and the query input, which provides important insights and guidance for model pre-training and prompt engineering in ICL. Moreover, the impact of the prompt demonstration size and the dimension of the LLM embeddings in ICL are also explored based on the proposed theory. Finally, several real-data experiments are conducted to validate the practical usefulness of CB-ICL and the corresponding theory.</description>

      <title>Simulating Mediumband Wireless Communication Systems: A Concise Description</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the necessary procedures for accurately simulating digital wireless communication systems operating in the mediumband, aimed at both beginners and experts. In the research literature, digital wireless communication systems are typically simulated in the discrete-time complex baseband domain, where pulse shaping, upconversion, mixing, carrier synchronization, and symbol timing synchronization are often ignored. These assumptions are indeed sufficient in most cases, but to capture the essence of communication in the mediumband, certain physical layer (PHY) operations should be simulated in detail. In this paper, we concisely describe how to simulate a mediumband wireless communication scenario from a single transmitter (TX) to a single receiver (RX) in MATLAB, elaborating the operation of key PHY subsystems. The approach described here ensures that the simulated system captures the delicate dynamics of mediumband wireless communication, including the effect of deep fading avoidance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.02507v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the positivity and causality axioms for Markov categories as properties of dilations and information flow in Markov categories, and in variations thereof for arbitrary semicartesian monoidal categories. These help us show that being a positive Markov category is merely an additional property of a symmetric monoidal category (rather than extra structure). We also characterize the positivity of representable Markov categories and prove that causality implies positivity, but not conversely. Finally, we note that positivity fails for quasi-Borel spaces and interpret this failure as a privacy property of probabilistic name generation.</description>

Abstract: We prove tight probabilistic bounds for the shortest vectors in module lattices over number fields using the results of arXiv:2308.15275. Moreover, establishing asymptotic formulae for counts of fixed rank matrices with algebraic integer entries and bounded Euclidean length, we prove an approximate Rogers integral formula for discrete sets of module lattices obtained from lifts of algebraic codes. This in turn implies that the moment estimates of arXiv:2308.15275 as well as the aforementioned bounds on the shortest vector also carry through for large enough discrete sets of module lattices.</description>

      <title>On Sum-Free Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A function from $\Bbb F_{2^n}$ to $\Bbb F_{2^n}$ is said to be {\em $k$th order sum-free} if the sum of its values over each $k$-dimensional $\Bbb F_2$-affine subspace of $\Bbb F_{2^n}$ is nonzero. This notion was recently introduced by C. Carlet as, among other things, a generalization of APN functions. At the center of this new topic is a conjecture about the sum-freedom of the multiplicative inverse function $f_{\text{\rm inv}}(x)=x^{-1}$ (with $0^{-1}$ defined to be $0$). It is known that $f_{\text{\rm inv}}$ is 2nd order (equivalently, $(n-2)$th order) sum-free if and only if $n$ is odd, and it is conjectured that for $3\le k\le n-3$, $f_{\text{\rm inv}}$ is never $k$th order sum-free. The conjecture has been confirmed for even $n$ but remains open for odd $n$. In the present paper, we show that the conjecture holds under each of the following conditions: (1) $n=13$; (2) $3\mid n$; (3) $5\mid n$; (4) the smallest prime divisor $l$ of $n$ satisfies $(l-1)(l+2)\le (n+1)/2$. We also determine the ``right'' $q$-ary generalization of the binary multiplicative inverse function $f_{\text{\rm inv}}$ in the context of sum-freedom. This $q$-ary generalization not only maintains most results for its binary version, but also exhibits some extraordinary phenomena that are not observed in the binary case.</description>

      <title>SIM-Enabled Hybrid Digital-Wave Beamforming for Fronthaul-Constrained Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the dense deployment of access points (APs) in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems presents significant challenges, per-AP coverage can be expanded using large-scale antenna arrays (LAAs). However, this approach incurs high implementation costs and substantial fronthaul demands due to the need for dedicated RF chains for all antennas. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid beamforming framework that integrates wave-domain beamforming via stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) with conventional digital processing. By dynamically manipulating electromagnetic waves, SIM-equipped APs enhance beamforming gains while significantly reducing RF chain requirements. We formulate a joint optimization problem for digital and wave-domain beamforming along with fronthaul compression to maximize the weighted sum-rate for both uplink and downlink transmission under finite-capacity fronthaul constraints. Given the high dimensionality and non-convexity of the problem, we develop alternating optimization-based algorithms that iteratively optimize digital and wave-domain variables. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid schemes outperform conventional hybrid schemes, that rely on randomly set wave-domain beamformers or restrict digital beamforming to simple power control. Moreover, the proposed scheme employing sufficiently deep SIMs achieves near fully-digital performance with fewer RF chains in the high signal-to-noise ratios regime.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical filtrations of line bundles and optimal algebraic geometry codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01859v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce \emph{hierarchical depth}, a new invariant of line bundles and divisors, defined via maximal chains of effective sub-line bundles. This notion gives rise to \emph{hierarchical filtrations}, refining the structure of the Picard group and providing new insights into the geometry of algebraic surfaces. We establish fundamental properties of hierarchical depth, derive inequalities through intersection theory and the Hodge index theorem, and characterize filtrations that are Hodge-tight.
  Using this framework, we develop a theory of \emph{hierarchical algebraic geometry codes}, constructed from evaluation spaces along these filtrations. This approach produces nested families of codes with controlled growth of parameters and identifies an optimal intermediate code maximizing a utility function balancing rate and minimum distance. Hierarchical depth thus provides a systematic method to construct AG codes with favorable asymptotic behavior, linking geometric and coding-theoretic perspectives.
  Our results establish new connections between line bundle theory, surface geometry, and coding theory, and suggest applications to generalized Goppa codes and higher-dimensional evaluation codes.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Temperature Induced by Adopted Regular Universal Turing Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that an effective temperature naturally emerges from the algorithmic structure of a regular universal Turing machine (UTM), without introducing any external physical parameter. In particular, the redundancy growth of the machine's wrapper language induces a Boltzmann--like exponential weighting over program lengths, yielding a canonical ensemble interpretation of algorithmic probability. This establishes a formal bridge between algorithmic information theory and statistical mechanics, in which the adopted UTM determines the intrinsic ``algorithmic temperature.'' We further show that this temperature approaches its maximal limit under the universal mixture (Solomonoff distribution), and discuss its epistemic meaning as the resolution level of an observer.</description>
