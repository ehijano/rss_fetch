      <title>Radiometric Interferometry for Deep Space Navigation using Geostationary Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep space navigation presents significant challenges due to the unavailability of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals and severe signal attenuation over interplanetary distances. Traditional terrestrial systems, such as NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) and ESA ESTRACK, rely on Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) for angular positioning. However, these systems are limited by relatively short baselines, atmospheric distortions requiring extensive calibration, and reduced visibility availability due to Earth rotation. This research proposes a complementary deep space navigation approach using space based interferometry, in which radio signals from the spacecraft are received and cross correlated onboard Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites. By replacing terrestrial VLBI stations with dual GEO platforms, the method significantly extends the effective baseline, removes atmospheric phase errors, and provides almost continuous visibility to deep space targets. Unlike Earth based systems, GEO based interferometry maintains persistent station mutual visibility, enabling higher measurement availability and more flexible mission support. A complete system model is presented, including the principles of dual frequency phase based angular tracking and a structured error budget analysis. Theoretical results show that the GEO based system achieves a total angular error of approximately 3.73 nanoradians, within the same order of magnitude as terrestrial VLBI. Space based architecture nearly doubles the geometrical availability for interferometric tracking, while eliminating atmospheric distortions. These findings support the feasibility of the GEO based VLBI concept and motivate continued research and field validation for future deep space navigation applications.</description>

      <title>Torqued Accelerator using Radiation from the Sun (TARS) for Interstellar Payloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of exploring space using solar power is energetically appealing, but interstellar solar sails typically require extremely low areal densities (~g/m^2). This work explores an alternative approach: storing solar energy as rotational kinetic energy, which is later released to propel a microprobe beyond the solar system. The proposed Torqued Accelerator using Radiation from the Sun (TARS) consists of two thin surfaces with contrasting albedos that gradually spins up over weeks to months while in a sub-Keplerian "quasite" orbit around the Sun. Though constrained by material strengths, careful design allows a phone-sized payload to reach interstellar velocities in less than a year, using commercially available materials (e.g. CNT sheets). The entire system spans tens of meters and weighs of order of a kilogram. Whilst there is no theoretical limit to the achievable speeds, practical designs grow exponentially in size as velocity targets increase, making interstellar flight feasible but relativistic speeds implausible. Several strategies, including the use of graphene sheets, gravity assists, the Oberth effect, and electrostatic confinement, could further maximise velocity. TARS is an attractive light sail technology when high-powered directed energy systems are impractical, offering a potentially low-cost solution for deploying small, sub-relativistic interstellar probes.</description>

      <title>In Situ Measurements of Dark Photon Dark Matter Using Parker Solar Probe: Going beyond the Radio Window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12285v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark photon dark matter (DPDM) emerges as a compelling candidate for ultralight bosonic dark matter, detectable through resonant conversion into photons within a plasma environment. This study employs in-situ measurements from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP), the first spacecraft to venture into the solar corona, to probe for DPDM signatures. The PSP in-situ measurements go beyond the traditional radio window, spanning frequencies between about 10 kHz and 20 MHz, a challenging range inaccessible to Earth-based radio astronomy. Additionally, the proximity of PSP to the resonant conversion location enhances the signal flux, providing a distinct advantage over ground-based observations. As a result, the PSP data establishes the most stringent constraints on the kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon$ for DPDM frequencies between 70 kHz and 20 MHz, with values of $\epsilon \lesssim 10^{-14}-10^{-13}$. Investigating the data from STEREO satellites resulted in weaker constraints compared to those obtained from PSP. By utilizing state-of-the-art solar observations from space, we have surpassed the cosmic microwave background limits derived from early-universe observations.</description>

      <title>A Unified Phenomenology of Ion Heating in Low-$\beta$ Plasmas: Test-Particle Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07015v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that stochastic and quasi-linear ion heating, often viewed as distinct processes in low-$\beta$ collisionless plasmas, are the far limits of a continuum controlled by nonlinear broadening of turbulent fluctuations, and thus by the normalized cross helicity. We propose a simple empirical formula that captures both regimes, generalizing that commonly used to describe stochastic heating. Simulations of test ions interacting with turbulence confirm our scalings across a wide range of different ion and turbulence properties, including with a steep ion-kinetic transition range as seen in the solar wind. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding ion heating processes across diverse astrophysical environments from black-hole accretion disks to the solar corona, also providing a compact and versatile subgrid model for larger-scale simulations.</description>
