      <title>Resnikoff silver numbers and tilings of the half-line (Dedicated to the memory of H.L.Resnikoff)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on work by H.L.Resnikoff we consider (Resnikoff) silver numbers, which generalize the familiar golden number. By definition, a silver number is the largest positive root of a certain polynomial called silver polynomial. In turn, a corresponding companion matrix of a silver polynomial gives rise to a well known construction of inflationary tilings of the (non-negative) real half-line, via an iteration of inflation and substitution. Resnikoff noted for the golden number $\phi$ that this tiling corresponds to the set of what he called $\phi$-integers. We generalize this result for a special class of silver numbers, the distinguished silver numbers, by showing that the integers for a distinguished silver number give rise to a tiling, of which we provide a precise description. For the general problem, whether the integers for an arbitrary silver number give rise to a tiling, we cannot give a general answer, but we show that tilings are obtained if and only if the differences of silver integers satisfy a (rather weak looking) non-accumulation condition. If tilings of this type exist for certain (necessarily non-distinguished) silver numbers, they would seem to form a class of inflationary tilings that differs from those obtained by inflation and substitution. In an Appendix we recall necessary notions and -- mostly known -- results, including the inflation-substitution construction principle for (one dimensional) inflationary tilings, in an elementary manner. For the readers' convenience we also collect the pertinent facts about non-negative matrices, thus the construction is accessible with only basic prerequisites from linear algebra and analysis. Finally, in our setting we give a detailed proof of a non-periodicity result that goes back to Penrose.</description>

      <title>New matrices for the spectral theory of mixed graphs, Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of the integrated adjacency matrix for mixed graphs was first introduced in [9], where its spectral properties were analyzed in relation to the structural characteristics of the mixed graph. Building upon this foundation, this paper introduces the integrated Laplacian matrix, the integrated signless Laplacian matrix, and the normalized integrated Laplacian matrix for mixed graphs. We further explore how the spectra of these matrices relate to the structural properties of the mixed graph.</description>

      <title>Counting occurrences of a pattern in a binary word</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enumerating the number of times one word occurs in another is a much-studied combinatorial subject. By utilizing a method that we call ``lexicographic extreme referencing'', we provide a formula for computing occurrences of one binary word in another. We then study $B_{n,p}(k)$, the number of binary words of length $n$ containing a given word $p$ exactly $k$ times. For this purpose, we first use lexicographic extreme referencing to provide an algorithm for constructing all words $w$ that contain a given word $p$. Afterward, we give a modified version of this algorithm for constructing the subset of binary words that are ``primitive'' with respect to $p$, and we discuss approaches for finding $B_{n,p}(k)$ via primitive words.</description>

      <title>Sharp Threshold for Cliques in Random 0/1 Polytope Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study graph-theoretic properties of random $0/1$ polytopes. Specifically, let $Q_p^n \subseteq \{0,1\}^n$ be a random subset where each point is included independently with probability $p$, and consider the graph $G_p$ of the polytope conv$(Q_p^n)$. We provide a short and combinatorial proof that $p = 2^{-n/2}$ is a threshold for the edge density of $G_p$, a result originally due to Kaibel and Remshagen. We next resolve an open question from their paper by showing that for $p \leq 2^{-n/2 - o(1)}$, $G_p$ exhibits strong edge expansion. In particular, we prove that, with high probability, every vertex has degree $(1 - o(1))|Q_p^n|$. Lastly, we determine the threshold for $G_p$ being a clique, strengthening a result of Bondarenko and Brodskiy. We show that with high probability, if $p \geq 2^{-\delta n + o(1)}$, then $G_p$ is not a clique, and if $ p \leq 2^{-\delta n - o(1)}$, then $G_p$ is a clique, where $\delta \approx 0.8295$. Our approach combines a combinatorial characterization of edges in graphs arising from polytopes with the Kim-Vu polynomial concentration inequality.</description>

      <title>Regularization and asymmetric extremal numbers of subdivisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a real $\mu\geq 1$, a graph $H$ is $\mu$-almost-regular if $\Delta(H)\leq \mu \delta(H)$. The celebrated regularization theorem of Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits states that for every real $0&lt;\varepsilon&lt;1$ there exists a real $\mu=\mu(\varepsilon)$ such that every $n$-vertex graph $G$ with $\Omega(n^{1+\varepsilon})$ edges contains an $m$-vertex $\mu$-almost-regular subgraph $H$ with $\Omega(m^{1+\varepsilon})$ edges for some $n^{\varepsilon\frac{1-\varepsilon}{1+\varepsilon}}\leq m\leq n$. We develop an enhanced version of it in which the subgraph $H$ also has average degree at least $\Omega(\frac{d(G)}{\log n})$, where $d(G)$ is the average degree of $G$. We then give a bipartite analogue of the enhanced regularization theorem.
  Using the bipartite regularization theorem, we establish upper bounds on the maximum number of edges in a bipartite graph with part sizes $m$ and $n$ that does not contain a $2k$-subdivision of $K_{s,t}$ or $2k$-multi-subdivisions of $K_p$, thus extending the corresponding work of Janzer to the bipartite setting for even subdivisions. We show these upper bounds are tight up to a constant factor for infinitely many pairs $(m,n)$. The problem for estimating the maximum number of edges in a bipartite graph with part sizes $m$ and $n$ that does not contain a $(2k+1)$-subdivision of $K_{s,t}$ remains open.</description>

      <title>Minimum degree and sparse connected spanning subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph on $n$ vertices and at most $n(1+\epsilon)$ edges with bounded maximum degree, and $F$ a graph on $n$ vertices with minimum degree at least $n-k$, where $\epsilon$ is a constant depending on $k$. In this paper, we prove that $F$ contains $G$ as a spanning subgraph provided $n\ge 6k^3$, by establishing tight bounds for the Ramsey number $r(G,K_{1,k})$, where $K_{1,k}$ is a star on $k+1$ vertices. Our result generalizes and refines the work of Erd\H{o}s, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp (JCT-B, 1982), who established the corresponding result for $G$ being a tree. Moreover, the tight bound for $r(G,tK_{1,k})$ is also obtained.</description>

      <title>Analysing the Moments of the Determinant of a Random Matrix Via Analytic Combinatorics of Permutation Tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the following natural question. Given a matrix $A$ with i.i.d. random entries, what are the moments of the determinant of $A$? In other words, what is $\mathbb{E}[\det(A)^k]$? While there is a general expression for $\mathbb{E}[\det(A)^k]$ when the entries of $A$ are Gaussian, much less is known when the entries of $A$ have some other distribution.
  In two recent papers, we answered this question for $k = 4$ when the entries of $A$ are drawn from an arbitrary distribution and for $k = 6$ when the entries of $A$ are drawn from a distribution which has mean $0$. These analyses used recurrence relations and were highly intricate. In this paper, we show how these analyses can be simplified considerably by using analytic combinatorics on permutation tables.</description>

      <title>Newton numbers, vanishing polytopes and algebraic degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a polynomial $f$ with a convenient Newton polytope $P$ and generic complex coefficients. By the global version of the Kouchnirenko formula, the hypersurface $\{f = 0\} \subset \mathbb C^n$ has the homotopy type of a bouquet of $(n-1)$-spheres, and the number of spheres is given by a certain alternating sum of volumes, called the Newton number $\nu(P)$. Using the Furukawa-Ito classification of dual defective sets, we classify convenient Newton polytopes with vanishing Newton numbers as certain Cayley sums called $B_k$-polytopes. These $B_k$-polytopes generalize the $B_1$- and $B_2$-facets appearing in the local monodromy conjecture in the Newton non-degenerate case. Our classification provides a partial solution to the Arnold's monotonicity problem.
  The local $h^*$-polynomial (or $\ell^*$-polynomial) is a natural invariant of lattice polytopes that refines the $h^*$-polynomial coming from Ehrhart theory. We obtain decomposition formulas for the Newton number, for instance, prove the inequality $\nu(P) \ge \ell^*(P;1)$. The $B_k$-polytopes are non-trivial examples of thin polytopes.
  We generalize the Newton number in two independent ways: the $\ell$-Newton number and the $e$-Newton number. The $\ell$-Newton number comes from Ehrhart theory, namely, from certain generalizations of Katz-Stapledon decomposition formulas. It is the main ingredient in the proof of the thinness of the $B_k$-polytopes. The $e$-Newton number is the number of points of zero-dimensional critical complete intersections. Vanishing of the $e$-Newton number characterizes the dual defective sets. The $e$-Newton number calculates the algebraic degrees (Maximum Likelihood, Euclidean Distance, and Polar degrees). For instance, we show that all the known formulas for the algebraic degrees in the Newton non-degenerate case are implied by basic properties of the $e$-Newton number.</description>

      <title>Robustness of the Sauer-Spencer Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a robust version of a graph embedding theorem of Sauer and Spencer. To state this sparser analogue, we define $G(p)$ to be a random subgraph of $G$ obtained by retaining each edge of $G$ independently with probability $p \in [0,1]$, and let $m_1(H)$ be the maximum $1$-density of a graph $H$. We show that for any constant $\Delta$ and $\gamma &gt; 0$, if $G$ is an $n$-vertex host graph with minimum degree $\delta(G) \geq (1 - 1/2\Delta + \gamma)n$ and $H$ is an $n$-vertex graph with maximum degree $\Delta(H) \leq \Delta$, then for $p \geq Cn^{-1/m_1(H)}\log n$, the random subgraph $G(p)$ contains a copy of $H$ with high probability. Our value for $p$ is optimal up to a log-factor.
  In fact, we prove this result for a more general minimum degree condition on $G$, by introducing an \emph{extension threshold} $\delta_{\rm e}(\Delta)$, such that the above result holds for graphs $G$ with ${\delta(G) \geq (\delta_{\rm e}(\Delta) + \gamma)n}$. We show that $\delta_{\rm e}(\Delta) \leq (2\Delta-1)/2\Delta$, and further conjecture that $\delta_{\rm e}(\Delta)$ equals $\Delta/(\Delta+1)$, which matches the minimum degree condition on $G$ in the Bollob\'as-Eldridge-Catlin Conjecture. A main tool in our proof is a vertex-spread version of the blow-up lemma of Allen, B\"{o}ttcher, H\`{a}n, Kohayakawa, and Person, which we believe to be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Spectrahedral relaxations of Eulerian rigidly convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a generalization of Eulerian polynomials to the multivariate setting introduced by Br\"and\'en. Although initially these polynomials were introduced using the language of hyperbolic and stable polynomials, we manage to translate some restrictions of these polynomials to our real zero setting. Once we are in this setting, we focus our attention on the rigidly convex sets (RCSs) defined by these polynomials. In particular, we study the corresponding rigidly convex sets looking at spectrahedral relaxations constructed through the use of monic symmetric linear matrix polynomials (MSLMPs) of small size and depending polynomially (actually just cubically) on the coefficients of the corresponding polynomials. We analyze how good are the obtained spectrahedral approximations to these rigidly convex sets. We do this analysis by measuring the behavior along the diagonal, where we precisely recover the original univariate Eulerian polynomials. Thus we conclude that, measuring through the diagonal, our relaxation-based spectrahedral method for approximation of the rigidly convex sets defined by multivariate Eulerian polynomials is highly accurate. In particular, we see that this relaxation-based spectrahedral method for approximation of the rigidly convex sets defined by multivariate Eulerian polynomials provides bounds for the extreme roots of the corresponding univariate Eulerian polynomials that are better than these already found in the literature. All in all, this tells us that, at least close to the diagonal, the global outer approximation to the rigidly convex sets provided by this relaxation-based spectrahedral method is itself highly accurate.</description>

      <title>Automated Counting of Spanning Trees for Several Infinite Families of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the theoretical basis developed by Yao and Zeilberger, we consider certain graph families whose structure results in a rational generating function for sequences related to spanning tree enumeration. Said families are Powers of Cycles and Powers of Path; later, we briefly discuss Torus graphs and Grid graphs. In each case we know, a priori, that the set of spanning trees of the family of graphs can be described in terms of a finite-state-machine, and hence there is a finite transfer-matrix that guarantees the generating function is rational. Finding this ``grammar'', and hence the transfer-matrix is very tedious, so a much more efficient approach is to use experimental mathematics. Since computing numerical determinants is so fast, one can use the matrix tree theorem to generate sufficiently many terms, then fit the data to a rational function. The whole procedure can be done rigorously a posteriori.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonicity of toroidal 5-puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an explicit Hamiltonian cycle in the state graph of the 5-puzzle on a toroidal 2x 3 grid, a graph with 720 vertices. The cycle is described by a short symbolic sequence of 48 moves over the alphabet {L,R,V}, repeated $15$ times, which can be verified directly. We also find a shorter 24-move sequence whose repetition yields a 2-cycle cover, which can be spliced into a Hamiltonian path. These constructions arise naturally from a general method: lifting Hamiltonian cycles from a quotient graph under the action of the puzzle's symmetry group.
  The method produces compact, human-readable cycle encodings and appears effective in broader settings, suggesting a combinatorial grammar underlying Hamiltonian paths in symmetric configuration spaces.</description>

      <title>Independent Set Enumeration and Estimation of Related Constants of Grid Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employed tensor network contraction algorithms to compute the hard-core lattice gas model, i.e., the enumeration of independent sets on grid graphs. We observed the influence of boundary effect and parity effect on the enumeration (or entropy), and derived upper and lower bounds for both the free energy and the first-order coefficients of boundary effects. Our computational results provided terms 0 to 3159 of the OEIS sequence A089980.
  Additionally, we conducted corresponding calculations and analyses for triangular, cylindrical, and twisted cylindrical variants of grid graphs. We computed and analyzed their associated constants and compared how different adjacency and boundary conditions affect these constants. For the enumeration of independent sets on triangular grid graphs, we provided terms 0 to 40 of the OEIS sequence A027740.</description>

      <title>On the smallest partition associated to a numerical semigroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The set of hook lengths of an integer partition $\lambda$ is the complement of some numerical semigroup $S$. There has been recent interest in studying the number of partitions with a given set of hook lengths. Very little is known about the distribution of sizes of this finite set of partitions. We focus on the problem of determining the size of the smallest partition with its set of hook lengths equal to $\mathbb{N}\setminus S$.</description>

Abstract: Given any two sequences of complex numbers, we establish simple relations between their binomial convolution and the binomial convolution of their individual binomial transforms. We employ these relations to derive new identities involving Fibonacci numbers, Bernoulli numbers, harmonic numbers, odd harmonic numbers and binomial coefficients.</description>

      <title>On Modular Edge Colourings of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and an integer $k\geq 2$, let $\chi'_k(G)$ denote the minimum number of colours required to colour the edges of $G$ such that, in each colour class, the subgraph induced by the edges of that colour has all non-zero degrees congruent to $1$ modulo $k$. In 1992, Pyber proved that $\chi'_2(G) \leq 4$ for every graph $G$, and posed the question of whether $\chi'_k(G)$ can be bounded solely in terms of $k$ for every $k\geq 3$. This question was answered in 1997 by Scott, who showed that $\chi'_k(G)\leq5k^2\log k$, and further asked whether $\chi'_k(G) = O(k)$. Recently, Botler, Colucci, and Kohayakawa (2023) answered Scott's question affirmatively proving that $\chi'_k(G) \leq 198k - 101$, and conjectured that the multiplicative constant could be reduced to $1$. A step towards this latter conjecture was made in 2024 by Nweit and Yang, who improved the bound to $\chi'_k(G) \leq 177k - 93$. In this paper, we further improve the multiplicative constant to $9$. More specifically, we prove that there is a function $f\in o(k)$ for which $\chi'_k(G) \leq 7k + f(k)$ if $k$ is odd, and $\chi'_k(G) \leq 9k + f(k)$ if $k$ is even. In doing so, we prove that $\chi'_k(G) \leq k + O(d)$ for every $d$-degenerate graph $G$, which plays a central role in our proof.</description>

      <title>Subdivision-free graphs with the maximum spectral radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph family $\mathbb{H}$, let ${\rm SPEX}(n,\mathbb{H}_{\rm sub})$ denote the set of $n$-vertex $\mathbb{H}$-subdivision-free graphs with the maximum spectral radius. In this paper, we investigate the problem of graph subdivision from a spectral extremal perspective, with a focus on the structural characterization of graphs in ${\rm SPEX}(n,\mathbb{H}_{\rm sub})$. For any graph $H \in \mathbb{H}$, let $\alpha(H)$ denote its independence number. Define $\gamma_\mathbb{H}:=\min_{H\in \mathbb{H}}\{|H| - \alpha(H) - 1\}$. We prove that every graph in ${\rm SPEX}(n,\mathbb{H}_{\rm sub})$ contains a spanning subgraph isomorphic to $K_{\gamma_\mathbb{H}}\vee (n-\gamma_\mathbb{H})K_1$, which is obtained by joining a $\gamma_\mathbb{H}$-clique with an independent set of $n-\gamma_\mathbb{H}$ vertices. This extends a recent result by Zhai, Fang, and Lin concerning spectral extremal problems for $\mathbb{H}$-minor-free graphs.</description>

      <title>An exact Ore-degree condition for Hamilton cycles in oriented graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An oriented graph is a digraph that contains no 2-cycles, i.e., there is at most one arc between any two vertices. We show that every oriented graph $G$ of sufficiently large order $n$ with $\mathrm{deg}^+(x) +\mathrm{deg}^{-}(y)\geq (3n-3)/4$ whenever $G$ does not have an edge from $x$ to $y$ contains a Hamilton cycle. This is best possible and solves a problem of K\"uhn and Osthus from 2012. Our result generalizes the result of Keevash, K\"uhn, and Osthus and improves the asymptotic bound obtained by Kelly, K\"uhn, and Osthus.</description>

Abstract: The general problem of the factorization of a basic hypergeometric series is presented and discussed. The case of the general $_2\psi_2$ series is examined in detail. Connections are found with the theory of basic hypergeometric series on root systems. Alternative proofs of several well-known summation and transformation formulae, including Gustafson's generalization of Ramanujan's $_1\psi_1$ summation, are obtained incidentally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tangles o er a way to indirectly but precisely capture cluster-like though possibly fuzzy substructures in discrete data. In this paper, we analyze witnessing and guiding sets of tangles that can help to find proper cluster candidates for given tangles. We show that every k-tangle has a witnessing set whose size is bounded in an exponential function in k which improves a result of Grohe and Schweizer. Further, we generalize a result of Diestel, Elbracht and Jacobs by providing a characterization of tangles that have a guiding function of some given reliability.</description>

      <title>The Hamilton cycle space of random regular graphs and randomly perturbed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cycle space of a graph $G$, denoted $C(G)$, is a vector space over ${\mathbb F}_2$, spanned by all incidence vectors of edge-sets of cycles of $G$. If $G$ has $n$ vertices, then $C_n(G)$ is the subspace of $C(G)$, spanned by the incidence vectors of Hamilton cycles of $G$. We prove that asymptotically almost surely $C_n(G_{n,d}) = C(G_{n,d})$ holds whenever $n$ is odd and $d$ is a sufficiently large (even) integer. This extends (though with a weaker bound on $d$) the well-known result asserting that $G_{n,d}$ is asymptotically almost surely Hamiltonian for every $d \geq 3$ (but not for $d &lt; 3$). Since $n$ being odd mandates that $d$ be even, somewhat limiting the generality of our result, we also prove that if $n$ is even and $d$ is any sufficiently large integer, then asymptotically almost surely $C_{n-1}(G_{n,d}) = C(G_{n,d})$.
  An influential result of Bohman, Frieze, and Martin asserts that if $H$ is an $n$-vertex graph with minimum degree at least $\delta n$ for some constant $\delta &gt; 0$, and $G \sim \mathbb{G}(n, C/n)$, where $C := C(\delta)$ is a sufficiently large constant, then $H \cup G$ is asymptotically almost surely Hamiltonian. We strengthen this result by proving that the same assumptions on $H$ and $G$ ensure that $C_n(H \cup G) = C(H \cup G)$ holds asymptotically almost surely.</description>

      <title>Hyper-Catalan and Geode Recurrences and Three Conjectures of Wildberger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hyper-Catalan number $C[m_2,m_3,m_4,\ldots]$ counts the number of subdivisions of a roofed polygon into $m_2$ triangles, $m_3$ quadrilaterals, $m_4$ pentagons, etc. Its closed form has been known since Erd\'elyi and Etherington, 1940. In 2025, Wildberger and Rubine showed its generating sum $\mathbf{S}[t_2,t_3,t_4,\ldots]$ is a zero of the general geometric univariate polynomial. We use that to derive a recurrence for hyper-Catalans, which expresses each in terms of other hyper-Catalans with smaller indices, generalizing the well-known Catalan convolution sum.
  Wildberger notes the factorization $\mathbf{S}-1=(t_2 + t_3 + t_4 + \ldots)\mathbf{G}$, where the factor $\mathbf{G}$ is called the Geode. We derive a recurrence that let us express the Geode coefficients in terms of other hyper-Catalan and Geode coefficients, and ultimately in terms of hyper-Catalans alone. We use it to prove three conjectures of Wildberger, all closed forms for special cases of elements of $\mathbf{G}$. While the recurrence allows us to expand each Geode coefficient as an integer combination of hyper-Catalans, enabling calculation, a closed-form for the general Geode coefficient remains unknown, as does what it counts.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Tur\'an problem of the generalized triangle with bounded matching number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a 3-graph on $n$ vertices. The matching number $\nu(\mathcal{H})$ is defined as the maximum number of disjoint edges in $\mathcal{H}$. The generalized triangle $F_5$ is a 3-graph on the vertex set $\{a,b,c,d,e\}$ with the edge set $\{abc, abd,cde\}$. In this paper, we showed that an $F_5$-free 3-graph $\mathcal{H}$ with matching number at most $s$ has at most $s\lfloor (n-s)^2/4\rfloor$ edges for $n\geq 30(s+1)$ and $s\geq 3$. For the proof, we establish a 2-colored version of Mantel's theorem, which may be of independent interests.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2019, Aharoni proposed a conjecture generalizing the Caceetta-H\"aggkvist conjecture: if an $n$-vertex graph $G$ admits an edge coloring (not necessarily proper) with $n$ colors such that each color class has size at least $r$, then $G$ contains a rainbow cycle of length at most $\lceil n/r\rceil$. Recent works \cite{AG2023,ABCGZ2023,G2025} have shown that if a constant fraction of the color classes are non-star, then the rainbow girth is $O(\log n)$. In this note, we extend these results, and we show that even a small fraction of non-star color classes suffices to ensure logarithmic rainbow girth. We also prove that the logarithmic bound is of the right order of magnitude. Moreover, we determine the threshold fraction between the types of color classes at which the rainbow girth transitions from linear to logarithmic.</description>

      <title>Liar's vertex-edge domination in subclasses of chordal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V, E)$ be an undirected graph. The set $N_G[x]=\{y\in V|xy\in E\}\cup \{x\}$ is called the closed neighbourhood of a vertex $x\in V$ and for an edge $e=xy\in E$, the closed neighbourhood of $e$ is the set $N_G[x]\cup N_G[y]$, which is denoted by $N_G[e]$ or $N_G[xy]$. A set $L\subseteq V$ is called \emph{liar's vertex-edge dominating set} of a graph $G=(V,E)$ if for every $e_i\in E$, $|N_G[e_i]\cap L|\geq 2$ and for every pair of distinct edges $e_i,e_j\in E$, $|(N_G[e_i]\cup N_G[e_j])\cap L|\geq 3$. The notion of liar's vertex-edge domination arises naturally from some applications in communication networks. Given a graph $G$, the \textsc{Minimum Liar's Vertex-Edge Domination Problem} (\textsc{MinLVEDP}) asks to find a liar's vertex-edge dominating set of $G$ of minimum cardinality. In this paper, we study this problem from an algorithmic point of view. We design two linear time algorithms for \textsc{MinLVEDP} in block graphs and proper interval graphs, respectively. On the negative side, we show that the decision version of liar's vertex-edge domination problem is NP-complete for undirected path graphs.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds on the $H$-rank of a mixed graph in terms of the matching number and fractional matching number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mixed graph $\widetilde{G}$ is obtained by orienting some edges of a graph $G$, where $G$ is the underlying graph of $\widetilde{G}$. Let $r(\widetilde{G})$ be the $H$-rank of $\widetilde{G}$. Denote by $r(G)$, $\kappa(G)$, $m(G)$ and $m^{\ast}(G)$ the rank, the number of even cycles, the matching number and the fractional matching number of $G$, respectively. Zhou et al. [Discrete Appl. Math. 313 (2022)] proved that $2m(G)-2\kappa(G)\leq r(G)\leq 2m(G)+\rho(G)$, where $\rho(G)$ is the largest number of disjoint odd cycles in $G$. We extend their results to the setting of mixed graphs and prove that $2m(G)-2\kappa(G)\leq r(\widetilde{G}) \leq 2m^{\ast}(G)$ for a mixed graph $\widetilde{G}$. Furthermore, we characterize some classes of mixed graphs with rank $r(\widetilde{G})=2m(G)-2\kappa(G)$, $r(\widetilde{G})=2m(G)-2\kappa(G)+1$ and $r(\widetilde{G})=2m^{\ast}(G)$, respectively. Our results also improve those of Chen et al. [Linear Multiliear Algebra. 66 (2018)]. In addition, our results can be applied to signed graphs and oriented graphs in some situations.</description>

      <title>Generalizing blocking semiovals in finite projective planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blocking semiovals and the determination of their (minimum) sizes constitute one of the central research topics in finite projective geometry. In this article we introduce the concept of blocking set with the $r_\infty$-property in a finite projective plane $\text{PG}(2,q)$, with $r_\infty$ a line of $\text{PG}(2,q)$ and $q$ a prime power. This notion greatly generalizes that of blocking semioval. We address the question of determining those integers $k$ for which there exists a blocking set of size $k$ with the $r_\infty$-property. To solve this problem, we build new theory which deeply analyzes the interplay between blocking sets in finite projective and affine planes.</description>

      <title>The Saturation Number for the Diamond is Linear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a fixed poset $\mathcal P$ we say that a family $\mathcal F\subseteq\mathcal P([n])$ is $\mathcal P$-saturated if it does not contain an induced copy of $\mathcal P$, but whenever we add a new set to $\mathcal F$, we form an induced copy of $\mathcal P$. The size of the smallest such family is denoted by $\text{sat}^*(n, \mathcal P)$.\par For the diamond poset $\mathcal D_2$ (the two-dimensional Boolean lattice), while it is easy to see that the saturation number is at most $n+1$, the best known lower bound has stayed at $O(\sqrt n)$ since the introduction of the area of poset saturation. In this paper we prove that $\text{sat}^*(n, \mathcal D_2)\geq \frac{n+1}{5}$, establishing that the saturation number for the diamond is linear. The proof uses a result about certain pairs of set systems which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On ADEG-polyhedra in hyperbolic spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish that the non-zero dihedral angles of hyperbolic Coxeter polyhedra of large dimensions are not arbitrarily small. Namely, for dimensions $n\geq 32$, they are of the form $\frac{\pi}{m}$ with $m\leq 6$. Moreover, this property holds in all dimensions $n\geq 7$ for Coxeter polyhedra with mutually intersecting facets. Then, we develop a constructive procedure tailored to Coxeter polyhedra with prescribed dihedral angles, from which we derive the complete classification of ADEG-polyhedra, characterized by having no pair of disjoint facets and dihedral angles $\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{3}$ and $\frac{\pi}{6}$, only. Besides some well-known simplices and pyramids, there are three exceptional polyhedra, one of which is a new polyhedron $P_{\star}\subset \mathbb H^9$ with $14$ facets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct $n$-vertex graphs $G$ where $\epsilon n^2$ edges must be deleted to become triangle-free, which contain less than $\epsilon^{(C_{\text{new}}-o(1))\log_2 1/\epsilon}n^3$ triangles for $C_{\text{new}}= \frac{1}{4\log_2(4/3)} \approx 1.6601$. Previously, a bound of the same shape was known, but with $C_{\text{new}}$ replaced by $C_{\text{old}} := C_{\text{new}}/2$. Our construction uses ideas from additive combinatorics, drawing especially from the corners problem, but does not yield new bounds for those problems.</description>

      <title>Barvinok's interpolation method meets Weitz's correlation decay approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we take inspiration from Weit'z algorithm for approximating the independence polynomial to provide a new algorithm for computing the coefficients of the Taylor series of the logarithm of the independence polynomial. Hereby we provide a clear connections between Barvinok's interpolation method and Weitz's algorithm. Our algorithm easily extends to other graph polynomials and partition functions and we illustrate this by applying it to the chromatic polynomial and to the graph homomorphism partition function. Our approach arguably yields a simpler and more transparent algorithm than the algorithm of Patel and the second author.
  As an application of our algorithmic approach we moreover derive, using the interpolation method, a deterministic $O(n(m/\varepsilon)^{7})$-time algorithm that on input of an $n$-vertex and $m$-edge graph of minimum degree at least $3$ and $\varepsilon&gt;0$ approximately computes the number of sink-free orientations of $G$ up to a multiplicative $\exp(\varepsilon)$ factor.</description>

      <title>Complexity of learning matchings and half graphs via edge queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of learning or reconstructing an unknown graph from a known family via partial-information queries arises as a mathematical model in various contexts. The most basic type of access to the graph is via \emph{edge queries}, where an algorithm may query the presence/absence of an edge between a pair of vertices of its choosing, at unit cost.
  While more powerful query models have been extensively studied in the context of graph reconstruction, the basic model of edge queries seems to have not attracted as much attention. In this paper we study the edge query complexity of learning a hidden bipartite graph, or equivalently its bipartite adjacency matrix, in the classical as well as quantum settings. We focus on learning matchings and half graphs, which are graphs whose bipartite adjacency matrices are a row/column permutation of the identity matrix and the lower triangular matrix with all entries on and below the principal diagonal being 1, respectively.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item For matchings of size $n$, we show a tight deterministic bound of $n(n-1)/2$ and an asymptotically tight randomized bound of $\Theta(n^2)$. A quantum bound of $\Theta(n^{1.5})$ was shown in a recent work of van Apeldoorn et al.~[ICALP'21].
  \item For half graphs whose bipartite adjacency matrix is a column-permutation of the $n \times n$ lower triangular matrix,
  we give tight $\Theta(n \log n)$ bounds in both deterministic and randomized settings, and an $\Omega(n)$ quantum lower bound. \item For general half graphs,
  we observe that the problem is equivalent to a natural generalization of the famous nuts-and-bolts problem, leading to a tight $\Theta(n \log n)$ randomized bound.
  We also present a simple quicksort-style method that instantiates to a $O(n \log^2 n)$ randomized algorithm and a tight $O(n \log n)$ quantum algorithm.

      <description>arXiv:2507.03338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Each continuous action of a countably infinite discrete group $\Gamma$ on a compact metrizable space X induces a continuous action of $\Gamma$ on the space M(X) of Borel probability measures on X. We compare the local entropy theory for these two actions, and describe the relation between their IE-tuples. Several other types of tuples are also studied. Our main tool is a new combinatorial lemma. We also give an application of the combinatorial lemma to the local theory of Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>Dimension-Preserving Saturated Embeddings of Finite Posets into the Spectra of Noetherian UFDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite poset $X$, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for there to exist a local Noetherian UFD $A$ and a saturated embedding of posets $\phi : X \longrightarrow \mbox{Spec}(A)$ such that $\dim(X)=\dim(A)$. The conditions imposed on $X$ in our characterization are remarkably mild, demonstrating that there is a large class of finite posets that can be embedded into the spectrum of a local Noetherian UFD of the same dimension as $X$ in a way that preserves saturated chains. We also show that given any finite poset $Y$, there exists a semi-local quasi-excellent ring $S$ and a saturated embedding $\psi: Y \longrightarrow \mbox{Spec}(S)$ such that if $z$ is a minimal element of $Y$, then $\psi(z)$ is a minimal prime ideal of $S$ and the coheight of $\psi(z)$ is the same as the length of the longest chain in $Y$ that starts at $z$ and ends at a maximal element of $Y$.</description>

      <title>Non-orientable regular maps with negative prime-power Euler characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a classification of all regular maps on surfaces of Euler characteristic $-r^d$ for some odd prime $r$ and integer $d\ge 1$. Such maps are necessarily non-orientable, and the cases where $d = 1$ or $2$ have been dealt with previously.
  This classification splits naturally into three parts, based on the nature of the automorphism group $G$ of the map, and particularly the structure of its quotient $G/O(G)$ where $O(G)$ is the largest normal subgroup of $G$ of odd order. In fact $G/O(G)$ is isomorphic to either a $2$-group (in which case $G$ is soluble), or $\textrm{PSL}(2,q)$ or $\textrm{PGL}(2,q)$ where $q$ is an odd prime power. The result is a collection of $18$ non-empty families of regular maps, with conditions on the associated parameters.</description>

      <title>Perturbative renormalisation of the $\Phi^4_{4-\varepsilon}$ model via generalized Wick maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the perturbative renormalisation of the $\Phi^4_d$ model from Euclidean Quantum Field Theory for any, possibly non-integer dimension $d&lt;4$. The so-called BPHZ renormalisation, named after Bogoliubov, Parasiuk, Hepp and Zimmermann, is usually encoded into extraction-contraction operations on Feynman diagrams, which have a complicated combinatorics. We show that the same procedure can be encoded in the much simpler algebra of polynomials in two unknowns $X$ and $Y$, which represent the fourth and second Wick power of the field. In this setting, renormalisation takes the form of a \lq\lq Wick map\rq\rq\ which maps monomials into Bell polynomials. The construction makes use of recent results by Bruned and Hou on multiindices, which are algebraic objects of intermediate complexity between Feynman diagrams and polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operator systems of matrices can be viewed as quantum analogues of finite graphs. This analogy suggests many natural combinatorial questions in linear algebra. We determine the quantum Ramsey numbers $QR(2,k)$ and the lower quantum Tur\'an numbers $T^\downarrow(n, m)$ with $n &gt; 3m$. In particular, we conclude that $QR(2,2) = 4$ and confirm Weaver's conjecture that $T^\downarrow(4, 1) = 4$. We also obtain a new result for the existence of anticliques in quantum graphs of low dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The code equivalence problem is central in coding theory and cryptography. While classical invariants are effective for Hamming and rank metrics, the sum-rank metric, which unifies both, introduces new challenges. This paper introduces new invariants for sum-rank metric codes: generalised idealisers, the centraliser, the center, and a refined notion of linearity. These lead to the definition of nuclear parameters, inspired by those used in division algebra theory, where they are crucial for proving inequivalence. We also develop a computational framework based on skew polynomials, which is isometric to the classical matrix setting but enables explicit computation of nuclear parameters for known MSRD (Maximum Sum-Rank Distance) codes. This yields a new and effective method to study the code equivalence problem where traditional tools fall short. In fact, using nuclear parameters, we can study the equivalence among the largest families of known MSRD codes.</description>

Abstract: We study the persistence probabilities of a moving average process of order one with uniform innovations. We identify a number of regions, characterized by the location of the uniform distribution and the coupling parameter of the process, where the persistence probabilities have qualitatively different behaviour. We obtain the generating functions of the persistence probabilities explicitly in all possible regions. In some of the regions, the persistence probabilities can be expressed explicitly in terms of various combinatorial quantities.</description>

      <title>Heights of butterfly trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary search trees (BSTs) are fundamental data structures whose performance is largely governed by tree height. We introduce a block model for constructing BSTs by embedding internal BSTs into the nodes of an external BST -- a structure motivated by parallel data architectures -- corresponding to composite permutations formed via Kronecker or wreath products. Extending Devroye's result that the height $h_n$ of a random BST satisfies $h_n / \log n \to c^* \approx 4.311$, we show that block BSTs with $nm$ nodes and fixed external size $m$ satisfy $h_{n,m} / \log n \to c^* + h_m$ in distribution. We then analyze height growth under iterated products. For simple butterfly trees (from iterated Kronecker products of $S_2$), we give a full distributional description showing polynomial height growth: $\mathbb{E} h_n^{\operatorname{B}} = \Theta(N^\alpha)$ with $\alpha \approx 0.58496$. For nonsimple butterfly trees (from wreath products), we prove power-law bounds: $cN^\alpha\cdot (1 + o(1)) \le \mathbb{E} h_n^{\operatorname{B}} \le dN^\beta\cdot (1 + o(1))$, with $\beta \approx 0.913189$.</description>

      <title>$q$-Congruences for Z.-W. Sun's generalized polynomials $w^{(\alpha)}_k(x)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2022, Z.-W. Sun defined \begin{equation*} w_k^{(\alpha)}{(x)}=\sum_{j=1}^{k}w(k,j)^{\alpha}x^{j-1}, \end{equation*} where $k,\alpha$ are positive integers and $w(k,j)=\frac{1}{j}\binom{k-1}{j-1}\binom{k+j}{j-1}$. Let $(x)_{0}=1$ and $(x)_{n}=x(x+1)\cdots(x+n-1)$ for all $n\geq 1$. In this paper, it is proved by $q$-congruences that for any positive integers ${\alpha,\beta, m,n,r}$, we have \begin{equation*} \frac{(2,n)}{n(n+1)(n+2)}\sum_{k=1}^{n}k^r(k+1)^r(2k+1)w_{k}^{(\alpha)}(x)^{m}\in\mathbb{Z}[x], \end{equation*} \begin{equation*} \frac{(2,n)}{n(n+1)(n+2)}\sum_{k=1}^{n}(-1)^{k}k^r(k+1)^r(2k+1) w_{k}^{(\alpha)}(x)^{m}\in\mathbb{Z}[x], \end{equation*} and \begin{equation*} \frac{2}{[n,n+1,\cdots,n+2\beta+1]}\sum_{k=1}^{n}(k)_{\beta}^r(k+\beta+1)_{\beta}^r(k+\beta) \prod_{i=0}^{2\beta-1}w_{k+i}^{(\alpha)}(x)^m\in\mathbb{Z}[x], \end{equation*} where $[n,n+1,\cdots,n+2\beta+1]$ is the least common multiple of $n$, $n+1$, $\cdots$, $n+2\beta+1$. Taking $r=\beta=1$ above will confirm some of Z.-W. Sun's conjectures.</description>

      <title>Counting linear congruence systems with a fixed number of solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a prime p and a positive integer s consider a homogeneous linear system over the ring Z_p^s (the ring of integers modulo p^s) described by an n x m-matrix. The possible number of solutions to such a system is p^j, where j=0,1,..., sm. We study the problem of how many n x m -matrices over Z_p^s there are given that we have exactly p^j homogeneous solutions. For the case s=1 (when Z_p^s is a field) George von Landsberg proved a general formula in 1893. However, there seems to be few published general results for the case s&gt;1 except when we have a unique solution (j=0). In this article we present recursive methods for counting such matrices and present explicit formulas for the case when j=&gt; s and n&gt;= m. We will use a generalization of Euler's phi-function and Gaussian binomial coefficients to express our formulas. As an application we compute the probability that gcd(det(A),p^s) gives the number of solutions to the quadratic system Ax=0.</description>

      <title>Computing Expansions in Infinitely Many Cantor Real Bases via a Single Transducer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Representing real numbers using convenient numeration systems (integer bases, $\beta$-numeration, Cantor bases, etc.) has been a longstanding mathematical challenge. This paper focuses on Cantor real bases and, specifically, on automatic Cantor real bases and the properties of expansions of real numbers in this setting. We develop a new approach where a single transducer associated with a fixed real number $r$, computes the $\mathbf{B}$-expansion of $r$ but for an infinite family of Cantor real bases $\mathbf{B}$ given as input. This point of view contrasts with traditional computational models for which the numeration system is fixed. Under some assumptions on the finitely many Pisot numbers occurring in the Cantor real base, we show that only a finite part of the transducer is visited. We obtain fundamental results on the structure of this transducer and on decidability problems about these expansions, proving that for certain classes of Cantor real bases, key combinatorial properties such as greediness of the expansion or periodicity can be decided algorithmically.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Equalizability of Words and Its Application to Card-Based Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Card-based cryptography is a research area to implement cryptographic procedures using a deck of physical cards. In recent years, it has been found to be related to finite group theory and algebraic combinatorics, and is becoming more and more closely connected to the field of mathematics. In this paper, we discuss the relationship between card-based cryptography and combinatorics on words for the first time. In particular, we focus on cyclic equality of words. We say that a set of words are cyclically equalizable if they can be transformed to be cyclically equal by repeated simultaneous insertion of letters. The main result of this paper is to show that two binary words of equal length and equal Hamming weight are cyclically equalizable. As applications of cyclic equalizability to card-based cryptography, we describe its applications to the information erasure problem and to single-cut full-open protocols.</description>

      <title>Wythoff's Game with a Pass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04960</link>
      <description>arXiv:1711.04960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper describes Wythoff's game with a pass, which is a variant of the classical Wythoff's game. The classical form is played with two piles of stones, from which two players take turns to remove stones from one or both piles. When removing stones from both piles, an equal number must be removed from each. The player who removes the last stone or stones is the winner.
  In Wythoff's game with a pass, we modify the standard rules to allow for a one-time pass, i.e., a pass move that may be used at most once in a game but not from a terminal position. Once either player has used the pass, it is no longer available. We denote the position of the game by (x,y,p) , where x,y are numbers of stones in two piles and p=1 if a pass is available, and p=0 if not. The authors proved that for (x,y,1) with x &lt;= 9 or y x &lt;= 9 , (x,y,1) is a P-position (the previous player's winning position) if and only if the Grundy number of (x,y,0) is 1 . Therefore, by using the result by U. Blass and A.S. Fraenkel, the Euclid distance between each previous player's winning position in Wythoff's game with a pass and a nearby previous player's winning position in Wythoff's game without a pass is within square root of 20 .</description>

      <title>Euclidean sets with only one distance modulo a prime ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12331v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a finite set in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$. If the squared distance between any two distinct points in $X$ is an odd integer, then the cardinality of $X$ is bounded above by $d+2$, as shown by Rosenfeld (1997) or Smith (1995). They proved that there exists a $(d+2)$-point set $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ having only odd integral squared distances if and only if $d+2$ is congruent to $0$ modulo $4$. The distances can be interpreted as an element of the finite field $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$. We generalize this result for a local ring $(A_\mathfrak{p},\mathfrak{p}A_\mathfrak{p})$ as follows. Let $K$ be an algebraic number field that can be embedded into $\mathbb{R}$. Fix an embedding of $K$ into $\mathbb{R}$, and $K$ is interpreted as a subfield of $\mathbb{R}$. Let $A=O_K$ be the ring of integers of $K$, and $\mathfrak{p}$ a prime ideal of $O_K$. Let $(A_\mathfrak{p},\mathfrak{p}A_\mathfrak{p})$ be the local ring obtained from the localization $(A\setminus \mathfrak{p})^{-1} A$, which is interpreted as a subring of $\mathbb{R}$. If the squared distances of $X\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ are in $A_\mathfrak{p}$ and each squared distance is congruent to some constant $k \not\equiv 0 $ modulo $\mathfrak{p} A_\mathfrak{p}$, then $|X| \leq d+2$, as shown by Nozaki (2023). In this paper, we prove that there exists a set $X\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ attaining the upper bound $|X| \leq d+2$ if and only if $d+2$ is congruent to $0$ modulo $4$ when the finite field $A_\mathfrak{p}/ \mathfrak{p} A_\mathfrak{p}$ is of characteristic 2, and $d+2$ is congruent to $0$ modulo $p$ when $A_\mathfrak{p}/ \mathfrak{p} A_\mathfrak{p}$ is of characteristic $p$ odd. We also provide examples attaining this upper bound.</description>

      <title>Parity conditions for one-way rail networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10044v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present parity conditions under which a toy-train rail network is one-way, i.e., every reachable point can be approached from only one direction. We show that this problem is equivalent to determining the balance of a signed graph obtained from the network, whose edges are assigned positive or negative signs. Using signed-graph theory, we derive two equivalent parity conditions for one-wayness: (i) every cycle must contain an even number of edges that join the same sides of switches, and (ii) every cycle must contain an even number of angles at switches. Signed-graph theory also offers an analytical criterion: a connected network is one-way if and only if the smallest eigenvalue of its signed Laplacian matrix is zero, suggesting a computational tool for evaluating one-wayness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11452v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ore in 1961 determined the maximum number of edges in graphs not containing a Hamiltonian cycle, and Tur\'{a}n in 1941 found the maximum number of edges in graphs not containing a $K_{r+1}$. Motivated by the work of Adamus in 2009 and Ferrero and Lesniak in 2018 on the maximum number of edges in $r$-partite non-Hamiltonian graphs, we find the maximum number of edges in $K_{r+1}$-free non-Hamiltonian graphs. Then we extend this result from Hamiltonicity to traceability, chorded pancyclicity, Hamiltonian-connectedness, $k$-path Hamiltonicity, $k$-Hamiltonicity, $k$-Hamiltonian-connectedness, and $k$-connectedness. Finally we introduce a method for translating results on the maximum number of edges to results on the maximum number of $t$-cliques using the fact that colex Tur\'{a}n graphs are extremal, and thus determine the maximum number of $t$-cliques in each of these classes of graphs.</description>

Abstract: We show that the facet-ridge graph of a shellable simplicial sphere $\Delta$ uniquely determines the entire combinatorial structure of $\Delta$. This generalizes the celebrated result due to Blind and Mani (1987), and Kalai (1988) on reconstructing simple polytopes from their graphs. Our proof utilizes the notions of good acyclic orientations from Kalai's proof as well as $k$-systems introduced by Joswig, Kaibel, and K\"orner.</description>

      <title>Web bases in degree two from hourglass plabic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Webs give a diagrammatic calculus for spaces of $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_r)$-tensor invariants, but intrinsic characterizations of web bases are only known in certain cases. Recently, we introduced hourglass plabic graphs to give the first such $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_4)$-web bases. Separately, Fraser introduced a web basis for Pl\"{u}cker degree two representations of arbitrary $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_r)$. Here, we show that Fraser's basis agrees with that predicted by the hourglass plabic graph framework and give an intrinsic characterization of the resulting webs. A further compelling feature with many applications is that our bases exhibit rotation-invariance. Together with the results of our earlier paper, this implies that hourglass plabic graphs give a uniform description of all known rotation-invariant $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_r)$-web bases. Moreover, this provides a single combinatorial model simultaneously generalizing the Tamari lattice, the alternating sign matrix lattice, and the lattice of plane partitions. As a part of our argument, we develop properties of square faces in arbitrary hourglass plabic graphs, a key step in our program towards general $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_r)$-web bases.</description>

      <title>Regions of Level $\ell$ of Catalan/Semiorder-Type Arrangements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10198v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1996, Stanley extended the classical Catalan arrangement and semiorder arrangement, which are called the Catalan-type arrangement $\mathcal{C}_{n,A}$ and the semiorder-type arrangement $\mathcal{C}_{n,A}^*$ in this paper. By establishing a labeled Dyck path model for the regions of $\mathcal{C}_{n,A}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{n,A}^*$, this paper explores several enumerative problems related to the number of regions of level $\ell$, denoted as $r_{\ell}(\mathcal{C}_{n,A})$ and $r_{\ell}(\mathcal{C}_{n,A}^*)$, which includes:
  (1) proving a Stirling convolution relation between $r_{\ell}(\mathcal{C}_{n,A})$ and $r_{\ell}(\mathcal{C}_{n,A}^*)$, refining a result by Stanley and Postnikov;
  (2) showing that the sequences$\left(r_\ell{(\mathcal{C}_{n,A})}\right)_{n\geq 0}$ and $(r_\ell {(\mathcal{C}_{n,A}^*)})_{n\geq 0}$ exhibit properties of binomial type in the sense of Rota;
  (3) establishing the transformational significance of $r_{\ell}(\mathcal{C}_{n,A})$ and $r_{\ell}(\mathcal{C}_{n,A}^*)$ under Stanley's ESA framework: they can be viewed as transition matrices from binomial coefficients to their characteristic polynomials respectively.
  Further, we present two applications of the theories and methods: first, we provide a hyperplane arrangement counting interpretation of the two-parameter generalization of Fuss--Catalan numbers, which is closely related to the number of regions of level $\ell$ in the $m$-Catalan arrangement. Second, using labeled Dyck paths to depict the number of regions in the $m$-Catalan arrangement, we algorithmically provide the inverse mapping of the Fu, Wang, and Zhu mapping.</description>

      <title>(Injective) hom-complexity between graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16547v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the notion of hom-complexity, $\text{C}(G;H)$, for two graphs $G$ and $H$, along with basic results for this numerical invariant. This invariant $\text{C}(G;H)$ is a number that measures the \aspas{complexity} of the question: when is there a homomorphism $G\to H$? More precisely, $\text{C}(G;H)$ is the least positive integer $k$ such that there are $k$ different subgraphs $G_j$ of $G$ such that $G=G_1\cup\cdots\cup G_k$, and for each $G_j$, there is a homomorphism $G_j\to H$. Likewise, we introduce the notion of injective hom-complexity, $\text{IC}(G;H)$. The (injective) hom-complexity is a graph invariant. Additionally, these invariants can be used to show the nonexistence of homomorphisms. We explore the sub-additivity of (injective) hom-complexity and study products.
  We describe bounds for the hom-complexity in terms of chromatic number $\chi$ and clique number $\omega$. We provide the formula \[\text{C}(G;H)=\lceil\log_{\chi(H)}\chi(G)\rceil\] whenever $\omega(H)=\chi(H)$. For example, we obtain $\text{C}(G;K_\ell)=\lceil\log_{\ell}\chi(G)\rceil$. Moreover, we discuss a connection between the (injective) hom-complexity and several well-known covering numbers. For instance, we provide a lower bound for the clique covering number in terms of the injective hom-complexity. Additionally, we show that the hom-complexity $\mathrm{C}(G;K_{\ell})$ coincides with the $\ell$-particity $\beta_\ell(G)$ of $G$, and the hom-complexity $\mathrm{C}(K_n;K_{2})$ coincides with the bipartite dimension $\mathrm{d}(K_n)$ of $K_n$. As a consequence, we recover the well-known formulas $\beta_\ell(G)=\lceil\log_{\ell}\chi(G)\rceil$ and $\mathrm{d}(K_n)=\lceil\log_{2}n\rceil$.</description>

      <title>Identifiability of directed-cycle and catenary linear compartment models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A parameter of a mathematical model is structurally identifiable if it can be determined from noiseless experimental data. Here, we examine the identifiability properties of two important classes of linear compartmental models: directed-cycle models and catenary models (models for which the underlying graph is a directed cycle or a bidirected path, respectively). Our main result is a complete characterization of the directed-cycle models for which every parameter is (generically locally) identifiable. Additionally, for catenary models, we give a formula for their input-output equations. Such equations are used to analyze identifiability, so we expect our formula to support future analyses into the identifiability of catenary models. Our proofs rely on prior results on input-output equations, and we also use techniques from linear algebra and graph theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let ${\rm dim}(G)$ and $D(G)$ respectively denote the metric dimension and the distinguishing number of a graph $G$. It is proved that $D(G) \le {\rm dim}(G)+1$ holds for every connected graph $G$. Among trees, exactly paths and stars attain the bound, and among connected unicyclic graphs such graphs are $t$-cycles for $t\in \{3,4,5\}$. It is shown that for any $1\leq n&lt; m$, there exists a graph $G$ with $D(G)=n$ and ${\rm dim}(G)=m$. Using the bound $D(G) \le {\rm dim}(G)+1$, graphs with $D(G) = n(G)-2$ are classified.</description>

      <title>Blocking Ideals: a method for filtering linear extensions of a finite poset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11073v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard notion of poset probability of a finite poset P involves calculating, for incomparable $\alpha$, $\beta$ in P, the number of linear extensions of P for which $\alpha$ precedes $\beta$. The fraction of those linear extensions among all linear extensions of P is the probability that $\alpha &lt; \beta$. The question of whether there is always a pair $\alpha, \beta$ such that this probability lies between 1/3 and 2/3, in any poset P (that is not a chain) is the famous "1/3-2/3-conjecture".
  A general way of counting linear extensions of P for which $\alpha$ precedes $\beta$ is to count linear extensions of the poset obtained by adding the relation $(\alpha,\beta)$, and its transitive consequences.
  For chain-products, and more generally for partition posets, lattice-path methods can be used to count the number of those linear extensions.
  We present an alternative approach to find the pertinent linear extensions. It relies on finding the "blocking ideals" in $J(P)$, where $J(P)$ is the lattice of order ideals in P. This method works for all finite posets.
  We illustrate this method by using blocking ideals to find explicit formulas of poset probabilities in cell posets $P_{\lambda}$ of two-row partitions. Well-known formulae such as the hook-length formula for $f^\lambda$, the number of standard Young tableaux on a partition $\lambda$, and the corresponding determinental formula by Jacobi-Trudi-Aitken for $f^{\lambda / \mu}$, the number of standard Young tableaux on a skew partition $\lambda / \mu$, are used along the way.
  We also calculate the limit probabilities when the elements $\alpha,\beta$ are fixed cells, but the arm-lengths tend to infinity.</description>

Abstract: This is the first paper of a sequence papers on the multiple Riordan group and the multiple Riordon type arrays. We give a comprehensive discussion of the multiple Riordan arrays and characterize them by an $A$-sequence and multiple $Z$-sequences. The multiple Riordan group and some of its subgroups are defined. In addition, we give compressions of multiple Riordan arrays and their sequence characterizations. The total positivity of the compressions of multiple Riordan arrays is studied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish for the first time the explicit curvature formulas for the horizontal and vertical edges of the strong product of two regular graphs. We complement this result with showing that there does not exist an analogous formula for the curvatures of diagonal edges except for a special case, and providing a sharp lower bound for them in terms of the curvatures of the factors. This gives the curvature formulas for all the edges of the product of a complete graph and a regular graph. We also present an accessible and simpler proof of the curvature formulas for all the edges of the Cartesian product of two regular graphs, originally established by Lin, Lu, and Yau [2011].</description>

      <title>Infinite polynomial patterns in large subsets of the rational numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by a question of Kra, Moreira, Richter, and Robertson, we prove two new results about infinite polynomial configurations in large subsets of the rational numbers. First, given a finite coloring of $\mathbb{Q}$, we show that there exists an infinite set $B = \{b_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\} \subseteq \mathbb{Q}$ such that $$\{b_i, b_i^2 + b_j : i &lt; j\}$$ is monochromatic. Second, we prove that every subset of positive density in the rational numbers contains a translate of such an infinite configuration. The corresponding results in the integers are both known to be false, so our results provide natural and relatively simple examples of combinatorial structures that distinguish between the Ramsey-theoretic properties of the rational numbers and the integers.
  The proofs of our main results build upon methods developed in a series of papers by Kra, Moreira, Richter, and Robertson to translate from combinatorics into dynamics, where the core of the argument reduces to understanding the behavior of certain polynomial ergodic averages. The new dynamical tools required for this analysis are a Wiener--Wintner theorem for polynomially-twisted ergodic averages in $\mathbb{Q}$-systems and a structure theorem for Abramov $\mathbb{Q}$-systems.</description>

      <title>The Hamilton cycle space of random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cycle space of a graph $G$, denoted $C(G)$, is a vector space over ${\mathbb F}_2$, spanned by all incidence vectors of edge-sets of cycles of $G$. If $G$ has $n$ vertices, then $C_n(G)$ denotes the subspace of $C(G)$, spanned by the incidence vectors of Hamilton cycles of $G$. A classical result in the theory of random graphs asserts that for $G \sim \mathbb{G}(n,p)$, asymptotically almost surely the necessary condition $\delta(G) \geq 2$ is also sufficient to ensure Hamiltonicity. Resolving a problem of Christoph, Nenadov, and Petrova, we augment this result by proving that for $G \sim \mathbb{G}(n,p)$, with $n$ being odd, asymptotically almost surely the condition $\delta(G) \geq 3$ (observed to be necessary by Heinig) is also sufficient for ensuring $C_n(G) = C(G)$. That is, not only does $G$ typically have a Hamilton cycle, but its Hamilton cycles are typically rich enough to span its cycle space.</description>

      <title>Hamilton Cycles In Vertex-Transitive Graphs of Order 10p</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After long-term efforts, the Hamilton path (cycle) problem for connected vertex-transitive graphs of order $pq$ (where $p$ and $q$ are primes) was finally resolved in 2021, see [10]. Fifteen years ago, mathematicians began addressing this problem for graphs of order $2pq$. Among these studies, it was proved in 2012 (see [21]) that every connected vertex-transitive graph of order $10p$ (where $p \neq 7$ is a prime) contains a Hamilton path, with the exception of a family of graphs that was recently confirmed in [11]. In this paper, we achieve a further result: every connected vertex-transitive graph of order $10p$ (where $p$ is a prime) contains a Hamilton cycle, except for the truncation of the Petersen graph.</description>

      <title>Ordered set partition posets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lattice of partitions of a set and its d-divisible generalization have been much studied for their combinatorial, topological, and representation-theoretic properties. An ordered set partition is a set partition where the subsets are listed in a specific order. Ordered set partitions appear in combinatorics, number theory, permutation polytopes, and the study of coinvariant algebras. The ordered set partitions of {1,\ldots,n} can be partially ordered by refinement and then a unique minimal element attached, resulting in a lattice Omega_n. This lattice has appeared while studying other combinatorial objects, but not as the central focus. The purpose of this paper is to provide the first comprehensive look at Omega_n. In particular, we show that it admits a recursive atom ordering, and study the action of the symmetric group S_n on associated homology groups, looking in particular at the multiplicity of the trivial representation. We also consider the related posets where every block has size either divisible by some fixed d at least 2 or congruent to 1 modulo d. Open problems and avenues for future research are scattered throughout.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discover a family $A$ of sixteen statistics on fillings of any given Young diagram and prove new combinatorial formulas for modified Macdonald polynomials, that is, $$\tilde{H}_{\lambda}(X;q,t)=\sum_{\sigma\in T(\lambda)}x^{\sigma}q^{maj(\sigma)}t^{\eta(\sigma)}$$ for each statistic $\eta\in A$. Building upon this new formula, we establish four compact formulas for the modified Macdonald polynomials, namely, $$\tilde{H}_{\lambda}(X;q,t)=\sum_{\sigma}d_{\varepsilon}(\sigma)x^{\sigma}q^{maj(\sigma)}t^{\eta(\sigma)}$$ which is summed over all canonical or dual canonical fillings of a Young diagram and $d_{\varepsilon}(\sigma)$ is a product of $t$-multinomials. Finally, the compact formulas enable us to derive four explicit expressions for the monomial expansion of modified Macdonald polynomials, one of which coincides with the formula given by Garbali and Wheeler (2020).</description>

      <title>Permanental Analog of the Rank-Nullity Theorem for Symmetric Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rank-nullity theorem is a core result in the study of matrices. The rank of an $n \times n$ matrix is equal to the size of its largest square submatrix with a nonzero determinant; it can be computed in $O(n^{2.37})$ time. For symmetric matrices, the rank equals to the number of nonzero eigenvalues (that is, the nonzero roots of the characteristic polynomial), which implies that the nullity equals the multiplicity of zero eigenvalue. Similar to the rank, the permanental rank of a matrix is the size of the largest square submatrix with nonzero permanent (whose computation is #P-complete), while the permanental nullity is the multiplicity of zero as a root of the permanental polynomial. In this paper, we prove a permanental analog of the rank-nullity theorem for any non-negative symmetric matrix, positive semi-definite matrix and (-1, 0, 1)-balanced symmetric matrices.</description>

Abstract: The $(\kappa,\ell)$-edge-inducibility problem asks for the maximum number of $\kappa$-subsets inducing exactly $\ell$ edges that a graph of given order $n$ can have. Using flag algebras and stability approach, we resolve this problem for all sufficiently large $n$ (including a description of all extremal and almost extremal graphs) in eleven new non-trivial cases when $\kappa\le 7$.
  We also compute the $F$-inducibility constant (the asymptotically maximum density of induced copies of $F$ in a graph of given order $n$) and obtain some corresponding structure results for three new graphs $F$ with $5$ vertices: the 3-edge star plus an isolated vertex, the 4-cycle plus an isolated vertex, and the 4-cycle with a pendant edge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.05569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use algorithmic methods from online learning to explore some important objects at the intersection of model theory and combinatorics, and find natural ways that algorithmic methods can detect and explain (and improve our understanding of) stable structure in the sense of model theory. The main theorem deals with existence of $\epsilon$-excellent sets (which are key to the Stable Regularity Lemma, a theorem characterizing the appearance of irregular pairs in Szemer\'edi's celebrated Regularity Lemma). We prove that $\epsilon$-excellent sets exist for any $\epsilon &lt; \frac{1}{2}$ in $k$-edge stable graphs in the sense of model theory (equivalently, Littlestone classes); earlier proofs had given this only for $\epsilon &lt; 1/{2^{2^k}}$ or so. We give two proofs: the first uses regret bounds from online learning, the second uses Boolean closure properties of Littlestone classes and sampling. We also give a version of the dynamic Sauer-Shelah-Perles lemma appropriate to this setting, related to definability of types. We conclude by characterizing stable/Littlestone classes as those supporting a certain abstract notion of majority: the proof shows that the two distinct, natural notions of majority, arising from measure and from dimension, densely often coincide.</description>

      <title>An Algebra of Elliptic Commuting Variables and an Elliptic Extension of the Multinomial Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an algebra of elliptic commuting variables involving a base $q$, nome $p$, and $2r$ noncommuting variables. This algebra, which for $r=1$ reduces to an algebra considered earlier by the author, is an elliptic extension of the well-known algebra of $r$ $q$-commuting variables. We present a multinomial theorem valid as an identity in this algebra, hereby extending the author's previously obtained elliptic binomial theorem to higher rank. Two essential ingredients are a consistency relation satisfied by the elliptic weights and the Weierstrass type $\mathsf A$ elliptic partial fraction decomposition. From the elliptic multinomial theorem we obtain, by convolution, an identity equivalent to Rosengren's type $\mathsf A$ extension of the Frenkel-Turaev ${}_{10}V_9$ summation. Interpreted in terms of a weighted counting of lattice paths in the integer lattice $\mathbb Z^r$, this derivation of Rosengren's $\mathsf A_r$ Frenkel-Turaev summation constitutes the first combinatorial proof of that fundamental identity.</description>

      <title>Fra\"{i}ss\'{e}'s Conjecture and big Ramsey degrees of structures admitting finite monomorphic decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20307v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that a countable structure admitting a finite monomorphic decomposition has finite big Ramsey degrees if and only if so does every monomorphic part in its minimal monomorphic decomposition. The necessary prerequisite for this result is the characterization of monomorphic structures with finite big Ramsey degrees: a countable monomorphic structure has finite big Ramsey degrees if and only if it is chainable by a chain with finite big Ramsey degrees. Interestingly, both characterizations require deep structural properties of chains. Fra\"{i}ss\'{e}'s Conjecture (actually, its positive resolution due to Laver) is instrumental in the characterization of monomorphic structures with finite big Ramsey degrees, while the analysis of big Ramsey combinatorics of structures admitting a finite monomorphic decomposition requires a product Ramsey theorem for big Ramsey degrees. We find this last result particularly intriguing because big Ramsey degrees misbehave notoriously when it comes to general product statements.</description>

      <title>On Modular Invariants of Truncated Polynomial Rings in low ranks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We verify the conjectures due to Lewis, Reiner and Stanton about the Hilbert series of the invariant ring of the truncated polynomial ring for all parabolic subgroups up to rank $3$. This is done by constructing an explicit set of generators for each invariant ring in question. We also propose a conjecture concerning the action of the Steenrod algebra and the Dickson algebra on a certain naturally occurring filtration of the invariant ring under the general linear group.</description>

      <title>Graphons of Line Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01656v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating graph limits, known as graphons, from observations of sequences of sparse finite graphs. In this paper we show a simple method that can shed light on a subset of sparse graphs. The method involves mapping the original graphs to their line graphs. We show that graphs satisfying a particular property, which we call the square-degree property are sparse, but give rise to dense line graphs. This enables the use of results on graph limits of dense graphs to derive convergence. In particular, star graphs satisfy the square-degree property resulting in dense line graphs and non-zero graphons of line graphs. We demonstrate empirically that we can distinguish different numbers of stars (which are sparse) by the graphons of their corresponding line graphs. Whereas in the original graphs, the different number of stars all converge to the zero graphon due to sparsity. Similarly, superlinear preferential attachment graphs give rise to dense line graphs almost surely. In contrast, dense graphs, including Erdos-Renyi graphs make the line graphs sparse, resulting in the zero graphon.</description>

      <title>Minimal and Maximal Distances in Metric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14648v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given functions $f,g: [n] \rightarrow [n]$ do there exist $n$ points $A_1,A_2\ldots A_n$ in some metric space such that $A_{f(i)},A_{g(i)}$ are the points closest and farthest from point $A_i$? In this paper we characterize precisely which pairs of functions have this property. If the metric space is $\mathbb{R}^k$ we show that the maximal number $m(k)$ so that any pair of functions $f,g: [m(k)]\rightarrow [m(k)]$ realizable in some metric space is also realizable in $\mathbb{R}^k$ grows exponentially in $k$. In the final section of this paper we consider what happens when we look at minimal and maximal distances separately. We show that any function $g$ that can be a maximal distance function can also be a maximal distance function in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We also find an interesting family of functions that can be minimal distance functions but not in $\mathbb{R}^k$.</description>

      <title>Ricci curvature, diameter and eigenvalues of amply regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21055v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Amply regular graphs are graphs with local distance-regularity constraints. In this paper, we prove a weaker version of a conjecture proposed by Qiao, Park, and Koolen on diameter bounds of amply regular graphs and make new progress on Terwilliger's conjecture on finiteness of amply regular graphs. Terwilliger's conjecture can be considered as a natural extension of the Bannai-Ito conjecture about distance-regular graphs confirmed by Bang, Dubickas, Koolen, and Moulton. As a consequence, we show that there are only finitely many amply regular graphs with parameters $(n,d,\alpha,\beta)$ satisfying $\alpha\leq 6\beta-9$. We achieve these results by a significantly improved Lin--Lu--Yau curvature estimate and new Bakry--\'Emery curvature estimates. We further discuss applications of our curvature estimates to bounding eigenvalues, isoperimetric constants, and expansion properties. In addition, we obtain a volume estimate, which is sharp for hypercubes.</description>

      <title>Induced Minor Models. II. Sufficient conditions for polynomial-time detection of induced minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $H$-Induced Minor Containment problem ($H$-IMC) consists in deciding if a fixed graph $H$ is an induced minor of a graph $G$ given as input, that is, whether $H$ can be obtained from $G$ by deleting vertices and contracting edges. Equivalently, the problem asks if there exists an induced minor model of $H$ in $G$, that is, a collection of disjoint subsets of vertices of $G$, each inducing a connected subgraph, such that contracting each subgraph into a single vertex results in $H$.
  It is known that $H$-IMC is NP-complete for several graphs $H$, even when $H$ is a tree. In this work, we investigate which properties of $H$ guarantee the existence of an induced minor model whose structure can be leveraged to solve the problem in polynomial time. This allows us to identify four infinite families of graphs $H$ that enjoy such properties. Moreover, we show that if the input graph $G$ excludes long induced paths, then $H$-IMC is polynomial-time solvable for any fixed graph $H$. As a byproduct of our results, this implies that $H$-IMC is polynomial-time solvable for all graphs $H$ with at most $5$ vertices, except for three open cases.</description>

      <title>Verified Certificates via SAT and Computer Algebra Systems for the Ramsey $R(3, 8)$ and $R(3, 9)$ Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Ramsey problem $R(3, k)$ seeks to determine the smallest value of $n$ such that any red/blue edge coloring of the complete graph on $n$ vertices must either contain a blue triangle (3-clique) or a red clique of size $k$. Despite its significance, many previous computational results for the Ramsey $R(3, k)$ problem such as $R(3, 8)$ and $R(3, 9)$ lack formal verification. To address this issue, we use the software MathCheck to generate certificates for Ramsey problems $R(3, 8)$ and $R(3, 9)$ (and symmetrically $R(8, 3)$ and $R(9, 3)$) by integrating a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver with a computer algebra system (CAS). Our SAT+CAS approach significantly outperforms traditional SAT-only methods, demonstrating an improvement of several orders of magnitude in runtime. For instance, our SAT+CAS approach solves $R(3, 8)$ (resp., $R(8, 3)$) sequentially in 59 hours (resp., in 11 hours), while a SAT-only approach using state-of-the-art CaDiCaL solver times out after 7 days. Additionally, in order to be able to scale to harder Ramsey problems $R(3, 9)$ and $R(9, 3)$ we further optimized our SAT+CAS tool using a parallelized cube-and-conquer approach. Our results provide the first independently verifiable certificates for these Ramsey numbers, ensuring both correctness and completeness of the exhaustive search process of our SAT+CAS tool.</description>

      <title>Contributions to conjectures on planar graphs: Induced Subgraphs, Treewidth, and Dominating Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10471v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two of the most prominent unresolved conjectures in graph theory, the Albertson-Berman conjecture and the Matheson-Tarjan conjecture, have been extensively studied by many researchers.
  (AB) Every planar graph of order $n$ has an induced forest of order at least $\frac{n}{2}$.
  (MT) Every plane triangulation of sufficiently large order $n$ has a dominating set of cardinality at most $\frac{n}{4}$.
  Although partial progress and weaker bounds are known, both conjectures remain unsolved. To shed further light on them, researchers have explored a variety of related notions and generalizations. In this paper, we clarify relations among several of these notions, most notably connected domination and induced outerplanar subgraphs, and investigate the corresponding open problems. Furthermore, we construct an infinite family of plane triangulations of order $n$ whose connected domination number exceeds $n/3$. This construction gives a negative answer to a question of Bradshaw et al. [SIAM J. Discrete Math. 36 (2022) 1416-1435], who asked whether the maxleaf number of every plane triangulation of order $n$ is at least $2n/3$. We also obtain new results on induced subgraphs with bounded treewidth and induced outerplanar subgraphs.</description>

      <title>The multinomial dimer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An $N$-dimer cover of a graph is a collection of edges (with multiplicity) such that each vertex is contained in exactly $N$ edges in the collection. The multinomial dimer model is a natural probability measure on $N$-dimer covers. We study the behavior of these measures on periodic bipartite graphs in ${\mathbb R}^d$, in the scaling limit as the multiplicity $N$ and then the size of the graph go to infinity.
  In this iterated limit, we prove a large deviation principle, where the rate function is the integral of an explicit surface tension, and show that random configurations concentrate on a limit shape which is the unique solution to an associated Euler-Lagrange equation. We further show that the associated critical gauge functions, which exist in the $N\to\infty$ limit on each finite graph, converge in the scaling limit to a limiting gauge function which solves a dual Euler-Lagrange equation.
  We use our techniques to compute explicit limit shapes in some two and three dimensional examples, such as the Aztec diamond and ``Aztec cuboid". These $3d$ examples are the first stat mech models in dimensions $d\ge3$ where limit shapes can be computed explicitly.</description>

      <title>Galton-Watson processes, simple varieties of trees and Khinchin families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18370v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we introduce a unified analytic framework that connects simple varieties of trees, Bienayme-Galton-Watson processes and Khinchin families. Using Lagrange's inversion formula, we derive new coefficient-based expressions for extinction probabilities and reinterpret them as boundary phenomena tied to the domain of the inverse of the solution to Lagrange's equation. This perspective reveals a structural bridge between combinatorial and probabilistic models, simplifying classical arguments and yielding new results. It also leads to a computationally efficient method for simulating Galton-Watson processes via power series coefficients.</description>
