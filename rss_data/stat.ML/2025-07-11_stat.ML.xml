      <title>Class conditional conformal prediction for multiple inputs by p-value aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction methods are statistical tools designed to quantify uncertainty and generate predictive sets with guaranteed coverage probabilities. This work introduces an innovative refinement to these methods for classification tasks, specifically tailored for scenarios where multiple observations (multi-inputs) of a single instance are available at prediction time. Our approach is particularly motivated by applications in citizen science, where multiple images of the same plant or animal are captured by individuals. Our method integrates the information from each observation into conformal prediction, enabling a reduction in the size of the predicted label set while preserving the required class-conditional coverage guarantee. The approach is based on the aggregation of conformal p-values computed from each observation of a multi-input. By exploiting the exact distribution of these p-values, we propose a general aggregation framework using an abstract scoring function, encompassing many classical statistical tools. Knowledge of this distribution also enables refined versions of standard strategies, such as majority voting. We evaluate our method on simulated and real data, with a particular focus on Pl@ntNet, a prominent citizen science platform that facilitates the collection and identification of plant species through user-submitted images.</description>

      <title>Topological Machine Learning with Unreduced Persistence Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised machine learning pipelines trained on features derived from persistent homology have been experimentally observed to ignore much of the information contained in a persistence diagram. Computing persistence diagrams is often the most computationally demanding step in such a pipeline, however. To explore this, we introduce several methods to generate topological feature vectors from unreduced boundary matrices. We compared the performance of pipelines trained on vectorizations of unreduced PDs to vectorizations of fully-reduced PDs across several data and task types. Our results indicate that models trained on PDs built from unreduced diagrams can perform on par and even outperform those trained on fully-reduced diagrams on some tasks. This observation suggests that machine learning pipelines which incorporate topology-based features may benefit in terms of computational cost and performance by utilizing information contained in unreduced boundary matrices.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Double Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double descent is a phenomenon of over-parameterized statistical models. Our goal is to view double descent from a Bayesian perspective. Over-parameterized models such as deep neural networks have an interesting re-descending property in their risk characteristics. This is a recent phenomenon in machine learning and has been the subject of many studies. As the complexity of the model increases, there is a U-shaped region corresponding to the traditional bias-variance trade-off, but then as the number of parameters equals the number of observations and the model becomes one of interpolation, the risk can become infinite and then, in the over-parameterized region, it re-descends -- the double descent effect. We show that this has a natural Bayesian interpretation. Moreover, we show that it is not in conflict with the traditional Occam's razor that Bayesian models possess, in that they tend to prefer simpler models when possible. We illustrate the approach with an example of Bayesian model selection in neural networks. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Hess-MC2: Sequential Monte Carlo Squared using Hessian Information and Second Order Proposals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When performing Bayesian inference using Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, two considerations arise: the accuracy of the posterior approximation and computational efficiency. To address computational demands, Sequential Monte Carlo Squared (SMC$^2$) is well-suited for high-performance computing (HPC) environments. The design of the proposal distribution within SMC$^2$ can improve accuracy and exploration of the posterior as poor proposals may lead to high variance in importance weights and particle degeneracy. The Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA) uses gradient information so that particles preferentially explore regions of higher probability. In this paper, we extend this idea by incorporating second-order information, specifically the Hessian of the log-target. While second-order proposals have been explored previously in particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo (p-MCMC) methods, we are the first to introduce them within the SMC$^2$ framework. Second-order proposals not only use the gradient (first-order derivative), but also the curvature (second-order derivative) of the target distribution. Experimental results on synthetic models highlight the benefits of our approach in terms of step-size selection and posterior approximation accuracy when compared to other proposals.</description>

      <title>Galerkin-ARIMA: A Two-Stage Polynomial Regression Framework for Fast Rolling One-Step-Ahead Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-series models like ARIMA remain widely used for forecasting but limited to linear assumptions and high computational cost in large and complex datasets. We propose Galerkin-ARIMA that generalizes the AR component of ARIMA and replace it with a flexible spline-based function estimated by Galerkin projection. This enables the model to capture nonlinear dependencies in lagged values and retain the MA component and Gaussian noise assumption. We derive a closed-form OLS estimator for the Galerkin coefficients and show the model is asymptotically unbiased and consistent under standard conditions. Our method bridges classical time-series modeling and nonparametric regression, which offering improved forecasting performance and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Unified Empirical Risk Minimization Framework for Flexible N-Tuples Weak Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To alleviate the annotation burden in supervised learning, N-tuples learning has recently emerged as a powerful weakly-supervised method. While existing N-tuples learning approaches extend pairwise learning to higher-order comparisons and accommodate various real-world scenarios, they often rely on task-specific designs and lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this paper, we propose a general N-tuples learning framework based on empirical risk minimization, which systematically integrates pointwise unlabeled data to enhance learning performance. This paper first unifies the data generation processes of N-tuples and pointwise unlabeled data under a shared probabilistic formulation. Based on this unified view, we derive an unbiased empirical risk estimator that generalizes a broad class of existing N-tuples models. We further establish a generalization error bound for theoretical support. To demonstrate the flexibility of the framework, we instantiate it in four representative weakly supervised scenarios, each recoverable as a special case of our general model. Additionally, to address overfitting issues arising from negative risk terms, we adopt correction functions to adjust the empirical risk. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and demonstrate that leveraging pointwise unlabeled data consistently improves generalization across various N-tuples learning tasks.</description>

      <title>TRIP: A Nonparametric Test to Diagnose Biased Feature Importance Scores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Along with accurate prediction, understanding the contribution of each feature to the making of the prediction, i.e., the importance of the feature, is a desirable and arguably necessary component of a machine learning model. For a complex model such as a random forest, such importances are not innate -- as they are, e.g., with linear regression. Efficient methods have been created to provide such capabilities, with one of the most popular among them being permutation feature importance due to its efficiency, model-agnostic nature, and perceived intuitiveness. However, permutation feature importance has been shown to be misleading in the presence of dependent features as a result of the creation of unrealistic observations when permuting the dependent features. In this work, we develop TRIP (Test for Reliable Interpretation via Permutation), a test requiring minimal assumptions that is able to detect unreliable permutation feature importance scores that are the result of model extrapolation. To build on this, we demonstrate how the test can be complemented in order to allow its use in high dimensional settings. Through testing on simulated data and applications, our results show that the test can be used to reliably detect when permutation feature importance scores are unreliable.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented Sequential Bayesian Experimental Design for Causal Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present GO-CBED, a goal-oriented Bayesian framework for sequential causal experimental design. Unlike conventional approaches that select interventions aimed at inferring the full causal model, GO-CBED directly maximizes the expected information gain (EIG) on user-specified causal quantities of interest, enabling more targeted and efficient experimentation. The framework is both non-myopic, optimizing over entire intervention sequences, and goal-oriented, targeting only model aspects relevant to the causal query. To address the intractability of exact EIG computation, we introduce a variational lower bound estimator, optimized jointly through a transformer-based policy network and normalizing flow-based variational posteriors. The resulting policy enables real-time decision-making via an amortized network. We demonstrate that GO-CBED consistently outperforms existing baselines across various causal reasoning and discovery tasks-including synthetic structural causal models and semi-synthetic gene regulatory networks-particularly in settings with limited experimental budgets and complex causal mechanisms. Our results highlight the benefits of aligning experimental design objectives with specific research goals and of forward-looking sequential planning.</description>

      <title>Feature-free regression kriging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial interpolation is a crucial task in geography. As perhaps the most widely used interpolation methods, geostatistical models -- such as Ordinary Kriging (OK) -- assume spatial stationarity, which makes it difficult to capture the nonstationary characteristics of geographic variables. A common solution is trend surface modeling (e.g., Regression Kriging, RK), which relies on external explanatory variables to model the trend and then applies geostatistical interpolation to the residuals. However, this approach requires high-quality and readily available explanatory variables, which are often lacking in many spatial interpolation scenarios -- such as estimating heavy metal concentrations underground. This study proposes a Feature-Free Regression Kriging (FFRK) method, which automatically extracts geospatial features -- including local dependence, local heterogeneity, and geosimilarity -- to construct a regression-based trend surface without requiring external explanatory variables. We conducted experiments on the spatial distribution prediction of three heavy metals in a mining area in Australia. In comparison with 17 classical interpolation methods, the results indicate that FFRK, which does not incorporate any explanatory variables and relies solely on extracted geospatial features, consistently outperforms both conventional Kriging techniques and machine learning models that depend on explanatory variables. This approach effectively addresses spatial nonstationarity while reducing the cost of acquiring explanatory variables, improving both prediction accuracy and generalization ability. This finding suggests that an accurate characterization of geospatial features based on domain knowledge can significantly enhance spatial prediction performance -- potentially yielding greater improvements than merely adopting more advanced statistical models.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Bernstein Inequality for Dependent Data in Hilbert Spaces and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning from non-independent and non-identically distributed data poses a persistent challenge in statistical learning. In this study, we introduce data-dependent Bernstein inequalities tailored for vector-valued processes in Hilbert space. Our inequalities apply to both stationary and non-stationary processes and exploit the potential rapid decay of correlations between temporally separated variables to improve estimation. We demonstrate the utility of these bounds by applying them to covariance operator estimation in the Hilbert-Schmidt norm and to operator learning in dynamical systems, achieving novel risk bounds. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to illustrate the practical implications of these bounds in both contexts.</description>

      <title>Pre-Trained AI Model Assisted Online Decision-Making under Missing Covariates: A Theoretical Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a sequential contextual decision-making problem in which certain covariates are missing but can be imputed using a pre-trained AI model. From a theoretical perspective, we analyze how the presence of such a model influences the regret of the decision-making process. We introduce a novel notion called "model elasticity", which quantifies the sensitivity of the reward function to the discrepancy between the true covariate and its imputed counterpart. This concept provides a unified way to characterize the regret incurred due to model imputation, regardless of the underlying missingness mechanism. More surprisingly, we show that under the missing at random (MAR) setting, it is possible to sequentially calibrate the pre-trained model using tools from orthogonal statistical learning and doubly robust regression. This calibration significantly improves the quality of the imputed covariates, leading to much better regret guarantees. Our analysis highlights the practical value of having an accurate pre-trained model in sequential decision-making tasks and suggests that model elasticity may serve as a fundamental metric for understanding and improving the integration of pre-trained models in a wide range of data-driven decision-making problems.</description>

      <title>Late Fusion Multi-task Learning for Semiparametric Inference with Nuisance Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the age of large and heterogeneous datasets, the integration of information from diverse sources is essential to improve parameter estimation. Multi-task learning offers a powerful approach by enabling simultaneous learning across related tasks. In this work, we introduce a late fusion framework for multi-task learning with semiparametric models that involve infinite-dimensional nuisance parameters, focusing on applications such as heterogeneous treatment effect estimation across multiple data sources, including electronic health records from different hospitals or clinical trial data. Our framework is two-step: first, initial double machine-learning estimators are obtained through individual task learning; second, these estimators are adaptively aggregated to exploit task similarities while remaining robust to task-specific differences. In particular, the framework avoids individual level data sharing, preserving privacy. Additionally, we propose a novel multi-task learning method for nuisance parameter estimation, which further enhances parameter estimation when nuisance parameters exhibit similarity across tasks. We establish theoretical guarantees for the method, demonstrating faster convergence rates compared to individual task learning when tasks share similar parametric components. Extensive simulations and real data applications complement the theoretical findings of our work while highlight the effectiveness of our framework even in moderate sample sizes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In most real-world applications of artificial intelligence, the distributions of the data and the goals of the learners tend to change over time. The Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning framework, which underpins most machine learning algorithms, fails to account for dynamic data distributions and evolving objectives, often resulting in suboptimal performance. Prospective learning is a recently introduced mathematical framework that overcomes some of these limitations. We build on this framework to present preliminary results that improve the algorithm and numerical results, and extend prospective learning to sequential decision-making scenarios, specifically foraging.

      <title>Reinforcement Learning with Action Chunking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Q-chunking, a simple yet effective recipe for improving reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks. Our recipe is designed for the offline-to-online RL setting, where the goal is to leverage an offline prior dataset to maximize the sample-efficiency of online learning. Effective exploration and sample-efficient learning remain central challenges in this setting, as it is not obvious how the offline data should be utilized to acquire a good exploratory policy. Our key insight is that action chunking, a technique popularized in imitation learning where sequences of future actions are predicted rather than a single action at each timestep, can be applied to temporal difference (TD)-based RL methods to mitigate the exploration challenge. Q-chunking adopts action chunking by directly running RL in a 'chunked' action space, enabling the agent to (1) leverage temporally consistent behaviors from offline data for more effective online exploration and (2) use unbiased $n$-step backups for more stable and efficient TD learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Q-chunking exhibits strong offline performance and online sample efficiency, outperforming prior best offline-to-online methods on a range of long-horizon, sparse-reward manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>Why is Your Language Model a Poor Implicit Reward Model?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reward models are key to language model post-training and inference pipelines. Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines an implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes. However, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution, compared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head over the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a generalization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They can be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and differ only in how the reward is computed. Towards a fundamental understanding of the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate the root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments, is that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently, they often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts, as well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against alternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge the intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder than verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator. Taken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can substantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.</description>

      <title>Determinant Estimation under Memory Constraints and Neural Scaling Laws</title>

Abstract: Calculating or accurately estimating log-determinants of large positive definite matrices is of fundamental importance in many machine learning tasks. While its cubic computational complexity can already be prohibitive, in modern applications, even storing the matrices themselves can pose a memory bottleneck. To address this, we derive a novel hierarchical algorithm based on block-wise computation of the LDL decomposition for large-scale log-determinant calculation in memory-constrained settings. In extreme cases where matrices are highly ill-conditioned, accurately computing the full matrix itself may be infeasible. This is particularly relevant when considering kernel matrices at scale, including the empirical Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) of neural networks trained on large datasets. Under the assumption of neural scaling laws in the test error, we show that the ratio of pseudo-determinants satisfies a power-law relationship, allowing us to derive corresponding scaling laws. This enables accurate estimation of NTK log-determinants from a tiny fraction of the full dataset; in our experiments, this results in a $\sim$100,000$\times$ speedup with improved accuracy over competing approximations. Using these techniques, we successfully estimate log-determinants for dense matrices of extreme sizes, which were previously deemed intractable and inaccessible due to their enormous scale and computational demands.</description>

      <title>LARP: Learner-Agnostic Robust Data Prefiltering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20573v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widespread availability of large public datasets is a key factor behind the recent successes of statistical inference and machine learning methods. However, these datasets often contain some low-quality or contaminated data, to which many learning procedures are sensitive. Therefore, the question of whether and how public datasets should be prefiltered to facilitate accurate downstream learning arises. On a technical level this requires the construction of principled data prefiltering methods which are learner-agnostic robust, in the sense of provably protecting a set of pre-specified downstream learners from corrupted data. In this work, we formalize the problem of Learner-Agnostic Robust data Prefiltering (LARP), which aims at finding prefiltering procedures that minimize a worst-case loss over a pre-specified set of learners. We first instantiate our framework in the context of scalar mean estimation with Huber estimators under the Huber data contamination model. We provide a hardness result on a specific problem instance and analyze several natural prefiltering procedures. Our theoretical results indicate that performing LARP on a heterogeneous set of learners leads to some loss in model performance compared to the alternative of prefiltering data for each learner/use-case individually. We explore the resulting utility loss and its dependence on the problem parameters via extensive experiments on real-world image and tabular data, observing statistically significant reduction in utility. Finally, we model the trade-off between the utility drop and the cost of repeated (learner-specific) prefiltering within a game-theoretic framework and showcase benefits of LARP for large datasets.</description>

      <title>It's Hard to Be Normal: The Impact of Noise on Structure-agnostic Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structure-agnostic causal inference studies how well one can estimate a treatment effect given black-box machine learning estimates of nuisance functions (like the impact of confounders on treatment and outcomes). Here, we find that the answer depends in a surprising way on the distribution of the treatment noise. Focusing on the partially linear model of \citet{robinson1988root}, we first show that the widely adopted double machine learning (DML) estimator is minimax rate-optimal for Gaussian treatment noise, resolving an open problem of \citet{mackey2018orthogonal}. Meanwhile, for independent non-Gaussian treatment noise, we show that DML is always suboptimal by constructing new practical procedures with higher-order robustness to nuisance errors. These \emph{ACE} procedures use structure-agnostic cumulant estimators to achieve $r$-th order insensitivity to nuisance errors whenever the $(r+1)$-st treatment cumulant is non-zero. We complement these core results with novel minimax guarantees for binary treatments in the partially linear model. Finally, using synthetic demand estimation experiments, we demonstrate the practical benefits of our higher-order robust estimators.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Bayesian Learning for Spatiotemporal Mechanistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06528v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an approach for Bayesian learning of spatiotemporal dynamical mechanistic models. Such learning consists of statistical emulation of the mechanistic system that can efficiently interpolate the output of the system from arbitrary inputs. The emulated learner can then be used to train the system from noisy data achieved by melding information from observed data with the emulated mechanistic system. This joint melding of mechanistic systems employ hierarchical state-space models with Gaussian process regression. Assuming the dynamical system is controlled by a finite collection of inputs, Gaussian process regression learns the effect of these parameters through a number of training runs, driving the stochastic innovations of the spatiotemporal state-space component. This enables efficient modeling of the dynamics over space and time. This article details exact inference with analytically accessible posterior distributions in hierarchical matrix-variate Normal and Wishart models in designing the emulator. This step obviates expensive iterative algorithms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo or variational approximations. We also show how emulation is applicable to large-scale emulation by designing a dynamic Bayesian transfer learning framework. Inference on mechanistic model parameters proceeds using Markov chain Monte Carlo as a post-emulation step using the emulator as a regression component. We demonstrate this framework through solving inverse problems arising in the analysis of ordinary and partial nonlinear differential equations and, in addition, to a black-box computer model generating spatiotemporal dynamics across a graphical model.</description>

      <title>Spectral Estimators for Structured Generalized Linear Models via Approximate Message Passing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14507v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of parameter estimation in a high-dimensional generalized linear model. Spectral methods obtained via the principal eigenvector of a suitable data-dependent matrix provide a simple yet surprisingly effective solution. However, despite their wide use, a rigorous performance characterization, as well as a principled way to preprocess the data, are available only for unstructured (i.i.d.\ Gaussian and Haar orthogonal) designs. In contrast, real-world data matrices are highly structured and exhibit non-trivial correlations. To address the problem, we consider correlated Gaussian designs capturing the anisotropic nature of the features via a covariance matrix $\Sigma$. Our main result is a precise asymptotic characterization of the performance of spectral estimators. This allows us to identify the optimal preprocessing that minimizes the number of samples needed for parameter estimation. Surprisingly, such preprocessing is universal across a broad set of designs, which partly addresses a conjecture on optimal spectral estimators for rotationally invariant models. Our principled approach vastly improves upon previous heuristic methods, including for designs common in computational imaging and genetics. The proposed methodology, based on approximate message passing, is broadly applicable and opens the way to the precise characterization of spiked matrices and of the corresponding spectral methods in a variety of settings.</description>

      <title>Finite Sample Analysis of Distribution-Free Confidence Ellipsoids for Linear Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The least squares (LS) estimate is the archetypical solution of linear regression problems. The asymptotic Gaussianity of the scaled LS error is often used to construct approximate confidence ellipsoids around the LS estimate, however, for finite samples these ellipsoids do not come with strict guarantees, unless some strong assumptions are made on the noise distributions. The paper studies the distribution-free Sign-Perturbed Sums (SPS) ellipsoidal outer approximation (EOA) algorithm which can construct non-asymptotically guaranteed confidence ellipsoids under mild assumptions, such as independent and symmetric noise terms. These ellipsoids have the same center and orientation as the classical asymptotic ellipsoids, only their radii are different, which radii can be computed by convex optimization. Here, we establish high probability non-asymptotic upper bounds for the sizes of SPS outer ellipsoids for linear regression problems and show that the volumes of these ellipsoids decrease at the optimal rate. Finally, the difference between our theoretical bounds and the empirical sizes of the regions are investigated experimentally.</description>

      <title>A Bilevel Optimization Framework for Imbalanced Data Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11171v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data rebalancing techniques, including oversampling and undersampling, are a common approach to addressing the challenges of imbalanced data. To tackle unresolved problems related to both oversampling and undersampling, we propose a new undersampling approach that: (i) avoids the pitfalls of noise and overlap caused by synthetic data and (ii) avoids the pitfall of under-fitting caused by random undersampling. Instead of undersampling majority data randomly, our method undersamples datapoints based on their ability to improve model loss. Using improved model loss as a proxy measurement for classification performance, our technique assesses a datapoint's impact on loss and rejects those unable to improve it. In so doing, our approach rejects majority datapoints redundant to datapoints already accepted and, thereby, finds an optimal subset of majority training data for classification. The accept/reject component of our algorithm is motivated by a bilevel optimization problem uniquely formulated to identify the optimal training set we seek. Experimental results show our proposed technique with F1 scores up to 10% higher than state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Gradient Normalization and Independent Sampling for (Stochastic) Generalized-Smooth Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that many nonconvex machine learning problems satisfy a generalized-smooth condition that extends beyond traditional smooth nonconvex optimization. However, the existing algorithms are not fully adapted to such generalized-smooth nonconvex geometry and encounter significant technical limitations on their convergence analysis. In this work, we first analyze the convergence of adaptively normalized gradient descent under function geometries characterized by generalized-smoothness and generalized P{\L} condition, revealing the advantage of adaptive gradient normalization. Our results provide theoretical insights into adaptive normalization across various scenarios.For stochastic generalized-smooth nonconvex optimization, we propose \textbf{I}ndependent-\textbf{A}daptively \textbf{N}ormalized \textbf{S}tochastic \textbf{G}radient \textbf{D}escent algorithm, which leverages adaptive gradient normalization, independent sampling, and gradient clipping to achieve an $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ sample complexity under relaxed noise assumptions. Experiments on large-scale nonconvex generalized-smooth problems demonstrate the fast convergence of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Challenges learning from imbalanced data using tree-based models: Prevalence estimates systematically depend on hyperparameters and can be upwardly biased</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imbalanced binary classification problems arise in many fields of study. When using machine learning models for these problems, it is common to subsample the majority class (i.e., undersampling) to create a (more) balanced dataset for model training. This biases the model's predictions because the model learns from a dataset that does not follow the same data generating process as new data. One way of accounting for this bias is to analytically map the resulting predictions to new values based on the sampling rate for the majority class, which was used to create the training dataset. While this approach may work well for some machine learning models, we show that calibrating a random forest this way has unintended negative consequences, including prevalence estimates that can be upwardly biased. These prevalence estimates depend on both i) the number of predictors considered at each split in the random forest; and ii) the sampling rate used. We explain the former using known properties of random forests and analytical calibration. However, in investigating the latter issue, we made a surprising discovery - contrary to the widespread belief that decision trees are biased towards the majority class, they actually can be biased towards the minority class.</description>

Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) is arguably one of the most widely used machine learning algorithms in practice. One of its prominent applications is Bayesian optimization (BO). Although the vanilla GP itself is already a powerful tool for BO, it is often beneficial to be able to consider the dependencies of multiple outputs. To do so, Multi-task GP (MTGP) is formulated, but it is not trivial to fully understand the derivations of its formulations and their gradients from the previous literature. This paper serves friendly derivations of the MTGP formulations and their gradients.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning is Not So Mysterious or Different</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are often seen as different from other model classes by defying conventional notions of generalization. Popular examples of anomalous generalization behaviour include benign overfitting, double descent, and the success of overparametrization. We argue that these phenomena are not distinct to neural networks, or particularly mysterious. Moreover, this generalization behaviour can be intuitively understood, and rigorously characterized, using long-standing generalization frameworks such as PAC-Bayes and countable hypothesis bounds. We present soft inductive biases as a key unifying principle in explaining these phenomena: rather than restricting the hypothesis space to avoid overfitting, embrace a flexible hypothesis space, with a soft preference for simpler solutions that are consistent with the data. This principle can be encoded in many model classes, and thus deep learning is not as mysterious or different from other model classes as it might seem. However, we also highlight how deep learning is relatively distinct in other ways, such as its ability for representation learning, phenomena such as mode connectivity, and its relative universality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social predictions do not passively describe the future; they actively shape it. They inform actions and change individual expectations in ways that influence the likelihood of the predicted outcome. Given these dynamics, to what extent can social events be predicted? This question was discussed throughout the 20th century by authors like Merton, Morgenstern, Simon, and others who considered it a central issue in social science methodology. In this work, we provide a modern answer to this old problem. Using recent ideas from performative prediction and outcome indistinguishability, we establish that one can always efficiently predict social events accurately, regardless of how predictions influence data. While achievable, we also show that these predictions are often undesirable, highlighting the limitations of previous desiderata. We end with a discussion of various avenues forward.</description>

      <title>Coefficient Shape Transfer Learning for Functional Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel transfer learning methodology to tackle the challenge of data scarcity in functional linear models. The methodology incorporates samples from the target model (target domain) alongside those from auxiliary models (source domains), transferring knowledge of coefficient shape from the source domains to the target domain. This shape-based knowledge transfer offers two key advantages. First, it is robust to covariate scaling, ensuring effectiveness despite variations in data distributions across different source domains. Second, the notion of coefficient shape homogeneity represents a meaningful advance beyond traditional coefficient homogeneity, allowing the method to exploit a wider range of source domains and achieve significantly improved model estimation. We rigorously analyze the convergence rates of the proposed estimator and examine the minimax optimality. Our findings show that the degree of improvement depends not only on the similarity of coefficient shapes between the target and source domains, but also on coefficient magnitudes and the spectral decay rates of the functional covariates covariance operators. To address situations where only a subset of auxiliary models is informative for the target model, we further develop a data-driven procedure for identifying such informative sources. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through comprehensive simulation studies and an application to occupation time analysis using physical activity data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.</description>

Abstract: Time series classification is crucial for numerous scientific and engineering applications. In this article, we present a numerically efficient, practically competitive, and theoretically rigorous classification method for distinguishing between two classes of locally stationary time series based on their time-domain, second-order characteristics. Our approach builds on the autoregressive approximation for locally stationary time series, combined with an ensemble aggregation and a distance-based threshold for classification. It imposes no requirement on the training sample size, and is shown to achieve zero misclassification error rate asymptotically when the underlying time series differ only mildly in their second-order characteristics. The new method is demonstrated to outperform a variety of state-of-the-art solutions, including wavelet-based, tree-based, convolution-based methods, as well as modern deep learning methods, through intensive numerical simulations and a real EEG data analysis for epilepsy classification.</description>
