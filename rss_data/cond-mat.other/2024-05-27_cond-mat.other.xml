      <title>Confinement Phenomena in Topological Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the fundamental theory describing the strong nuclear force and the interactions among quarks and gluons. Topological stars, characterized by extreme density conditions, offer a unique environment where QCD phenomena play a crucial role due to the confinement of fundamental particles. Understanding these phenomena is essential for unraveling the behavior and properties of these celestial bodies.
  In this study, we explore the implications of QCD within extreme density regimes, focusing on its contribution to the energy-momentum tensor ($T^{\mu\nu}_{\text{QCD}}$) within the framework of Quantum Chromodynamics. Our analysis sheds light on how these QCD effects influence the fabric of spacetime in the vicinity of topological stars, providing valuable insights into their underlying physics.</description>

      <title>Engineered Josephson diode effect in kinked Rashba nanochannels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect, reminiscent of the unidirectional charge transport in semiconductor diodes, is characterized by a nonreciprocal, dissipationless flow of Cooper pairs. This remarkable phenomenon arises from the interplay between symmetry constraints and the inherent quantum behavior of superconductors. Here, we explore the geometric control of the diode effect in a kinked nanostrip Josephson junction based on a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEGs) with Rashba spin-orbit interaction. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the diode effect as a function of the kink angle and the out-of-plane magnetic field. Our analysis reveals a rich phase diagram, showcasing a geometry and field-controlled diode effect. The phase diagram also reveals the presence of an anomalous Josephson effect related to the emergence of trivial zero-energy Andreev bound states, which can evolve into Majorana bound states. Our findings indicate that the exceptional synergy between geometric control of the diode effect and topological phases can be effectively leveraged to design and optimize superconducting devices with tailored transport properties.</description>

      <title>Coupling Light with Matter for Identifying Dominant Subnetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel light-matter platform that uses complex-valued oscillator networks, a form of physical neural networks, to identify dominant subnetworks and uncover indirect correlations within larger networks. This approach offers significant advantages, including low energy consumption, high processing speed, and the immediate identification of co- and counter-regulated nodes without post-processing. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through its application to biological networks, and we also propose its applicability to a wide range of other network types.</description>

      <title>Theory of Difference Frequency Quantum Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum oscillations (QO) describe the periodic variation of physical observables as a function of inverse magnetic field in metals. The Onsager relation connects the basic QO frequencies with the extremal areas of closed Fermi surface pockets, and the theory of magnetic breakdown explains the observation of sums of QO frequencies at high magnetic fields. Here we develop a quantitative theory of difference frequency QOs in two- and three-dimensional metals with multiple Fermi pockets with parabolic or linearly dispersing excitations. We show that a non-linear interband coupling, e.g. in the form of interband impurity scattering, can give rise to otherwise forbidden QO frequencies which can persist to much higher temperatures compared to the basis frequencies. We discuss the experimental implications of our findings for various material candidates, for example multi-fold fermion systems, and the relation to magneto intersubband oscillations known for coupled two-dimensional electron gases.</description>

      <title>Pair Production in time-dependent Electric field at Finite times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12079v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the finite-time behavior of pair production from the vacuum by a time-dependent Sauter pulsed electric field using the spinor quantum electrodynamics (QED). In the adiabatic basis, the one-particle distribution function in momentum space is determined by utilizing the exact analytical solution of the Dirac equation. By examining the temporal behavior of the one-particle distribution function and the momentum spectrum of created pairs in the sub-critical field limit $(E_0 = 0.2E_c)$, we observe oscillatory patterns in the longitudinal momentum spectrum(LMS) of particles at finite times. These oscillations arise due to quantum interference effects resulting from the dynamical tunneling. Furthermore, we derive an approximate and simplified analytical expression for the distribution function at finite times, which allows us to explain the origin and behavior of these oscillations. Additionally, we discuss the role of the vacuum polarization function and its counter term to the oscillations in LMS vacuum excitation. We also analyse the transverse momentum spectrum (TMS).</description>

      <title>Assessing the query complexity limits of quantum phase estimation using symmetry aware spectral bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computational cost of quantum algorithms for physics and chemistry is closely linked to the spectrum of the Hamiltonian, a property that manifests in the necessary rescaling of its eigenvalues. The typical approach of using the 1-norm as an upper bound to the spectral norm to rescale the Hamiltonian suits the most general case of bounded Hermitian operators but neglects the influence of symmetries commonly found in chemical systems. In this work, we introduce a hierarchy of symmetry-aware spectral bounds that provide a unified understanding of the performance of quantum phase estimation algorithms using block-encoded electronic structure Hamiltonians. We present a variational and numerically tractable method for computing these bounds, based on orbital optimization, to demonstrate that the computed bounds are smaller than conventional spectral bounds for a variety of molecular benchmark systems. We also highlight the unique analytical and numerical scaling behavior of these bounds in the thermodynamic and complete basis set limits. Our work shows that there is room for improvement in reducing the 1-norm, not yet achieved through methods like double factorization and tensor hypercontraction, but highlights potential challenges in improving the performance of current quantum algorithms beyond small constant factors through 1-norm reduction techniques alone.</description>

      <title>Vector Ising Spin Annealer for Minimizing Ising Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Vector Ising Spin Annealer (VISA), a framework in gain-based computing that harnesses light-matter interactions to solve complex optimization problems encoded in spin Hamiltonians. Traditional driven-dissipative systems often select excited states due to limitations in spin movement. VISA transcends these constraints by enabling spins to operate in a three-dimensional space, offering a robust solution to minimize Ising Hamiltonians effectively. Our comparative analysis reveals VISA's superior performance over conventional single-dimension spin optimizers, demonstrating its ability to bridge substantial energy barriers in complex landscapes. Through detailed studies on cyclic and random graphs, we show VISA's proficiency in dynamically evolving the energy landscape with time-dependent gain and penalty annealing, illustrating its potential to redefine optimization in physical systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-qubit quantum state preparation enabled by topology optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using topology optimization, we inverse-design nanophotonic cavities enabling the preparation of pure states of pairs and triples of quantum emitters. Our devices involve moderate values of the dielectric constant, operate under continuous laser driving, and yield fidelities to the target (Bell and W) states approaching unity for distant qubits (several natural wavelengths apart). In the fidelity optimization procedure, our algorithm generates entanglement by maximizing the dissipative coupling between the emitters, which allows the formation of multipartite pure steady states in the driven-dissipative dynamics of the system. Our findings open the way towards the efficient and fast preparation of multiqubit quantum states with engineered features, with potential applications for nonclassical light generation, quantum simulation, and quantum sensing.</description>
