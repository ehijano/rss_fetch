      <title>Ghost-free non-local $F(R)$ Gravity Compatible with ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We confront the ghost-free non-local $F(R)$ gravity theories with the latest Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) constraints on the spectral index of the scalar perturbations and the updated constraints of Planck/BICEP on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. After reviewing how the ghost-free non-local version of $F(R)$ gravity can be obtained, we show that the de Sitter solution can be obtained in this framework. Also, we show that the resulting theory can be cast in terms of an $F(R,\phi)$ theory of gravity. We analyze two models of non-local $F(R)$ gravity, one power-law and the $R^2$ model, and we show that both models can be compatible with the ACT and updated Planck/BICEP constraints.</description>

      <title>The Scalar Mach-Sciama Theory of Gravitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a scalar realization of Sciama's Machian programme within the general Bergmann-Wagoner class of scalar--tensor gravity. Starting from a universally conformally coupled matter sector, we rewrite the field equations in terms of the invariant set $\{{\cal I}_1,{\cal I}_2,{\cal I}_3,\hat g_{\mu\nu}\}$, so that Machian requirements can be stated independently of conformal frame. Sciama's causal postulate is implemented not by modifying the local dynamics, but as a selection rule on the solution space of the invariant scalar equation: the admissible configuration is the retarded response to the matter distribution in the causal past, with any source-free contribution removed. In a spatially flat FLRW universe, and in the light, slowly varying regime, the prescription reduces to an explicit temporal kernel that links the background scalar evolution to the matter content within the Hubble region, reproducing the expected Machian scaling in an expanding background. Universal coupling to a single physical metric implies that structureless test bodies share the same acceleration in a given external configuration, so that the E\"otvs parameter vanishes at leading order. Nonuniversal effects can arise only when gravitational binding energy contributes appreciably to the total mass, as in strongly self-gravitating objects. Thus, the theory implements a causal Machian determination of the cosmological inertial scale while remaining consistent with standard weak-field tests.</description>

      <title>Signatures of a subpopulation of hierarchical mergers in the GWTC-4 gravitational-wave dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Repeated black-hole mergers in dense stellar clusters are a plausible mechanism to populate the predicted gap in black hole masses due to the pair-instability process. These hierarchical mergers carry distinct spin and tilt features relative to first-generation black holes, for which previous studies have found evidence at a population level by interpreting features in the effective inspiral spin domain. We introduce an astrophysically-motivated model in the joint space of effective inspiral and precessing spins, which captures the dominant spin dynamics expected for hierarchical mergers. We find decisive evidence both for a population transition above $\sim 45M_\odot$, consistent with the anticipated onset of the pair-instability gap, as well as a peak at $\sim 15 M_\odot$, which we interpret as the global peak in the hierarchical merger rate. The existence of low- and high-mass subpopulations of higher-generation black holes suggests the contribution of both near-solar-metallicity and metal-poor star clusters to the hierarchical merger population. Our results reinforce the growing evidence for detailed, mass-dependent substructure in the spin distribution of the binary black hole population.</description>

      <title>General gravitational properties of neutron stars: curvature invariants, binding energy, and trace anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of curvature invariants for a large ensemble of neutron stars built with equations of state (EOSs) that satisfy constraints from nuclear theory and perturbative QCD, as well as measurements of neutron-star masses, radii, and gravitational waves from binary neutron-star mergers. Surprisingly, our analysis reveals that stars with negative Ricci scalar $\mathcal{R}$ are rather common and about $\sim 50\%$ of our EOSs produce one or more stars with Ricci curvature that is negative somewhere inside the star. The negative curvature is found mostly but not exclusively at the highest densities and pressures, and predominantly for stiff EOSs and for the most compact and most massive stars. Furthermore, we improve the quasi-universal relation between the stellar gravitational mass $M$ and the baryonic mass $M_\mathrm{b}$, which allows us to express analytically one in terms of the other with a maximum variance of only $\sim 3\%$. Finally, using the relation between the Ricci scalar and the trace anomaly $\Delta$, we determine the conditions under which $\Delta$ vanishes or becomes negative in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Generalized junction conditions for discontinuous metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the Darmois-Israel junction formalism is extended to the case of discontinuous metrics within the framework of Colombeau algebras of generalized functions. This formulation provides a mathematically consistent treatment of nonlinear operations involving singular quantities, such as products and derivatives of distributions. By relaxing the usual continuity condition on the metric, the generalized junction conditions naturally include higher-order singular terms in the curvature and in the surface energy-momentum tensor. These additional contributions represent new geometric degrees of freedom associated with genuine discontinuities in the space-time geometry. The resulting formalism recovers the traditional Darmois-Israel conditions as a limiting case, while offering a coherent extension applicable to geometric boundaries and abrupt transitions in space-time.</description>

      <title>A natural explanation of the Galactic Magnetic Fields from multistate Scalar Field Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the possibility that the large-scale magnetic fields observed in galaxies, of the order of microgauss, arise naturally from a complex Scalar Field Dark Matter (SFDM) halo charged under a local $U(1)$ symmetry. Extending our previous work, where multistate SFDM solutions were shown to form ``gravitational atoms'' capable of explaining the anisotropic distribution of satellite galaxies (VPOS), we analyze here the coupled dynamics of the scalar and a gauge field at the perturbative level. By solving the perturbed Klein-Gordon and gauge-field equations, we find the temporal evolution and show that the spatial structure of the induced electromagnetic fields is governed by the same spherical Bessel functions and spherical harmonics that characterize the ground and excited states of the multi-state SFDM halo. Remarkably, the presence of the gauge field does not modify the dark-matter density distribution, which preserves the multi-state configuration previously obtained. Our results demonstrate that a charged multi-state SFDM halo can generate coherent, large-scale magnetic fields whose morphology is determined by the excited modes of the scalar field, providing a unified framework in which both galactic magnetic fields and VPOS-like structures originate from the underlying quantum nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet Behavior of the Wheeler-DeWitt Equation in Horava-Lifshitz Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08222v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum structure of black hole interiors in Horava-Lifshitz gravity by analyzing the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in minisuperspace. Focusing on the ultraviolet regime, where higher-order spatial curvature terms dominate, we derive analytical solutions in this UV limit for both the original Horava-Lifshitz action and its analytically continued counterpart. We study their behavior near the event horizon and the classical singularity, with particular attention to the interpretation of the wave function in terms of the annihilation-to-nothing scenario proposed in general relativity. In this paper, we have considered cases in which the two-dimensional spatial section is spherical, planar, or hyperbolic, as well as models with positive, negative, or vanishing cosmological constant. In all cases, we find that the terms dominating in the ultraviolet regime, together with the effects of the running scaling parameter, act to suppress the annihilation-to-nothing behavior. These results suggest that, at least within the range explored in this study, the characteristic annihilation-to-nothing behavior does not appear in the ultraviolet regime of Horava-Lifshitz gravity, and provide a new perspective on the understanding of singularity resolution in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Kaluza-Klein Reduction of Einstein's Gravity in $6D$ on $S^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a six-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory with spacetime topology $M_4 \times S^2$ and analyze the gauge sector arising from dimensional reduction. Using normalized Killing vectors on $S^2$, we explicitly construct the reduced Yang-Mills action and determine the corresponding gauge kinetic matrix. Despite the $SO(3)$ isometry of $S^2$, we show that only two physical gauge fields propagate in four dimensions. The gauge kinetic matrix therefore has rank two and possesses a single zero eigenvalue. We demonstrate that this degeneracy is a direct consequence of the coset structure $S^2 \simeq SO(3)/SO(2)$ and reflects a non-dynamical gauge direction rather than an inconsistency of the reduction. Our results clarify the geometric origin of gauge degrees of freedom in Kaluza-Klein reductions on coset spaces.</description>

      <title>Geometry is Wavy: Curvature Wave Equations for Generic Affine Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometry is wavy: even at the purely geometric level (no particular theory chosen), curvature satisfies a covariant quasilinear wave equation. In Riemannian geometry equipped with the Levi-Civita connection, the Riemann curvature tensor obeys a wave equation of the schematic form \[ \Box Riem=\mathcal{Q}(Riem,Riem), \] where $\mathcal{Q}(Riem,Riem)$ denotes the terms quadratic in the curvature arising from the Bianchi identities. In this work, we generalize this curvature wave equation to spacetimes endowed with a generic affine connection possessing torsion and nonmetricity. Working within the metric-affine framework, we derive the corresponding wave equation for the Riemann tensor and analyze its structure in several geometrically and physically distinguished settings, including Einstein spaces, teleparallel gravity, and Einstein-Cartan theory.</description>

      <title>Magnetized dynamical black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a novel exact solution of the Einstein-scalar-Maxwell equations describing a dynamical black hole immersed in an external, time-dependent electromagnetic field. Motivated by the need for more realistic analytical black hole models, our construction incorporates two key ingredients often neglected in exact solutions: a fully dynamical cosmological background and the non-perturbative backreaction of external electromagnetic fields. The compact object is obtained by dressing a Schwarzschild black hole with a radially and temporally dependent scalar field, yielding a time-dependent generalization of the Fisher-Janis-Newman-Winicour solution within the Fonarev framework. The external electromagnetic field is generated via a Lie point symmetry of the Einstein-scalar-Maxwell system, which exports the effect of a Harrison transformation to dynamical settings provided a spacelike Killing vector is present. The resulting spacetime combines a spherically symmetric dynamical horizon with an axisymmetric electromagnetic field and exhibits a rich asymptotic structure mixing Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker and Levi-Civita geometries. We show that the time dependence of the configuration plays a crucial role in potentially cloaking curvature singularities, which would otherwise be generically naked in the stationary limit. We analyze the geometric and physical properties of the solution, including its asymptotic behavior, algebraic classification, and the structure of trapped surfaces defining the dynamical horizon. Possible implications for primordial black holes and some astrophysical applications, as well as extensions to higher dimensions, are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: We obtain the metric which describes the spacetime corresponding to the Frolov black hole in the presence of a cloud of strings and discuss how this cloud affects the regularity of the solution and the energy conditions. In addition, we analyze geodesics, effective potential, and several thermodynamic aspects. Finally, we compare our results with the corresponding findings in the literature for the original Frolov black hole, that is, in the absence of a cloud of strings</description>

      <title>Condensation of area quanta ensembles with quantum statistics in Schwarzschild spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As is well known, near-horizon (equivalently high acceleration) observers in spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes have a particularly simple form of the quasi-local energy. Using this energy and indistinguishable area quanta satisfying quantum statistics a statistical mechanical description of the Schwarzschild black hole geometry for uniformly accelerating observers is developed. The resulting model has several phases including one with highly excited states, Bose-Einstein condensates, condensates distinct from the usual Bose gas, and degenerate Fermi gases. In the large area limit, relevant for comparison to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, the new condensed state is favored over Bose-Einstein condensation and the degenerate Fermi gas. The entropies of the phases, and the entropy of mixing, are computed. The resulting low-entropic condensed state, where the quanta are essentially all in the lowest Bose energy state, provides the framework for the quantization of near-horizon geometric fluctuations, which is explored in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Black hole entropy from the quantum atmosphere of bound gravitational fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole entropy is identified with the counting of the dynamical degrees of freedom of trapped gravitational modes continually sourced by the Hawking-Unruh process. In the context of linear perturbations of Schwarzschild spacetime the density of states is derived from the orthogonality of states in the solution space of the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equation. The otherwise divergent energy and entropy is cutoff by the Planck scale closest approach of constantly accelerating observers near the horizon. The thermal distribution of the trapped modes, which represent shape fluctuations in the near horizon geometry, store a significant fraction of the spacetime mass as observed from far away. Unlike quasi-normal modes the modes are not directly observable outside of $\sim 3 M$ but, being external to the horizon, they affect the propagation of null rays near the black hole. The characteristic frequencies, around 100 Hz for solar mass black holes, are discussed in relation to possible observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For generic theories of nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) we investigate the restrictions imposed by causality on spherically-symmetric charged black-hole solutions of the Einstein-NLED equations. For a large class of (acausal) Born-type NLED theories, we find that the Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) metric is an exact, but unstable, solution for some dyonic black holes. For all causal NLED we show that there are no regular black holes, and that the entropy of extremal black holes is less than the RN entropy for fixed charge. We also find the conditions for a parameter-space transition between RN-type and Schwarzschild-type global structure. For the transition from Schwarzschild-type to naked singularity, which occurs at finite mass, we show that the metric at the transition point is a Barriola-Vilenkin global monopole.</description>

      <title>Local Scale Invariance in Quantum Theory: Experimental Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the experimental predictions of the local scale invariant, non-Hermitian pilot-wave (de Broglie-Bohm) formulation of quantum theory introduced in arXiv:2601.03567. We use Weyl's definition of gravitational radius of charge to obtain the fine-structure constant for non-integrable scale effects $\alpha_S$. The minuteness of $\alpha_S$ relative to $\alpha$ ($\alpha_S/\alpha \sim 10^{-21}$) effectively hides the effects in usual quantum experiments. In an Aharonov-Bohm double-slit experiment, the theory predicts that the position probability density depends on which slit the particle trajectory crosses, due to a non-integrable scale induced by the magnetic flux. This experimental prediction can be realistically tested for an electrically neutral, heavy molecule with mass $m \sim 10^{-19} \text{g}$ at a $\sim 10^6 \text{ esu}$ flux regime. We analyse the Weyl-Einstein debate on the second-clock effect using the theory and show that spectral frequencies are history-independent. We thereby resolve Einstein's key objection against local scale invariance, and obtain two further experimental predictions. First, spectral intensities turn out to be history-dependent. Second, energy eigenvalues are modified by tiny imaginary corrections that modify spectral linewidths. We argue that the trajectory dependence of the probabilities renders our theory empirically distinguishable from other quantum formulations that do not use pilot-wave trajectories, or their mathematical equivalents, to derive experimental predictions.</description>

      <title>Generalized Entropy is von Neumann Entropy II: The complete symmetry group and edge modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the algebra of observables of perturbative quantum gravity in the exterior of a stationary black hole or the static patch of de Sitter spacetime. It was previously argued that the backreaction of gravitons on the spacetime perturbs the area of the horizon at second-order which gives rise to a non-trivial constraint on the algebra of physical observables in the subregion. The corresponding "dressed" algebra including fluctuations of the total horizon area admits a well-defined trace and is Type II. In this paper we show that, at the same perturbative order at which the horizon area (and angular momentum) fluctuates, gravitational backreaction also perturbs the horizon area in an angle-dependent way. These fluctuations are encoded in horizon charges -- i.e., "edge modes" -- which are related to an infinite dimensional "boost supertranslation" symmetry of the horizon. Together, these charges impose an infinite family of nontrivial constraints on the gravitational algebra. We construct the full algebra of observables which satisfies these constraints. We argue that the resulting algebra is Type II and its trace is shown to take a universal form. The entropy of any "semiclassical state" is the generalized entropy with an additional "edge mode" contribution as well as a state-independent constant. For any black hole spacetime, the algebra has no maximum entropy state and is Type II$_{\infty}$. In de Sitter, the static patch is defined relative to the worldline of a localized "observer". We show that a consistent quantization of the static-patch algebra requires a more realistic model of the observer, in which higher multipole moments perturb the "shape" of the cosmological horizon. We argue that a proper account of the observer's rotational kinetic energy and (non-gravitational) binding energy implies that the algebra is of Type II$_{1}$ and thereby admits a maximum entropy state.</description>

      <title>Unimodular time in JT gravity: a holographic clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How is a ''bulk clock'' encoded holographically? We address this in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity, where a natural physical clock emerges by promoting the vacuum energy to a dynamical variable: the vacuum cosmological constant becomes a top form degree of freedom conjugate to spacetime volume, thereby defining a notion of bulk physical time. This construction is naturally formulated in the Henneaux-Teitelboim (HT) framework. We show that the boundary dynamics is the Schwarzian mode coupled to a free particle on $U(1)$, matching the universal low-energy effective action of the complex SYK model. By further clarifying the role of the vacuum cosmological constant as a top form, we establish the equivalence between JT gravity coupled to two-dimensional Maxwell theory and 2d HT gravity via an explicit field redefinition. The initial question is addressed: we show that the resulting boundary theory can itself be rewritten as an observer action, equivalently a $(0+1)$-dimensional HT theory. This yields a direct identification of the boundary clock with the $U(1)$ phase mode, and makes its relation to the bulk clock explicit.</description>

      <title>Subregion algebras in classical and quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the kinematics and dynamics of subregion algebras in classical and perturbative quantum gravity associated with portions of null surfaces such as event horizons and finite causal diamonds. We construct half-sided supertranslation generators by extending subregion phase spaces of the event horizon to include doubled pairs of corner edge modes obtained from splitting the horizon, namely relative boosts and null translations of the respective corners. These edge modes carry a corner symplectic form and give rise to canonical charges generating half-sided boosts and translations. We show that the null translation generator is necessarily two-sided in the complementary translation edge modes. The charges act nontrivially on gravitationally dressed local observables on the horizon, such that the horizon subalgebra naturally takes the form of a crossed product by the associated automorphism group. Quantizing the extended phase space after linearizing around a black hole background, we obtain for each horizon cut a Type II$_{\infty}$ von Neumann algebra equipped with a trace, whose von Neumann entropy coincides with the generalized entropy of that cut. The integrability of the half-sided null translation generator lifts to the existence of a self-adjoint operator that implements null time evolution on the Type II$_\infty$ horizon subalgebras. The area operator is identified as the bulk implementation of the Connes cocycle flow for one-sided observables in excited states. The nesting property of the resulting one-parameter family of horizon subalgebras implies a generalized second law for non-stationary linearized perturbations of Killing horizons. Lastly, we use gravitational half-sided modular inclusion algebras to prove the quantum focusing conjecture in the perturbative quantum gravity regime.</description>

      <title>Relativistic jets from millisecond proto-magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07918v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapidly rotating, strongly magnetized neutron stars (``millisecond proto-magnetars'') formed in stellar core-collapse, neutron star mergers, and white dwarf accretion-induced collapse have long been proposed as central engines of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) and accompanying supernovae/kilonovae. However, during the first few seconds after birth, neutrino heating drives baryon-rich winds from the neutron star surface, potentially limiting the magnetization and achievable Lorentz factors of the outflow and casting doubt on whether proto-magnetars can launch ultra-relativistic jets at early times, as needed to power short-duration GRB. We present 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of neutrino-heated proto-magnetar winds that incorporate M0 neutrino transport. While the global wind properties broadly agree with previous analytic estimates calibrated to one-dimensional models, our simulations reveal essential multidimensional effects. For rapidly rotating models with spin periods P = 1 ms, centrifugal forces strongly enhance mass loss near the rotational equator, producing a dense, sub-relativistic outflow ( ~0.1c). This equatorial wind naturally confines and collimates less baryon-loaded outflows emerging from higher latitudes, leading to the formation of a structured bipolar jet with a peak magnetization up to ~ 30-100 along the pole, sufficient to reach bulk Lorentz factors ~ 100 on larger scales. The resulting angular stratification of the outflow energy into ultra-relativistic polar and sub-relativistic equatorial components is broadly consistent with the observed partition between beaming-corrected GRB energies and supernova/kilonova ejecta. Our results demonstrate that millisecond proto-magnetars can launch relativistic jets within seconds of formation and highlight their potential role in powering the diverse electromagnetic counterparts of compact-object explosions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational dynamics of 3+1 dimensional covariant quantum spacetime in the IKKT or IIB matrix model is studied at one loop, combining the Yang-Mills-type matrix action with the induced Einstein-Hilbert action. This combined action leads to interesting modifications of the gravitational dynamics at long distances, governed by modified Einstein equations including an extra geometrical tensor interpreted as ''mirage matter''. In particular we find extra non-Ricci flat geometric modes with a non-standard dispersion relation, with features reminiscent of dark matter.</description>

      <title>A Non-Renormalization Theorem for Local Functionals in Ghost-Free Vector Field Theories Coupled to Dynamical Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a non-renormalization theorem for a class of ghost-free local functionals describing massive vector field theories coupled to dynamical geometry. Under the assumptions of locality, Lorentz invariance, and validity of the effective field theory expansion below a fixed cutoff, we show that quantum corrections do not generate local operators that renormalize the classical derivative self-interactions responsible for the constraint structure of the theory. The proof combines an operator-level analysis of the space of allowed local counterterms with a systematic decoupling-limit argument, which isolates the leading contributions to the effective action at each order in the derivative expansion. As a consequence, all radiatively induced local functionals necessarily involve additional derivatives per field and are suppressed by the intrinsic strong-coupling scales of the theory. In particular, the classical interactions defining ghost-free vector field theories are stable under renormalization, and any additional degrees of freedom arising from quantum corrections appear only above the effective field theory cutoff. This result extends known non-renormalization properties of flat-space vector theories to the case of dynamical geometry and provides a structural explanation for their perturbative stability to all loop orders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a formalism to compute non-perturbative 5-point scattering amplitudes and apply it to gravitational waveforms in the two-body problem for arbitrary trajectories. Drawing inspiration from Feshbach's projector formalism in nuclear physics, we introduce effective potentials governing graviton emission and relate them to perturbative scattering amplitudes at arbitrary order in the gravitational coupling and mass ratio. Once these potentials are determined, the corresponding non-perturbative amplitudes in the classical limit are obtained by iterative insertions and subsequently translated into gravitational waveforms using the KMOC formalism. As an application, we compute the gravitational waveform emitted by a two-body system moving along a generic, potentially highly bent, trajectory. Importantly, our formalism extends effective field theory matching of the gravitational two-body potential to radiative phenomena, enabling the extraction of gravitational-wave source terms directly from perturbative on-shell scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Fraction of LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA Binary Black Hole Merger Events Associated with Active Galactic Nucleus Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation channels of binary black hole (BBH) mergers detected by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) network remain uncertain. While BBH mergers occurring inside active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks may interact with surrounding gas and generate observable optical flares. We test this scenario by quantifying the spatial and temporal correlation between BBH events in GWTC-4.0 and AGN flares identified from six years of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) DR23 data. Using 80 BBH mergers selected for adequate localization, redshift reach, observing-epoch overlap, and ZTF sky coverage, we construct a likelihood for the flare-associated fraction, $f_{\rm flare}$, that combines each event's 3D localization with a locally estimated flare number density derived from a 3D Voronoi tessellation, while explicitly accounting for survey boundaries and incomplete catalog coverage. Adopting a 200-day post-merger time window for potential counterparts, we infer $f_{\rm flare} = 0.07_{-0.05}^{+0.25}$ (90\% confidence level). This non-zero maximum-likelihood value is driven primarily by GW190412, for which a single flare candidate (J143041.67+355703.8) is consistent in both time and spatial position. Excluding GW190412 yields results consistent with no association and an upper limit of $f_{\rm flare} &lt; 0.17$ at 90\% confidence level. The intrinsic properties of GW190412 and the characteristics of the candidate host AGN are broadly consistent with theoretical expectations for the AGN-disk formation channel, motivating continued, targeted electromagnetic follow-up of well-localized and highly asymmetric BBH mergers in current and upcoming time-domain surveys.</description>

      <title>A new magnitude--redshift relation based on SNe Ia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new empirical relation between the standardized magnitude ($m$) of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and redshift ($z$). Using Pantheon+ and DES-SN5YR, we find a negative linear correlation between $m-5\log(z(1+z))$ and $z$, implying that their magnitude--redshift relation can be parametrized with just two parameters: an intercept $\mathcal{M}$ and a slope $b$. This relation corresponds to the luminosity distance $d_L(z)=c\,H_0^{-1}z(1+z)10^{bz/5}$ and is valid up to at least $z\simeq1.1$. It outperforms the $\Lambda$CDM and flat $w$CDM models and the (2,1) Pad\'e approximant for $d_L(z)$, and performs comparably to the flat $\Lambda$CDM model and the (2,1) Pad\'e($j_0=1$) model of Hu et al. Furthermore, the relation is stable in the absence of low-$z$ SNe, making it suitable for fitting Hubble diagrams of SNe Ia without the need to add a low-$z$ sample. In deep fields in particular, assuming that the large-scale density is independent of the comoving radial coordinate, $b\propto q_0+1$. We fit the empirical relation to SN data in eight deep-field regions and find that their fitted $\mathcal{M}$ and $b$ parameters are consistent within $1.6\,\sigma$, in agreement with isotropy. The inferred $q_0$ values, ranging from $-0.6$ to $-0.4$, are consistent within $1.5\,\sigma$ and significantly lower than zero, indicating statistically consistent cosmic acceleration across all eight regions. We apply the empirical relation to the DES-Dovekie and Amalgame SN samples, finding $b$ values consistent with those from DES-SN5YR and Pantheon+. Finally, using the empirical relation in the hemispheric comparison method applied to Pantheon+ up to $z=1.1$, we find no evidence for anisotropies in $\mathcal{M}$ and $b$.</description>

      <title>One-Loop Tensor Power Spectrum from a Non-Minimally Coupled Spectator Field during Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the full one-loop corrections to the primordial tensor power spectrum in an inflationary scenario with a non-minimally coupled spectator field, using the in-in formalism. We derive semi-analytic results for the scalar-sourced one-loop tensor spectrum and the effective tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r_{\mathrm{eff}}$ . We consider two representative coupling functions: a localized Gaussian dip (Model G), which leads to moderate loop corrections, and a rapidly oscillatory coupling (Model O), which can yield much larger loop contributions. For Model G, we find a $\mathcal{O}(1)$ correction to $r_{\mathrm{eff}}$ while Model O can significantly enhance $r_{\mathrm{eff}}$ by several orders of magnitude (relative to the tree-level value). We further calculate the energy density of primordial gravitational waves. Assuming that primordial black holes with mass $10^{-12}M_{\odot}$ generated in this scenario, constitute all of the dark matter, we find that the results are several orders of magnitude lower than the sensitivities of Taiji/TianQin/LISA.</description>

Abstract: The third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) contains 90 binary coalescence candidates detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration (LVK). We provide a re-analysis of binary black hole (BBH) events using a recently developed numerical relativity (NR) waveform surrogate model, NRSur7dq4, that includes all $\ell \leq 4$ spin-weighted spherical harmonic modes as well as the complete physical effects of precession. Properties of the remnant black holes' (BH's) mass, spin vector, and kick vector are found using an associated remnant surrogate model NRSur7dq4Remnant. Both NRSur7dq4 and NRSur7dq4Remnant models have errors comparable to numerical relativity simulations and allow for high-accuracy parameter estimates. We restrict our analysis to 47 BBH events that fall within the regime of validity of NRSur7dq4 (mass ratios greater than 1/6 and total masses greater than $60 M_{\odot}$). While for most of these events our results match the LVK analyses that were obtained using the semi-analytical models such as IMRPhenomXPHM and SEOBNRv4PHM, we find that for more than 20\% of events the NRSur7dq4 model recovers noticeably different measurements of black hole properties like the masses and spins, as well as extrinsic properties like the binary inclination and distance. For instance, GW150914_095045 exhibits noticeable differences in spin precession and spin magnitude measurements. Other notable findings include one event (GW191109_010717) that constrains the effective spin $\chi_{eff}$ to be negative at a 99.3\% credible level and two events (GW191109_010717 and GW200129_065458) with well-constrained kick velocities. Furthermore, compared to the models used in the LVK analyses, NRSur7dq4 recovers a larger signal-to-noise ratio and/or Bayes factors for several events.</description>

Abstract: The pulsar timings are sensitive to both the nanohertz gravitational-wave background and the oscillation of ultralight dark matter. The Hellings-Downs angular correlation curve provides a criterion to search for stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds at nanohertz via pulsar timing arrays. We study the angular correlation of the timing residuals induced by the spin-2 ultralight dark matter, which is different from the usual Hellings-Downs correlation. At a typical frequency, we show that the spin-2 ultralight dark matter can give rise to the deformation of the Hellings-Downs correlation curve induced by the stochastic gravitational wave background.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology and origin of late-time tails in eccentric binary black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the late-time tail behavior in gravitational waves from merging eccentric binary black holes (BBH) using black hole perturbation theory. For simplicity, we focus only on the dominant quadrupolar mode of the radiation. We demonstrate that such tails become more prominent as eccentricity increases. Exploring the phenomenology of the tails in both spinning and non-spinning eccentric binaries, with the spin magnitude varying from $\chi=-0.6$ to $\chi=+0.6$ and eccentricity as high as $e=0.98$, we find that these tails can be well approximated by a slowly decaying power law. We study the power law for varying systems and find that the power law exponent lies close to the theoretically expected value $-4$. Finally, using both plunge geodesic and radiation-reaction-driven orbits, we perform a series of numerical experiments to understand the origin of the tails in BBH simulations. Our results suggest that the late-time tails are strongly excited in eccentric BBH systems when the smaller black hole is in the neighborhood of the apocenter, as opposed to any structure in the strong field of the larger black hole. Our analysis framework is publicly available through the \texttt{gwtails} Python package.</description>

      <title>Scalar perturbations on the normal and self-accelerating branch of a DGP brane and $\sigma_8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we constrain the value of $\sigma_8$ for the normal and self-accelerating branch of a DGP brane embedded in a five-dimensional Minkowski space-time. For that purpose we first constrain the model parameters $H_0$, $\Omega_{m0}$, $\Omega_{r0}$ and $M$ by means of the Pantheon+ catalog and a mock catalog of gravitational waves. Then, we solve numerically the equation for dark matter scalar perturbations using the dynamical scaling solution for the master equation and assuming that $p=4$ for the matter dominated era. Finally, we found that the evolution of matter density perturbations in both branches is different from the $\Lambda$CDM model and that the value of $\sigma_8=0.774\pm0.027$ for the normal branch and $\sigma_8=0.913\pm0.032$ for the self-accelerating branch.</description>

      <title>Equivalence principles in Weyl transverse gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03888v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There exist two consistent theories of massless, self-interacting gravitons, which differ by their local symmetries: general relativity and Weyl transverse gravity. We show that these two theories are also the only two metric descriptions of gravity in 4 spacetime dimensions which obey the equivalence principle for test gravitational physics. We further analyse how the weaker formulations of the equivalence principle are realised in Weyl transverse gravity (and its generalisations). The analysis sheds light on the behaviour of matter fields in this theory.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass ratio inspirals in dark matter halos: dynamics and distinguishability of halo models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) signals from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), a key target for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), will be affected in the presence of dark matter (DM) halos. In this paper we explore whether the effects of DM are detectable by LISA within a fully relativistic framework. We model the massive EMRI component as a nonrotating black hole (BH) surrounded by a DM halo. We compute axial and polar GW fluxes for circular orbits at linear order in the mass ratio for DM density profiles with varying mass and compactness. By comparing the phase evolution with vacuum systems, we find that DM halos can induce dephasings of tens to hundreds of radians over a one-year observation period. We demonstrate that even highly diluted DM distributions can significantly affect the emitted waveforms, and that the resulting GW signals can usually be distinguished from each other. While it is important to generalize these findings to more generic orbits and to spinning BHs, our results suggest that LISA could not only reveal the presence of DM halos, but also discriminate between different halo models.</description>

      <title>On the Limits of the Thermofield-Double Interpretation of the Minkowski Vacuumment?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Minkowski vacuum is often presented in textbooks and reviews as a thermofield double (TFD) state, an entangled state of field modes in the left and right Rindler wedges. This picture is widely used to explain the Unruh effect, motivate entanglement entropy calculations, and connect quantum field theory to black hole thermodynamics and AdS/CFT. However, we show that this interpretation, while elegant, is not exact.
  We explicitly compute two-point functions and their derivatives for a massless scalar field in two-dimensional Minkowski space, comparing results obtained from canonical quantization with those obtained by assuming a TFD form of the vacuum. Mixed-derivative correlators agree perfectly, but higher-derivative correlators show systematic mismatches that persist even for points well away from horizons and are not removed by infrared regularization.
  To further test this picture, we construct an alternate coordinate system that divides Minkowski spacetime into two disconnected regions, apply the same derivation that leads to the standard TFD expression, and obtain a new "entangled-state" representation of the vacuum that is not thermal. This demonstrates that the appearance of a TFD structure is a feature of the derivation method rather than a fundamental property of the vacuum. Our results clarify the limits of interpreting the Minkowski vacuum as a literal TFD state, emphasizing that while it captures key thermal features, it should be viewed as a powerful calculational tool rather than a precise statement about Hilbert space structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We constructed the ghost-free condition for nonlocal gravity using de-Sitter background field expansion and identified the structure of the nontrivial form factors. Our analysis shows that the particle spectrum of this model is nearly equivalent to general relativity(GR), with the potential addition of a scalar particle with positive mass m. Additionally, by employing recursion relations, we established the equivalence between nonlocal gravity and higher-derivative gravity. Moreover, we provided a comprehensive proof of the stability of de-Sitter solution within the nonlocal framework.</description>

      <title>Gravity from equilibrium thermodynamics of stretched light cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work digs into the connection between gravity and thermodynamics of stretched light cones (SLC). They are associated with uniformly accelerating observers, who endow the SLC with a physical notion of temperature via the Unruh effect. We compute the expansion, shear, and vorticity of the SLC to fully study its dynamics and account for the possibility of previously predicted non-equilibrium entropy production. For consistency, we prove the equivalence of the two different geometrical methods available for studying the SLCs' properties. Then, we apply the energy balance and use Clausius' relation to relate the geometrical properties of the SLC with energy fluxes crossing its surface, showing that it encodes the equations governing the gravitational dynamics. We show here how this analysis can be fully carried in terms of equilibrium thermodynamics due to the vanishing of shear, and how one can identify a work term related to the acceleration of the observer.</description>

      <title>Globally defined Carroll symmetry of gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The local Carroll symmetry of a gravitational wave found in Baldwin-Jeffery-Rosen coordinates is extended to a globally defined one by switching to Brinkmann coordinates. Two independent globally defined solutions of a Sturm-Liouville equation allow us to describe both the symmetries (translations and Carroll boosts) and the geodesic motions. One of them satisfies particular initial conditions which imply zero initial momentum, while the other does not. Pure displacement arises when the latter is turned off by requiring the momentum to vanish and when the wave parameters take, in addition, some particular values which correspond to having an integer half-wave number. The relation to the Schwarzian derivative is highlighted. We illustrate our general statements by the P\"oschl-Teller profile.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, exact charged spherically symmetric black hole solutions within the framework of bumblebee gravity have been obtained, where the Lorentz symmetry is spontaneously broken due to the nonvanishing vacuum expectation value of the bumblebee field. In this work, we investigate the quasinormal modes of this black hole. We compute the quasinormal frequencies corresponding to the scalar perturbation and the gravito-electromagnetic coupled perturbation using both the continued fraction method and the asymptotic iteration method. A detailed comparison of the results obtained from the two approaches is presented to evaluate their accuracy and efficiency in this Lorentz-violating background.</description>

Abstract: At linear order we study perturbations to a G\"odel background spacetime which includes expansion in addition to rotation. We investigate the transformation behaviour of these perturbations under gauge transformations and construct gauge invariant quantities. Using the perturbed energy conservation equation we find that there are conserved quantities in Expanding G\"odel (EG) Cosmology, in particular a spatial metric trace perturbation, {\zeta} SMTP , which is conserved on large scales for pressureless dust. We finally extend our discussion to a perfect fluid matter content to also obtain conserved quantities in this context.</description>

      <title>Simulations of gravitational collapse in null coordinates IV: evolving through the event horizon, with an application to the spherical charged scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider line elements of the form $-2G\,du\,(dx+B\,du) + R^2(...)$, where $(...)$ does not contain $dx$. Surfaces of constant $u$ are then null surfaces, and their affinely parameterised generators have tangent vector $G^{-1}\partial_x$. Considering $u$ as the time coordinate, we can evolve either $R$ or $G$, with the other one found by solving the Raychaudhuri equation along the null generators, or we can evolve both. This choice of {\em formulation} is independent from the remaining {\em gauge} choice $x\to x'(u,x,...)$ in the line element above, which is fixed incrementally by the choice of $B$. For example, we can evolve $G$, in order to be able to evolve through an event horizon, and use $B$ to adapt the coordinates to type-II critical collapse. As a demonstration of these ideas, we consider a charged scalar field in spherical symmetry. We consider two settings: a domain where the outgoing null cones emanate from a regular centre $R=0$, and a domain where they emanate from an ingoing-null boundary. In both settings, we demonstrate convergence with resolution, within each formulation and between the three formulations. As testbeds, we compute the critical exponents and periodic fine-structures of the black hole charge and mass scaling laws in a one-parameter family of charged regular initial data, and examples of perturbed extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om solutions.</description>

      <title>From Source Properties to Strong-Field Tests: a multipronged analysis of GW250114 with an effective one-body model for generic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of GW250114, the loudest gravitational-wave signal observed to date, using a waveform model capable of describing binary black holes in generic (eccentric and precessing) orbits. Our analysis builds on LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK)'s results, finding that the source is consistent at a probability of $\geq 96\%$ with the merger of two first-generation, nearly equal-mass, low-spin black holes, forming a remnant within the pair-instability mass gap. The signal's high signal-to-noise ratio ($\gtrsim 75$) enables the detection of the subdominant $(4,\pm4)$ multipoles, whose presence we confirm with higher evidence than previously reported by the LVK. Restricting the analysis even to post-peak data yields $\log_{10}B\gtrsim 1$ in favor of models including the $(4,\pm4)$ mode, demonstrating that this contribution remains detectable well into the post-merger phase. We further perform three independent tests of general relativity, complementary to those performed by the LVK: a modified residual analysis confirms that our semi-analytical model fully describes the signal without detectable discrepancies; a subdominant mode test finds that the amplitude of the $(4,\pm4)$ multipoles agrees with general-relativistic expectations; and a parameterised analysis of the plunge-merger-ringdown regime recovers the GR expectation within the 50\% credible region for the remnant mass and spin, and within the 90\% interval for the $(2,\pm2)$ peak amplitude. Collectively, these results reinforce GW250114 as a landmark event for a precision test of gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit Yeom's annihilation-to-nothing scenario using a modified Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation, incorporating higher curvature corrections. By taking these corrections into account, we show that singularity resolution does not occur within low-energy effective field theory (EFT). Since general relativity (GR) is itself only a low-energy EFT of an underlying ultraviolet (UV) theory, it is unlikely that true singularity resolution can emerge within its domain of validity. Our analysis does not contradict Yeom's conjecture but clarifies that any true resolution of the black hole singularity necessarily requires the inclusion of UV degrees of freedom beyond the scope of GR.</description>

      <title>Acceleration Radiation of Freely Falling Atoms: Nonlinear Electrodynamic Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of Scully \textit{et al.} [ \textcolor{blue}{Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 115, 8131 (2018)}] and Camblong \textit{et al.}[ \textcolor{blue}{Phys. Rev. D 102, 085010 (2020)}], we investigate horizon-brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) for freely falling two-level atoms in the geometry of a Bardeen regular black hole. Building on the quantum-optics approach to acceleration radiation and its near-horizon conformal quantum mechanics (CQM) structure, we show that the dominant physics is again governed by an inverse-square potential in the radial Klein-Gordon equation, with an effective coupling fixed by the Bardeen surface gravity. Using geodesic expansions and a near-horizon CQM reduction of the scalar field, we derive the excitation probability for atoms falling through a Boulware-like vacuum in the presence of a stretched-horizon mirror. The resulting spectrum is Planckian in the mode frequency, with a temperature determined by the Bardeen Hawking temperature. We analyze how the regular core parameter controls the strength of the radiation and demonstrate that the excitation probability is strongly suppressed as the geometry approaches the extremal (cold remnant) limit. Numerical results illustrate the dependence of the spectrum on the Bardeen parameter and on the atomic transition frequency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02491v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assuming that, with some care, dislocations could be meaningfully described by torsion, we propose here a scenario based on a previously unexplored role of time in the low-energy Dirac field theory description of two-space-dimensional Dirac materials. Our approach is based on the realization of an exotic time-loop that could be realized by oscillating particle-hole pairs, overcoming the well-known geometrical obstructions due to the lack of a third spatial dimension. General symmetry considerations allow concluding that the effects we are looking for can only be seen if we move to the nonlinear response regime.</description>

Abstract: We point out a difficulty with a naive application of Virasoro TQFT methods to compute path integrals for two types of off-shell 3-dimensional geometries. Maxfield-Turiaci proposed solving the negativity problem of pure 3d gravity by summing over off-shell geometries known as Seifert manifolds. We attempt to compute Seifert manifolds using Virasoro TQFT. Our results don't match completely with Maxfield-Turiaci. We trace the discrepancies to not including the mapping class group properly. We also compute a 3-boundary torus-wormhole by extrapolating from an on-shell geometry. We encounter challenges similar to those observed in the comparison between the genuine off-shell computation of a torus-wormhole by Cotler-Jensen and the extrapolation from an on-shell configuration.</description>

      <title>Power Suppression and Lensing Anomaly -- A phenomenological investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial power spectra with low power at long wavelengths can alleviate lensing anomaly. However the extent to which data favours such a primordial spectra is not clear. In this work, we investigate power suppression and related mitigation of lensing anomaly with the help of phenomenological models which are valid over scales of interest. We consider simple extensions to nearly scale invariant power spectra such as those which includes running and running of running of spectral index. We perform Bayesian analysis of these models, which are agnostic about power suppression, with Planck legacy data and show that data tend to choose parameters which leads to power suppression at low multipoles. We then investigate the connection between power suppression and alleviation of lensing anomaly and show that lensing anomaly is mitigated the most in models with maximum suppression of power at low multipoles. We also analyse the significance of these findings using information criteria. These results are further analyzed in the light of Planck Release 4 data using CamSpec, HiLLiPoP and LoLLiPoP likelihoods in which departure of lensing parameter from one is significantly reduced. Furthermore, we investigate the ability of near-ultimate future CMB missions such as ECHO to put tighter constraints on these models and to settle the issue. We conclude that we can make stronger conclusions about the presence of power suppression in the future by studying such simple phenomenological models.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian Cheeger-Gromov convergence and temporal functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15441v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uniqueness (up to isometries) and existence of limits are studied in the context of Cheeger-Gromov convergence of spacetimes. To address the non-compactness of the vector isometry group in the semi-Riemannian setting, standard pointed convergence is strengthened to anchored convergence, which in the Lorentzian case requires the convergence of a timelike direction. This allows one to construct a local isometry between neighborhoods of the basepoints, which can be extended globally under geodesic completeness or just inextensibility. In spacetimes, by using Cauchy temporal functions as both strengthening of anchors and tools to ``Wick rotate'' metrics, a special notion of convergence for globally hyperbolic spacetimes (including those with timelike boundaries) is introduced. After revisiting the tools related to time functions and studying their connections with Sormani-Vega null distance, the machinery of Riemannian Cheeger-Gromov theory becomes applicable. In particular, several results of independent interest are obtained, including local regularity of time functions up to rescaling, global and local characterizations of $h$-steep functions, independence of steepness and $h$-steepness for temporal functions, compatibility of both conditions for Cauchy temporal functions, and stability of the latter.</description>

      <title>Bias in the tensor-to-scalar ratio from self-interacting dark radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological imprint of self-interacting dark radiation (DR) on the primordial $B$-mode angular power spectrum and its impact on the estimation of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We consider a minimal model in which DR is described as an effectively massless axion-like particle with quartic self-interactions. These interactions are incorporated into the Einstein-Boltzmann equations using the relaxation time approximation and implemented in the $\texttt{CLASS}$ code. We show that increasing the strength of DR self-interactions suppresses anisotropic stress, thereby reducing the damping of gravitational waves and leading to an enhancement of the primordial $B$-mode signal relative to the free-streaming case. Using mock CMB data and Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses, we show that neglecting DR self-interactions may bias the inferred value of $r$ by an amount comparable to the uncertainty expected in forthcoming CMB polarization experiments, such as the ground-based $\textit{Simons Observatory}$ and the satellite missions $\textit{LiteBIRD}$ and PICO. Our results emphasize the importance of properly modeling DR interactions in future precision searches for primordial $B$-modes in order to obtain unbiased constraints on inflationary gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic models of reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a causal hydrodynamic model that provides an effective macroscopic description of the field-theoretic dynamics during the early stages of reheating. The inflaton condensate is treated as a homogeneous background coupled to a relativistic fluid that represents its inhomogeneous fluctuations. Within the divergence-type theory framework derived from kinetic considerations, the model captures essential dissipative and non-equilibrium effects while remaining stable and causal. We find that the coupling between the oscillating condensate and the fluid induces a parametric resonance in the tensor sector, leading to the amplification of the viscous stress tensor and the generation of gravitational waves with a characteristic spectral peak. The predicted spectrum agrees with lattice simulations performed with CosmoLattice. This hydrodynamic approach offers an effective bridge between microscopic field dynamics and macroscopic cosmological observables.</description>

      <title>Impact of Neutrino Flavor Conversions on Neutron Star Merger Dynamics, Ejecta, Nucleosynthesis, and Multi-Messenger Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present numerical relativity simulations of binary neutron star mergers incorporating neutrino flavor transformations triggered by fast flavor instability, quantum many-body effects, or potential beyond standard model physics. In both long-lived and short-lived remnant scenarios, neutrino flavor conversions modify species-dependent neutrino luminosities and mean energies, and drive the matter towards more neutron rich conditions. They produce up to $300\%$ more neutron rich ejecta and significantly boost the r-process yields, especially in low-density, near-equatorial outflows. We identify regions unstable to fast flavor instabilities and find that these instabilities persist despite flavor conversions. We further test the sensitivity to the equilibration timescale of the flavor conversions, finding that slower flavor conversions can interact with thermodynamic equilibration, and increase the neutron richness of the ejecta. Flavor conversions may also contribute to stronger gravitational wave and neutrino emissions, pointing to a correlation between neutrino transport and merger dynamics. These results highlight the potential impact of flavor conversions while motivating future work to improve on theoretical understanding of flavor instabilities in global simulations.</description>

      <title>Fermionic fields of higher spin in de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19652v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider fermionic fields of higher spin on a four-dimensional de Sitter background. A particular emphasis is placed on the Rarita-Schwinger spin-$\tfrac{3}{2}$ case. Both massive fields and gauge fields are considered, and their relation to the representation theory of $SO(4,1)$ is discussed. In Lorentzian signature, we study properties of the Bunch-Davies mode functions, and the late time structure of their two-point functions. For the Rarita-Schwinger gauge field, we consider a quantisation procedure based on the Minkowskian limit of the field operator. In Euclidean signature, the fields are placed on a four-sphere and the Euclidean path integral is computed at one-loop. The resulting Euclidean partition function is expressed in terms of unitary Lorentzian group characters with edge corrections. The unitary nature of the characters contrasts the lack of a conventional real action for the Rarita-Schwinger gauge field in de Sitter space. We speculate on the microscopic properties of a theory comprised of an infinite tower of interacting integer and half-integer gauge fields in de Sitter space. Along the way, we discuss a potentially interesting expression for the higher-spin path integral on the four-sphere.</description>

      <title>Optical Entropy and Generalized Thermodynamics of Solitonic Event Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The realization of Hawking radiation in optical analogs has historically focused on kinematic observables, such as the effective temperature determined by the horizon's surface gravity. A complete thermodynamic description, however, necessitates a rigorous definition of entropy and irreversibility, which has remained elusive in Hamiltonian optical systems. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing an operational entropy for solitonic event horizons, derived from the spectral partitioning of the optical field into coherent solitonic and incoherent radiative subsystems. We demonstrate that the emission of resonant radiation, mediated by the breaking of soliton integrability due to higher-order dispersion, serves as a fundamental mechanism for entropy production. Numerical simulations of the generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equation confirm that this process satisfies a generalized second law, where the change in total entropy is non-negative. These results establish optical event horizons as consistent nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems, offering a new pathway to explore the information-theoretic aspects of analog gravity in laboratory settings.</description>
