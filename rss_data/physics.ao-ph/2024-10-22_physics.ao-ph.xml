      <title>The impact of the spatial resolution of wind data on multi-decadal wind power forecasts in Germany</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate multi-decadal wind power predictions are crucial for sustainable energy transitions but are challenged by the coarse spatial resolution of global climate models (GCMs). This study examines the impact of spatial resolution on wind power forecasts by analyzing historical wind speed outputs from ten CMIP6 GCMs in Germany, using ERA5 reanalysis as a reference. Results show that the choice of GCM is the primary influence on wind speed output, with higher resolution models partly, but not consistently, improving predictions. While high-resolution models better capture extreme wind speeds, they do not systematically improve the prediction of the whole wind speed distribution. The data set MPI-ESM1-2-HR (MPI-HR) was found to represent the wind speed distribution particularly faithfully, while the MIROC6 (JAP) data set showed substantial underestimation for the German region compared to ERA5. These findings underscore the complexity of wind speed modeling for power predictions and emphasize the need for careful GCM selection and appropriate downscaling and bias correction methods.</description>

      <title>On the possible role of condensation-related hydrostatic pressure adjustments in intensification and weakening of tropical cyclones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that condensation and precipitation do not disturb the hydrostatic equilibrium if the local pressure sink (condensation rate expressed in pressure units) is proportional to the local pressure, with a proportionality coefficient $k$ that is independent of altitude. In the real atmosphere, condensation rate is controlled, among other factors, by the vertical velocity that can vary freely over height. This means that, in general, condensation disturbs hydrostatic equilibrium and thus causes pressure adjustments through redistribution of air masses. It is proposed that $k$ maximised in the upper atmosphere results in additional upward motion, which leads to cyclone strengthening. Conversely, $k$ maximised closer to the surface produces additional downward motion, which causes cyclone's weakening. The maximum scale of both effects should be set by the strength of the mass sink (precipitation). Using observational data, it is found that the mean intensification and weakening rates ($8$ and $6$ hPa~day$^{-1}$, respectively) in Atlantic tropical cyclones constitute about two thirds of their maximum concurrent precipitation (multiplied by gravity). The implications of these results for recent studies evaluating the (de-)intensification process based on a mass continuity equation that neglects the mass sink are discussed.</description>

      <title>Can AI weather models predict out-of-distribution gray swan tropical cyclones?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting gray swan weather extremes, which are possible but so rare that they are absent from the training dataset, is a major concern for AI weather/climate models. An important open question is whether AI models can extrapolate from weaker weather events present in the training set to stronger, unseen weather extremes. To test this, we train independent versions of the AI model FourCastNet on the 1979-2015 ERA5 dataset with all data, or with Category 3-5 tropical cyclones (TCs) removed, either globally or only over the North Atlantic or Western Pacific basin. We then test these versions of FourCastNet on 2018-2023 Category 5 TCs (gray swans). All versions yield similar accuracy for global weather, but the one trained without Category 3-5 TCs cannot accurately forecast Category 5 TCs, indicating that these models cannot extrapolate from weaker storms. The versions trained without Category 3-5 TCs in one basin show some skill forecasting Category 5 TCs in that basin, suggesting that FourCastNet can generalize across tropical basins. This is encouraging and surprising because regional information is implicitly encoded in inputs. No version satisfies gradient-wind balance, implying that enforcing such physical constraints may not improve generalizability to gray swans. Given that current state-of-the-art AI weather/climate models have similar learning strategies, we expect our findings to apply to other models and extreme events. Our work demonstrates that novel learning strategies are needed for AI weather/climate models to provide early warning or estimated statistics for the rarest, most impactful weather extremes.</description>

      <title>Wave (from) Polarized Light Learning (WPLL) method: high resolution spatio-temporal measurements of water surface waves in laboratory setups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective spatio-temporal measurements of water surface elevation (water waves) in laboratory experiments are crucial for scientific and engineering research. Existing techniques are often cumbersome, computationally heavy and generally suffer from limitations in wavenumber/frequency response. To address these challenges, we propose Wave (from) Polarized Light Learning (WPLL), a learning based remote sensing method for laboratory implementation, capable of inferring surface elevation and slope maps in high resolution. The method uses the polarization properties of light reflected from the water surface. The WPLL uses a deep neural network (DNN) model that approximates the water surface slopes from the polarized light intensities. Once trained on simple monochromatic wave trains, the WPLL is capable of producing high-resolution and accurate 2D reconstruction of the water surface slopes and elevation in a variety of irregular wave fields. The method's robustness is demonstrated by showcasing its high wavenumber/frequency response, its ability to reconstruct wave fields propagating at arbitrary angles relative to the camera optical axis, and its computational efficiency. This developed methodology is an accurate and cost-effective near-real time remote sensing tool for laboratory water surface waves measurements, setting the path for upscaling to open sea application for research, monitoring, and short-time forecasting.</description>

      <title>SIFM: A Foundation Model for Multi-granularity Arctic Sea Ice Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arctic sea ice performs a vital role in global climate and has paramount impacts on both polar ecosystems and coastal communities. In the last few years, multiple deep learning based pan-Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) forecasting methods have emerged and showcased superior performance over physics-based dynamical models. However, previous methods forecast SIC at a fixed temporal granularity, e.g. sub-seasonal or seasonal, thus only leveraging inter-granularity information and overlooking the plentiful inter-granularity correlations. SIC at various temporal granularities exhibits cumulative effects and are naturally consistent, with short-term fluctuations potentially impacting long-term trends and long-term trends provides effective hints for facilitating short-term forecasts in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we propose to cultivate temporal multi-granularity that naturally derived from Arctic sea ice reanalysis data and provide a unified perspective for modeling SIC via our Sea Ice Foundation Model. SIFM is delicately designed to leverage both intra-granularity and inter-granularity information for capturing granularity-consistent representations that promote forecasting skills. Our extensive experiments show that SIFM outperforms off-the-shelf deep learning models for their specific temporal granularity.</description>

      <title>A Fast AI Surrogate for Coastal Ocean Circulation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nearly 900 million people live in low-lying coastal zones around the world and bear the brunt of impacts from more frequent and severe hurricanes and storm surges. Oceanographers simulate ocean current circulation along the coasts to develop early warning systems that save lives and prevent loss and damage to property from coastal hazards. Traditionally, such simulations are conducted using coastal ocean circulation models such as the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS), which usually runs on an HPC cluster with multiple CPU cores. However, the process is time-consuming and energy expensive. While coarse-grained ROMS simulations offer faster alternatives, they sacrifice detail and accuracy, particularly in complex coastal environments. Recent advances in deep learning and GPU architecture have enabled the development of faster AI (neural network) surrogates. This paper introduces an AI surrogate based on a 4D Swin Transformer to simulate coastal tidal wave propagation in an estuary for both hindcast and forecast (up to 12 days). Our approach not only accelerates simulations but also incorporates a physics-based constraint to detect and correct inaccurate results, ensuring reliability while minimizing manual intervention. We develop a fully GPU-accelerated workflow, optimizing the model training and inference pipeline on NVIDIA DGX-2 A100 GPUs. Our experiments demonstrate that our AI surrogate reduces the time cost of 12-day forecasting of traditional ROMS simulations from 9,908 seconds (on 512 CPU cores) to 22 seconds (on one A100 GPU), achieving over 450$\times$ speedup while maintaining high-quality simulation results. This work contributes to oceanographic modeling by offering a fast, accurate, and physically consistent alternative to traditional simulation models, particularly for real-time forecasting in rapid disaster response.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Weather Forecasting: A CNN-LSTM Hybrid Model for Predicting Historical Temperature Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As global climate change intensifies, accurate weather forecasting has become increasingly important, affecting agriculture, energy management, environmental protection, and daily life. This study introduces a hybrid model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict historical temperature data. CNNs are utilized for spatial feature extraction, while LSTMs handle temporal dependencies, resulting in significantly improved prediction accuracy and stability. By using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the loss function, the model demonstrates excellent performance in processing complex meteorological data, addressing challenges such as missing data and high-dimensionality. The results show a strong alignment between the prediction curve and test data, validating the model's potential in climate prediction. This study offers valuable insights for fields such as agriculture, energy management, and urban planning, and lays the groundwork for future applications in weather forecasting under the context of global climate change.</description>

      <title>Harnessing single polarization doppler weather radars for tracking Desert Locust Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Desert locusts are notorious agriculture pests prompting billions in losses and global food scarcity concerns. With billions of these locusts invading agrarian lands, this is no longer a thing of the past. This study taps into the existing doppler weather radar (DWR) infrastructure which was originally deployed for meteorological applications. This study demonstrates a systematic approach to distinctly identify and track concentrations of desert locust swarms in near real time using single polarization radars. Findings reveal the potential to establish early warning systems with lead times of around 7 hours and spatial coverage of approximately 100 kilometers. Embracing these technological advancements are crucial to safeguard agricultural landscapes and upload global food security.</description>

      <title>An analytical model of tornado generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new analytical model for the generation of axisymmetric tornado-type vortices has been developed. A solution to the nonlinear equation for the stream function in an unstable stratified atmosphere is obtained and analyzed within the framework of ideal hydrodynamics. The solution is sought by smooth connecting continuous solutions for the internal region ("eye"), the central region ("wall" with maximum velocities) and the external region of the tornado. Expressions describing radial dependences for the radial and vertical velocity components include combinations of Bessel functions. The vortex is spatially localized by radius and height. Convective instability of a stratified atmosphere leads to an increase in the radial and vertical components of velocities according to the hyperbolic sine law. A downward flow is observed near the tornado axis. The maximum speed of the upward flow is achieved at a certain radial distance at a certain height. Below this height, radial flows converge towards the central part of the tornado, and above this height there is an outflow from the "wall" to the axis and to the periphery. The radial structure of the azimuthal velocity is determined by the structure of the initial disturbance and can change with height. Maximum rotation is achieved in the tornado "wall" at a certain height. The increase in azimuthal velocity can occur according to a superexponential law. Possible structures of movements, scenarios for the development of a tornado and its dynamics are discussed.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Attributing Change in Climate and Complex Systems: Foundations, Green's Functions, and Nonlinear Fingerprints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02628v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detection and attribution (D&amp;A) studies are cornerstones of climate science, providing crucial evidence for policy decisions. Their goal is to link observed climate change patterns to anthropogenic and natural drivers via the optimal fingerprinting method (OFM). We show that response theory for nonequilibrium systems offers the physical and dynamical basis for OFM, including the concept of causality used for attribution. Our framework clarifies the method's assumptions, advantages, and potential weaknesses. We use our theory to perform D&amp;A for prototypical climate change experiments performed on an energy balance model and on a low-resolution coupled climate model. We also explain the underpinnings of degenerate fingerprinting, which offers early warning indicators for tipping points. Finally, we extend the OFM to the nonlinear response regime. Our analysis shows that OFM has broad applicability across diverse stochastic systems influenced by time-dependent forcings, with potential relevance to ecosystems, quantitative social sciences, and finance, among others.</description>

      <title>Lightning declines over shipping lanes following regulation of fuel sulfur emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aerosol interactions with clouds represent a significant uncertainty in our understanding of the Earth system. Deep convective clouds may respond to aerosol perturbations in several ways that have proven difficult to elucidate with observations. Here, we leverage the two busiest maritime shipping lanes in the world, which emit aerosol particles and their precursors into an otherwise relatively clean tropical marine boundary layer, to make headway on the influence of aerosol on deep convective clouds. The recent seven-fold change in allowable fuel sulfur by the International Maritime Organization allows us to test the sensitivity of the lightning to changes in ship plume aerosol size distributions. We find that, across a range of atmospheric thermodynamic conditions, the previously documented enhancement of lightning over the shipping lanes has fallen by over 40%. The enhancement is therefore at least partially aerosol-mediated, a conclusion that is supported by observations of droplet number at cloud base, which show a similar decline over the shipping lane. These results have fundamental implications for our understanding of aerosol-cloud interactions, suggesting that deep convective clouds are impacted by the aerosol number distribution in the remote marine environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic generators are useful for estimating climate impacts on various sectors. Projecting climate risk in various sectors, e.g. energy systems, requires generators that are accurate (statistical resemblance to ground-truth), reliable (do not produce erroneous examples), and efficient. Leveraging data from the North American Land Data Assimilation System, we introduce TemperatureGAN, a Generative Adversarial Network conditioned on months, locations, and time periods, to generate 2m above ground atmospheric temperatures at an hourly resolution. We propose evaluation methods and metrics to measure the quality of generated samples. We show that TemperatureGAN produces high-fidelity examples with good spatial representation and temporal dynamics consistent with known diurnal cycles.</description>

      <title>Direction Symmetry of Wave Field Modulation by Tidal Current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical studies on the modulation of unidimensional regular waves over a flat bottom due to a current typically assign an asymmetry between the effects of opposing/following streams on the evolution of major sea variables, such as significant wave height. The significant wave height is expected to monotonically increase with opposing streams and to decrease with following streams. To some extent, observations on data sets containing a few thousand of waves or over a continuous series of about a day confirm this prediction. Here, based on a multi-year dataset, we show that in very broad-banded seas with high directional spread, the asymptotic behavior of sea variables is highly non-trivial and does not follow the theoretical predictions, especially at high values of the ratio between tidal stream and group speed.</description>
