      <title>Astronomy in Appalachia: Five Lessons in Designing a Planetarium Show</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cultural Astronomy sits at the intersection of our study of the universe and the human experience, exploring how we observe the stars, interpret their motions, and incorporate them into our perspectives of the nature of reality. "Astronomy in Appalachia" is a new Planetarium show, developed for the Planetarium at East Tennessee State University, that explores how the inherited experience of the night sky in Appalachia can be used as a part of Astronomy education, and how that can serve as a cross-cultural point of connection. Using Earth's seasons as an anchor, the show highlights several Appalachian folk science narratives, examining how they are rooted in Astronomy, and relating them to modern scientific interpretations of the cosmos. This article describes the lessons our team learned while researching, scripting, and developing this new program.</description>

      <title>A stochastic approach in physics exercises of mathematics education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for incorporating a stochastic point of view into physics exercises of mathematics education. The core of our method is the randomization of some inputs, the system model used does not differ from what we would use in the deterministic approach. We consider exercises from the theory of projectile motion and statics. The outputs of stochastic models are random variables, and we usually determine their probability distributions, expected values, variances, and relative standard deviations, and the probabilities of some events related to them are also calculated. We primarily recommend our exercises to motivated high school students but first-year university students can also benefit from them.</description>

      <title>Comparing item response theory models for ranking incorrect response options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous work has shown that item response theory may be used to rank incorrect response options to multiple-choice items on commonly used assessments. This work has shown that, when the correct response to each item is specified, a nominal response model (NRM) may be used to rank the incorrect options. We seek to determine the robustness of these results by applying the NRM to all response choices, without specifying the correct response. We apply these analyses to multiple data sets (each with more than 9,000 response sets), including pre-instruction and post-instruction responses. We find that the rankings generated without specifying the correct response are consistent with the previously published rankings for one data set; however, we find noticeable differences between rankings generated from different data sets. We provide evidence that discrepancies may result from differences in response rates for less commonly chosen responses.</description>

      <title>Crowd-sourced particle physics stories from DESY-CMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CMS at DESY outreach Instagram account (@cmsatdesy) serves as a platform for science communication and outreach for a large experimental particle physics group. The initiative aims to promote scientific research, engage young scientists in outreach activities, and showcase their contributions. Instagram was chosen for its strong alignment with the target demographic and its broad user base in Germany and internationally.
  The account highlights the work of young scientists, providing insights into their scientific journeys and disseminating particle physics outreach content. Multiple contributors collaborate on content creation, offering early career researchers opportunities for training in science communication while maintaining a manageable time commitment. This paper presents the evolution of the project, its initial objectives, target audience, and the experiences gained in content development and public engagement on social media platforms.</description>
