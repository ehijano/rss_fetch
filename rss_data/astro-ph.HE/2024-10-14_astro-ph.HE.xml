      <title>Nonlinear perturbations and weak shock waves in isentropic atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic perturbations to stellar envelopes can lead to the formation of weak shock waves via nonlinear wave-steepening. Close to the stellar surface, the weak shock wave increases in strength and can potentially lead to the expulsion of part of the stellar envelope. While accurate analytic solutions to the fluid equations exist in the limits of low amplitude waves or strong shocks, connecting these phases generally requires simulations. We address this problem using the fact that the plane parallel Euler equations, in the presence of a constant gravitational field, admit exact Riemann invariants when the flow is isentropic. We obtain exact solutions for acoustic perturbations and show that after they steepen into shock waves, Whitham's approximation can be used to solve for the shock's dynamics in the weak to moderately strong regimes, using a simple ordinary differential equation. Numerical simulations show that our analytic shock approximation is accurate up to moderate ($\sim$ few--15) Mach numbers, where the accuracy increases with the adiabatic index.</description>

      <title>An alternative interpretation of magnetars' traits deduced from the observational data on their outburst fluxes and spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By applying the Efron-Petrosian method to the fluxes $S$ and distances $D$ of the magnetars listed in the Magnetar Outburst Online Catalogue, we show that the observational data are consistent with the dependence $S\propto D^{-3/2}$, which characterizes the emission from the superluminally moving current sheet in the magnetosphere of a non-aligned neutron star, at substantially higher levels of significance than they are with the dependence $S\propto D^{-2}$. This result agrees with that previously obtained by an analysis of the data in the McGill Online Magnetar Catalog and confirms that, contrary to the currently prevalent view, magnetars' X-ray luminosities do not exceed their spin-down luminosities. The X-ray spectra of magnetars, moreover, are congruous with the spectral energy distribution (SED) of a broadband non-thermal emission mechanism identical to that at play in rotation-powered pulsars: we show that the SED of the caustics that are generated in certain privileged directions by the magnetospheric current sheet single-handedly fits the observed spectra of 4U 0142+61, 1E 1841-045 and XTE J1810-197 over their entire breadths. Magnetars' outbursts and their associated radio bursts are predicted to occur when, as a result of large-scale timing anomalies (such as glitches, quakes or precession), one of the privileged directions along which the radiation from the current sheet decays more slowly than predicted by the inverse-square law either swings past or oscillates across the line of sight.</description>

      <title>A test for LISA foreground Gaussianity and stationarity. I. Galactic white-dwarf binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upcoming space-based gravitational-wave detectors will be sensitive to millions and resolve tens of thousands of stellar-mass binary systems at mHz frequencies. The vast majority of these will be double white dwarfs in our Galaxy. The greatest part will remain unresolved, forming an incoherent stochastic foreground signal. Using state-of-the-art Galactic models for the formation and evolution of binary white dwarfs and accurate LISA simulated signals, we introduce a test for foreground Gaussianity and stationarity. We explain the former with a new analytical modulation induced by the LISA constellation motion and the intrinsic anisotropy of the source distribution. By demodulating the foreground signal, we reveal a deviation from Gaussianity in the 2-10 mHz frequency band. Our finding is crucial to design faithful data models, i.e. unbiased likelihoods for both individual sources and astrophysical foregrounds parameter estimation, and ultimately for an accurate interpretation of the LISA data.</description>

      <title>Chaotic magnetic disconnections trigger flux eruptions in accretion flows channeled onto magnetically saturated Kerr black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetized accretion flow onto a black hole (BH) may lead to accumulation of poloidal magnetic flux across its horizon, which for high BH spin can power far-reaching relativistic jets. The BH magnetic flux is subject to a saturation mechanism by means of magnetic flux eruptions involving relativistic magnetic reconnection. Such accretion flows have been described as magnetically arrested (MAD) or choked (MCAF). The main goal of this work is to describe the onset of relativistic reconnection and initial development of magnetic flux eruption in accretion flow onto magnetically saturated BH. We analyze the results of 3D ideal GRMHD numerical simulations in the Kerr metric, starting from weakly magnetized geometrically thick tori rotating either prograde or retrograde. We integrate large samples of magnetic field lines in order to probe magnetic connectivity with the BH horizon. The boundary between magnetically connected and disconnected domains coincides roughly with enthalpy equipartition. The geometrically constricted innermost part of the disconnected domain develops a rigid structure of magnetic field lines - rotating slowly and insensitive to the BH spin orientation. The typical shape of innermost disconnected lines is a double spiral converging to a sharp inner tip anchored at the single equatorial current layer. The footpoints of magnetic flux eruptions are found to zip around the BH along with other azimuthal patterns. Magnetic flux eruptions from magnetically saturated accreting BHs can be triggered by minor density gaps in the disconnected domain, resulting from chaotic disconnection of plasma-depleted magnetospheric lines. Accretion flow is effectively channeled along the disconnected lines towards the current layer, and further towards the BH by turbulent cross-field diffusion. Rotation of flux eruption footpoints may contribute to the variability of BH crescent images.</description>

      <title>In-ice Askaryan Emission from Air Showers: Implications for Radio Neutrino Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most promising techniques for detecting ultra-high energy neutrinos involves the use of radio antennas to observe the 10-1000 MHz radiation generated by the showers that neutrinos induce in large volumes of ice. The expected neutrino detection rates of one neutrino or less per detector station per 10 years make the characterization of backgrounds a priority. The largest natural background comes from ultra-high energy cosmic rays which are orders of magnitude more abundant than neutrinos. Particularly crucial is the understanding of geometries in which substantial energy of the cosmic-ray-induced air shower is deposited in the ice giving rise to a compact in-ice shower close to the ice surface. We calculated the radio emission of air-shower cores using the novel CORSIKA 8 code and found it to be similar to the predictions for neutrino-induced showers. For the first time, we calculated the detection rates for O(100m) deep antennas yielding 10-100 detections per year and detector station, which makes this a useful calibration source as these downward-going signals can be differentiated from neutrino-induced showers based on the signal arrival direction. However, the presence of reflection layers in the ice confuses the arrival directions, which makes this a potentially important background. We review the existing information on reflecting layers in the South Pole glacier and, for the first time, quantify the corresponding rate of reflected air-shower signals for the proposed IceCube-Gen2 radio array and discuss mitigation strategies. The reflectivity of the layers is the dominant uncertainty resulting in rate predictions of much less than one detection to several detections per year for IceCube-Gen2 if not mitigated.</description>

      <title>Is the Gum Nebula an Important Interstellar Scattering Disk of Background Pulsars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gum Nebula is a faint supernova remnant extending about 40 degrees across the southern sky, potentially affecting tens of background pulsars. Though the view that the Gum Nebula acts as a potential scattering screen for background pulsars has been recurrently mentioned over the past five decades, it has not been directly confirmed. We chose the strong background pulsar PSR~B0740$-$28 as a probe and monitored its diffractive interstellar scintillation (DISS) at 2.25~$\&amp;$~8.60~GHz simultaneously for about two years using the Shanghai Tian Ma Radio Telescope (TMRT). DISS was detected at both frequencies and quantified by two-dimensional autocorrelation analysis. We calculated their scattering spectral index $\alpha$ and found that 9/21 of the observations followed the theoretical predictions, while 4/21 of them clearly showed $\alpha &lt; 4$. This finding provides strong support for anomalous scattering along the pulsar line of sight, due to the large frequency lever arm and the simultaneous features of our dual-frequency observations. In comparison to the 2.25~GHz observations, scintillation arcs were observed in 10/21 of the secondary spectrum plots for 8.60~GHz observations. Consequently, the highest frequency record for pulsar scintillation arc detection was updated to 8.60~GHz. Our fitting results were the most direct evidence for the view that the Gum Nebula acts as the scattering screen for background pulsars, because both the distance ($245^{+69}_{-72}$~pc) and transverse speed ($22.4^{+4.1}_{-4.2}$~km/s) of the scintillation screen are comparable with related parameters of the Gum Nebula. Our findings indicated that anisotropic scattering provides a superior explanation for the annual modulation of scintillation arcs than isotropic scattering. Additionally, the orientation of its long axis was also fitted.</description>

      <title>A test for LISA foreground Gaussianity and stationarity. II. Extreme mass-ratio inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) are key observational targets for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. Unresolvable EMRI signals contribute to forming a gravitational wave background (GWB). Characterizing the statistical features of the GWB from EMRIs is of great importance, as EMRIs will ubiquitously affect large segments of the inference scheme. In this work, we apply a frequentist test for GWB Gaussianity and stationarity, exploring three astrophysically-motivated EMRI populations. We construct the resulting signal by combining state-of-the-art EMRI waveforms and a detailed description of the LISA response with time-delay interferometric variables. Depending on the brightness of the GWB, our analysis demonstrates that the resultant EMRI foregrounds show varying degrees of departure from the usual statistical assumptions that the GWBs are both Gaussian and Stationary. If the GWB is non-stationary with non-Gaussian features, this will challenge the robustness of Gaussian-likelihood model, when applied to global inference results, e.g. foreground estimation, background detection, and individual-source parameters reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Wolf-Rayet -- compact object binaries as progenitors of binary compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binaries with a Wolf-Rayet star and a compact object (WR-COs), either a black hole (BH) or a neutron star (NS), have been proposed as possible progenitors for the binary compact object mergers (BCOs) observed with the gravitational wave (GW) detectors. In this work, we use the open-source population synthesis code SEVN to investigate the role of WR-COs as BCO progenitors. We consider an initial population of $5 \times 10^6$ binaries and we evolve it across 96 combinations of metallicities, common envelope efficiencies, core-collapse supernova models and natal kick distributions. We find that WR-COs are the progenitors of most BCOs, especially at high and intermediate metallicity. At $Z=0.02,\,{}0.014,$ and $0.0014$, more than $\gtrsim 99 \%$ of all the BCOs in our simulations evolved as WR-COs. At $Z = 0.00014$, inefficient binary-stripping lowers the fraction of BCOs with WR-CO progenitors to $\approx 83-95 \%$. Despite their key role in BCO production, only $\approx 5-30 \%$ of WR-COs end their life as BCOs. We find that Cyg X-3, the only WR-CO candidate observed in the Milky Way, is a promising BCO progenitor, especially if it hosts a BH. In our simulations, about $\approx 70-100 \%$ of the Cyg X-3 - like systems in the WR-BH configuration (BH mass $ \leq 10 \rm ~ M_\odot$) are BCO progenitors, in agreement with the literature. Future observations of WR-COs similar to Cyg X-3 may be the Rosetta stone to interpret the formation of BCOs.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh-Energy Gamma-ray Emission Associated with Black Hole-Jet Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes (BH), one of the most intriguing objects in the universe, can manifest themselves through electromagnetic radiations initiated by the accretion flow. Some stellar-mass BHs drive relativistic jets when accreting matter from their companion stars, called microquasars. Non-thermal emission from the radio to tera-electronvolt (TeV) gamma-ray band has been observed from microquasars, indicating acceleration of relativistic particles by the system. Here we report detection of ultrahigh-energy (UHE, photon energy $E&gt;100$TeV) gamma-ray associated with 5 out of 12 microquasars harboring BHs visible by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory, namely, SS 433, V4641 Sgr, GRS 1915+105, MAXI J1820+070, and Cygnus X-1. In the central region of SS 433, extended UHE emission is detected in spatial coincidence with a giant gas cloud, suggesting the hadronic origin of the emission. An elongated source is discovered from V4641 Sgr with the spectrum continuing up to 800 TeV. GRS 1915+105, MAXI J1820+070 and Cygnus X-1 are detected with quasi-stable radiations up to $\sim$100 TeV. The detection of UHE gamma-rays demonstrates that accreting BHs and their environments can operate as extremely efficient accelerators of particles out of 1 peta-electronvolt (PeV), thus contributing to Galactic cosmic rays especially around the `knee' region.</description>

      <title>Cyclostationary signals in LISA: a practical application to Milky Way satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the primary sources of gravitational waves (GWs) anticipated to be detected by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) are Galactic double white dwarf binaries (DWDs). However, most of these binaries will be unresolved, and their GWs will overlap incoherently, creating a stochastic noise known as the Galactic foreground. Similarly, the population of unresolved systems in the Milky Way's (MW) satellites is expected to contribute to a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Due to their anisotropy and the annual motion of the LISA constellation, both the Galactic foreground and the satellite SGWB fall into the category of cyclostationary processes. Leveraging this property, we develop a purely frequency-based method to study LISA's capability to detect the MW foreground and SGWBs from the most promising MW satellites. We analyze both mock data generated by an astrophysically motivated SGWB spectrum, and realistic ones from a DWD population generated via binary population synthesis. We are able to recover or put constrains on the candidate foregrounds, reconstructing -- in the presence of noise uncertainties -- their sky distribution and spectrum. Our findings highlight the significance of the interplay between the astrophysical spectrum and LISA's sensitivity to detect the satellites' SGWB. Considering an astrophysically motivated prior on the satellite positions improves their detectability, which becomes otherwise challenging in the presence of the Galactic foreground. Furthermore, we explore the potential to observe a hypothetical satellite located behind the Galactic disk. Our results suggest that a Large Magellanic Cloud-like satellite could indeed be observable by LISA.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signal Denoising and Merger Time Prediction By Deep Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mergers of massive black hole binaries could generate rich electromagnetic emissions, which allow us to probe the environments surrounding these massive black holes and gain deeper insights into the high energy astrophysics. However, due to the short timescale of binary mergers, it is crucial to predict the time of the merger in advance to devise detailed observational plans. The significant noise and the slow accumulation of signal-to-noise ratio in the inspiral phase make this task particularly challenging. To address this issue, we propose a novel deep neural denoising network in this study, capable of denoising continuous inspiral phase signals lasting up to 30 days. Following the denoising process, we perform the detection and merger time prediction based on the denoised signals. Our results demonstrate that for inspiral phase data with a signal-to-noise ratio between 10 and 50 occurring no more than 10 days before the merger, our prediction error for the merger time is generally within 24 hours.</description>

      <title>Accretion mediated spin-eccentricity correlations in LISA massive black hole binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine expected effective spin ($\chi_{{\rm eff},1\rm yr}$) and orbital eccentricity ($e_{1\rm yr}$) correlations for a population of observable equal-mass massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with total redshifted mass $M_z\sim[10^{4.5},10^{7.5}]~{\rm M}_\odot$ embedded in a circumbinary disc (CBD), one-year before merging in the LISA band. We find a strong correlation between measurable eccentricity and negative effective spin for MBHBs that are carried to merger by retrograde accretion. This is due to the well-established eccentricity pumping of retrograde accretion and the formation of retrograde CBD-aligned mini-discs, as observed in hydrodynamical simulations. Conversely, prograde accretion channels result in positive $\chi_{{\rm eff},1\rm yr}$ and non-measurable $e_{1\rm yr}$. This clear contrast between the two CBD orientations - and particularly the unique signature of retrograde configurations - provides a promising way to unlock the mysteries of MBHB formation channels in the LISA era.</description>

Abstract: Pulsars are highly magnetized rotating neutron stars, emitting in a broad electromagnetic energy range. Reproducing the observed pulsars population refines our understanding of their formation and evolution scenarios as well as their radiation processes and geometry. In this paper, we improve our previous population synthesis by focusing on both the radio and $\gamma$-ray pulsar populations, investigating the impact of the Galactic gravitational potential and of the radio emission death line. In order to elucidate the necessity of a death line, refined initial distributions of spin period and spacial position at birth were implemented, elevating the sophistication of our simulations to the most recent state-of-the-art. The motion of each individual pulsar is tracked in the Galactic potential by a fourth order symplectic integration scheme. Our pulsar population synthesis takes into account the secular evolution of the force-free magnetosphere and magnetic field decay simultaneously and self-consistently. Each pulsar is evolved from its birth up to the present time. The radio and $\gamma$-ray emission locations are modelled respectively by the polar cap geometry and the striped wind model. By simulating ten million pulsars we found that including a death line better reproduces the observational trend. However, when simulating one million pulsars, we obtain an even more realistic $P-\dot{P}$ diagram, whether or not a death line is included. This suggests that the ages of the detected pulsars might be overestimated, therefore questioning the real need for a death line in pulsar population studies. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests confirm the statistical similarity between the observed and simulated $P-\dot{P}$ diagram. Additionally, simulations with increased $\gamma$-ray telescope sensitivities hint to a significant contribution of $\gamma$-ray pulsars to the GeV excess in the Galactic centre.</description>

      <title>GX 301-2 pre-periastron and apastron flares with MAXI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bright high-mass X-ray binary GX 301-2 exhibits two periodic flare episodes along its orbit which are produced when the neutron star is close to the apastron and periastron passages. Time-resolved spectra were extracted and several models applied to describe all of them. The best description was obtained with a blackbody continuum modified by the Fe K-shell absorption edge, absorbed by a large column density on the order of $10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ and, if present, a Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescent emission line. Three of the nine apastron flares were as bright as the pre-periastron flare and two of them coincided with spin-up episodes of the neutron star. This fact points to the presence of a transient disc around the neutron star as it passes through the apastron that increases the accretion process. The size of emitting region on the neutron star surface showed some variability but quite consistent with a hot spot.</description>

      <title>Multiparameter multipolar test of general relativity with gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Amplitude and phase of the gravitational waveform from compact binary systems can be decomposed in terms of their mass- and current-type multipole moments. In a modified theory of gravity, one or more of these multipole moments could deviate from general theory of relativity. In this work, we show that a waveform model that parametrizes the amplitude and phase in terms of the multipole moments of the binary can facilitate a novel multiparameter test of general relativity with exquisite precision. Using a network of next-generation gravitational-wave observatories, simultaneous deviation in the leading seven multipoles of a GW190814-like binary can be bounded to within 6%--40% depending on the multipole order, while supermassive black hole mergers observed by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna achieve a bound of 0.3%--2%. We further argue that bounds from multipoles can be uniquely mapped onto other parametrized tests of general relativity and have the potential to become a downstream analysis from which bounds of other parametric tests of general relativity can be derived. The set of multipole parameters, therefore, provides an excellent basis to carry out precision tests of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Impact of Correlations on the Modeling and Inference of Beyond Vacuum-GR Effects in Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In gravitational-wave astronomy, extreme-mass-ratio-inspiral (EMRI) sources for the upcoming LISA observatory have the potential to serve as high-precision probes of astrophysical environments in galactic nuclei, and of potential deviations from general relativity (GR). Such ``beyond vacuum-GR'' effects are often modeled as perturbations to the evolution of vacuum EMRIs under GR. Previous studies have reported unprecedented constraints on these effects by examining the inference of one effect at a time. However, a more realistic analysis would require the simultaneous inference of multiple beyond vacuum-GR effects. The parameters describing such effects are generally significantly correlated with each other and the vacuum EMRI parameters. We explicitly show how these correlations remain even if any modeled effect is absent in the actual signal, and how they cause inference bias when any effect in the signal is absent in the analysis model. This worsens the overall measurability of the whole parameter set, challenging the constraints found by previous studies, and posing a general problem for the modeling and inference of beyond vacuum-GR effects in EMRIs.</description>

      <title>Thermal fluctuations of matter composition and quark nucleation in compact stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At the extreme densities reached in the core of neutron stars, it is possible that quark deconfined matter is produced. The formation of this new phase of strongly interacting matter is likely to occur via a first-order phase transition for the typical temperatures reached in astrophysical processes. The first seeds of quark matter would then form through a process of nucleation within the metastable hadronic phase. Here we address the role of the thermal fluctuations in the hadronic composition on the nucleation of two-flavour quark matter. At finite temperature, thermodynamic quantities in a system fluctuate around average values. Being nucleation a local process, it is possible that it occurs in a subsystem whose composition makes the nucleation easier. We will consider the total probability of the nucleation as the product between the probability that a subsystem has a certain hadronic composition different from the average in the bulk, and the nucleation probability in that subsystem. We will show how those fluctuations of the hadronic composition can increase the efficiency of nucleation already for temperatures $\sim (0.1-1)$ keV. However, for temperatures $\lesssim (1-10)$ MeV, the needed overpressure exceeds the maximum pressure reached in compact stars. Finally, for even larger temperatures the process of nucleation can take place, even taking into account finite size effects.</description>

      <title>Applicability criteria of proper charge neutrality and special relativistic MHD models extended by two-fluid effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The applicability of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) and its generalization to two-fluid models (including the Hall and inertial effects) is systematically investigated by using the method of dominant balance in the two-fluid equations. Although proper charge neutrality or quasi-neutrality is the key assumption for all MHD models, this condition is difficult to be met when both relativistic and inertial effects are taken into account. The range of application for each MHD model is illustrated in the space of dimensionless scale parameters. Moreover, the number of field variables of relativistic Hall MHD (RHMHD) is shown to be greater than that of RMHD and Hall MHD. Nevertheless, the RHMHD equations may be solved at a lower computational cost than RMHD, since root-finding algorithm, which is the most time-consuming part of the RMHD code, is no longer required to compute the primitive variables.</description>
