      <title>Verification of Robust Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic multi-agent systems are a central modeling framework for autonomous controllers, communication protocols, and cyber-physical infrastructures. In many such systems, however, transition probabilities are only estimated from data and may therefore be partially unknown or subject to perturbations. In this paper, we study the verification of robust strategies in stochastic multi-agent systems with imperfect information, in which coalitions must satisfy a temporal specification while dealing with uncertain system transitions, partial observation, and adversarial agents. By focusing on bounded-memory strategies, we introduce a robust variant of the model-checking problem for a probabilistic, observation-based extension of Alternating-time Temporal Logic. We characterize the complexity of this problem under different notions of perturbation, thereby clarifying the computational cost of robustness in stochastic multi-agent verification and supporting the use of bounded-memory strategies in uncertain environments.</description>

      <title>Common Knowledge Always, Forever</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been an increasing interest in topological semantics for epistemic logic, which has been shown to be useful for, e.g., modelling evidence, degrees of belief, and self-reference. We introduce a polytopological PDL capable of expressing common knowledge and various generalizations and show it has the finite model property over closure spaces but not over Cantor derivative spaces. The latter is shown by embedding a version of linear temporal logic with `past', which does not have the finite model property.</description>

      <title>Beyond Eager Encodings: A Theory-Agnostic Approach to Theory-Lemma Enumeration in SMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lifting Boolean-reasoning techniques to the SMT level most often requires producing theory lemmas that rule out theory-inconsistent truth assignments. With standard SMT solving, it is common to "lazily" generate such lemmas on demand during the search; with some harder SMT-level tasks -- such as unsat-core extraction, MaxSMT, T-OBDD or T-SDD compilation -- it may be beneficial or even necessary to "eagerly" pre-compute all the needed theory lemmas upfront. Whereas in principle "classic" eager SMT encodings could do the job, they are specific for very few and easy theories, they do not comply with theory combination, and may produce lots of unnecessary lemmas.
  In this paper, we present theory-agnostic methods for enumerating complete sets of theory lemmas tailored to a given formula. Starting from AllSMT as a baseline approach, we propose improved lemma-enumeration techniques, including divide&amp;conquer, projected enumeration, and theory-driven partitioning, which are highly parallelizable and which may drastically improve scalability. An experimental evaluation demonstrates that these techniques significantly enhance efficiency and enable the method to scale to substantially more complex instances.</description>

      <title>Rewriting Induction for Existentially Quantified Equations in Logically Constrained Rewriting (Full Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rewriting Induction (RI) is a principle to prove that an equation over terms is an inductive theorem of a rewrite system, i.e., that any ground instance of the equation is a theorem of the rewrite system. RI has been adapted to several kinds of rewrite systems, and RI for constrained rewrite systems has been extended to inequalities. In this paper, we extend RI for constrained equations to existentially quantified equations in logically constrained rewriting. To this end, we first extend constrained equations by introducing existential quantification to the equation part of constrained equations. Then, in applying a constrained rewrite rule to such extended constrained equations, we introduce existential quantification to extra variables of the applied rule. Finally, using the extended application of constrained rewrite rules, we extend RI for constrained equations to existentially quantified equations.</description>

      <title>Colimit-Based Composition of High-Level Computing Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of High-level Computation (MHCs) provide effective means to describe complex real-world computing systems because they offer formal foundations for the specification of interacting computing devices, as opposed to describing individual ones, which has been the focus of classical models such as Turing machines or the lambda calculus. Despite numerous proposals over the past half century, there is still no canonical MHC akin to Turing machines for (compositionally) reasoning about computation in the large. One of the major drawbacks of current MHCs is that they extensively neglect control flow, a well-know semantic property that defines computation order. Only a few MHCs treat control explicitly at the expense of assuming that data follows control. Mixing such dimensions within the same framework leads to inefficient methods for formal analysis and verification. To address this, the computon model has recently emerged as a category-theoretic MHC that separates data and control and makes control explicit by supporting composition operators characterised as finite colimit constructions. Such constructions allow the formation of sequential, parallel, branching and iterative computing devices. Unfortunately, the computon model is still a generic reference rather than a concrete realisation. In this paper, we provide a variation of it to enable functional computing devices, introduce a new branching operator, discuss how to define synchronous parallelising out of sequencing and asynchronous parallelising, describe concrete operational semantics for computon execution and provide the first implementation of the model. The implementation yields an open-source programming environment that realises the underlying categorical semantics. This tool is publicly available and ready to build complex computing devices that are structurally correct by construction.</description>

      <title>Learning Robust Markov Models for Safe Runtime Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model-based approach to learning robust runtime monitors for autonomous systems. Runtime monitors play a crucial role in raising the level of assurance by observing system behavior and predicting potential safety violations. In our approach, we propose to capture a system's (stochastic) behavior using interval Hidden Markov Models (iHMMs). The monitor then uses this learned iHMM to derive risk estimates for potential safety violations. The paper makes three key contributions: (1) it provides a formalization of the problem of learning robust runtime monitors, (2) introduces a novel framework that uses conformance-testing-based refinement for learning robust iHMMs with convergence guarantees, and (3) presents an efficient monitoring algorithm for computing risk estimates over iHMMs. Our empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of monitors learned using our approach, particularly when compared to model-free monitoring approaches that rely solely on collected data without access to a system model.</description>

      <title>Scaling the Scaling Logic: Agentic Meta-Synthesis of Logic Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling verifiable training signals remains a key bottleneck for Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Logical reasoning is a natural substrate: constraints are formal and answers are programmatically checkable. However, prior synthesis pipelines either depend on expert-written code or operate within fixed templates/skeletons, which limits growth largely to instance-level perturbations. We propose SSLogic, an agentic meta-synthesis framework that scales at the task-family level by iteratively synthesizing and repairing executable Generator--Validator program pairs in a closed Generate--Validate--Repair loop, enabling continuous family evolution with controllable difficulty. To ensure reliability, we introduce a Multi-Gate Validation Protocol that combines multi-strategy consistency checks with Adversarial Blind Review, where independent agents must solve instances by writing and executing code to filter ambiguous or ill-posed tasks. Starting from 400 seed families, two evolution rounds expand to 953 families and 21,389 verifiable instances (from 5,718). Training on SSLogic-evolved data yields consistent gains over the seed baseline at matched training steps, improving SynLogic by +5.2, BBEH by +1.4, AIME25 by +3.0, and Brumo25 by +3.7.</description>

      <title>A Formal Framework for the Explanation of Finite Automata Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite automata (FA) are a fundamental computational abstraction that is widely used in practice for various tasks in computer science, linguistics, biology, electrical engineering, and artificial intelligence. Given an input word, an FA maps the word to a result, in the simple case "accept" or "reject", but in general to one of a finite set of results. A question that then arises is: why? Another question is: how can we modify the input word so that it is no longer accepted? One may think that the automaton itself is an adequate explanation of its behaviour, but automata can be very complex and difficult to make sense of directly. In this work, we investigate how to explain the behaviour of an FA on an input word in terms of the word's characters. In particular, we are interested in minimal explanations: what is the minimal set of input characters that explains the result, and what are the minimal changes needed to alter the result? In this paper, we propose an efficient method to determine all minimal explanations for the behaviour of an FA on a particular word. This allows us to give unbiased explanations about which input features are responsible for the result. Experiments show that our approach scales well, even when the underlying problem is challenging.</description>

      <title>Conformal Signal Temporal Logic for Robust Reinforcement Learning Control: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how formal temporal logic specifications can enhance the safety and robustness of reinforcement learning (RL) control in aerospace applications. Using the open source AeroBench F-16 simulation benchmark, we train a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent to regulate engine throttle and track commanded airspeed. The control objective is encoded as a Signal Temporal Logic (STL) requirement to maintain airspeed within a prescribed band during the final seconds of each maneuver. To enforce this specification at run time, we introduce a conformal STL shield that filters the RL agent's actions using online conformal prediction. We compare three settings: (i) PPO baseline, (ii) PPO with a classical rule-based STL shield, and (iii) PPO with the proposed conformal shield, under both nominal conditions and a severe stress scenario involving aerodynamic model mismatch, actuator rate limits, measurement noise, and mid-episode setpoint jumps. Experiments show that the conformal shield preserves STL satisfaction while maintaining near baseline performance and providing stronger robustness guarantees than the classical shield. These results demonstrate that combining formal specification monitoring with data driven RL control can substantially improve the reliability of autonomous flight control in challenging environments.</description>

      <title>Model Checking Disjoint-Paths Logic on Topological-Minor-Free Graph Classes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07033v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disjoint-paths logic, denoted $\mathsf{FO}$+$\mathsf{dp}$, extends first-order logic ($\mathsf{FO}$) with atomic predicates $\mathsf{dp}_r[(x_1,y_1),\ldots,(x_r,y_r)]$, expressing the existence of vertex-disjoint paths between $x_i$ and $y_i$, for $1\leq i\leq r$. We prove that for every graph class excluding some fixed graph as a topological minor, the model checking problem for $\mathsf{FO}$+$\mathsf{dp}$ is fixed-parameter tractable. This essentially settles the question of tractable model checking for this logic on subgraph-closed classes, since the problem is hard on subgraph-closed classes not excluding a topological minor (assuming a further mild condition of efficiency of encoding).</description>

Abstract: The formal analysis of automated systems is an important and growing industry. This activity routinely requires new verification frameworks to be developed to tackle new programming features, or new considerations (bugs of interest). Often, one particular property can prove frustrating to establish: completeness of the logic with respect to the semantics. In this paper, we try and make such developments easier, with a particular attention on completeness. Towards that aim, we propose a formal (meta-)model of software analysis systems (SAS), the eponymous Representations. This model requires few assumptions on the SAS being modelled, and as such is able to capture a large class of such systems. We then show how our approach can be fruitful, both to understand how existing completeness proofs can be structured, and to leverage this structure to build new systems and prove their completeness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the hybrid quantum language with general recursion $\mathtt{Hyrql}$, driven towards resource-analysis. By design, $\mathtt{Hyrql}$ does not require the specification of an initial set of quantum gates. Hence, it is well amenable towards a generic cost analysis, unlike languages that use different sets of quantum gates, which yield quantum circuits of distinct complexity.
  Regarding resource-analysis, we show how to relate the runtime of an expressive fragment of $\mathtt{Hyrql}$ programs with the size of the corresponding quantum circuits. We also manage to capture the class of functions computable in quantum polynomial time, which, by Yao's Theorem, corresponds to families of circuits of polynomial size. Consequently, this result paves the way for the use of termination and runtime-analysis techniques designed for classical programs to guarantee bounds on the size of quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Generalized Kantorovich-Rubinstein Duality beyond Hausdorff and Kantorovich</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality guarantees coincidence between metrics on the space of probability distributions defined on the one hand via transport plans (couplings) and on the other hand via price functions. Both constructions have been lifted to the level of generality of set functors, with the construction based on couplings referred to as the Wasserstein or simply the coupling-based lifting, and the price-function-based construction as the Kantorovich or codensity lifting, both based on a choice of quantitative modalities for the given functor. It is known that every coupling-based lifting can be expressed as a price-function-based lifting; however, the latter in general needs to use additional modalities. We give an example showing that this cannot be avoided in general. We refer to cases in which the same modalities can be used as satisfying the generalized Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality. We establish the generalized Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality in this sense for two important cases: The L\'evy-Prokhorov distance on distributions, which finds wide-spread applications in machine learning due to its favourable stability properties, and the standard metric on convex sets of distributions that arises by combining the Hausdorff and Kantorovich-Rubinstein distances.</description>

      <title>Formal Reasoning About Confidence and Automated Verification of Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last decade, a large body of work has emerged on robustness of neural networks, i.e., checking if the decision remains unchanged when the input is slightly perturbed. However, most of these approaches ignore the confidence of a neural network on its output. In this work, we aim to develop a generalized framework for formally reasoning about the confidence along with robustness in neural networks. We propose a simple yet expressive grammar that captures various confidence-based specifications. We develop a novel and unified technique to verify all instances of the grammar in a homogeneous way, viz., by adding a few additional layers to the neural network, which enables the use any state-of-the-art neural network verification tool. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation over a large suite of 8870 benchmarks, where the largest network has 138M parameters, and show that this outperforms ad-hoc encoding approaches by a significant margin.</description>

Abstract: The Harder-Narasimhan theory provides a canonical filtration of a vector bundle on a projective curve whose successive quotients are semistable with strictly decreasing slopes. In this article, we present the formalization of Harder-Narasimhan theory in the proof assistant Lean 4 with Mathlib. This formalization is based on a recent approach of Harder-Narasimhan theory by Chen and Jeannin, which reinterprets the theory in order-theoretic terms and avoids the classical dependence on algebraic geometry. As an application, we formalize the uniqueness of coprimary filtration of a finitely generated module over a noetherian ring, and the existence of the Jordan-H\"older filtration of a semistable Harder-Narasimhan game.

Abstract: In this article, we present a formalization of spherically complete spaces, which is a fundamental notion in non-archimedean functional analysis. This work includes the equivalent definitions of spherically complete spaces, their basic properties, examples and non-examples such as the field $\mathbf{C}_p$ of $p$-adic complex numbers. As applications, we formalize the Birkhoff-James orthogonality, Hahn-Banach extension theorem and the spherical completion for non-archimedean Banach spaces.
