      <title>Which subsets and when orbits of non-uniformly hyperbolic systems prefer to visit: operator renewal theory approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper addresses some basic questions in the theory of finite time dynamics and finite time predictions for non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems. We are concerned with transport in phase spaces of such systems, and analyze which subsets and when the orbits prefer to visit. An asymptotic expansion of the decay of polynomial escape rates is obtained. Our approach is based on the construction of operator renewal equations for open dynamical systems and on their spectral analysis. In order to do this, we generalize the Keller-Liverani perturbation technique. Applications to a large class of one-dimensional non-uniformly expanding systems are considered.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the set of zero-noise limits measures of perturbed cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We add small random perturbations to a cellular automaton and consider the one-parameter family $(F_\epsilon)_{\epsilon&gt;0}$ parameterized by $\epsilon$ where $\epsilon&gt;0$ is the level of noise. The objective of the article is to study the set of limiting invariant distributions as $\epsilon$ tends to zero denoted $\Ml$. Some topological obstructions appear, $\Ml$ is compact and connected, as well as combinatorial obstructions as the set of cellular automata is countable: $\Ml$ is $\Pi_3$-computable in general and $\Pi_2$-computable if it is uniformly approached. Reciprocally, for any set of probability measures $\mathcal{K}$ which is compact, connected and $\Pi_2$-computable, we construct a cellular automaton whose perturbations by an uniform noise admit $\mathcal{K}$ as the zero-noise limits measure and this set is uniformly approached. To finish, we study how the set of limiting invariant measures can depend on a bias in the noise. We construct a cellular automaton which realizes any connected compact set (without computable constraints) if the bias is changed for an arbitrary small value. In some sense this cellular automaton is very unstable with respect to the noise.</description>

      <title>Reduction of Elementary Integrability of Polynomial Vector Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prelle and Singer showed in 1983 that if a system of ordinary differential equations defined on a differential field $K$ has a first integral in an elementrary field extension $L$ of $K$, then it must have a first integral consisting of algebraic elements over $K$ via their constant powers and logarithms. Based on this result they further proved that an elementary integrable planar polynomial differential system has an integrating factor which is a fractional power of a rational function. Here we extend their results and prove that any $n$ dimensional elementary integrable polynomial vector field has $n-1$ functionally independent first integrals being composed of algebraic elements over $K$. Furthermore, using the Galois theory we prove that the vector field has a rational Jacobian multiplier.</description>

      <title>Upper semi-continuity of metric entropy for diffeomorphisms with dominated splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a $C^{r}$ $(r&gt;1)$ diffeomorphism on a compact manifold that admits a dominated splitting, this paper establishes the upper semi-continuity of the entropy map. More precisely, given a sequence of invariant measures with only positive Lyapunov exponents along a sub-bundle and non-positive Lyapunov exponents along another sub-bundle, the upper limit of their metric entropies is less than or equal to the entropy of the limiting measure.</description>

      <title>On Convergents of Proper Continued Fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proper continued fractions are generalized continued fractions with positive integer numerators $a_i$ and integer denominators with $b_i\geq a_i$. In this paper we study the strength of approximation of irrational numbers to their convergents and classify which pairs of integers $p,q$ yield a convergent $p/q$ to some irrational $x$. Notably, we reduce the problem to finding convergence only of index one and two. We completely classify the possible choices for convergents of odd index and provide a near-complete classification for even index. We furthermore propose a natural two-dimensional generalization of the classical Gauss map as a method for dynamically generating all possible expansions and establish ergodicity of this map.</description>

      <title>Learning Generalized Diffusions using an Energetic Variational Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracting governing physical laws from computational or experimental data is crucial across various fields such as fluid dynamics and plasma physics. Many of those physical laws are dissipative due to fluid viscosity or plasma collisions. For such a dissipative physical system, we propose two distinct methods to learn the corresponding laws of the systems based on their energy-dissipation laws, assuming either continuous data (probability density) or discrete data (particles) are available. Our methods offer several key advantages, including their robustness to corrupted observations, their easy extension to more complex physical systems, and the potential to address higher-dimensional systems. We validate our approach through representative numerical examples and carefully investigate the impacts of data quantity and data property on the model discovery.</description>

      <title>Stokes-Lagrange and Stokes-Dirac representations of $N$-dimensional port-Hamiltonian systems for modelling and control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the port-Hamiltonian framework by introducing the concept of Stokes-Lagrange structure, which enables the implicit definition of a Hamiltonian over an $N$-dimensional domain and incorporates energy ports into the system. This new framework parallels the existing Dirac and Stokes-Dirac structures. We propose the Stokes-Lagrange structure as a specific case where the subspace is explicitly defined via differential operators that satisfy an integration by parts formula. By examining various examples through the lens of the Stokes-Lagrange structure, we demonstrate the existence of multiple equivalent system representations. These representations provide significant advantages for both numerical simulation and control design, offering additional tools for the modelling and control of port-Hamiltonian systems.</description>

      <title>Chaos for foliated spaces and pseudogroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.09983v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize "sensitivity to initial conditions" to foliated spaces and pseudogroups, offering a definition of Devaney chaos in this setting. In contrast to the case of group actions, where sensitivity follows from the other two conditions of Devaney chaos, we show that this is true only for compact foliated spaces, exhibiting a counterexample in the non-compact case. Finally, we obtain an analogue of the Auslander-Yorke dichotomy for compact foliated spaces and compactly generated pseudogroups.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium states for the classical Lorenz attractor and sectional-hyperbolic attractors in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10784v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has long been conjectured that the classical Lorenz attractor supports a unique measure of maximal entropy. In this article, we give a positive answer to this conjecture and its higher-dimensional counterpart by considering the uniqueness of equilibrium states for H\"older continuous functions on a sectional-hyperbolic attractor $\Lambda$. We prove that in a $C^1$-open and dense family of vector fields (including the classical Lorenz attractor), if the point masses at singularities are not equilibrium states, then there exists a unique equilibrium state supported on $\Lambda$. In particular, there exists a unique measure of maximal entropy for the flow $X|_\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>On the boundary of an immediate attracting basin of a hyperbolic entire function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a transcendental entire function of finite order which has an attracting periodic point $z_0$ of period at least $2$. Suppose that the set of singularities of the inverse of $f$ is finite and contained in the component $U$ of the Fatou set that contains $z_0$. Under an additional hypothesis we show that the intersection of $\partial U$ with the escaping set of $f$ has Hausdorff dimension $1$. The additional hypothesis is satisfied for example if $f$ has the form $f(z)=\int_0^z p(t)e^{q(t)}dt+c$ with polynomials $p$ and $q$ and a constant $c$. This generalizes a result of Bara\'nski, Karpi\'nska and Zdunik dealing with the case $f(z)=\lambda e^z$.</description>

      <title>Collinear Fractals and Bandt's Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a complex parameter $c$ outside the unit disk and an integer $n\ge2$, we examine the $n$-ary collinear fractal $E(c,n)$, defined as the attractor of the iterated function system $\{\mbox{$f_k \colon \mathbb{C} \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}$}\}_{k=1}^n$, where $f_k(z):=1+n-2k+c^{-1}z$. We investigate some topological features of the connectedness locus $\mathcal{M}_n$, similar to the Mandelbrot set, defined as the set of those $c$ for which $E(c,n)$ is connected. In particular, we provide a detailed answer to an open question posed by Calegari, Koch, and Walker in 2017. We also extend and refine the technique of the covering property by Solomyak and Xu to any $n\ge2$. We use it to show that a nontrivial portion of $\mathcal{M}_n$ is regular-closed. When $n\ge21$, we enhance this result by showing that, in fact, the whole $\mathcal{M}_n\setminus\mathbb{R}$ lies within the closure of its interior, thus proving that the generalized Bandt's conjecture is true.</description>

Abstract: We study optimization problems in ergodic theory from the view point of minimax problems. We give minimax characterizations of maximum ergodic averages involving time averages. Our approach works for the abstract variational principle of generalized pressure functions which is proved by Bi\'{s} et al. (2022). We also describe the relationship between our minimax results and the Fenchel-Rockafellar duality.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, the existence, uniqueness, and positivity of solutions, as well as the asymptotic behavior through a finite fractal dimensional global attractor for a general Advection-Diffusion-Reaction (ADR) equation, are investigated. Our findings are innovative, as we employ semigroups and global attractors theories to achieve these results. Also, an analytical solution of a two-dimensional Advection-Diffusion Equation is presented. And finally, two Explicit Finite Difference schemes are used to simulate solutions in the two- and three-dimensional cases. The numerical simulations are conducted with predefined initial and Dirichlet boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>A new platooning model for connected and autonomous vehicles to improve string stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18791v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to coordinated vehicle platooning, where the platoon followers communicate solely with the platoon leader. A dynamic model is proposed to account for driving safety under communication delays. General linear stability results are mathematically proven, and numerical simulations are performed to analyze the impact of model parameters in two scenarios: a ring road with initial disturbance and an infinite road with periodic disturbance. The simulation outcomes align with the theoretical analysis, demonstrating that the proposed "look-to-the-leader" platooning strategy significantly outperforms conventional car-following strategies, such as following one or two vehicles ahead, in terms of traffic flow stabilization. This paper introduces a new perspective on organizing platoons for autonomous vehicles, with implications for enhancing traffic stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate state feedback and observation for infinite-dimensional linear systems, including a variety of partial differential equations with boundary control and observation. We extend the modulating function approach to infinite-dimensional systems. This approach, simply put, involves reconstructing part of the state by convolving with null controls of the adjoint system. We show how this method aids in state reconstruction, and we also examine distributional solutions of the adjoint system, showing their ability to handle unbounded feedback operators. This enables us to use feedback from spatial point evaluations in partial differential equations.</description>
