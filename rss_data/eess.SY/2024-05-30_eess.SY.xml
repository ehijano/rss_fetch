      <title>Flexible Agent-based Modeling Framework to Evaluate Integrated Microtransit and Fixed-route Transit Designs: Mode Choice, Supernetworks, and Fleet Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of traditional fixed-route transit (FRT) and more flexible microtransit has been touted as a means of improving mobility and access to opportunity, increasing transit ridership, and promoting environmental sustainability. To help evaluate integrated FRT and microtransit public transit (PT) system (henceforth ``integrated fixed-flex PT system'') designs, we propose a high-fidelity modeling framework that provides reliable estimates for a wide range of (i) performance metrics and (ii) integrated fixed-flex PT system designs. We formulate the mode choice equilibrium problem as a fixed-point problem wherein microtransit demand is a function of microtransit performance, and microtransit performance depends on microtransit demand. We propose a detailed agent-based simulation modeling framework that includes (i) a binary logit mode choice model (private auto vs. transit), (ii) a supernetwork-based model and pathfinding algorithm for multi-modal transit path choice where the supernetwork includes pedestrian, FRT, and microtransit layers, (iii) a detailed mobility-on-demand fleet simulator called FleetPy to model the supply-demand dynamics of the microtransit service. In this paper, we illustrate the capabilities of the modeling framework by analyzing integrated fixed-flex PT system designs that vary the following design parameters: FRT frequencies and microtransit fleet size, service region structure, virtual stop coverage, and operating hours. We include case studies in downtown San Diego and Lemon Grove, California. The computational results show that the proposed modeling framework converges to a mode choice equilibrium. Moreover, the scenario results imply that introducing a new microtransit service decreases FRT ridership and requires additional subsidies, but it significantly increases job accessibility and slightly reduces total VMT.</description>

      <title>A novel fault localization with data refinement for hydroelectric units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the scarcity of fault samples and the complexity of non-linear and non-smooth characteristics data in hydroelectric units, most of the traditional hydroelectric unit fault localization methods are difficult to carry out accurate localization. To address these problems, a sparse autoencoder (SAE)-generative adversarial network (GAN)-wavelet noise reduction (WNR)- manifold-boosted deep learning (SG-WMBDL) based fault localization method for hydroelectric units is proposed. To overcome the data scarcity, a SAE is embedded into the GAN to generate more high-quality samples in the data generation module. Considering the signals involving non-linear and non-smooth characteristics, the improved WNR which combining both soft and hard thresholding and local linear embedding (LLE) are utilized to the data preprocessing module in order to reduce the noise and effectively capture the local features. In addition, to seek higher performance, the novel Adaptive Boost (AdaBoost) combined with multi deep learning is proposed to achieve accurate fault localization. The experimental results show that the SG-WMBDL can locate faults for hydroelectric units under a small number of fault samples with non-linear and non-smooth characteristics on higher precision and accuracy compared to other frontier methods, which verifies the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Assessing the impact of weather-induced uncertainties in large-scale electricity systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The future energy system will largely depend on volatile renewable energy sources and temperature-dependent loads, which makes the weather a central influencing factor. This article presents a novel approach for simulating weather scenarios for robust large-scale power system analysis. By applying different signal analysis methods, historical weather data is decomposed into its spectral components, processed appropriately, and then used to generate random, self-consistent weather data. In this process, any weather parameters of different locations can be considered, while their respective dependencies are mapped. The added value is demonstrated by coupling with a state-of-the-art large-scale energy system model for Europe. It is shown that the integrated consideration of different weather influences allows a quantification of the range of fluctuation of various parameters - such as the feed-in of wind and solar power - and thus provides the basis for future resilient grid planning approaches.</description>

      <title>Discrete-Time I&amp;I Adaptive Interconnection and Damping Passivity-Based Control for Nonlinearly Parameterized Port-Controlled Hamiltonian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a discrete-time I&amp;I-based adaptive IDA-PBC controller for uncertain nonlinearly parameterized port-controlled Hamiltonian systems (PCH), where the parameter uncertainties are assumed in the energy function, is constructed. A proper formulation for the uncertain system dynamics is established where the uncertainties appear in nonlinearly parameterized form in the gradient of the Hamiltonian function. The adaptive IDA-PBC controller is constructed considering this formulation. For the adaptation mechanism of the IDA-PBC controller, a discrete-time parameter estimator is derived based on the immersion and invariance (I&amp;I) approach. A structure for a free design function in the I&amp;I-based estimator is proposed including some other free design functions. If these free design functions are selected to satisfy some conditions, derived in this paper, the Lyapunov asymptotic stability of the estimator dynamics is guaranteed. Besides, assuming these conditions are satisfied, local asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system, in a sufficiently large set is shown. The proposed method is applied to the two physical system examples and the performance of the adaptive controller is tested by simulation. It is demonstrated that the performance of the certain IDA-PBC controller is maintained by the adaptive IDA-PBC controller successfully.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph-Aided Task-Resource Matching for Maximizing Value of Task Completion in Collaborative IoT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing scale and intrinsic heterogeneity of Internet of Things (IoT) systems, distributed device collaboration becomes essential for effective task completion by dynamically utilizing limited communication and computing resources. However, the separated design and situation-agnostic operation of computing, communication and application layers create a fundamental challenge for rapid task-resource matching, which further deteriorate the overall task completion effectiveness. To overcome this challenge, we utilize hypergraph as a new tool to vertically unify computing, communication, and task aspects of IoT systems for an effective matching by accurately capturing the relationships between tasks and communication and computing resources. Specifically, a state-of-the-art task-resource matching hypergraph (TRM-hypergraph) model is proposed in this paper, which is used to effectively transform the process of allocating complex heterogeneous resources to convoluted tasks into a hypergraph matching problem. Taking into account computational complexity and storage, a game-theoretic hypergraph matching algorithm is proposed via considering the hypergraph matching problem as a non-cooperative multi-player clustering game. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed TRM-hypergraph model achieves superior performance in matching of tasks and resources compared with comparison algorithms.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Slack Bus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a general dynamic formulation of slack bus. With this aim, the angle constraint imposed by the slack bus is redefined as a set of differential equations and an energy source. The existence and role of the transient component of this source is also discussed in the letter. Based on this framework, the letter shows that the swing equations of synchronous machines can be interpreted as distributed, dynamic, multi-variable, local slack buses. Other relevant cases, including primary and secondary frequency regulation, passive loads as well as grid following and grid forming converters are discussed.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Battlefield Awareness: An Aerial RIS-assisted ISAC System with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a joint communication and sensing technique for enhancing situational awareness in practical battlefield scenarios. In particular, we propose an aerial reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS)-assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system consisting of a single access point (AP), an ARIS, multiple users, and a sensing target. With deep reinforcement learning (DRL), we jointly optimize the transmit beamforming of the AP, the RIS phase shifts, and the trajectory of the ARIS under signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) constraints. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed technique outperforms the conventional benchmark schemes by suppressing the self-interference and clutter echo signals or optimizing the RIS phase shifts.</description>

      <title>Non-intrusive data-driven model order reduction for circuits based on Hammerstein architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that data-driven system identification techniques can provide a basis for effective, non-intrusive model order reduction (MOR) for common circuits that are key building blocks in microelectronics. Our approach is motivated by the practical operation of these circuits and utilizes a canonical Hammerstein architecture. To demonstrate the approach we develop a parsimonious Hammerstein model for a non-linear CMOS differential amplifier. We train this model on a combination of direct current (DC) and transient Spice (Xyce) circuit simulation data using a novel sequential strategy to identify the static nonlinear and linear dynamical parts of the model. Simulation results show that the Hammerstein model is an effective surrogate for the differential amplifier circuit that accurately and efficiently reproduces its behavior over a wide range of operating points and input frequencies.</description>

      <title>Generation planning and operation under power stability constraints: A Hydro-Quebec use case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydro-Quebec (HQ) is a vertically integrated utility that produces, transmits, and distributes most of the electricity in the province of Quebec. The power grid it operates has a particular architecture created by large hydroelectric dams located far north and the extensive 735kV transmission grid that allows the generated power to reach the majority of the load located thousands of kilometers away in the southern region of Quebec. The specificity of the grid has led HQ to develop monitoring tools responsible for generating so-called stability limits. Those stability limits take into account several nonlinear phenomena such as angular stability, frequency stability, or voltage stability. Since generation planning and operation tools rely mostly on mixed integer linear programming formulation, HQ had to adapt its tools to integrate stability limits into them. This paper presents the challenges it faced, especially considering its reserve monitoring tool and unit commitment tool.</description>

      <title>System Identification for Lithium-Ion Batteries with Nonlinear Coupled Electro-Thermal Dynamics via Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Essential to various practical applications of lithium-ion batteries is the availability of accurate equivalent circuit models. This paper presents a new coupled electro-thermal model for batteries and studies how to extract it from data. We consider the problem of maximum likelihood parameter estimation, which, however, is nontrivial to solve as the model is nonlinear in both its dynamics and measurement. We propose to leverage the Bayesian optimization approach, owing to its machine learning-driven capability in handling complex optimization problems and searching for global optima. To enhance the parameter search efficiency, we dynamically narrow and refine the search space in Bayesian optimization. The proposed system identification approach can efficiently determine the parameters of the coupled electro-thermal model. It is amenable to practical implementation, with few requirements on the experiment, data types, and optimization setups, and well applicable to many other battery models.</description>

      <title>Ancillary Services Provision by Cross-Voltage-Level Power Flow Control using Flexibility Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large-scale integration of distributed renewable energy sources into the electricity grid requires the investigation of new methods to ensure stability. For example, Active Distribution Networks (ADNs) can be used at (sub-) transmission levels for emergency operation, provided robust and efficient control is available. This paper investigates the use of Feasible Operating Regions (FORs) and Flexibility Regions (FRs) for Cross-Voltage-Level Power Flow Control (CPFC). The enhancement of network stability due to the provision of ancillary services is illustrated, as is the need for strengthened cooperation between Transmission (TSOs) and Distribution System Operators (DSOs). Optimal power flow methods are considered, focusing on computational advances through PieceWise Linearization (PWL) and convex relaxation techniques aiming to speed up runtime while keeping high accuracy. To illustrate the algorithms' benefits and drawbacks, they are analyzed using exemplary medium voltage grids.</description>

      <title>Speed Profile Definition for GLOSA Implementation on Buses Based on Statistical Analysis of Experimental Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are pushing an increasing interest and development when dealing with eco-driving systems. In this framework, this paper presents a method to define speed profiles specifically designed for Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) systems on buses. GLOSA aims to optimize traffic flow by providing vehicles with real-time speed recommendations synchronized with traffic signal timings. Leveraging statistical analysis of experimental data collected from an urban bus, the study develops a methodology to extract meaningful insights into bus behaviour and traffic dynamics. The proposed approach considers road topology, scheduled bus stops, and signal timings to define simple although suitable speed profiles considering the peculiarities of the motion of a bus in an urban scenario. Through extensive data collection robust statistical data are defined, allowing the definition of vehicle motion profile for effectively develop and implement GLOSA systems. This research contributes to the advancement of Intelligent Transportation Systems by providing realistic data and practical insights for optimizing bus operations in urban environments.</description>

      <title>Approximate Thompson Sampling for Learning Linear Quadratic Regulators with $O(\sqrt{T})$ Regret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an approximate Thompson sampling algorithm that learns linear quadratic regulators (LQR) with an improved Bayesian regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T})$. Our method leverages Langevin dynamics with a meticulously designed preconditioner as well as a simple excitation mechanism. We show that the excitation signal induces the minimum eigenvalue of the preconditioner to grow over time, thereby accelerating the approximate posterior sampling process. Moreover, we identify nontrivial concentration properties of the approximate posteriors generated by our algorithm. These properties enable us to bound the moments of the system state and attain an $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound without the unrealistic restrictive assumptions on parameter sets that are often used in the literature.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Optimization in Time-Varying Networks with Arbitrary Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a decentralized optimization problem for networks affected by communication delays. Examples of such networks include collaborative machine learning, sensor networks, and multi-agent systems. To mimic communication delays, we add virtual non-computing nodes to the network, resulting in directed graphs. This motivates investigating decentralized optimization solutions on directed graphs. Existing solutions assume nodes know their out-degrees, resulting in limited applicability. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel gossip-based algorithm, called DT-GO, that does not need to know the out-degrees. The algorithm is applicable in general directed networks, for example networks with delays or limited acknowledgment capabilities. We derive convergence rates for both convex and non-convex objectives, showing that our algorithm achieves the same complexity order as centralized Stochastic Gradient Descent. In other words, the effects of the graph topology and delays are confined to higher-order terms. Additionally, we extend our analysis to accommodate time-varying network topologies. Numerical simulations are provided to support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a convex optimization approach to determine perturbations in the initial conditions of a weather phenomenon as control inputs for quantitative weather control. We first construct a sensitivity matrix of outputs, such as accumulated precipitation, to the initial conditions, such as temperature and humidity, through sensitivity analysis of a numerical weather prediction model. We then solve a convex optimization problem to find optimal perturbations in the initial conditions to realize the desired spatial distribution of the targeting outputs. We implement the proposed method in a benchmark of a warm bubble experiment and show that it realizes desired spatial distributions of accumulated precipitation, such as a reference distribution and the reduced maximum value.</description>

      <title>SysCaps: Language Interfaces for Simulation Surrogates of Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven simulation surrogates help computational scientists study complex systems. They can also help inform impactful policy decisions. We introduce a learning framework for surrogate modeling where language is used to interface with the underlying system being simulated. We call a language description of a system a "system caption", or SysCap. To address the lack of datasets of paired natural language SysCaps and simulation runs, we use large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality captions. Using our framework, we train multimodal text and timeseries regression models for two real-world simulators of complex energy systems. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of designing language interfaces for real-world surrogate models at comparable accuracy to standard baselines. We qualitatively and quantitatively show that SysCaps unlock text-prompt-style surrogate modeling and new generalization abilities beyond what was previously possible. We will release the generated SysCaps datasets and our code to support follow-on studies.</description>

Abstract: The sudden onset of deleterious and oscillatory dynamics (often called instabilities) is a known challenge in many fluid, plasma, and aerospace systems. These dynamics are difficult to address because they are nonlinear, chaotic, and are often too fast for active control schemes. In this work, we develop an alternative active controls system using an iterative, trajectory-optimization and parameter-tuning approach based on Iterative Learning Control (ILC), Time-Lagged Phase Portraits (TLPP) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). The novelty of this approach is that it can control a system's dynamics despite the controller being much slower than the dynamics. We demonstrate this controller on the Lorenz system of equations where it iteratively adjusts (tunes) the system's input parameters to successfully reproduce a desired oscillatory trajectory or state. Additionally, we investigate the system's dynamical sensitivity to its control parameters, identify continuous and bounded regions of desired dynamical trajectories, and demonstrate that the controller is robust to missing information and uncontrollable parameters as long as certain requirements are met. The controller presented in this work provides a framework for low-speed control for a variety of fast, nonlinear systems that may aid in instability suppression and mitigation.</description>

      <title>Assistance-Seeking in Human-Supervised Autonomy: Role of Trust and Secondary Task Engagement (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a dual-task paradigm, we explore how robot actions, performance, and the introduction of a secondary task influence human trust and engagement. In our study, a human supervisor simultaneously engages in a target-tracking task while supervising a mobile manipulator performing an object collection task. The robot can either autonomously collect the object or ask for human assistance. The human supervisor also has the choice to rely upon or interrupt the robot. Using data from initial experiments, we model the dynamics of human trust and engagement using a linear dynamical system (LDS). Furthermore, we develop a human action model to define the probability of human reliance on the robot. Our model suggests that participants are more likely to interrupt the robot when their trust and engagement are low during high-complexity collection tasks. Using Model Predictive Control (MPC), we design an optimal assistance-seeking policy. Evaluation experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the MPC policy over the baseline policy for most participants.</description>

      <title>Lasso-based state estimation for cyber-physical systems under sensor attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of algorithms for secure state estimation in vulnerable cyber-physical systems has been gaining attention in the last years. A consolidated assumption is that an adversary can tamper a relatively small number of sensors. In the literature, block-sparsity methods exploit this prior information to recover the attack locations and the state of the system.
  In this paper, we propose an alternative, Lasso-based approach and we analyse its effectiveness. In particular, we theoretically derive conditions that guarantee successful attack/state recovery, independently of established time sparsity patterns. Furthermore, we develop a sparse state observer, by starting from the iterative soft thresholding algorithm for Lasso, to perform online estimation.
  Through several numerical experiments, we compare the proposed methods to the state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Nonuniqueness and Convergence to Equivalent Solutions in Observer-based Inverse Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.16299v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key challenge in solving the deterministic inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) problem online and in real-time is the existence of multiple solutions. Nonuniqueness necessitates the study of the notion of equivalent solutions, i.e., solutions that result in a different cost functional but same feedback matrix, and convergence to such solutions. While offline algorithms that result in convergence to equivalent solutions have been developed in the literature, online, real-time techniques that address nonuniqueness are not available. In this paper, a regularized history stack observer that converges to approximately equivalent solutions of the IRL problem is developed. Novel data-richness conditions are developed to facilitate the analysis and simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed technique.</description>

      <title>AI-based Identification of Most Critical Cyberattacks in Industrial Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern industrial systems face a growing threat from sophisticated cyberattacks that can cause significant operational disruptions. This work presents a novel methodology for identification of the most critical cyberattacks that may disrupt the operation of such a system. Application of the proposed framework can enable the design and development of advanced cybersecurity solutions for a wide range of industrial applications. Attacks are assessed taking into direct consideration how they impact the system operation as measured by a defined Key Performance Indicator (KPI). A simulation model (SM), of the industrial process is employed for calculation of the KPI based on operating conditions. Such SM is augmented with a layer of information describing the communication network topology, connected devices, and potential actions an adversary can take based on each device or network link. Each possible action is associated with an abstract measure of effort, which is interpreted as a cost. It is assumed that the adversary has a corresponding budget that constrains the selection of the sequence of actions defining the progression of the attack. A dynamical system comprising a set of states associated with the cyberattack (cyber-states) and transition logic for updating their values is also proposed. The resulting augmented simulation model (ASM) is then employed in an artificial intelligence-based sequential decision-making optimization to yield the most critical cyberattack scenarios as measured by their impact on the defined KPI. The methodology is successfully tested based on an electrical power distribution system use case.</description>

Abstract: This work introduces the Data-Enabled Predictive iteRative Control (DeePRC) algorithm, a direct data-driven approach for iterative LTI systems. The DeePRC learns from previous iterations to improve its performance and achieves the optimal cost. By utilizing a tube-based variation of the DeePRC scheme, we propose a two-stage approach that enables safe active exploration using a left-kernel-based input disturbance design. This method generates informative trajectories to enrich the historical data, which extends the maximum achievable prediction horizon and leads to faster iteration convergence. In addition, we present an end-to-end formulation of the two-stage approach, integrating the disturbance design procedure into the planning phase. We showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms on a numerical experiment.</description>

      <title>Characteristic time of transient response of solid oxide cells (SOCs) to changes in voltage/current: from theory to applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intermittency of solar and wind power can be addressed by integrating them with Solid Oxide Cells (SOCs). This study delves into the transient characteristics of SOCs and their dependence on dynamic heat and mass transfer processes. Non-dimensional analysis was used to identify influential parameters, followed by a 3-D numerical simulation-based parametric analysis to examine the dynamic gaseous and thermal responses of SOCs with varying dimensions, material properties, and operating conditions. For the first time, we proposed characteristic times to describe the relationship between SOC transients and multiple parameters. These characteristic times represent the overall heat and mass transfer rats in SOCs. Their effectiveness was validated against literature and demonstrated potential in characterizing the transient characteristics of other electrochemical cells. Besides, two examples are provided to illustrate how the characteristic times facilitate SOC design and control at minimal computational cost.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Convex Optimization: A Contraction and Equilibrium Tracking Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we provide a novel and broadly-applicable contraction-theoretic approach to continuous-time time-varying convex optimization. For any parameter-dependent contracting dynamics, we show that the tracking error is asymptotically proportional to the rate of change of the parameter with proportionality constant upper bounded by Lipschitz constant in which the parameter appears divided by the contraction rate of the dynamics squared. We additionally establish that any parameter-dependent contracting dynamics can be augmented with a feedforward prediction term to ensure that the tracking error converges to zero exponentially quickly. To apply these results to time-varying convex optimization problems, we establish the strong infinitesimal contractivity of dynamics solving three canonical problems, namely monotone inclusions, linear equality-constrained problems, and composite minimization problems. For each of these problems, we prove the sharpest-known rates of contraction and provide explicit tracking error bounds between solution trajectories and minimizing trajectories. We validate our theoretical results on three numerical examples including an application to control-barrier function based controller design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17217v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce novel tactile-based motion primitives termed "tactile-traversal", "tactile-turning" and "ricocheting" for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These primitives enable contact-rich UAV missions such as tactile-based exploration, mapping, and collision-inclusive navigation. We begin by introducing XPLORER, a passive deformable UAV that sustains collisions and establishes smooth contacts by exploiting its spring-augmented chassis. Next, an improved and fast converging external force estimation algorithm is proposed to detect contacts/collisions. We also design three distinct reaction controllers for (i) static-wrench application, (ii) disturbance rejection, and (iii) collision recovery. Finally, the three new tactile-based motion primitives are proposed by leveraging the reactions obtained from deploying these controllers to interact with surroundings. We showcase the effectiveness of these primitives to facilitate efficient exploration and rapid navigation in unknown environments by capitalizing on collisions and contacts.</description>

      <title>Real-to-Sim Deformable Object Manipulation: Optimizing Physics Models with Residual Mappings for Robotic Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate deformable object manipulation (DOM) is essential for achieving autonomy in robotic surgery, where soft tissues are being displaced, stretched, and dissected. Many DOM methods can be powered by simulation, which ensures realistic deformation by adhering to the governing physical constraints and allowing for model prediction and control. However, real soft objects in robotic surgery, such as membranes and soft tissues, have complex, anisotropic physical parameters that a simulation with simple initialization from cameras may not fully capture. To use the simulation techniques in real surgical tasks, the "real-to-sim" gap needs to be properly compensated. In this work, we propose an online, adaptive parameter tuning approach for simulation optimization that (1) bridges the real-to-sim gap between a physics simulation and observations obtained 3D perceptions through estimating a residual mapping and (2) optimizes its stiffness parameters online. Our method ensures a small residual gap between the simulation and observation and improves the simulation's predictive capabilities. The effectiveness of the proposed mechanism is evaluated in the manipulation of both a thin-shell and volumetric tissue, representative of most tissue scenarios. This work contributes to the advancement of simulation-based deformable tissue manipulation and holds potential for improving surgical autonomy.</description>

      <title>Teach and Repeat Navigation: A Robust Control Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robot navigation requires an autonomy pipeline that is robust to environmental changes and effective in varying conditions. Teach and Repeat (T&amp;R) navigation has shown high performance in autonomous repeated tasks under challenging circumstances, but research within T&amp;R has predominantly focused on motion planning as opposed to motion control. In this paper, we propose a novel T&amp;R system based on a robust motion control technique for a skid-steering mobile robot using sliding-mode control that effectively handles uncertainties that are particularly pronounced in the T&amp;R task, where sensor noises, parametric uncertainties, and wheel-terrain interaction are common challenges. We first theoretically demonstrate that the proposed T&amp;R system is globally stable and robust while considering the uncertainties of the closed-loop system. When deployed on a Clearpath Jackal robot, we then show the global stability of the proposed system in both indoor and outdoor environments covering different terrains, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean average trajectory error and stability in these challenging environments. This paper makes an important step towards long-term autonomous T&amp;R navigation with ensured safety guarantees.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the convergence properties of a robust adaptive model predictive control algorithm used to control an unknown nonlinear system. We show that by employing a standard quadratic stabilizing cost function, and by recursively updating the nominal model through kinky inference, the resulting controller ensures convergence of the true system to the origin, despite the presence of model uncertainty. We illustrate our theoretical findings through a numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of magnetic tunnel junction-based computational random-access memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14264v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional computing paradigm struggles to fulfill the rapidly growing demands from emerging applications, especially those for machine intelligence, because much of the power and energy is consumed by constant data transfers between logic and memory modules. A new paradigm, called "computational random-access memory (CRAM)" has emerged to address this fundamental limitation. CRAM performs logic operations directly using the memory cells themselves, without having the data ever leave the memory. The energy and performance benefits of CRAM for both conventional and emerging applications have been well established by prior numerical studies. However, there lacks an experimental demonstration and study of CRAM to evaluate its computation accuracy, which is a realistic and application-critical metrics for its technological feasibility and competitiveness. In this work, a CRAM array based on magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) is experimentally demonstrated. First, basic memory operations as well as 2-, 3-, and 5-input logic operations are studied. Then, a 1-bit full adder with two different designs is demonstrated. Based on the experimental results, a suite of modeling has been developed to characterize the accuracy of CRAM computation. Scalar addition, multiplication, and matrix multiplication, which are essential building blocks for many conventional and machine intelligence applications, are evaluated and show promising accuracy performance. With the confirmation of MTJ-based CRAM's accuracy, there is a strong case that this technology will have a significant impact on power- and energy-demanding applications of machine intelligence.</description>
