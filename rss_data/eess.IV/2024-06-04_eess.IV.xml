      <title>Augmentation-based Unsupervised Cross-Domain Functional MRI Adaptation for Major Depressive Disorder Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mental disorder that typically affects a person's mood, cognition, behavior, and physical health. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data are widely used for computer-aided diagnosis of MDD. While multi-site fMRI data can provide more data for training reliable diagnostic models, significant cross-site data heterogeneity would result in poor model generalizability. Many domain adaptation methods are designed to reduce the distributional differences between sites to some extent, but usually ignore overfitting problem of the model on the source domain. Intuitively, target data augmentation can alleviate the overfitting problem by forcing the model to learn more generalized features and reduce the dependence on source domain data. In this work, we propose a new augmentation-based unsupervised cross-domain fMRI adaptation (AUFA) framework for automatic diagnosis of MDD. The AUFA consists of 1) a graph representation learning module for extracting rs-fMRI features with spatial attention, 2) a domain adaptation module for feature alignment between source and target data, 3) an augmentation-based self-optimization module for alleviating model overfitting on the source domain, and 4) a classification module. Experimental results on 1,089 subjects suggest that AUFA outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in MDD identification. Our approach not only reduces data heterogeneity between different sites, but also localizes disease-related functional connectivity abnormalities and provides interpretability for the model.</description>

      <title>Correlation-aware Coarse-to-fine MLPs for Deformable Medical Image Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deformable image registration is a fundamental step for medical image analysis. Recently, transformers have been used for registration and outperformed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Transformers can capture long-range dependence among image features, which have been shown beneficial for registration. However, due to the high computation/memory loads of self-attention, transformers are typically used at downsampled feature resolutions and cannot capture fine-grained long-range dependence at the full image resolution. This limits deformable registration as it necessitates precise dense correspondence between each image pixel. Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs) without self-attention are efficient in computation/memory usage, enabling the feasibility of capturing fine-grained long-range dependence at full resolution. Nevertheless, MLPs have not been extensively explored for image registration and are lacking the consideration of inductive bias crucial for medical registration tasks. In this study, we propose the first correlation-aware MLP-based registration network (CorrMLP) for deformable medical image registration. Our CorrMLP introduces a correlation-aware multi-window MLP block in a novel coarse-to-fine registration architecture, which captures fine-grained multi-range dependence to perform correlation-aware coarse-to-fine registration. Extensive experiments with seven public medical datasets show that our CorrMLP outperforms state-of-the-art deformable registration methods.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objectives: To present a publicly available torso segmentation network for large epidemiology datasets on volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination (VIBE) images. Materials &amp; Methods: We extracted preliminary segmentations from TotalSegmentator, spine, and body composition networks for VIBE images, then improved them iteratively and retrained a nnUNet network. Using subsets of NAKO (85 subjects) and UK Biobank (16 subjects), we evaluated with Dice-score on a holdout set (12 subjects) and existing organ segmentation approach (1000 subjects), generating 71 semantic segmentation types for VIBE images. We provide an additional network for the vertebra segments 22 individual vertebra types. Results: We achieved an average Dice score of 0.89 +- 0.07 overall 71 segmentation labels. We scored &gt; 0.90 Dice-score on the abdominal organs except for the pancreas with a Dice of 0.70. Conclusion: Our work offers a detailed and refined publicly available full torso segmentation on VIBE images.</description>

      <title>Direct Cardiac Segmentation from Undersampled K-space Using Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prevailing deep learning-based methods of predicting cardiac segmentation involve reconstructed magnetic resonance (MR) images. The heavy dependency of segmentation approaches on image quality significantly limits the acceleration rate in fast MR reconstruction. Moreover, the practice of treating reconstruction and segmentation as separate sequential processes leads to artifact generation and information loss in the intermediate stage. These issues pose a great risk to achieving high-quality outcomes. To leverage the redundant k-space information overlooked in this dual-step pipeline, we introduce a novel approach to directly deriving segmentations from sparse k-space samples using a transformer (DiSK). DiSK operates by globally extracting latent features from 2D+time k-space data with attention blocks and subsequently predicting the segmentation label of query points. We evaluate our model under various acceleration factors (ranging from 4 to 64) and compare against two image-based segmentation baselines. Our model consistently outperforms the baselines in Dice and Hausdorff distances across foreground classes for all presented sampling rates.</description>

      <title>MVAD: A Multiple Visual Artifact Detector for Video Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual artifacts are often introduced into streamed video content, due to prevailing conditions during content production and/or delivery. Since these can degrade the quality of the user's experience, it is important to automatically and accurately detect them in order to enable effective quality measurement and enhancement. Existing detection methods often focus on a single type of artifact and/or determine the presence of an artifact through thresholding objective quality indices. Such approaches have been reported to offer inconsistent prediction performance and are also impractical for real-world applications where multiple artifacts co-exist and interact. In this paper, we propose a Multiple Visual Artifact Detector, MVAD, for video streaming which, for the first time, is able to detect multiple artifacts using a single framework that is not reliant on video quality assessment models. Our approach employs a new Artifact-aware Dynamic Feature Extractor (ADFE) to obtain artifact-relevant spatial features within each frame for multiple artifact types. The extracted features are further processed by a Recurrent Memory Vision Transformer (RMViT) module, which captures both short-term and long-term temporal information within the input video. The proposed network architecture is optimized in an end-to-end manner based on a new, large and diverse training database that is generated by simulating the video streaming pipeline and based on Adversarial Data Augmentation. This model has been evaluated on two video artifact databases, Maxwell and BVI-Artifact, and achieves consistent and improved prediction results for ten target visual artifacts when compared to seven existing single and multiple artifact detectors. The source code and training database will be available at https://chenfeng-bristol.github.io/MVAD/.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of CNN, ResNet, and Vision Transformers for Multi-Classification of Chest Diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models, notably utilizing Transformer architectures, have emerged as powerful tools due to their scalability and ability to process large amounts of data. Dosovitskiy et al. expanded this architecture to introduce Vision Transformers (ViT), extending its applicability to image processing tasks. Motivated by this advancement, we fine-tuned two variants of ViT models, one pre-trained on ImageNet and another trained from scratch, using the NIH Chest X-ray dataset containing over 100,000 frontal-view X-ray images. Our study evaluates the performance of these models in the multi-label classification of 14 distinct diseases, while using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and ResNet architectures as baseline models for comparison. Through rigorous assessment based on accuracy metrics, we identify that the pre-trained ViT model surpasses CNNs and ResNet in this multilabel classification task, highlighting its potential for accurate diagnosis of various lung conditions from chest X-ray images.</description>

      <title>Hybrid attention structure preserving network for reconstruction of under-sampled OCT images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive, high-resolution imaging technology that provides cross-sectional images of tissues. Dense acquisition of A-scans along the fast axis is required to obtain high digital resolution images. However, the dense acquisition will increase the acquisition time, causing the discomfort of patients. In addition, the longer acquisition time may lead to motion artifacts, thereby reducing imaging quality. In this work, we proposed a hybrid attention structure preserving network (HASPN) to achieve super-resolution of under-sampled OCT images to speed up the acquisition. It utilized adaptive dilated convolution-based channel attention (ADCCA) and enhanced spatial attention (ESA) to better capture the channel and spatial information of the feature. Moreover, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) exhibit a higher sensitivity of low-frequency than high-frequency information, which may lead to a limited performance on reconstructing fine structures. To address this problem, we introduced an additional branch, i.e., textures &amp; details branch, using high-frequency decomposition images to better super-resolve retinal structures. The superiority of our method was demonstrated by qualitative and quantitative comparisons with mainstream methods. HASPN was applied to the diabetic macular edema retinal dataset, validating its good generalization ability.</description>

      <title>Complex Style Image Transformations for Domain Generalization in Medical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The absence of well-structured large datasets in medical computer vision results in decreased performance of automated systems and, especially, of deep learning models. Domain generalization techniques aim to approach unknown domains from a single data source. In this paper we introduce a novel framework, named CompStyle, which leverages style transfer and adversarial training, along with high-level input complexity augmentation to effectively expand the domain space and address unknown distributions. State-of-the-art style transfer methods depend on the existence of subdomains within the source dataset. However, this can lead to an inherent dataset bias in the image creation. Input-level augmentation can provide a solution to this problem by widening the domain space in the source dataset and boost performance on out-of-domain distributions. We provide results from experiments on semantic segmentation on prostate data and corruption robustness on cardiac data which demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our method increases performance in both tasks, without added cost to training time or resources.</description>

      <title>Whole Heart 3D+T Representation Learning Through Sparse 2D Cardiac MR Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging serves as the gold-standard for evaluating cardiac morphology and function. Typically, a multi-view CMR stack, covering short-axis (SA) and 2/3/4-chamber long-axis (LA) views, is acquired for a thorough cardiac assessment. However, efficiently streamlining the complex, high-dimensional 3D+T CMR data and distilling compact, coherent representation remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce a whole-heart self-supervised learning framework that utilizes masked imaging modeling to automatically uncover the correlations between spatial and temporal patches throughout the cardiac stacks. This process facilitates the generation of meaningful and well-clustered heart representations without relying on the traditionally required, and often costly, labeled data. The learned heart representation can be directly used for various downstream tasks. Furthermore, our method demonstrates remarkable robustness, ensuring consistent representations even when certain CMR planes are missing/flawed. We train our model on 14,000 unlabeled CMR data from UK BioBank and evaluate it on 1,000 annotated data. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance to baselines in tasks that demand comprehensive 3D+T cardiac information, e.g. cardiac phenotype (ejection fraction and ventricle volume) prediction and multi-plane/multi-frame CMR segmentation, highlighting its effectiveness in extracting comprehensive cardiac features that are both anatomically and pathologically relevant.</description>

      <title>DSCA: A Digital Subtraction Angiography Sequence Dataset and Spatio-Temporal Model for Cerebral Artery Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cerebrovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a leading cause of global disability and mortality. Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) sequences, recognized as the golden standard for diagnosing CVDs, can clearly visualize the dynamic flow and reveal pathological conditions within the cerebrovasculature. Therefore, precise segmentation of cerebral arteries (CAs) and classification between their main trunks and branches are crucial for physicians to accurately quantify diseases. However, achieving accurate CA segmentation in DSA sequences remains a challenging task due to small vessels with low contrast, and ambiguity between vessels and residual skull structures. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets limits exploration in the field. In this paper, we introduce a DSA Sequence-based Cerebral Artery segmentation dataset (DSCA), the first publicly accessible dataset designed specifically for pixel-level semantic segmentation of CAs. Additionally, we propose DSANet, a spatio-temporal network for CA segmentation in DSA sequences. Unlike existing DSA segmentation methods that focus only on a single frame, the proposed DSANet introduces a separate temporal encoding branch to capture dynamic vessel details across multiple frames. To enhance small vessel segmentation and improve vessel connectivity, we design a novel TemporalFormer module to capture global context and correlations among sequential frames. Furthermore, we develop a Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) module to effectively integrate spatial and temporal features from the encoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSANet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in CA segmentation, achieving a Dice of 0.9033.</description>

      <title>SynthBA: Reliable Brain Age Estimation Across Multiple MRI Sequences and Resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain age is a critical measure that reflects the biological ageing process of the brain. The gap between brain age and chronological age, referred to as brain PAD (Predicted Age Difference), has been utilized to investigate neurodegenerative conditions. Brain age can be predicted using MRIs and machine learning techniques. However, existing methods are often sensitive to acquisition-related variabilities, such as differences in acquisition protocols, scanners, MRI sequences, and resolutions, significantly limiting their application in highly heterogeneous clinical settings. In this study, we introduce Synthetic Brain Age (SynthBA), a robust deep-learning model designed for predicting brain age. SynthBA utilizes an advanced domain randomization technique, ensuring effective operation across a wide array of acquisition-related variabilities. To assess the effectiveness and robustness of SynthBA, we evaluate its predictive capabilities on internal and external datasets, encompassing various MRI sequences and resolutions, and compare it with state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we calculate the brain PAD in a large cohort of subjects with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), demonstrating a significant correlation with AD-related measures of cognitive dysfunction. SynthBA holds the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of brain age prediction in clinical settings, where re-training or fine-tuning is often unfeasible. The SynthBA source code and pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/LemuelPuglisi/SynthBA.</description>

      <title>Dual Hyperspectral Mamba for Efficient Spectral Compressive Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep unfolding methods have made impressive progress in restoring 3D hyperspectral images (HSIs) from 2D measurements through convolution neural networks or Transformers in spectral compressive imaging. However, they cannot efficiently capture long-range dependencies using global receptive fields, which significantly limits their performance in HSI reconstruction. Moreover, these methods may suffer from local context neglect if we directly utilize Mamba to unfold a 2D feature map as a 1D sequence for modeling global long-range dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Dual Hyperspectral Mamba (DHM) to explore both global long-range dependencies and local contexts for efficient HSI reconstruction. After learning informative parameters to estimate degradation patterns of the CASSI system, we use them to scale the linear projection and offer noise level for the denoiser (i.e., our proposed DHM). Specifically, our DHM consists of multiple dual hyperspectral S4 blocks (DHSBs) to restore original HSIs. Particularly, each DHSB contains a global hyperspectral S4 block (GHSB) to model long-range dependencies across the entire high-resolution HSIs using global receptive fields, and a local hyperspectral S4 block (LHSB) to address local context neglect by establishing structured state-space sequence (S4) models within local windows. Experiments verify the benefits of our DHM for HSI reconstruction. The source codes and models will be available at https://github.com/JiahuaDong/DHM.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Model-based Deep Learning for Dual-Energy Computed Tomography Material Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual energy X-ray Computed Tomography (DECT) enables to automatically decompose materials in clinical images without the manual segmentation using the dependency of the X-ray linear attenuation with energy. In this work we propose a deep learning procedure called End-to-End Material Decomposition (E2E-DEcomp) for quantitative material decomposition which directly convert the CT projection data into material images. The algorithm is based on incorporating the knowledge of the spectral model DECT system into the deep learning training loss and combining a data-learned prior in the material image domain. Furthermore, the training does not require any energy-based images in the dataset but rather only sinogram and material images. We show the effectiveness of the proposed direct E2E-DEcomp method on the AAPM spectral CT dataset (Sidky and Pan, 2023) compared with state of the art supervised deep learning networks.</description>

      <title>TacShade A New 3D-printed Soft Optical Tactile Sensor Based on Light, Shadow and Greyscale for Shape Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the TacShade a newly designed 3D-printed soft optical tactile sensor. The sensor is developed for shape reconstruction under the inspiration of sketch drawing that uses the density of sketch lines to draw light and shadow, resulting in the creation of a 3D-view effect. TacShade, building upon the strengths of the TacTip, a single-camera tactile sensor of large in-depth deformation and being sensitive to edge and surface following, improves the structure in that the markers are distributed within the gap of papillae pins. Variations in light, dark, and grey effects can be generated inside the sensor through external contact interactions. The contours of the contacting objects are outlined by white markers, while the contact depth characteristics can be indirectly obtained from the distribution of black pins and white markers, creating a 2.5D visualization. Based on the imaging effect, we improve the Shape from Shading (SFS) algorithm to process tactile images, enabling a coarse but fast reconstruction for the contact objects. Two experiments are performed. The first verifies TacShade s ability to reconstruct the shape of the contact objects through one image for object distinction. The second experiment shows the shape reconstruction capability of TacShade for a large panel with ridged patterns based on the location of robots and image splicing technology.</description>

      <title>SAM-VMNet: Deep Neural Networks For Coronary Angiography Vessel Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the most prevalent diseases in the cardiovascular field and one of the major contributors to death worldwide. Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) images are regarded as the authoritative standard for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease, and by performing vessel segmentation and stenosis detection on CTA images, physicians are able to diagnose coronary artery disease more accurately. In order to combine the advantages of both the base model and the domain-specific model, and to achieve high-precision and fully-automatic segmentation and detection with a limited number of training samples, we propose a novel architecture, SAM-VMNet, which combines the powerful feature extraction capability of MedSAM with the advantage of the linear complexity of the visual state-space model of VM-UNet, giving it faster inferences than Vision Transformer with faster inference speed and stronger data processing capability, achieving higher segmentation accuracy and stability for CTA images. Experimental results show that the SAM-VMNet architecture performs excellently in the CTA image segmentation task, with a segmentation accuracy of up to 98.32% and a sensitivity of up to 99.33%, which is significantly better than other existing models and has stronger domain adaptability. Comprehensive evaluation of the CTA image segmentation task shows that SAM-VMNet accurately extracts the vascular trunks and capillaries, demonstrating its great potential and wide range of application scenarios for the vascular segmentation task, and also laying a solid foundation for further stenosis detection.</description>

      <title>Length-scale study in deep learning prediction for non-small cell lung cancer brain metastasis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning assisted digital pathology has the potential to impact clinical practice in significant ways. In recent studies, deep neural network (DNN) enabled analysis outperforms human pathologists. Increasing sizes and complexity of the DNN architecture generally improves performance at the cost of DNN's explainability. For pathology, this lack of DNN explainability is particularly problematic as it hinders the broader clinical interpretation of the pathology features that may provide physiological disease insights. To better assess the features that DNN uses in developing predictive algorithms to interpret digital microscopic images, we sought to understand the role of resolution and tissue scale and here describe a novel method for studying the predictive feature length-scale that underpins a DNN's predictive power. We applied the method to study a DNN's predictive capability in the case example of brain metastasis prediction from early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer biopsy slides. The study highlights the DNN attention in the brain metastasis prediction targeting both cellular scale (resolution) and tissue scale features on H&amp;E-stained histological whole slide images. At the cellular scale, we see that DNN's predictive power is progressively increased at higher resolution (i.e., lower resolvable feature length) and is largely lost when the resolvable feature length is longer than 5 microns. In addition, DNN uses more macro-scale features (maximal feature length) associated with tissue organization/architecture and is optimized when assessing visual fields larger than 41 microns. This study for the first time demonstrates the length-scale requirements necessary for optimal DNN learning on digital whole slide images.</description>

      <title>An Early Investigation into the Utility of Multimodal Large Language Models in Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have spurred significant interest in their potential applications across various medical imaging domains. On the one hand, there is a temptation to use these generative models to synthesize realistic-looking medical image data, while on the other hand, the ability to identify synthetic image data in a pool of data is also significantly important. In this study, we explore the potential of the Gemini (\textit{gemini-1.0-pro-vision-latest}) and GPT-4V (gpt-4-vision-preview) models for medical image analysis using two modalities of medical image data. Utilizing synthetic and real imaging data, both Gemini AI and GPT-4V are first used to classify real versus synthetic images, followed by an interpretation and analysis of the input images. Experimental results demonstrate that both Gemini and GPT-4 could perform some interpretation of the input images. In this specific experiment, Gemini was able to perform slightly better than the GPT-4V on the classification task. In contrast, responses associated with GPT-4V were mostly generic in nature. Our early investigation presented in this work provides insights into the potential of MLLMs to assist with the classification and interpretation of retinal fundoscopy and lung X-ray images. We also identify key limitations associated with the early investigation study on MLLMs for specialized tasks in medical image analysis.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Frequency Correlation for Hyperspectral Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep priors have emerged as potent methods in hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction. While most methods emphasize space-domain learning using image space priors like non-local similarity, frequency-domain learning using image frequency priors remains neglected, limiting the reconstruction capability of networks. In this paper, we first propose a Hyperspectral Frequency Correlation (HFC) prior rooted in in-depth statistical frequency analyses of existent HSI datasets. Leveraging the HFC prior, we subsequently establish the frequency domain learning composed of a Spectral-wise self-Attention of Frequency (SAF) and a Spectral-spatial Interaction of Frequency (SIF) targeting low-frequency and high-frequency components, respectively. The outputs of SAF and SIF are adaptively merged by a learnable gating filter, thus achieving a thorough exploitation of image frequency priors. Integrating the frequency domain learning and the existing space domain learning, we finally develop the Correlation-driven Mixing Domains Transformer (CMDT) for HSI reconstruction. Extensive experiments highlight that our method surpasses various state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in reconstruction quality and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Once-for-All: Controllable Generative Image Compression with Dynamic Granularity Adaption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although recent generative image compression methods have demonstrated impressive potential in optimizing the rate-distortion-perception trade-off, they still face the critical challenge of flexible rate adaption to diverse compression necessities and scenarios. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a Controllable Generative Image Compression framework, Control-GIC, the first capable of fine-grained bitrate adaption across a broad spectrum while ensuring high-fidelity and generality compression. We base Control-GIC on a VQGAN framework representing an image as a sequence of variable-length codes (i.e. VQ-indices), which can be losslessly compressed and exhibits a direct positive correlation with the bitrates. Therefore, drawing inspiration from the classical coding principle, we naturally correlate the information density of local image patches with their granular representations, to achieve dynamic adjustment of the code quantity following different granularity decisions. This implies we can flexibly determine a proper allocation of granularity for the patches to acquire desirable compression rates. We further develop a probabilistic conditional decoder that can trace back to historic encoded multi-granularity representations according to transmitted codes, and then reconstruct hierarchical granular features in the formalization of conditional probability, enabling more informative aggregation to improve reconstruction realism. Our experiments show that Control-GIC allows highly flexible and controllable bitrate adaption and even once compression on an entire dataset to fulfill constrained bitrate conditions. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance over recent state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Streaming quanta sensors for online, high-performance imaging and vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently quanta image sensors (QIS) -- ultra-fast, zero-read-noise binary image sensors -- have demonstrated remarkable imaging capabilities in many challenging scenarios. Despite their potential, the adoption of these sensors is severely hampered by (a) high data rates and (b) the need for new computational pipelines to handle the unconventional raw data. We introduce a simple, low-bandwidth computational pipeline to address these challenges. Our approach is based on a novel streaming representation with a small memory footprint, efficiently capturing intensity information at multiple temporal scales. Updating the representation requires only 16 floating-point operations/pixel, which can be efficiently computed online at the native frame rate of the binary frames. We use a neural network operating on this representation to reconstruct videos in real-time (10-30 fps). We illustrate why such representation is well-suited for these emerging sensors, and how it offers low latency and high frame rate while retaining flexibility for downstream computer vision. Our approach results in significant data bandwidth reductions ~100X and real-time image reconstruction and computer vision -- $10^4$-$10^5$ reduction in computation than existing state-of-the-art approach while maintaining comparable quality. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to achieve online, real-time image reconstruction on QIS.</description>

      <title>Patch-Based Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Automatic Transmitted Light to Fluorescence Imaging Transition: Contribution to the LightMyCells Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic prediction of fluorescently labeled organelles from label-free transmitted light input images is an important, yet difficult task. The traditional way to obtain fluorescence images is related to performing biochemical labeling which is time-consuming and costly. Therefore, an automatic algorithm to perform the task based on the label-free transmitted light microscopy could be strongly beneficial. The importance of the task motivated researchers from the France-BioImaging to organize the LightMyCells challenge where the goal is to propose an algorithm that automatically predicts the fluorescently labeled nucleus, mitochondria, tubulin, and actin, based on the input consisting of bright field, phase contrast, or differential interference contrast microscopic images. In this work, we present the contribution of the AGHSSO team based on a carefully prepared and trained encoder-decoder deep neural network that achieves a considerable score in the challenge, being placed among the best-performing teams.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is pivotal in various medical diagnoses due to its non-invasive nature and safety. In clinical practice, the accuracy and precision of ultrasound image analysis are critical. Recent advancements in deep learning are showing great capacity of processing medical images. However, the data hungry nature of deep learning and the shortage of high-quality ultrasound image training data suppress the development of deep learning based ultrasound analysis methods. To address these challenges, we introduce an advanced deep learning model, dubbed S-CycleGAN, which generates high-quality synthetic ultrasound images from computed tomography (CT) data. This model incorporates semantic discriminators within a CycleGAN framework to ensure that critical anatomical details are preserved during the style transfer process. The synthetic images produced are used to augment training datasets for semantic segmentation models and robot-assisted ultrasound scanning system development, enhancing their ability to accurately parse real ultrasound imagery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we proposed large selective kernel and sparse attention network (LSKSANet) for remote sensing image semantic segmentation. The LSKSANet is a lightweight network that effectively combines convolution with sparse attention mechanisms. Specifically, we design large selective kernel module to decomposing the large kernel into a series of depth-wise convolutions with progressively increasing dilation rates, thereby expanding the receptive field without significantly increasing the computational burden. In addition, we introduce the sparse attention to keep the most useful self-attention values for better feature aggregation. Experimental results on the Vaihingen and Postdam datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed LSKSANet over state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Boosting Spatial-Spectral Masked Auto-Encoder Through Mining Redundant Spectra for HSI-SAR/LiDAR Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although recent masked image modeling (MIM)-based HSI-LiDAR/SAR classification methods have gradually recognized the importance of the spectral information, they have not adequately addressed the redundancy among different spectra, resulting in information leakage during the pretraining stage. This issue directly impairs the representation ability of the model. To tackle the problem, we propose a new strategy, named Mining Redundant Spectra (MRS). Unlike randomly masking spectral bands, MRS selectively masks them by similarity to increase the reconstruction difficulty. Specifically, a random spectral band is chosen during pretraining, and the selected and highly similar bands are masked. Experimental results demonstrate that employing the MRS strategy during the pretraining stage effectively improves the accuracy of existing MIM-based methods on the Berlin and Houston 2018 datasets.</description>

      <title>Arctic Sea Ice Image Super-Resolution Based on Multi-Scale Convolution and Dual-Gating Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arctic Sea Ice Concentration (SIC) is the ratio of ice-covered area to the total sea area of the Arctic Ocean, which is a key indicator for maritime activities. Nowadays, we often use passive microwave images to display SIC, but it has low spatial resolution, and most of the existing super-resolution methods of Arctic SIC don't take the integration of spatial and channel features into account and can't effectively integrate the multi-scale feature. To overcome the aforementioned issues, we propose MFM-Net for Arctic SIC super-resolution, which concurrently aggregates multi-scale information while integrating spatial and channel features. Extensive experiments on Arctic SIC dataset from the AMSR-E/AMSR-2 SIC DT-ASI products from Ocean University of China validate the effectiveness of porposed MFM-Net.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-source remote sensing data classification has emerged as a prominent research topic with the advancement of various sensors. Existing multi-source data classification methods are susceptible to irrelevant information interference during multi-source feature extraction and fusion. To solve this issue, we propose a sparse focus network for multi-source data classification. Sparse attention is employed in Transformer block for HSI and SAR/LiDAR feature extraction, thereby the most useful self-attention values are maintained for better feature aggregation. Furthermore, cross-attention is used to enhance multi-source feature interactions, and further improves the efficiency of cross-modal feature fusion. Experimental results on the Berlin and Houston2018 datasets highlight the effectiveness of SF-Net, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Dynamic CT Image Reconstruction with Neural Fields Through Explicit Motion Regularizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image reconstruction for dynamic inverse problems with highly undersampled data poses a major challenge: not accounting for the dynamics of the process leads to a non-realistic motion with no time regularity. Variational approaches that penalize time derivatives or introduce motion model regularizers have been proposed to relate subsequent frames and improve image quality using grid-based discretization. Neural fields offer an alternative parametrization of the desired spatiotemporal quantity with a deep neural network, a lightweight, continuous, and biased towards smoothness representation. The inductive bias has been exploited to enforce time regularity for dynamic inverse problems resulting in neural fields optimized by minimizing a data-fidelity term only. In this paper we investigate and show the benefits of introducing explicit PDE-based motion regularizers, namely, the optical flow equation, in 2D+time computed tomography for the optimization of neural fields. We also compare neural fields against a grid-based solver and show that the former outperforms the latter.</description>

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) models have been successfully applied to many applications including biomedical cell segmentation and classification in histological images. These models require large amounts of annotated data which might not always be available, especially in the medical field where annotations are scarce and expensive. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel pipeline for generating synthetic datasets for cell segmentation. Given only a handful of annotated images, our method generates a large dataset of images which can be used to effectively train DL instance segmentation models. Our solution is designed to generate cells of realistic shapes and placement by allowing experts to incorporate domain knowledge during the generation of the dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00571v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on transformed $\ell_1$ regularization, transformed total variation (TTV) has robust image recovery that is competitive with other nonconvex total variation (TV) regularizers, such as TV$^p$, $0&lt;p&lt;1$. Inspired by its performance, we propose a TTV-regularized Mumford--Shah model with fuzzy membership function for image segmentation. To solve it, we design an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm that utilizes the transformed $\ell_1$ proximal operator. Numerical experiments demonstrate that using TTV is more effective than classical TV and other nonconvex TV variants in image segmentation.</description>

      <title>Towards Point Cloud Compression for Machine Perception: A Simple and Strong Baseline by Learning the Octree Depth Level Predictor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point cloud compression has garnered significant interest in computer vision. However, existing algorithms primarily cater to human vision, while most point cloud data is utilized for machine vision tasks. To address this, we propose a point cloud compression framework that simultaneously handles both human and machine vision tasks. Our framework learns a scalable bit-stream, using only subsets for different machine vision tasks to save bit-rate, while employing the entire bit-stream for human vision tasks. Building on mainstream octree-based frameworks like VoxelContext-Net, OctAttention, and G-PCC, we introduce a new octree depth-level predictor. This predictor adaptively determines the optimal depth level for each octree constructed from a point cloud, controlling the bit-rate for machine vision tasks. For simpler tasks (\textit{e.g.}, classification) or objects/scenarios, we use fewer depth levels with fewer bits, saving bit-rate. Conversely, for more complex tasks (\textit{e.g}., segmentation) or objects/scenarios, we use deeper depth levels with more bits to enhance performance. Experimental results on various datasets (\textit{e.g}., ModelNet10, ModelNet40, ShapeNet, ScanNet, and KITTI) show that our point cloud compression approach improves performance for machine vision tasks without compromising human vision quality.</description>

Abstract: The current variants of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), which include the original SAM and Medical SAM, still lack the capability to produce sufficiently accurate segmentation for medical images. In medical imaging contexts, it is not uncommon for human experts to rectify segmentations of specific test samples after SAM generates its segmentation predictions. These rectifications typically entail manual or semi-manual corrections employing state-of-the-art annotation tools. Motivated by this process, we introduce a novel approach that leverages the advantages of online machine learning to enhance Segment Anything (SA) during test time. We employ rectified annotations to perform online learning, with the aim of improving the segmentation quality of SA on medical images. To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of online learning when integrated with large-scale vision models like SAM, we propose a new method called Auxiliary Online Learning (AuxOL). AuxOL creates and applies a small auxiliary model (specialist) in conjunction with SAM (generalist), entails adaptive online-batch and adaptive segmentation fusion. Experiments conducted on eight datasets covering four medical imaging modalities validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our work proposes and validates a new, practical, and effective approach for enhancing SA on downstream segmentation tasks (e.g., medical image segmentation).</description>

      <title>Capsule Enhanced Variational AutoEncoder for Underwater Image Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Underwater image analysis is crucial for marine monitoring. However, it presents two major challenges (i) the visual quality of the images is often degraded due to wavelength-dependent light attenuation, scattering, and water types; (ii) capturing and storing high-resolution images is limited by hardware, which hinders long-term environmental analyses. Recently, deep neural networks have been introduced for underwater enhancement yet neglecting the challenge posed by the limitations of autonomous underwater image acquisition systems. We introduce a novel architecture that jointly tackles both issues by drawing inspiration from the discrete features quantization approach of Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (\myVQVAE). Our model combines an encoding network, that compresses the input into a latent representation, with two independent decoding networks, that enhance/reconstruct images using only the latent representation. One decoder focuses on the spatial information while the other captures information about the entities in the image by leveraging the concept of capsules. With the usage of capsule layers, we also overcome the differentiabilty issues of \myVQVAE making our solution trainable in an end-to-end fashion without the need for particular optimization tricks. Capsules perform feature quantization in a fully differentiable manner. We conducted thorough quantitative and qualitative evaluations on 6 benchmark datasets to assess the effectiveness of our contributions. Results demonstrate that we perform better than existing methods (eg, about $+1.4dB$ gain on the challenging LSUI Test-L400 dataset), while significantly reducing the amount of space needed for data storage (ie, $3\times$ more efficient).</description>

Abstract: Cancer diseases constitute one of the most significant societal challenges. In this paper, we introduce a novel histopathological dataset for prostate cancer detection. The proposed dataset, consisting of over 2.6 million tissue patches extracted from 430 fully annotated scans, 4675 scans with assigned binary diagnoses, and 46 scans with diagnoses independently provided by a group of histopathologists can be found at https://github.com/michalkoziarski/DiagSet. Furthermore, we propose a machine learning framework for detection of cancerous tissue regions and prediction of scan-level diagnosis, utilizing thresholding to abstain from the decision in uncertain cases. The proposed approach, composed of ensembles of deep neural networks operating on the histopathological scans at different scales, achieves 94.6% accuracy in patch-level recognition and is compared in a scan-level diagnosis with 9 human histopathologists showing high statistical agreement.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Low-dose CT Reconstruction via Bayesian Uncertainty Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) image reconstruction techniques can reduce patient radiation exposure while maintaining acceptable imaging quality. Deep learning is widely used in this problem, but the performance of testing data (a.k.a. target domain) is often degraded in clinical scenarios due to the variations that were not encountered in training data (a.k.a. source domain). Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) of LDCT reconstruction has been proposed to solve this problem through distribution alignment. However, existing UDA methods fail to explore the usage of uncertainty quantification, which is crucial for reliable intelligent medical systems in clinical scenarios with unexpected variations. Moreover, existing direct alignment for different patients would lead to content mismatch issues. To address these issues, we propose to leverage a probabilistic reconstruction framework to conduct a joint discrepancy minimization between source and target domains in both the latent and image spaces. In the latent space, we devise a Bayesian uncertainty alignment to reduce the epistemic gap between the two domains. This approach reduces the uncertainty level of target domain data, making it more likely to render well-reconstructed results on target domains. In the image space, we propose a sharpness-aware distribution alignment to achieve a match of second-order information, which can ensure that the reconstructed images from the target domain have similar sharpness to normal-dose CT images from the source domain. Experimental results on two simulated datasets and one clinical low-dose imaging dataset show that our proposed method outperforms other methods in quantitative and visualized performance.</description>

      <title>MedNeXt: Transformer-driven Scaling of ConvNets for Medical Image Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09975v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been exploding interest in embracing Transformer-based architectures for medical image segmentation. However, the lack of large-scale annotated medical datasets make achieving performances equivalent to those in natural images challenging. Convolutional networks, in contrast, have higher inductive biases and consequently, are easily trainable to high performance. Recently, the ConvNeXt architecture attempted to modernize the standard ConvNet by mirroring Transformer blocks. In this work, we improve upon this to design a modernized and scalable convolutional architecture customized to challenges of data-scarce medical settings. We introduce MedNeXt, a Transformer-inspired large kernel segmentation network which introduces - 1) A fully ConvNeXt 3D Encoder-Decoder Network for medical image segmentation, 2) Residual ConvNeXt up and downsampling blocks to preserve semantic richness across scales, 3) A novel technique to iteratively increase kernel sizes by upsampling small kernel networks, to prevent performance saturation on limited medical data, 4) Compound scaling at multiple levels (depth, width, kernel size) of MedNeXt. This leads to state-of-the-art performance on 4 tasks on CT and MRI modalities and varying dataset sizes, representing a modernized deep architecture for medical image segmentation. Our code is made publicly available at: https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/MedNeXt.</description>

      <title>The Multiscale Surface Vision Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface meshes are a favoured domain for representing structural and functional information on the human cortex, but their complex topology and geometry pose significant challenges for deep learning analysis. While Transformers have excelled as domain-agnostic architectures for sequence-to-sequence learning, the quadratic cost of the self-attention operation remains an obstacle for many dense prediction tasks. Inspired by some of the latest advances in hierarchical modelling with vision transformers, we introduce the Multiscale Surface Vision Transformer (MS-SiT) as a backbone architecture for surface deep learning. The self-attention mechanism is applied within local-mesh-windows to allow for high-resolution sampling of the underlying data, while a shifted-window strategy improves the sharing of information between windows. Neighbouring patches are successively merged, allowing the MS-SiT to learn hierarchical representations suitable for any prediction task. Results demonstrate that the MS-SiT outperforms existing surface deep learning methods for neonatal phenotyping prediction tasks using the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) dataset. Furthermore, building the MS-SiT backbone into a U-shaped architecture for surface segmentation demonstrates competitive results on cortical parcellation using the UK Biobank (UKB) and manually-annotated MindBoggle datasets. Code and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/metrics-lab/surface-vision-transformers.</description>

      <title>Domain Transfer Through Image-to-Image Translation for Uncertainty-Aware Prostate Cancer Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prostate Cancer (PCa) is a prevalent disease among men, and multi-parametric MRIs offer a non-invasive method for its detection. While MRI-based deep learning solutions have shown promise in supporting PCa diagnosis, acquiring sufficient training data, particularly in local clinics remains challenging. One potential solution is to take advantage of publicly available datasets to pre-train deep models and fine-tune them on the local data, but multi-source MRIs can pose challenges due to cross-domain distribution differences. These limitations hinder the adoption of explainable and reliable deep-learning solutions in local clinics for PCa diagnosis. In this work, we present a novel approach for unpaired image-to-image translation of prostate multi-parametric MRIs and an uncertainty-aware training approach for classifying clinically significant PCa, to be applied in data-constrained settings such as local and small clinics. Our approach involves a novel pipeline for translating unpaired 3.0T multi-parametric prostate MRIs to 1.5T, thereby augmenting the available training data. Additionally, we introduce an evidential deep learning approach to estimate model uncertainty and employ dataset filtering techniques during training. Furthermore, we propose a simple, yet efficient Evidential Focal Loss, combining focal loss with evidential uncertainty, to train our model effectively. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) by over 20% compared to the previous work.

      <title>Enhancing Super-Resolution Networks through Realistic Thick-Slice CT Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10182v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning-based Generative Models have the potential to convert low-resolution CT images into high-resolution counterparts without long acquisition times and increased radiation exposure in thin-slice CT imaging. However, procuring appropriate training data for these Super-Resolution (SR) models is challenging. Previous SR research has simulated thick-slice CT images from thin-slice CT images to create training pairs. However, these methods either rely on simplistic interpolation techniques that lack realism or sinogram reconstruction, which require the release of raw data and complex reconstruction algorithms. Thus, we introduce a simple yet realistic method to generate thick CT images from thin-slice CT images, facilitating the creation of training pairs for SR algorithms. The training pairs produced by our method closely resemble real data distributions (PSNR=49.74 vs. 40.66, p$&lt;$0.05). A multivariate Cox regression analysis involving thick slice CT images with lung fibrosis revealed that only the radiomics features extracted using our method demonstrated a significant correlation with mortality (HR=1.19 and HR=1.14, p$&lt;$0.005). This paper represents the first to identify and address the challenge of generating appropriate paired training data for Deep Learning-based CT SR models, which enhances the efficacy and applicability of SR models in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Encoding of Brain Dynamics with Surface Masked Autoencoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of robust and generalisable models for encoding the spatio-temporal dynamics of human brain activity is crucial for advancing neuroscientific discoveries. However, significant individual variation in the organisation of the human cerebral cortex makes it difficult to identify population-level trends in these signals. Recently, Surface Vision Transformers (SiTs) have emerged as a promising approach for modelling cortical signals, yet they face some limitations in low-data scenarios due to the lack of inductive biases in their architecture. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the surface Masked AutoEncoder (sMAE) and video surface Masked AutoEncoder (vsMAE) - for multivariate and spatio-temporal pre-training of cortical signals over regular icosahedral grids. These models are trained to reconstruct cortical feature maps from masked versions of the input by learning strong latent representations of cortical structure and function. Such representations translate into better modelling of individual phenotypes and enhanced performance in downstream tasks. The proposed approach was evaluated on cortical phenotype regression using data from the young adult Human Connectome Project (HCP) and developing HCP (dHCP). Results show that (v)sMAE pre-trained models improve phenotyping prediction performance on multiple tasks by $\ge 26\%$, and offer faster convergence relative to models trained from scratch. Finally, we show that pre-training vision transformers on large datasets, such as the UK Biobank (UKB), supports transfer learning to low-data regimes. Our code and pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/metrics-lab/surface-masked-autoencoders .</description>

      <title>HemoSet: The First Blood Segmentation Dataset for Automation of Hemostasis Management</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hemorrhaging occurs in surgeries of all types, forcing surgeons to quickly adapt to the visual interference that results from blood rapidly filling the surgical field. Introducing automation into the crucial surgical task of hemostasis management would offload mental and physical tasks from the surgeon and surgical assistants while simultaneously increasing the efficiency and safety of the operation. The first step in automation of hemostasis management is detection of blood in the surgical field. To propel the development of blood detection algorithms in surgeries, we present HemoSet, the first blood segmentation dataset based on bleeding during a live animal robotic surgery. Our dataset features vessel hemorrhage scenarios where turbulent flow leads to abnormal pooling geometries in surgical fields. These pools are formed in conditions endemic to surgical procedures -- uneven heterogeneous tissue, under glossy lighting conditions and rapid tool movement. We benchmark several state-of-the-art segmentation models and provide insight into the difficulties specific to blood detection. We intend for HemoSet to spur development of autonomous blood suction tools by providing a platform for training and refining blood segmentation models, addressing the precision needed for such robotics.</description>

      <title>Automatic Cranial Defect Reconstruction with Self-Supervised Deep Deformable Masked Autoencoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thousands of people suffer from cranial injuries every year. They require personalized implants that need to be designed and manufactured before the reconstruction surgery. The manual design is expensive and time-consuming leading to searching for algorithms whose goal is to automatize the process. The problem can be formulated as volumetric shape completion and solved by deep neural networks dedicated to supervised image segmentation. However, such an approach requires annotating the ground-truth defects which is costly and time-consuming. Usually, the process is replaced with synthetic defect generation. However, even the synthetic ground-truth generation is time-consuming and limits the data heterogeneity, thus the deep models' generalizability. In our work, we propose an alternative and simple approach to use a self-supervised masked autoencoder to solve the problem. This approach by design increases the heterogeneity of the training set and can be seen as a form of data augmentation. We compare the proposed method with several state-of-the-art deep neural networks and show both the quantitative and qualitative improvement on the SkullBreak and SkullFix datasets. The proposed method can be used to efficiently reconstruct the cranial defects in real time.</description>

Abstract: Binary breast cancer tumor segmentation with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data is typically trained and evaluated on private medical data, which makes comparing deep learning approaches difficult. We propose a benchmark (BC-MRI-SEG) for binary breast cancer tumor segmentation based on publicly available MRI datasets. The benchmark consists of four datasets in total, where two datasets are used for supervised training and evaluation, and two are used for zero-shot evaluation. Additionally we compare state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on our benchmark and provide an exhaustive list of available public breast cancer MRI datasets.

      <description>arXiv:2405.09552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optic nerve head (ONH) detection has been a crucial area of study in ophthalmology for years. However, the significant discrepancy between fundus image datasets, each generated using a single type of fundus camera, poses challenges to the generalizability of ONH detection approaches developed based on semantic segmentation networks. Despite the numerous recent advancements in general-purpose semantic segmentation methods using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, there is currently a lack of benchmarks for these state-of-the-art (SoTA) networks specifically trained for ONH detection. Therefore, in this article, we make contributions from three key aspects: network design, the publication of a dataset, and the establishment of a comprehensive benchmark. Our newly developed ONH detection network, referred to as ODFormer, is based upon the Swin Transformer architecture and incorporates two novel components: a multi-scale context aggregator and a lightweight bidirectional feature recalibrator. Our published large-scale dataset, known as TongjiU-DROD, provides multi-resolution fundus images for each participant, captured using two distinct types of cameras. Our established benchmark involves three datasets: DRIONS-DB, DRISHTI-GS1, and TongjiU-DROD, created by researchers from different countries and containing fundus images captured from participants of diverse races and ages. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed ODFormer outperforms other state-of-the-art (SoTA) networks in terms of performance and generalizability. Our dataset and source code are publicly available at mias.group/ODFormer.</description>

Abstract: Virtual Imaging Trials (VIT) offer a cost-effective and scalable approach for evaluating medical imaging technologies. Computational phantoms, which mimic real patient anatomy and physiology, play a central role in VIT. However, the current libraries of computational phantoms face limitations, particularly in terms of sample size and diversity. Insufficient representation of the population hampers accurate assessment of imaging technologies across different patient groups. Traditionally, phantoms were created by manual segmentation, which is a laborious and time-consuming task, impeding the expansion of phantom libraries. This study presents a framework for realistic computational phantom modeling using a suite of four deep learning segmentation models, followed by three forms of automated organ segmentation quality control. Over 2500 computational phantoms with up to 140 structures illustrating a sophisticated approach to detailed anatomical modeling are released. Phantoms are available in both voxelized and surface mesh formats. The framework is aggregated with an in-house CT scanner simulator to produce realistic CT images. The framework can potentially advance virtual imaging trials, facilitating comprehensive and reliable evaluations of medical imaging technologies. Phantoms may be requested at https://cvit.duke.edu/resources/, code, model weights, and sample CT images are available at https://xcat-3.github.io.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has become a key technology for non-invasive quality evaluation in various fields, offering detailed insights through spatial and spectral data. Despite its efficacy, the complexity and high cost of HSI systems have hindered their widespread adoption. This study addressed these challenges by exploring deep learning-based hyperspectral image reconstruction from RGB (Red, Green, Blue) images, particularly for agricultural products. Specifically, different hyperspectral reconstruction algorithms, such as Hyperspectral Convolutional Neural Network - Dense (HSCNN-D), High-Resolution Network (HRNET), and Multi-Scale Transformer Plus Plus (MST++), were compared to assess the dry matter content of sweet potatoes. Among the tested reconstruction methods, HRNET demonstrated superior performance, achieving the lowest mean relative absolute error (MRAE) of 0.07, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.03, and the highest peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 32.28 decibels (dB). Some key features were selected using the genetic algorithm (GA), and their importance was interpreted using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Partial least squares regression (PLSR) models were developed using the RGB, reconstructed, and ground truth (GT) data. The visual and spectra quality of these reconstructed methods was compared with GT data, and predicted maps were generated. The results revealed the prospect of deep learning-based hyperspectral image reconstruction as a cost-effective and efficient quality assessment tool for agricultural and biological applications.</description>

      <title>I$^2$VC: A Unified Framework for Intra- &amp; Inter-frame Video Compression</title>

Abstract: Video compression aims to reconstruct seamless frames by encoding the motion and residual information from existing frames. Previous neural video compression methods necessitate distinct codecs for three types of frames (I-frame, P-frame and B-frame), which hinders a unified approach and generalization across different video contexts. Intra-codec techniques lack the advanced Motion Estimation and Motion Compensation (MEMC) found in inter-codec, leading to fragmented frameworks lacking uniformity. Our proposed Intra- &amp; Inter-frame Video Compression (I$^2$VC) framework employs a single spatio-temporal codec that guides feature compression rates according to content importance. This unified codec transforms the dependence across frames into a conditional coding scheme, thus integrating intra- and inter-frame compression into one cohesive strategy. Given the absence of explicit motion data, achieving competent inter-frame compression with only a conditional codec poses a challenge. To resolve this, our approach includes an implicit inter-frame alignment mechanism. With the pre-trained diffusion denoising process, the utilization of a diffusion-inverted reference feature rather than random noise supports the initial compression state. This process allows for selective denoising of motion-rich regions based on decoded features, facilitating accurate alignment without the need for MEMC. Our experimental findings, across various compression configurations (AI, LD and RA) and frame types, prove that I$^2$VC outperforms the state-of-the-art perceptual learned codecs. Impressively, it exhibits a 58.4% enhancement in perceptual reconstruction performance when benchmarked against the H.266/VVC standard (VTM).

      <title>UU-Mamba: Uncertainty-aware U-Mamba for Cardiac Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17496</link>

Abstract: Biomedical image segmentation is critical for accurate identification and analysis of anatomical structures in medical imaging, particularly in cardiac MRI. Manual segmentation is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to errors, highlighting the need for automated methods. However, current machine learning approaches face challenges like overfitting and data demands. To tackle these issues, we propose a new UU-Mamba model, integrating the U-Mamba model with the Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) optimizer and an uncertainty-aware loss function. SAM enhances generalization by locating flat minima in the loss landscape, thus reducing overfitting. The uncertainty-aware loss combines region-based, distribution-based, and pixel-based loss designs to improve segmentation accuracy and robustness. Evaluation of our method is performed on the ACDC cardiac dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art models including TransUNet, Swin-Unet, nnUNet, and nnFormer. Our approach achieves Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) scores, demonstrating its effectiveness in cardiac MRI segmentation.</description>

      <title>Octonion Phase Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Signal processing over hypercomplex numbers arises in many optical imaging applications. In particular, spectral image or color stereo data are often processed using octonion algebra. Recently, the eight-band multispectral image phase recovery has gained salience, wherein it is desired to recover the eight bands from the phaseless measurements. In this paper, we tackle this hitherto unaddressed hypercomplex variant of the popular phase retrieval (PR) problem. We propose octonion Wirtinger flow (OWF) to recover an octonion signal from its intensity-only observation. However, contrary to the complex-valued Wirtinger flow, the non-associative nature of octonion algebra and the consequent lack of octonion derivatives make the extension to OWF non-trivial. We resolve this using the pseudo-real-matrix representation of octonion to perform the derivatives in each OWF update. We demonstrate that our approach recovers the octonion signal up to a right-octonion phase factor. Numerical experiments validate OWF-based PR with high accuracy under both noiseless and noisy measurements.</description>
