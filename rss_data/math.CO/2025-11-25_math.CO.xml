      <title>Distance spectral radius for a graph to be k-critical with respect to [1,b]-odd factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph, and let $b$ and $k$ be two positive integers with $b\equiv1$ (mod 2). A $[1,b]$-odd factor of $G$ is a spanning subgraph $F$ of $G$ with $d_F(v)\equiv1$ (mod 2) and $1\leq d_F(v)\leq b$ for every $v\in V(G)$. A graph $G$ is called $k$-critical with respect to $[1,b]$-odd factor if $G-X$ contains a $[1,b]$-odd factor for every $X\subseteq V(G)$ with $|X|=k$. Let $\mathcal{D}(G)$ denote the distance matrix of $G$. The largest eigenvalue of $\mathcal{D}(G)$, denoted by $\mu(G)$, is called the distance spectral radius of $G$. In this paper, we prove an upper bound for $\mu(G)$ in a connected graph $G$ which guarantees $G$ to be $k$-critical with respect to $[1,b]$-odd factor.</description>

      <title>Three formulas for CSM classes of open quiver loci</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the space of equioriented type $A$ quiver representations, placing strict rank conditions on the maps cuts out subvarieties that we call "open quiver loci." Their closures are the quiver loci, whose equivariant cohomology classes are the quiver polynomials of Buch and Fulton. We present a geometric and a combinatorial formula to compute equivariant Chern--Schwartz--MacPherson (CSM) classes of open quiver loci. These classes naturally associate an element of equivariant cohomology to each open quiver locus, and they include the data of the quiver polynomials, along with additional data about Euler characteristic. The combinatorial formula is in terms of "chained generic pipe dreams," which modify the pipe dreams of Fomin and Kirillov to more strongly resemble the lacing diagrams developed by Knutson-Miller-Shimozono. We also present three new formulas for quiver polynomials, two of which are combinatorial; these are streamlined versions of the previously known Knutson-Miller-Shimozono formulas, in the sense that they contain fewer terms.</description>

      <title>Some observations on bent and planar functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the graph of a bent function is a Salem set in an appropriate sense. We also establish a simple result that quantifies redundancies in the difference operators of a function, which applies to bent functions over fields of odd characteristic via their equivalence to perfect non-linear functions in that setting. We end by demonstrating, by entirely elementary means, that the distance between two distinct planar functions must be at least two.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Frameproof Codes and Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frameproof codes are a class of secure codes introduced by Boneh and Shaw in the context of digital fingerprinting, and have been widely studied from a combinatorial point of view. In this paper, we study a quantitative extension of frameproof codes and hypergraphs, referred to as {\it quantitative frameproof codes and hypergraphs}. We give asymptotically optimal bounds on the maximum sizes of these structures and determine their exact sizes for a broad range of parameters. In particular, we introduce a generalized version of the Erd\H{o}s matching number in our proof and derive relevant estimates for it.</description>

      <title>A new proof of an E\u{g}ecio\u{g}lu--Remmel inverse Kostka matrix problem via a Garsia--Milne involution involving Sym and NSym</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: E\u{g}ecio\u{g}lu and Remmel provide a combinatorial proof (using special rim hook tableaux) that the product of the Kostka matrix $K$ and its inverse $K^{-1}$ equals the identity matrix $I$. They then pose the problem of proving the reverse identity $K^{-1}K =I$ combinatorially. Sagan and Lee prove a special case of this identity using overlapping special rim hook tableaux. Loehr and Mendes provide a full proof using bijective matrix algebra that relies on the E\u{g}ecio\u{g}lu--Remmel map. In this article, we solve the problem in full generality independent of the E\u{g}ecio\u{g}lu--Remmel bijection. To do this, we start by proving NSym versions of both Kostka matrix identities using sign-reversing involutions involving the tunnel hook coverings recently introduced by the first and third authors. Then we modify our sign-reversing involutions to reduce to Sym. Finally, we show that our bijection is different than the Loehr and Mendes result by constructing an injective map between special rim tableaux and the symmetric group $S_n.$</description>

      <title>On zero-sum problems over metacyclic groups $C_n \rtimes_s C_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group. A finite collection of elements from $G$, where the order is disregarded and repetitions are allowed, is said to be a product-one sequence if its elements can be ordered such that their product in $G$ equals the identity element of $G$. Then, the Gao's constant $\mathsf E (G)$ of $G$ is the smallest integer $\ell$ such that every sequence of length at least $\ell$ has a product-one subsequence of length $|G|$. For a positive integer $n$, we denote by $C_n$ a cyclic group of order $n$. Let $G = C_n \rtimes_s C_2$ with $s^2\equiv 1\pmod n$ be a metacyclic group. The direct and inverse problems of $\mathsf E (G)$ were settled recently, except for the case that $G=C_{3n_2}\rtimes_s C_2$ with $n_2\neq 1$, $\gcd(n_2,6)=1$, $s\equiv -1 \pmod 3$, and $s\equiv 1\pmod {n_2}$. In this paper, we complete the remaining case and hence for all metacyclic groups of the form $G=C_n \rtimes C_2$, the Gao's constant and the associated inverse problem are now fully settled (see Theorem 1.2).</description>

      <title>The automorphism groups and identification of some Generalized Paley Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The family of generalized Paley graphs of prime power order $q$ and degree $(q-1)/k$ is studied. It is shown that the automorphism group of a graph in this family is a subgroup of ${\mathrm{A\Gamma L}}(1,q)$ whenever $q$ is sufficiently large relative to $k$. Furthermore, under the same conditions, the Weisfeiler-Leman dimension of these graphs is proved to be at most $5$. In particular, the same bound holds for the Van Lint-Schrijver graphs.</description>

      <title>Explicit Formulas and Combinatorial Interpretation of Triangular Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the weighted paths to interpret any triangular array of the form
  \[
  T(n,k)=(a_2 n + a_1 k + a_0)\,T(n-1,k)
  + (b_2 n + b_1 k + b_0)\,T(n-1,k-1),
  \]
  allowing a structural analysis of the coefficients $\big(T(n,k)\big)_{n,k\in \mathbb{N}}$.
  This leads to explicit expressions for general $T(n,k)$, with simpler formulas arising in the cases $a_2=0$ or $b_2=0$, as well as in the fully general case.
  Applications include explicit formulas for the $r$-Eulerian numbers and the marked $r$-Eulerian numbers ones. We will write also the case where $b_{n,k}=1$, as a matrix of passage.
  \textbf{Keywords:} triangular recurrence, weighted paths, $r$-Eulerian numbers, combinatorial interpretation.</description>

      <title>Extremality in semidistributive lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish several independent results concerning extremal, left modular, congruence uniform, and semidistributive lattices. An equivalent characterization of left modular lattices is obtained in terms of edge-labellings, together with necessary and sufficient conditions on the doubling steps in the construction of congruence normal lattices that ensure left modularity or extremality. We prove that a congruence uniform lattice is shellable if and only if it is extremal. We answer a question of Barnard by constructing a counterexample showing that an induced subcomplex of a canonical join complex need not itself be such a complex. Finally, we show that the order dimension of a semidistributive extremal lattice equals the chromatic number of the complement of its Galois graph, generalizing a theorem of Dilworth for distributive lattices. As an application, we determine the dimensions of generalizations of the Hochschild lattice, of the parabolic Tamari lattice, and of the lattice of torsion classes of a gentle tree. The latter proves that the $c$-Cambrian lattices of type $\mathbf{A}_n$ have dimension $n$.</description>

      <title>Improved Bounds for the Ultimate Independence Ratio of Odd Wheels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultimate independence ratio of a graph $G$ is defined as $\mathscr{I}(G) = \lim_{k\rightarrow\infty } \frac{\alpha(G^{\Box k})}{|V(G)|^k},$ where $\alpha(G^{\Box k})$ is the independence number of the Cartesian product of $k$ copies of $G$. For all graphs $G$, Hahn, Hell, and Poljak (1995) proved that $\frac{1}{\chi(G)} \leq \mathscr{I}(G) \leq \frac{1}{\omega(G)}$ where $\chi(G)$ is the chromatic number, and $\omega(G)$ is the clique number of $G$. So all graphs $G$ with $\chi(G) = \omega(G)$ satisfy $\mathscr{I}(G) = \frac{1}{\chi(G)} = \frac{1}{\omega(G)}$. A construction of Zhu demonstrates that there exists a graph $G$ with $\frac{1}{\chi(G)} &lt; \mathscr{I}(G) &lt; \frac{1}{\omega(G)}$, so neither equality holds in general. In response, Hahn, Hell, and Poljak conjectured that all wheel graphs $W_n$ satisfy $\mathscr{I}(W_n) = \frac{1}{\chi(W_n)}$.
  For even wheels $W_{2t}$ this follows from the fact $\chi(W_{2t}) = \omega(W_{2t}) = 3$. Odd wheels of length at least $5$ present a more challenging case, since $\chi(W_{2t+1}) = 4$ and $\omega(W_{2t+1}) = 3$. First, we prove that odd wheels of length at least $7$ satisfy $\mathscr{I}(W_{2t+1})\leq \frac{4t^2+6t}{3(2t+2)^2}&lt;\frac{1}{3}$, which provides the best upper bound for large odd wheels. Next, we prove that $\mathscr{I}(W_5) \leq \frac{1019}{3888}$, improving an upper bound of Hahn, Hell, and Poljak that $\mathscr{I}(W_5) \leq \frac{11}{41}$. Our proofs combine counting arguments, recursive bounds on $\alpha(W^{\Box k}_{2t+1})$, and computer-assisted calculation in the $W_5$ case.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the multisigns of Hamiltonian circles in the multisigned complete graph \(\Sigma_n := (K_n, \sigma, \mathbb{F}_2^m)\). The \emph{multisign} of a circle \(C\) is defined as the sum \[ \sigma(C) := \sum_{e \in E(C)} \sigma(e). \] For a fixed \(m\) and sufficiently large \(n\), we show that the set of multisigns of Hamiltonian circles \[ \{\sigma(H) : H \text{ is a Hamiltonian circle of } \Sigma_n)\} \] forms either a subspace, an affine subspace, or the entire space \(\mathbb{F}_2^m\), except in certain exceptional cases.</description>

      <title>Hilton-Milner Theorem for the $r$-independent sets in a union of cliques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a Hilton-Milner Theorem for the $r$-independent sets in the graph that is the union of copies of $K_k$. That is, we determine the maximum intersecting families of $r$-independent sets in this graph, subject to the condition that the sets in a family do not all share a common element. As a by-product, we also find a tight upper bound for the sum of sizes of a pair of cross intersecting families made up of the same objects.
  We apply our theorem to find the largest intersecting family of $r$-independent sets in a family of graphs called ``depth-two claws". This confirms the Holroyd--Talbot conjecture for depth-two claws, extending previous results on these graphs (which covered cases where $r$ was relatively small compared to the number of vertices) to all possible values of $r$.</description>

      <title>Majority additive coloring and the maximum degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kamyczura introduced the notion of a majority additive $k$-coloring of a graph $G$ as a function $c: V(G) \to \{1,2,\ldots,k\}$ such that $$\left|\left\{u \in N_G(v):\sum_{w \in N_G(u)} c(w) = s \right\}\right|\leq \max\left\{1,\frac{d_G(v)}{2}\right\}$$ for every vertex $v$ of $G$ and every positive integer $s$. We show that every graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$ admitting a majority additive coloring has a majority additive $\mathcal{O}\left(\Delta^2\right)$-coloring. Under additional restrictions we improve this to sublinear in $\Delta$. We show that determining whether a majority additive $k$-coloring exists for a given graph is NP-complete for all $k\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Congruences Modulo Powers of 7 for the Reciprocal Crank Parity Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amdeberhan and Merca recently studied arithmetic properties of the sequence $a(n)$, the reciprocal of the crank parity function, which counts the number of integer partitions of weight $n$ whose even parts are monochromatic and whose odd parts may appear in one of three colors (OEIS A298311). A key result of their work was the congruence $a(7n + 2) \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$ for all $n \geq 0$. We prove new congruences for the reciprocal crank parity function modulo powers of $7$.</description>

Abstract: The celebrated Nash-Williams and Tutte's theorem states that a graph $G=(V, E)$ contains $k$ edge disjoint spanning trees if and only if $\nu_{f}(G) \geq k$, where $$\nu_{f}(G):=\min_{|\mathcal{\mathcal{P}}|&gt;1, \text{$\mathcal{P}$ is a partition of $V(G)$}}\frac{|E( \mathcal{P})|}{|\mathcal{P}|-1}.$$ Inspired by the NDT theorem as structural explanations for the fractional part of Nash-Williams' forest decomposition theorem, Fang and Yang extended Nash-Williams and Tutte's theorem and proved that if $\nu_{f}(G) &gt; k+ \frac{d-1}{d}$, then $G$ contains $k$ edge disjoint spanning trees and another forest $F$ with $ |E(F)|&gt; \frac{d-1}{d} (|V(G)|-1)|$, and if $F$ is not a spanning tree, then $F$ has a component with at least $d$ edges. In this paper, we give a digraphic version of their result; however, the mixed graphic version remains open.</description>

      <title>Odd and even cycle lengths, minimum degree and chromatic number in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the relationship between odd or even cycle lengths, minimum degree and chromatic number. We prove the similar results for odd and even cycle lengths. Let $L_o(G)$ denote the set of odd cycle lengths of $G$ and let $\ell_o(G)$ denote the longest odd cycle length. In 1992, Gy\'arf\'as proved that $\chi(G)\leq 2|L_o(G)|+2$, and if $w(G)\leq 2|L_o(G)|+1$, then $\chi(G)\leq 2|L_o(G)|+1$. We first prove that if $G$ is a 2-connected non-bipartite graph with $\delta(G)\geq 2k$, then $|L_o(G)|\geq k+1$, or $|L_o(G)|=k$. Moreover, if $|L_o(G)|=k$, then $2|L_o(G)|+1=\ell_o(G)$, and either $K_{2k+1}\subseteq G$ or $\chi(G)\leq 2k$. Applying this result, we prove that if $w(G)\leq 2|L_o(G)|$, then $\chi(G)\leq 2|L_o(G)|$ for $|L_o(G)|\geq 2$, improving the result of Gy\'arf\'as. Our result can deduce the similar result of $\chi(G)$ and $\ell_o(G)$ proved by Kenkre and Vishwanathan. We also construct a class of graphs with $w(G)=2|L_o(G)|-1$ but $\chi(G)=2|L_o(G)|$ for every $|L_o(G)|\geq 2$.
  Our second result is about even cycle lengths. Let $L_e(G)$ denote the set of even cycle lengths of $G$ and let $\ell_e(G)$ denote the longest even cycle length. In 2004, Mih\'ok and Schiermeyer proved that $\chi(G)\leq 2|L_e(G)|+3$, and if $w(G)\leq 2|L_e(G)|+2$, then $\chi(G)\leq 2|L_e(G)|+2$. We prove that if $G$ is a 2-connected graph with $\delta(G)\geq 2k+1$, then $|L_e(G)|\geq k+1$, or $|L_e(G)|=k$. Moreover, if $|L_e(G)|=k$, then $2|L_e(G)|+2=\ell_e(G)$, and either $K_{2k+2}\subseteq G$ or $\chi(G)\leq 2k+1$. Applying this result, we prove that if $w(G)\leq 2|L_e(G)|+1$, then $\chi(G)\leq 2|L_e(G)|+1$ for $|L_e(G)|\geq 2$, improving the result of Mih\'ok and Schiermeyer. Our result can deduce the similar result of $\chi(G)$ and $\ell_e(G)$. We also construct a class of graphs with $w(G)=2|L_e(G)|$ but $\chi(G)=2|L_e(G)|+1$ for every $|L_e(G)|\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>The Eulerian numbers can D.I.E</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Eulerian numbers form a triangular array with many interesting properties. The numbers arise from various combinatorial and probabilistic interpretations, and have been studied in a variety of mathematical contexts. In this article we examine two distinct alternating sign formulas for the Eulerian numbers and show how they can be proved using a sign-reversing involution technique described by Benjamin and Quinn known as the ``D.I.E.'' method. Each of these arguments lends itself to a broad generalization, shedding light on different parts of mathematics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address a question posed by Fessler-Jensen-Kelsey-Owen regarding graphs whose second gonality is greater than the first by exactly 1. We answer the question affirmatively under a stronger condition, thereby characterising the entire gonality sequence for a large family of graphs. We prove a structure theorem for the graphs satisfying the condition, and show that they are all obtained via an inductive process by gluing together complete and banana graphs under certain rules.</description>

      <title>Every $Q$-polynomial distance-regular graph is sharp over $\mathbb{R}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ denote a distance-regular graph with vertex set $X$ and diameter $D \geq 3$. Fix a vertex $x \in X$. Let the field $\mathbb{F}$ be either $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$. Let $\operatorname{Mat}_X(\mathbb{F})$ denote the $\mathbb{F}$-algebra of matrices whose rows and columns are indexed by $X$ and all entries in $\mathbb{F}$. The Terwilliger algebra $T^\mathbb{F} = T^\mathbb{F}(x)$ is the subalgebra of $\operatorname{Mat}_X(\mathbb{F})$ generated by the adjacency matrix $A$ of $\Gamma$ and the dual primitive idempotents $\{E_i^*\}_{i=0}^D$ of $\Gamma$ with respect to $x$. Let $\{E_i\}_{i=0}^D$ denote the primitive idempotents of $A$. Assume that the ordering $\{E_i\}_{i=0}^D$ is $Q$-polynomial. Let $W$ denote an irreducible $T^\mathbb{F}$-module. We say that $W$ is sharp over $\mathbb{F}$ whenever $\dim (E_r^* W) = 1$, where $r$ is the endpoint of $W$. It is known, by Nomura and Terwilliger (2008), that every irreducible $T^\mathbb{C}$-module is sharp. In this paper, we prove that every irreducible $T^\mathbb{R}$-module is sharp. Once this is established, we obtain four additional results: (i) if $W$ is an irreducible $T^\mathbb{R}$-module, then its complexification $W^\mathbb{C}= W \otimes_{\mathbb{R}} \mathbb{C}$ is an irreducible $T^\mathbb{C}$-module; (ii) two irreducible $T^\mathbb{R}$-modules $W_1$ and $W_2$ are isomorphic if and only if their complexifications $W_1^\mathbb{C}$ and $W_2^\mathbb{C}$ are isomorphic as $T^\mathbb{C}$-modules; (iii) if $\bigoplus_{i=1}^h \operatorname{Mat}_{n_i}(\mathbb{C})$ is the Wedderburn decomposition of $T^\mathbb{C}$, then $\bigoplus_{i=1}^h \operatorname{Mat}_{n_i}(\mathbb{R})$ is the Wedderburn decomposition of $T^\mathbb{R}$; (iv) each of the subalgebras $E_1^* T E_1^*$, $E_1 T E_1$, $E_D^* T E_D^*$, and $E_D T E_D$ is commutative and every element of these algebras is a symmetric matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every positive integer $n$, we find a complete classification for planar graphs according to the collection of numbers of common neighbours for every $n$-tuple of distinct vertices. Our results expand the literature on planar graphical degree sequences, that have recently been the object of renewed attention. Here we completely settle the version with no multiplicities of the vast problem of planar graphical $n$-degree sequences.</description>

Abstract: We prove that Anderson's conjecture on symmetric sequencings and Bailey's conjecture on 2-sequencings hold for sufficiently large groups. In addition, we discuss extensions of partial harmonious sequences and partial R-sequencings. Several further results on double sequencings are presented, both in the context of abelian groups and for sufficiently large non-abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics of Minimal Balanced Collections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the combinatorics of balanced collections. A collection of subsets of the set $[n] = \{1, \dots, n\}$ is called \emph{balanced} if the relative interior of the convex hull of the corresponding characteristic vectors intersects the main diagonal of the $n$-dimensional cube, and it is called \emph{minimal} if it contains no proper balanced subcollections. In particular, we establish both upper and lower bounds for the number of minimal balanced collections. Specifically, we prove that if $B_n$ denotes the number of minimal balanced collections, then $\frac{0.288}{n!} \, 2^{(n-1)^2} &lt; B_n &lt; \frac{120}{n!} \, 2^{n^2 - n}$.</description>

      <title>How to Expand a Self-orthogonal Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show how to expand Euclidean/Hermitian self-orthogonal code preserving their orthogonal property. Our results show that every $k$-dimension Hermitian self-orthogonal code is contained in a $(k+1)$-dimensional Hermitian self-orthogonal code. Also, for $k&lt; n/2-1$, every $[n,k]$ Euclidean self-orthogonal code is contained in an $[n,k+1]$ Euclidean self-orthogonal code. Moreover, for $k=n/2-1$ and $p=2$, we can also fulfill the expanding process. But for $k=n/2-1$ and $p$ odd prime, the expanding process can be fulfilled if and only if an extra condition must be satisfied. We also propose two feasible algorithms on these expanding procedures.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks vs Convolutional Neural Networks for Graph Domination Number Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate machine learning approaches to approximating the \emph{domination number} of graphs, the minimum size of a dominating set. Exact computation of this parameter is NP-hard, restricting classical methods to small instances. We compare two neural paradigms: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which operate on adjacency matrix representations, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which learn directly from graph structure through message passing. Across 2,000 random graphs with up to 64 vertices, GNNs achieve markedly higher accuracy ($R^2=0.987$, MAE $=0.372$) than CNNs ($R^2=0.955$, MAE $=0.500$). Both models offer substantial speedups over exact solvers, with GNNs delivering more than $200\times$ acceleration while retaining near-perfect fidelity. Our results position GNNs as a practical surrogate for combinatorial graph invariants, with implications for scalable graph optimization and mathematical discovery.</description>

      <title>The persistent homology of the Linial-Meshulam process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a fixed dimension $k\ge 1$, let us consider the randomly growing simplical complex on the vertex set $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ defined as follows: We start with the empty complex, and for each $k+1$-element subset $\sigma$ of $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$, we add $\sigma$ and all of its subsets to the complex at some random time $t_\sigma$, where $(t_\sigma)$ are i.i.d. uniform random elements of $[0,n]$. As the complex evolves, new $k-1$-dimensional cycles are born and then at a later time they die, that is, they get filled in. The notion of persistence diagrams, which is a standard tool in topological data analysis, provides a way to record these birth and death times. In this paper, we understand the asymptotic behavior of the persistence diagrams of the above defined randomly evolving complexes as $n$ goes to infinity.
  As the single time marginals of the above process are variants of the Linial-Meshulam complex, our results can be viewed as extensions of the results of Linial and Peled on the Betti numbers of the Linial-Meshulam complex.
  Our proof relies on the notion of local weak convergence of graphs and a generalization of the results of Bordenave, Lelarge and Salez on the rank of sparse random matrices.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Grassmann-Pfaffian Framework for Monomer-Dimer and Spanning Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework for Berezin integrals over Grassmann variables that establishes master identities for exponential quadratic fermionic forms and linear fermionic forms coupled to both bosonic and fermionic sources. The construction is rigorous for both real and complex fermions in arbitrary dimensions and remains well-defined even when the underlying matrices are singular. Our main mathematical results appear in two master theorems. Theorem 12 provides a comprehensive identity for Berezin integrals over Grassmann variables for real fermions with mixed bosonic-fermionic sources, applicable to any antisymmetric matrix. Its complex analogue, Theorem 13, yields corresponding determinant-based representations. Together, they serve as generating functionals for a wide range of combinatorial and physical models. Key applications include the dimer, monomer-dimer, matching, and almost-matching problems. We revisit the Kasteleyn theorem for planar dimers using Berezin integrals. We construct monomer-dimer systems through the \textit{Monobisyzexant (Mbsz)} function, which generalizes the Hafnian to incorporate monomer contributions and admits a Pfaffian-sum representation for planar graphs (Theorem 5); and practical techniques for handling singular matrices via unitary block decomposition (Theorem 6) and spectral analysis. We further present explicit mappings between Hafnians and Pfaffians and their submatrix generalizations (Hafnianinhos and Pfaffianinhos); an alternative source-ordered Berezin integral representation for spanning trees and forests using complex bosonic sources that regularizes the Laplacian zero mode (Theorem 10). Overall, this work offers a flexible toolkit for the theoretical analysis and computational implementation of graph-based models and lattice field theories using Berezin integrals over Grassmann variables .</description>

      <title>Overlap Analysis of the Shortest Path Problem: Local Search, Landscapes, and Franz--Parisi Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two directions in algorithms and complexity involve: (1) classifying which optimization problems can be solved in polynomial time, and (2) understanding which computational problems are hard to solve \emph{on average} in addition to the worst case. For many average-case problems, there does not currently exist strong evidence via reductions that they are hard. However, we can still attempt to predict their polynomial time tractability by proving lower bounds against restricted classes of algorithms.
  Geometric approaches to predicting tractability typically study the \emph{optimization landscape}. For optimization problems with random objectives or constraints, ideas originating in statistical physics suggest we should study the \emph{overlap} between approximately-optimal solutions. Formally, properties of \emph{Gibbs measures} and the \emph{Franz--Parisi potential} imply lower bounds against natural local search algorithms, such as Langevin dynamics. A related theory, the \emph{Overlap Gap Property (OGP)}, proves rigorous lower bounds against classes of algorithms which are stable functions of their input.
  A remarkable recent work of Li and Schramm showed that the shortest path problem in random graphs admits lower bounds against a class of stable algorithms, via the OGP. Yet this problem is polynomial time tractable. We further investigate this. We find that both the OGP and the Franz--Parisi potential predict that: (1) local search will fail in the optimization landscape of shortest paths, but (2) local search should succeed in the optimization landscape for shortest path \emph{trees}, which is true. Using the Franz--Parisi potential, we explain an analogy with results from combinatorial optimization -- submodular minimization is tractable via local search on the Lov\'asz extension, even though ``naive'' local search over sets or the multilinear extension provably fails.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of Autocatalytic Subsystems in Large Chemical Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autocatalysis is an important feature of metabolic networks, contributing crucially to the self-maintenance of organisms. Autocatalytic subsystems of chemical reaction networks (CRNs) are characterized in terms of algebraic conditions on submatrices of the stoichiometric matrix. Here, we derive sufficient conditions for subgraphs supporting irreducible autocatalytic systems in the bipartite K\"onig representation of the CRN. On this basis, we develop an efficient algorithm to enumerate autocatalytic subnetworks and, as a special case, autocatalytic cores, i.e., minimal autocatalytic subnetworks, in full-size metabolic networks. The same algorithmic approach can also be used to determine autocatalytic cores only. As a showcase application, we provide a complete analysis of autocatalysis in the core metabolism of E. coli and enumerate irreducible autocatalytic subsystems of limited size in full-fledged metabolic networks of E. coli, human erythrocytes, and Methanosarcina barkeri (Archea). The mathematical and algorithmic results are accompanied by software enabling the routine analysis of autocatalysis in large CRNs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the multigraded Betti numbers of Veronese embeddings of projective spaces. Due to Hochster's formula, we interpret these multigraded Betti numbers in terms of the homology of certain simplicial complexes. By analyzing these simplicial complexes and applying Forman's discrete Morse theory, we derive vanishing and non-vanishing results for these multigraded Betti numbers.</description>

      <title>Lattices of pretorsion classes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since their introduction, torsion theories have played a key role in the study of abelian and pointed categories. In representation theory, torsion theories and lattices of torsion classes of mod$ A$, for $A$ a finite-dimensional algebra, have been widely studied. The more recent definition of pretorsion theories, that can be given for any category, has expanded the theory, giving many more instances of ``non-pointed torsion theories'' in unexpected settings. In this work, we introduce and study the lattice $\mathcal{L}_t(A)$ of pretorsion classes of mod$ A$. These lattices are in close connection with the lattices tors$ A$ of torsion classes of mod$ A$. We fully describe the completely join-irreducible elements of $\mathcal{L}_t(A)$. Moreover, we characterise and give a full classification of when $\mathcal{L}_t(A)$ is distributive and further describe when it can be identified with the \emph{distributive closure} of tors$ A$. Finally, we show how the lattices of pretorsion classes, together with their duals, can be used to build pretorsion theories in mod$ A$.</description>

Abstract: We present a combinatorial isomorphism between Stasheff associahedra and an inductive cone construction of those complexes given by Loday. We give an alternate description of certain polytopes, known as multiplihedra, which arise in the study of $A_\infty$ maps. We also prove a combinatorial isomorphism between Stasheff associahedra, collapsed multiplihedra and graph cubeahedra for path graphs.</description>

      <title>An algebraic approach towards a conjecture on the Davenport constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a finite group $G,$ $\mathsf{D}(G)$ is defined as the least positive integer $k$ such that for every sequence $S=g_1\bdot g_2\bdot \dotsc \bdot g_k$ of length $k$ over $G$, there exist $1 \le i_1 &lt; i_2 &lt;\cdots &lt; i_m \le k $ such that $g_{i_1}g_{i_2}\cdots g_{i_m}=1,$ where $1$ is the identity element of $G.$ The small Davenport constant $\mathsf{d}(G)$ is the maximal positive integer $k$ such that there is a sequence of length $k$ over $G$ which has no non-trivial product-one subsequence. In 2004, Dimitrov proved that $\mathsf{D}(G)\leq \mathsf{L}(G)$ for a finite $p$-group $G$, where $p$ is a prime and $\mathsf{L}(G)$ is the Loewy length of $\mathbb{F}_p[G].$ He conjectured that the equality holds for all finite $p$-groups. In this article, we compute $\mathsf{D}(G)$ for certain classes of finite non-abelian $p$-groups, including metacyclic groups, and show that the conjecture is true by determining the precise value of $\mathsf{L}(G)$. As a consequence, we refine an upper bound on $\mathsf{d}(G)$ recently given by Qu, Li and Teeuwsen, and prove that for specific classes of groups $\mathsf{D}(G)=\mathsf{d}(G)+1$. We also evaluate $\mathsf{D}(G)$ for finite dicyclic, semi-dihedral and other groups.</description>

      <title>Shelling of links and star clusters in edgewise subdivision of a simplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12756v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the combinatorial types of the links of the vertices in the edgewise triangulation $T_{k,q}$ of a $(k-1)$-simplex are encoded by the partitions of $k$. Each of these complexes is isomorphic to a subcomplex of the barycentric subdivision of the boundary of a $(k-1)$-simplex, and the containment relations among them are described by a new poset on the set of partitions of $k$. We compute the $h$-vectors of these complexes and determine the number of vertices of $T_{k,q}$ whose links are the same (correspond to the same partition).
  The combinatorial type of the link of an $(s-1)$-dimensional face of $T_{k,q}$ corresponds to a partition $(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_s)$ of $k$ into $s$ parts, together with additional partitions of each $\lambda_i$. We also enumerate the combinatorial types of all $m$-dimensional complexes that arise as the links in edgewise triangulations.
  A new permutation statistic, \textit{the faithful initial part}, is introduced and used to describe the star cluster of a facet of $T_{k,q}$. By examining a specific shelling of this star cluster, we prove that the $i$-th entry of its $h$-vector
  counts the number of permutations of $[k]$ with exactly $i$ descents,
  taking into account the
  faithful initial part as the multiplicity. Finally, we
  describe a concrete shelling order for $T_{k,q}$, give a
  combinatorial interpretation of its $h$-vector, and derive an explicit formula for it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two sets $X, Y$ of vertices in a graph $G$ are "anticomplete" if $X\cap Y=\varnothing$ and there is no edge in $G$ with an end in $X$ and an end in $Y$. We prove that every graph $G$ of sufficiently large treewidth contains two anticomplete sets of vertices each inducing a subgraph of large treewidth unless $G$ contains, as an induced subgraph, a highly structured graph of large treewidth that is an obvious counterexample to this statement. These are: complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs and "interrupted $s$-constellations." The latter is a slightly adjusted version of a well-known construction by Bonamy et al.</description>

      <title>On the Classification of Schubert Varieties in Partial Flag Varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02150v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the classification of isomorphism classes of Schubert varieties in complete flag varieties G/B to a class of partial flag varieties G/P. In particular, we classify all Schubert varieties in G/P where P is a minimal parabolic subgroup and all Schubert surfaces. We also obtain several pairs of isomorphisms of Schubert varieties from folding the root system. This allows us to find an upper bound of the cardinality of isomorphism classes of Schubert three-folds.</description>

      <title>On $\mathcal{F}$-multicolor Tur\'{a}n number of hypergraph graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11869v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ruzsa-Szemer\'{e}di $(6,3)$-problem can be equivalently stated as determining the maximum number of edge-disjoint triangles on $n$ vertices such that no triangle is formed by edges from three distinct triangle-copies. Gowers and Janzer extended this problem by establishing an analogous result for complete graphs. A natural generalization of the two results, first introduced by Imolay, Karl, Nazy and V\'{a}li, asks for the maximum number of edge-disjoint copies of a graph $F$ on $n$ vertices such that no copy of $G$ is formed by edges originating from distinct $F$-copies. This maximum number, denoted by $ex_F(n,G)$, is called the {\em $F$-multicolor Tur\'{a}n number} of $G$. This paper focuses on the setting of uniform hypergraphs. We first prove that for $k$-uniform hypergraphs $\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathcal{F}$, $ex_{\mathcal{F}}(n,\mathcal{G})=o(n^k)$ if and only if there exists a homomorphism from $\mathcal{G}$ to $\mathcal{F}$. For degenerate case, we show that $ex_{\mathcal{F}}(n,\mathcal{G})=n^{k-o(1)}$ whenever $\mathcal{G}$ contains a $k$-uniform tight triangle. These results extend previous results. We further establish corresponding supersaturation and blowup statements. In the non-degenerate setting, we derive matching lower and upper bounds for $ex_{\mathcal{F}}(n,\mathcal{G})$. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for $ex_{\mathcal{F}}(n,\mathcal{G})$ to fail to attain the upper bound, under the assumption that the extremal graphs for $\mathcal{G}$ are stable. As an application, we refine a result due to Imolay, Karl, Nazy and V\'{a}li. Furthermore, we completely characterize $\mathcal{F}$ for which $ex_{\mathcal{F}}(n,\mathcal{G})$ does not attain the upper bound when $\mathcal{G}$ is one of the three special intersecting graphs: Fano plane, extended triangle and $r$-book of $r$-edges with $r=3,4$.</description>

      <title>Coarse cops and robber in graphs and groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15571v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (abstract shortened to meet arxiv's length requirements) We investigate two variants of the classical Cops and robber game in graphs, recently introduced by Lee, Mart\'inez-Pedroza, and Rodr\'iguez-Quinche. The two versions are played in infinite graphs and the goal of the cops is to prevent the robber to visit some ball of finite radius (chosen by the robber) infinitely many times. Moreover the cops and the robber move at a different speed, and the cops can choose a radius of capture before the game starts. Depending on the order in which the parameters are chosen, this naturally defines two games, a weak version and a strong version (in which the cops are more powerful), and thus two variants of the cop number of a graph $G$: the weak cop number and the strong cop number. It turns out that these two parameters are invariant under quasi-isometry and thus we can investigate these parameters in finitely generated groups by considering any of their Cayley graphs; the parameters do not depend on the chosen set of generators.
  We answer a number of questions raised by Lee, Mart\'inez-Pedroza, and Rodr\'iguez-Quinche, and more recently by Cornect and Mart\'inez-Pedroza. This includes a proof that the weak and strong cop numbers are monotone under quasi-isometric embedding, characterizations of graphs of weak cop number 1 and graphs of strong cop number 1, and a proof that the grid has infinite strong cop number. Moreover we tie the weak cop number of a graph $G$ to the existence of asymptotic minors of large tree-width in $G$, and use the result to prove that any finitely presented group has weak cop number 1 or $\infty$.
  We have learned very recently that some of our results have been obtained independently by Appenzeller and Klinge, using fairly different arguments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theorem by Ding, Oporowski, Oxley, and Vertigan states that every sufficiently large bipartite graph without twins contains a matching, co-matching, or half-graph of any given size as an induced subgraph. We prove that this Ramsey statement has polynomial dependency assuming bounded VC-dimension of the initial graph, using the recent verification of the Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal property for graphs of bounded VC-dimension. Since the theorem of Ding et al. plays a role in (finite) model theory, which studies even more restricted structures, we also comment on further refinements of the theorem within this context.</description>

Abstract: It is well known that every sufficiently large connected graph has, as an induced subgraph, $K_n$, $K_{1,n}$, or an $n$-vertex path. A 2023 paper of Allred, Ding, and Oporowski identified a set of unavoidable induced subgraphs of sufficiently large $2$-connected graphs. In this paper, we establish a dual version of this theorem by focusing on the minors obtained by contracting cycles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We call a family $\mathcal{F}$ $(3,2,\ell)$-intersecting if $|A \cap B|+|B \cap C|+|C \cap A| \geq \ell$ for all $A$, $B$, $C \in \mathcal{F}$. We try to look for the maximum size of such a family $\mathcal{F}$ in case when $\mathcal{F} \subset {[n] \choose k}$ or $\mathcal{F} \subset 2^{[n]}$. In the uniform case we show that if $\mathcal{F}$ is $(3,2,2)$-intersecting, then $\vert \mathcal{F} \vert \leq {n+1 \choose k-1}+{n \choose k-2}$ and if $\mathcal{F}$ is $(3,2,3)$-intersecting, then $|\mathcal{F}| \leq {n \choose k-1} + 2 {n \choose k-3} + 3 {n-1 \choose k-3}$. For the lower bound we construct a $(3,2,\ell)$-intersecting family and we show that this bound is sharp when $\ell=2$ or $3$ and $n$ is sufficiently large compared to $k$. In the non-uniform case we give an upper bound for a $(3,2,n-x)$-intersecting family, when $n$ is sufficiently large compared to $x$.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of polytopes with edge length and coplanarity constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a novel setting for polytope rigidity, where a flex must preserve edge lengths and the planarity of faces, but is allowed to change the shapes of faces. For instance, the regular cube is flexible in this notion. We present techniques for constructing flexible polytopes and find that flexibility seems to be an exceptional property. Based on this observation, we introduce a notion of generic realizations for polytopes and conjecture that convex polytopes are generically rigid in dimension $d\geq 3$. We prove this conjecture in dimension $d=3$. Motivated by our findings we also pose several questions that are intended to inspire future research into this notion of polytope rigidity.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, the study of extreme value bounds for topological indices is crucial for understanding their influence on trees and bipartite graphs. For integers $\alpha, p$ satisfying $1 \leq p \leq \alpha \leq \Delta - 3$, the minimum Albertson index $\operatorname{irr}_{\min}$ has the following lower bound: $$ \operatorname{irr}_{\min} \geq \Delta^2 (\Delta - 1) \frac{2^{\alpha}}{(\Delta - p)^2}. $$ This work examines the maximum and minimum values of the Albertson index in bipartite graphs, depending on the sizes of their bipartition sets. Utilizing a known corollary, explicit formulas and bounds are derived to characterize the irregularity measure under various vertex size conditions. Additionally, upper bounds for the Albertson and Sigma indices are established using graph parameters such as degrees and edge counts. The theoretical findings are illustrated with examples and inequalities involving degree sequences, advancing the understanding of extremal irregularity behavior in bipartite graphs.</description>

Abstract: Fullerenes are an allotrope of carbon having hollow, cage-like structure. Atoms in the molecule are arranged in pentagonal and hexagonal rings, such that each atom is connected to three other atoms. Simple polyhedra having only pentagonal and hexagonal faces are a mathematical model for fullerenes. We say that a fullerene with $n$ vertices has magical property if the numbers $1, 2, \dots, n$ may be assigned to its vertices so that the sums of the numbers in each pentagonal faces are equal and the sums of the numbers in each hexagonal faces are equal. We show that $C_{8n+4}$ does not admit such an arrangement for all $n$, while there are fullerenes, like $C_{24}$ and $C_{26}$ that have many nonisomorphic such arrangements.</description>

Abstract: The Dowling geometry $Q_n(\Gamma)$, where $\Gamma$ is a finite group, is a matroid that generalizes the complete-graphic matroid $M(K_{n+1})$. We determine the maximum size of an $N$-free submatroid of $Q_n(\Gamma)$ for various choices of $N$, including subgeometries $Q_m(\Gamma')$, lines $U_{2,\ell}$, and graphic matroids $M(H)$. When the group $\Gamma$ is trivial and $N=M(K_t)$, this problem reduces to Tur\'{a}n's classical result in extremal graph theory. We show that when $\Gamma$ is nontrivial, a complex dependence on $\Gamma$ emerges, even when $N=M(K_4)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exhibit two instances of the cyclic sieving phenomenon - one on dissections of a polygon of a fixed type and one on triangulations of a once-punctured polygon. We use these results to give refined enumerations of certain families of frieze patterns. We also give an interpretation of finite, positive integral frieze patterns fixed under nontrivial rotations as frieze patterns from a family of orbifolds and show that these are always unitary. Finally, we give a bijection between Holm-Jorgensen frieze patterns and p-Dyck paths, extending a recent construction of Canadas, Espinosa, Gaviria, and Rios, and discuss an induced rotation map on Dyck paths. Several conjectures and questions for future study are highlighted throughout the article.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Raspaud and Wang conjectured that every triangle-free planar graph can be vertex-partitioned into an independent set and a forest. Independently, Kawarabayashi and Thomassen also remarked that this might be true, after providing another proof of a result of Borodin and Glebov, showing this result for planar graphs of girth~5. Subsequently, Dross, Montassier, and Pinlou raised the same question and proved that every triangle-free planar graph can be partitioned into a forest and another forest of maximum degree~5. More recently, Feghali and \v{S}\'{a}mal improved this bound on the maximum degree to~3. In this note, we further improve the result by showing that every triangle-free planar graph can be partitioned into a forest and a linear forest, that is, a forest of maximum degree~2.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds on Intersection Families for Certain Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A family of graphs $\mathcal{F}$ is $H$-intersecting if the edge intersection of any two graphs in $\mathcal{F}$ contains a copy of a fixed graph $H$. A fundamental problem is to determine the maximum size of such a family. The trivial lower bound of $2^{\binom{n}{2} - e(H)}$ is known to be not sharp for some graphs, such as the $P_4$ graph, as shown by Christofides. This paper presents two main contributions. First, we introduce a general construction for $H$-intersecting families based on decompositions of complete multipartite graphs, yielding new lower bounds for $H = K_{s_1, \dots, s_{k-1}, t}$. We compare this construction to a result by Balogh and Linz, showing that our bound is valid for a substantially wider range of parameters (beginning at $t \ge 2^{\sum_i s_i}$) and provides a stronger numerical bound for a large interval where both constructions are applicable. Second, we conjecture the $\frac{17}{128}$ Christofides bound for $P_4$ is optimal, which would resolve the Alon-Spencer conjecture. We computationally verify this density is optimal for families generated by connected 6-vertex host graphs with 7 or 8 edges.</description>

      <title>Bumpless Pipe Dream Fragments -- Equivariant Geometry of Clans</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a new geometric setting for bumpless pipe dreams and double Schubert polynomials. Building on the notion of bumpless pipe dream fragments, we define clan polynomials as their weight generating functions. It turns out that clan polynomials arise naturally in the equivariant geometry of ($GL_p\times GL_q$)-orbits over the flag variety $Fl_{p+q}$ parametrized by $(p,q)$-clans. Furthermore, we show that the coefficients in the equivariant Schubert expansion of the fundamental classes of ($GL_p\times GL_q$)-orbit closures are exactly clan polynomials, which resolves an open problem posed by Wyser and Yong.</description>

      <title>Growing Avoiders from the Right: An Operator-Theoretic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Marcus and Tardos \cite{MarcusTardos2004} proved the Stanley--Wilf conjecture by reducing pattern avoidance to an extremal problem on $0$--$1$ matrices. We give a parallel proof for classical permutation patterns that stays entirely in the ``grow from the right'' world of enumerative combinatorics. A $v$-avoiding permutation is built by right insertion; at each step we keep a pruned family of locations of $(k{-}1)$-partial occurrences of $v$ (the \emph{frontier}), each carrying its forbidden rank interval. The insertion step then induces a nonnegative transfer operator on a doubly weighted $\ell^\infty$ space. A quadratic penalty in the length makes this operator bounded, and a Neumann-series argument on a natural separable predual yields analyticity of the growth series, hence finite exponential growth for $\Av(v)$.
  The formulation is completely internal -- we never pass to $0$--$1$ matrices -- and it cleanly separates the pattern-dependent combinatorics of the frontier from a purely operator-theoretic core. In particular, we obtain an abstract ``right-insertion/transfer-operator'' theorem: any system whose frontier grows at most linearly and whose transfer operator satisfies a uniform quadratic length bound has an analytic growth series.</description>

      <title>Graphical view on linear extensions of finite posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of possible cryptomorphic definitions of a partially ordered set (= a poset) $P$ on a non-empty finite basic set $N$ is in terms of the set ${\cal L}(P)$ of all its linear extensions, that is, in terms of the set of total orders of $N$ consonant with $P$. Any total order of $N$ can be interpreted as a node of a particular graph, called the permutohedral graph (over $N$), because it is indeed the graph of a certain polytope in $\mathbb{R}^{N}$, known as the permutohedron.
  It is shown in the paper that a non-empty set of total orders of $N$ equals to ${\cal L}(P)$ for some poset $P$ on $N$ iff it is a geodetically convex set in the permutohedral graph. This result means that a purely graphical concept of geodetical convexity in this graph is a cryptomorphic definition of a finite poset. In particular, the lattice of geodetically convex sets in this graph is graded and its height function is described in graphical terms. A counter-example, however, shows that the height function does not correspond to the usual graphical diameter, relating this matter to a combinatorial concept of the dimension of a poset.
  Two alternative cryptomorphic views on a poset $P$ on $N$ are also briefly commented. The geometric counterpart is its full-dimensional braid cone in $\mathbb{R}^{N}$, while a combinatorial alternative is a topology on $N$ distinguishing points, often referred as a distributive lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An open problem in convex geometry asks whether two simplices $A,B\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$, both containing the origin in their convex hulls, admit a polynomial-length sequence of vertex exchanges transforming $A$ into $B$ while maintaining the origin in the convex hull throughout. We propose a matroidal generalization of the problem to oriented matroids, concerning exchange sequences between bases under sign constraints on elements appearing in certain fundamental circuits. We formulate a conjecture on the minimum length of such a sequence, and prove it for oriented graphic matroids of directed graphs. We also study connections between our conjecture and several long-standing open problems on exchange sequences between pairs of bases in unoriented matroids.</description>

      <title>On Fair and Tolerant Colorings of Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A (not necessarily proper) vertex coloring of a graph $G$ with color classes $V_1$, $V_2$, $\dots$, $V_k$, is said to be a {\it Fair And Tolerant vertex coloring of $G$ with $k$ colors}, whenever $V_1$, $V_2$, $\dots$, $V_k$ are nonempty and there exist two real numbers $\alpha$ and $\beta$ such that $\alpha \in [0,1]$ and $\beta \in [0,1]$ and the following condition holds for each arbitrary vertex $v$ and every arbitrary color class $V_i$: $$ \bigl| V_i \cap N (v) \bigr| = \begin{cases}
  \alpha \deg (v) &amp; \mbox{ if } \ \ v \notin V_i
  \beta \deg (v) &amp; \mbox{ if } \ \ v \in V_i . \end{cases} $$ The {\it FAT chromatic number} of $G$, denoted by $\chi ^{{\rm FAT}} (G)$, is defined as the maximum positive integer $k$ for which $G$ admits a Fair And Tolerant vertex coloring with $k$ colors. The concept of the FAT chromatic number of graphs was introduced and studied by Beers and Mulas, where they asked for the existence of a function $f \colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ in such a way that the inequality $\chi ^{{\rm FAT}} (G) \ \leq \ f \big( \chi (G) \big)$ holds for all graphs $G$. Another similar interesting question concerns the existence of some function $g \colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that the inequality $\chi (G) \ \leq \ g \left( \chi ^{{\rm FAT}} (G) \right)$ holds for every graph $G$. In this paper, we establish that both questions admit negative resolutions.</description>

      <title>Circle Squaring with Pieces of Small Boundary and Low Borel Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.01412v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tarski's Circle Squaring Problem from 1925 asks whether it is possible to partition a disk in the plane into finitely many pieces and reassemble them via isometries to yield a partition of a square of the same area. It was finally resolved by Laczkovich in 1990 in the affirmative. Recently, several new proofs have emerged which achieve circle squaring with better structured pieces: namely, pieces which are Lebesgue measurable and have the property of Baire (Grabowski-M\'ath\'e-Pikhurko) or even are Borel (Marks-Unger).
  In this paper, we show that circle squaring is possible with Borel pieces of positive Lebesgue measure whose boundaries have upper Minkowski dimension less than 2 (in particular, each piece is Jordan measurable). We also improve the Borel complexity of the pieces: namely, we show that each piece can be taken to be a Boolean combination of $F_\sigma$ sets. This is a consequence of our more general result that applies to any two bounded subsets of $R^k$, $k\ge 1$, of equal positive measure whose boundaries have upper Minkowski dimension smaller than $k$.</description>

      <title>Optimization with pattern-avoiding input</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04236v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Permutation pattern-avoidance is a central concept of both enumerative and extremal combinatorics. In this paper we study the effect of permutation pattern-avoidance on the complexity of optimization problems.
  In the context of the dynamic optimality conjecture (Sleator, Tarjan, STOC 1983), Chalermsook, Goswami, Kozma, Mehlhorn, and Saranurak (FOCS 2015) conjectured that the amortized search cost of an optimal binary search tree (BST) is constant whenever the search sequence is pattern-avoiding. The best known bound to date is $2^{\alpha{(n)}(1+o(1))}$ recently obtained by Chalermsook, Pettie, and Yingchareonthawornchai (SODA 2024); here $n$ is the BST size and $\alpha(\cdot)$ the inverse-Ackermann function. In this paper we resolve the conjecture, showing a tight $O(1)$ bound. This indicates a barrier to dynamic optimality: any candidate online BST (e.g., splay trees or greedy trees) must match this optimum, but current analysis techniques only give superconstant bounds.
  More broadly, we argue that the easiness of pattern-avoiding input is a general phenomenon, not limited to BSTs or even to data structures. To illustrate this, we show that when the input avoids an arbitrary, fixed, a priori unknown pattern, one can efficiently compute a $k$-server solution of $n$ requests from a unit interval, with total cost $n^{O(1/\log k)}$, in contrast to the worst-case $\Theta(n/k)$ bound; and a traveling salesman tour of $n$ points from a unit box, of length $O(\log{n})$, in contrast to the worst-case $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ bound; similar results hold for the euclidean minimum spanning tree, Steiner tree, and nearest-neighbor graphs.
  We show both results to be tight. Our techniques build on the Marcus-Tardos proof of the Stanley-Wilf conjecture, and on the recently emerging concept of twin-width.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the worst-case mixing time of the global Kawasaki dynamics for the fixed-magnetization Ising model on the class of graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$. Proving a conjecture of Carlson, Davies, Kolla, and Perkins, we show that below the tree uniqueness threshold, the Kawasaki dynamics mix rapidly for all magnetizations. Disproving a conjecture of Carlson, Davies, Kolla, and Perkins, we show that the regime of fast mixing does not extend throughout the regime of tractability for this model: there is a range of parameters for which there exist efficient sampling algorithms for the fixed-magnetization Ising model on max-degree $\Delta$ graphs, but the Kawasaki dynamics can take exponential time to mix. Our techniques involve showing spectral independence in the fixed-magnetization Ising model and proving a sharp threshold for the existence of multiple metastable states in the Ising model with external field on random regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Note about the complexity of the acyclic orientation with parity constraint problem</title>

Abstract: Let $G = (V, E)$ be a connected graph, and let $T$ in $V$ be a subset of vertices. An orientation of $G$ is called $T$-odd if any vertex $v \in V$ has odd in-degree if and only if it is in $T$. Finding a T -odd orientation of G can be solved in polynomial time as shown by Chevalier, Jaeger, Payan and Xuong (1983). Since then, $T$-odd orientations have continued to attract interest, particularly in the context of global constraints on the orientation. For instance, Frank and Kir\'aly (2002) investigated $k$-connected $T$-odd orientations and raised questions about acyclic $T$-odd orientations. This problem is now recognized as an Egres problem and is known as the "Acyclic orientation with parity constraints" problem. Szegedy ( 005) proposed a randomized polynomial algorithm to address this problem. An easy consequence of his work provides a polynomial time algorithm for planar graphs whenever $|T | = |V | - 1$. Nevertheless, it remains unknown whether it exists in general. In this paper we contribute to the understanding of the complexity of this problem by studying a more general one. We prove that finding a $T$-odd acyclic orientation on graphs having some directed edges is NP-complete.</description>

      <title>Spectral selections, commutativity preservation and Coxeter-Lipschitz maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19393</link>

Abstract: Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system whose graph is connected, with no infinite edges. A self-map $\tau$ of $W$ such that $\tau_{\sigma\theta}\in \{\tau_{\theta},\ \sigma\tau_{\theta}\}$ for all $\theta\in W$ and all reflections $\sigma$ (analogous to being 1-Lipschitz with respect to the Bruhat order on $W$) is either constant or a right translation. A somewhat stronger version holds for $S_n$, where it suffices that $\sigma$ range over smaller, $\theta$-dependent sets of reflections.
  These combinatorial results have a number of consequences concerning continuous spectrum- and commutativity-preserving maps $\mathrm{SU}(n)\to M_n$ defined on special unitary groups: every such map is a conjugation composed with (a) the identity; (b) transposition, or (c) a continuous diagonal spectrum selection. This parallels and recovers Petek's analogous statement for self-maps of the space $H_n\le M_n$ of self-adjoint matrices, strengthening it slightly by expanding the codomain to $M_n$.</description>

      <title>Frostman random variables, entropy inequalities, and applications</title>

Abstract: We introduce Frostman conditions for bivariate random variables and study discretized entropy sum-product phenomena in both independent and dependent settings. Fix $0 &lt; s &lt; 1$, and let $(X,Y)$ be a bivariate real random variable with bounded support, whose distribution satisfies a Frostman condition of dimension $s$. Let $\phi(x,y)$ be a polynomial obtained from a diagonal polynomial $\rho_1(x)+\rho_2(y)\in \mathbb{R}[x, y]$ of degree $d\ge 2$ by applying an invertible rational linear change of variables in $(x,y)$. We show that there exists $\epsilon = \epsilon(\phi,s)&gt;0$ such that $$ \max\{H_n(X+Y), H_n(\phi(X,Y))\} \geq n(s+\epsilon) $$ for all sufficiently large $n$, where the precise assumptions on $(X,Y)$ depend on the Frostman level. The proof introduces a novel multi-step entropy framework, combining the submodularity formula, the discretized entropy Balog-Szemer\'{e}di-Gowers theorem, and state-of-the-art results on the Falconer distance problem, to reduce general forms to a diagonal core case.
  As an application, we obtain discretized sum-product type estimates. In particular, for a $\delta$-separated set $A\subseteq [0, 1]$ of cardinality $\delta^{-s}$, satisfying certain non-concentration conditions, and a dense subset $G\subseteq A\times A$, there exists $\epsilon=\epsilon(s, \phi)&gt;0$ such that $$ E_\delta(A+_GA) + E_\delta(\phi_G(A, A)) \gg\delta^{-\epsilon}(\#A) $$ for all $\delta$ small enough. Here $E_\delta(A)$ denotes the $\delta$-covering number of $A$, $A+_GA:=\{x+y\colon (x, y)\in G\}$, and $\phi_G(A,A):=\{\phi(x, y)\colon (x, y)\in G\}$.</description>

      <title>The Squishy Grid Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of approximating Euclidean distances by the infinite integer grid graph. Although the topology of the graph is fixed, we have control over the edge-weight assignment $w:E\to \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$, and hope to have grid distances be asymptotically isometric to Euclidean distances, that is, for all grid points $u,v$, $\mathrm{dist}_w(u,v) = (1\pm o(1))\|u-v\|_2$. We give three methods for solving this problem, each attractive in its own way.
  * Our first construction is based on an embedding of the recursive, non-periodic pinwheel tiling of Radin and Conway into the integer grid. Distances in the pinwheel graph are asymptotically isometric to Euclidean distances, but no explicit bound on the rate of convergence was known. We prove that the multiplicative distortion of the pinwheel graph is $(1+1/\Theta(\log^\xi \log D))$, where $D$ is the Euclidean distance and $\xi=\Theta(1)$. The pinwheel tiling approach is conceptually simple, but can be improved quantitatively.
  * Our second construction is based on a hierarchical arrangement of "highways." It is simple, achieving stretch $(1 + 1/\Theta(D^{1/9}))$, which converges doubly exponentially faster than the pinwheel tiling approach.
  * The first two methods are deterministic. An even simpler approach is to sample the edge weights independently from a common distribution $\mathscr{D}$. Whether there exists a distribution $\mathscr{D}^*$ that makes grid distances Euclidean, asymptotically and in expectation, is major open problem in the theory of first passage percolation. Previous experiments show that when $\mathscr{D}$ is a Fisher distribution, grid distances are within 1\% of Euclidean. We demonstrate experimentally that this level of accuracy can be achieved by a simple 2-point distribution that assigns weights 0.41 or 4.75 with probability 44\% and 56\%, respectively.</description>

      <title>One-weight codes in the sum-rank metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One-weight codes, in which all nonzero codewords share the same weight, form a highly structured class of linear codes with deep connections to finite geometry. While their classification is well understood in the Hamming and rank metrics - being equivalent to (direct sums of) simplex codes - the sum-rank metric presents a far more intricate landscape. In this work, we explore the geometry of one-weight sum-rank metric codes, focusing on three distinct classes. First, we introduce and classify \emph{constant rank-list} sum-rank codes, where each nonzero codeword has the same tuple of ranks, extending results from the rank-metric setting. Next, we investigate the more general \emph{constant rank-profile} codes, where, up to reordering, each nonzero codeword has the same tuple of ranks. Although a complete classification remains elusive, we present the first examples and partial structural results for this class. Finally, we consider one-weight codes that are also MSRD (Maximum Sum-Rank Distance) codes. For dimension two, constructions arise from partitions of scattered linear sets on projective lines. For dimension three, we connect their existence to that of special $2$-fold blocking sets in the projective plane, leading to new bounds and nonexistence results over certain fields.</description>
