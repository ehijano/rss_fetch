      <title>Modern physics courses: Understanding the content taught in the U.S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modern physics course is a crucial gateway for physics majors, introducing concepts beyond the scope of K-12 education. Despite its significance, content varies widely among institutions. This study analyzes 167 modern physics syllabi from 127 US research intensive institutions, employing emergent coding using both human and Natural Language Processing methods from public sources (51.5%) and private correspondence (48.5%). Public course catalogs were consulted to identify pre- and co-requisites, with 37.1% of students having completed calculus II. Foundational topics like Newtonian mechanics (94%), electricity and magnetism (84.4%), and waves or optics (77.2%) were frequently required. Quantum physics (94%), atomic physics (83%), and relativity (70%) were most commonly taught. The study highlights the lack of uniformity in modern physics curricula, emphasizing the importance of a consistent and comprehensive education for physics majors across universities. This insight contributes to the ongoing discourse on optimizing physics education in higher education.</description>

      <title>Quantum mechanics curriculum in the US: Quantifying the instructional time, content taught, and paradigms used</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics is an integral course for physics students. An understanding of quantum concepts is imperative for enrollment in physics graduate programs, participating in research within physics-fields, and employment at companies developing quantum technologies. This study analyzes 188 US research intensive institutions' course catalogs to determine the role and volume of quantum mechanics in their undergraduate physics programs. All of the institutions required one course on quantum concepts, 92% required two courses, and half required three. For institutions with complete class data (n=56), the quantum curriculum was analyzed using course syllabi. The mean number of classroom hours spent on quantum concepts was found to be 63.5 hours with a standard deviation of 28.1 hours. The most commonly taught themes in the quantum curriculum were the Schr{\"o}dinger equation and three-dimensional quantum mechanics. However, the Stern-Gerlach Experiment was only included in 28% of the course outlines. Despite current efforts to promote a spin-first approach, this study found the traditional position-first approaches were still more common as they were used by 73.7% of instructors.</description>

      <title>Serious Game for Physics as an Active and Gamified Learning Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design of a serious game is presented that served as an instrument to motivate and aid to Physics education using active and ludic learning, specifically the topic of free fall of objects, with diverse educational purposes, first to apply a set of teaching strategies focused on promoting supervised active learning and live programming and second, providing a serious game to illustrate the notions of kinematics and simulate the dynamics of rigid bodies using a video game engine. Thanks to the use of the game engine and a holistic methodology, it was possible to help Physics students implement said serious game during a semester of an introductory Physics course.</description>
