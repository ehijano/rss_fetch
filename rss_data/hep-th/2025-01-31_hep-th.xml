      <title>The gravitational index of 5d black holes and black strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The supersymmetric index of 5d black strings and spinning black holes in M-theory is related to that of 4d black holes in type IIA supergravity when both theories are compactified on the same Calabi-Yau threefold. We find the finite-temperature saddles for the 5d gravitational supersymmetric index by uplifting the recently found attractor saddles of the corresponding 4d index. We study uplifts for two types of geometries: 5d black holes and 5d black strings. For 5d black holes, the uplift guarantees that the index of 4d and 5d black holes match. For 5d black strings, the saddle reproduces the microscopic index at leading order in $G_N$ , even without the conventional decoupling limit taken in AdS/CFT. In particular, when the temperature is set to be finite in the 5d flat space region, the black string index is computed from an asymptotically flat solution where the AdS throat is absent. Further, as the temperature is lowered and eventually becomes infinitesimally small in the flat space region, the solution admits a novel decoupling limit in which the AdS$_3$ throat takes the form of a finite-temperature BTZ black hole that is known to compute the index in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$. This represents the first step towards understanding holography for supersymmetric observables in flat space, away from the decoupling limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the Penrose-Wall singularity theorem in the full semiclassical gravity regime, significantly expanding its range of validity. To accomplish this, we modify the definition of quantum-trapped surfaces without affecting their genericity. Our theorem excludes controlled "bounces" in the interior of a black hole and in a large class of cosmologies.</description>

      <title>Metric Isometries, Holography, and Continuous Symmetry Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the AdS/CFT correspondence, a topological symmetry operator of the boundary CFT is dual to a dynamical brane in the gravitational bulk. Said differently, this predicts a dynamical brane for every global symmetry of the boundary CFT. We analyze this correspondence for continuous symmetries which arise from a consistent truncation of isometries on the "internal" factor $X$ of $\text{AdS}\times X$. In the extra-dimensional geometry, these branes are associated with various metric singularities and do not arise from wrapped D-branes. Boosts relate configurations interpreted as topological symmetry operators and heavy defects in the CFT. From the perspective of the AdS factor, with gravity and bulk gauge fields, these are codimension two Gukov-Witten-like vortex configurations which are the gravity duals of 0-form symmetry operators. These effective branes come with an asymptotic tension and size which is also fully fixed by bulk dynamics. We use this higher-dimensional perspective to determine properties of the worldvolume theory for these branes. We also discuss how these considerations generalize to more general QFTs engineered via string theory which need not possess a semi-classical gravity dual.</description>

      <title>De Sitter Horizon Edge Partition Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-loop $S^{d+1}$ path integrals were shown to factorize into two parts: a bulk thermal ideal gas partition function in a $dS_{d+1}$ static patch and an edge partition function associated with degrees of freedom living on $S^{d-1}$. Here, we analyze the $\mathfrak{so}(d)$ structure of the edge partition functions for massive and massless totally symmetric tensors of arbitrary rank in any $d\geq 3$. For linearized Einstein gravity on $S^{d+1}$, we find that the edge partition function receives contributions from shift-symmetric vector and scalar fields on $S^{d-1}$ that nonlinearly realize the isometry group $SO(d+2)$ of $S^{d+1}$, suggesting a possible interpretation in terms of an embedded $S^{d-1}$ brane.</description>

      <title>The Incomprehensible Simplicity of PST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a hearsay that the PST approach to the covariant Lagrangian description of relativistic duality invariant theories is somewhat complicated. I will show, using an example of a chiral two-form field theory in six space-time dimensions, that it is actually natural and very simple. It directly stems from the Hamiltonian formulation of chiral-form theories.</description>

      <title>Defects in 4d SCFTs from supergravity and holographic renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type IIB string theory admits Janus solutions connecting $\text{AdS}_5$ vacua. These geometries correspond to interface conformal field theories and are naturally described in five-dimensional supergravity as $\text{AdS}_4$ foliations over an interval. In this work, we introduce a novel type of Janus solution in $\text{AdS}_5$, featuring $\text{AdS}_2 \times S^2$ foliations instead of $\text{AdS}_4$. We interpret these solutions as the supergravity duals of line defects in four-dimensional SCFTs and we discuss their D-brane engineering. Our primary tool is Romans supergravity in five dimensions, which provides a simple Type IIB truncation over $S^5$. Within this framework, under specific conditions, we construct regular solutions interpolating between $\text{AdS}_5$ and $\text{AdS}_2 \times \mathbb{R}^3$. These geometries represent one-parameter deformations of $\text{AdS}_5$ vacua and are characterized by a running profile for two-form gauge potentials and a scalar field in the supergravity bulk. Finally, using holographic renormalization, we explicitly compute the on-shell action of the defect and we discuss the one-point functions in the holographic field theory.</description>

      <title>Engineering of Anyons on M5-Probes via Flux Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These extended lecture notes survey a novel derivation of anyonic topological order (as seen in fractional quantum Hall systems) on single magnetized M5-branes probing Seifert orbi-singularities ("geometric engineering" of anyons), which we motivate from fundamental open problems in the field of quantum computing.
  The rigorous construction is non-Lagrangian and non-perturbative, based on previously neglected global completion of the M5-brane's tensor field by flux-quantization consistent with its non-linear self-duality and its twisting by the bulk C-field. This exists only in little-studied non-abelian generalized cohomology theories, notably in a twisted equivariant (and "twistorial") form of unstable Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis H").
  As a result, topological quantum observables form Pontrjagin homology algebras of mapping spaces from the orbi-fixed worldvolume into a classifying 2-sphere. Remarkably, results from algebraic topology imply from this the quantum observables and modular functor of abelian Chern-Simons theory, as well as braid group actions on defect anyons of the kind envisioned as hardware for topologically protected quantum gates.</description>

      <title>Conformal Dimensions On Causal Random Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interaction between matter and causal dynamical triangulations (CDT) in the context of two-dimensional quantum gravity. We focus on the Ising model coupled to CDT, contrasting this with Liouville gravity and the relation to the Knizhnik-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov (KPZ) formula. We demonstrate analytically for the quenched model that the conformal dimensions of fields on CDT align with those on a fixed lattice. We do this using a combination of lattice methods and adapting the Duplantier-Sheffield framework to CDT, emphasizing the one-dimensional nature of CDT and its description via a stochastic differential equation.</description>

      <title>Graviton loops and negativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit dispersive bounds on Wilson coefficients of scalar effective field theories (EFT) coupled to gravity in various spacetime dimensions, by computing the contributions from graviton loops to the corresponding sum rules at low energies. Fixed-momentum-transfer dispersion relations are often ill-behaved due to forward singularities arising from loop-level graviton exchange, making naive positivity bounds derived from them unreliable. Instead, we perform a careful analysis using crossing-symmetric dispersion relations, and compute the one-loop corrections to the bounds on EFT coefficients. We find that including the graviton loops generically allows for negativity of Wilson coefficients by an amount suppressed by powers of Newton's constant, $G$. The exception are the few couplings that dominate over (or are degenerate with) the graviton loops at low energies. In $D=4$, we observe that assuming that the eikonal formula captures the correct forward behavior of the amplitude at all orders in $G$, and for energies of the order of the EFT cutoff, yields bounds free of logarithmic infrared divergences.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative quantum gravity unlocked through computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Being able to perform explicit computations in a nonperturbative, Planckian regime is key to understanding quantum gravity as a fundamental theory of gravity and spacetime. Rather than a variety of different approaches to quantum gravity, what we primarily need is a gravitational analogue of the highly successful lattice treatment of nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics.
  Unsurprisingly, however, lattice quantum gravity is not simple. The crucial insight that has finally led to success is to build the dynamical and Lorentzian nature of spacetime into the lattices from the outset. Lattice quantum gravity based on causal dynamical triangulations (CDT) puts this idea into practice and is producing new and exciting physical results from numerical experiments.
  This largely nontechnical account describes the challenges and achievements of modern lattice quantum gravity, which has opened an unprecedented computational window on quantum spacetime in a Planckian regime and is reshaping our understanding of what it means to "solve" quantum gravity. This methodology is well placed to unlock the physics of the early universe from first principles. Related topics discussed are the difference between lattice and discrete quantum gravity, and the role of spacetime emergence in the light of computational results.</description>

      <title>Physics on and off the light cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study light-front physics and conformal symmetry, and their interplay both on and off the light cone. The full symmetry of the light cone is conformal symmetry not just Lorentz symmetry. Spontaneously breaking conformal symmetry gives masses to particles and takes them off the light cone. Canonical quantization specifies equal-time commutators on the light cone. Equal instant-time and equal light-front-time commutators look very different, but can be shown to be equivalent by looking at unequal-time commutators. We discuss the connection of the light-front approach to the infinite momentum frame approach, and show that vacuum graphs are outside this framework. We show that there is a light-front structure to both AdS/CFT and the eikonal approximation. While mass generation involves scale breaking mass scales, we show that such mass scales can arise via dynamical symmetry breaking in the presence of scale invariant interactions at a renormalization group fixed point.</description>

      <title>New vacuum boundary effects of massive field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytical arguments suggest that the Casimir energy in 2+1 dimensions for gauge theories exponentially decays with the distance between the boundaries. The phenomenon has also been observed by non-perturbative numerical simulations. The dependence of this exponential decay on the different boundary conditions could help to better understand the infrared behavior of these theories and in particular their mass spectrum. A similar behavior is expected in 3+1 dimensions. Motivated by this feature we analyze the dependence of the exponential decay of Casimir energy for different boundary conditions of massive scalar fields in 3+1 dimensional spacetimes. We show that the boundary conditions classify in two different families according on the rate of this exponential decay of the Casimir energy. If the boundary conditions on each boundary are independent (e.g. both boundaries satisfy Dirichlet boundary conditions), the Casimir energy has a exponential decay that is two times faster than when the boundary conditions interconnect the two boundary plates (e.g. for periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions). These results will be useful for a comparison with the Casimir energy in the non-perturbative regime of non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Holographic Correlators of Boundary/Crosscap CFTs in Two Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores holographic correlators within the frameworks of two-dimensional Boundary Conformal Field Theory (BCFT) and Crosscap Conformal Field Theory (XCFT). Utilizing the AdS/CFT correspondence, we compute stress tensor correlators in BCFT, considering both tensionless and tensionful end-of-the-world (EOW) brane scenarios. We derive recurrence relations for two-point and three-point correlators and examine the impact of non-zero brane tension on correlators. Extending these results, we investigate the holographic duals of XCFTs, presenting explicit scalar and stress tensor correlator computations on projective geometries such as $\mathbb{RP}^2$. Additionally, we analyze stress tensor correlators at a finite cutoff, uncovering deformations to one-point and two-point functions induced by the cutoff. Our findings provide novel insights into the holographic structures of BCFT and XCFT while laying the groundwork for future research into higher-dimensional extensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Working in a sector of large charge is a powerful tool to analytically access models that are either strongly coupled or otherwise difficult to solve explicitly. In the context of integrable systems, Volin's method is exactly such a large-charge approach. In this note, we apply this method to the bi-Yang-Baxter deformed $SU(2)$ principal chiral model. Our main result is an explicit expression for the free energy density as an asymptotic expansion. We moreover determine the leading non-perturbative effects both via analytic methods and a resurgence analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The color-flavor locked phase of high density QCD admits non-Abelian vortices, that are superfluid vortices with confined color-magnetic fluxes. Vortex solutions were thus far constructed in an axially symmetric Ansatz with common vortex winding in the left- and right-handed diquark condensates. In this paper, we explore vortex solutions without any Ansatz. In addition to axially symmetric configurations known before, we find that the axial symmetry is broken in certain parameter regions; in one case a single vortex is split into two chiral non-Abelian vortices, i.e. vortices with winding only in the left or right-handed diquark condensate, and they are connected by one or two domain walls forming a non-Abelian vortex molecule. In the other case, a chiral non-Abelian vortex molecule is confined inside a domain wall elongated to spatial infinity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the impact of loop effects on positivity in effective field theories emerging in the infrared from unitary and causal microscopic dynamics. Focusing on massless particles coupled to gravity, we address the treatment of forward-limit divergences from loop discontinuities and establish necessary conditions for maintaining computational control in perturbation theory. While loop effects remain small, ensuring consistency in our approach leads to a significant impact on bounds, even at tree level.</description>

      <title>Fractonic self-duality and covariant magnetic fractons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractons, excitations with restricted mobility, have emerged as a novel paradigm in high-energy and condensed matter physics, revealing deep connections to gauge theories and gravity. Here, we propose a tensorial generalization of electromagnetic duality using a doubled-potential framework with two symmetric tensor gauge fields. This approach symmetrically describes electric and magnetic sectors, introducing covariant magnetic fractons with reduced mobility and supporting a genuine fractonic self-duality. Notably, we find the absence of a Witten-like effect in the covariant fractonic case, precluding the emergence of fractonic dyons.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Weyl Superconductors with Different Pairings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian and its symmetries for a time-reversal symmetry broken three dimensional Weyl superconductor. In the limit of vanishing pairing potential, we specify that this Hamiltonian is invariant under two sets of continues symmetries, i.e. the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry and the $U(1)_A$ axial symmetry. Although a pairing of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer type spontaneously breaks both of these symmetries, we show that a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov type pairing spontaneously breaks only the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry (that is then restored via the well-known scalar phase mode of superconductivity). Consequently, in the former case, two Nambu-Goldstone modes are required in the system to restore the broken symmetries. We indicate that one of these two modes is an emergent pseudo-scalar phase mode. We also demonstrate that such a phase mode leads to a pseudo-Meissner effect.</description>

      <title>Coulomb interacting Bose-Einstein correlations in Fourier space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high-energy heavy-ion physics experiments, a state of matter is created that existed in the early Universe: the quark-gluon plasma. This strongly interacting matter exists in today's experiments only within a range of a few femtometers and for a duration of a few femtometers per speed of light, making its resolution with optical tools impossible. However, there is a method that allows for a closer look into the structure of the quark-gluon plasma: femtoscopy. Initially used in astronomy, femtoscopy is based on the quantum mechanical indistinguishability of identical particles, which causes them to arrive at detectors in a correlated manner. The measurable correlation is related to the spacetime structure of the particle-emitting source, which in heavy-ion physics is the quark-gluon plasma created in collisions. For free particles, a relatively simple relationship exists between the source and the correlation (essentially a Fourier transform). However, this relationship becomes complex when accurately accounting for the repulsive Coulomb interaction between final-state electrically charged particles. Our paper presents a new method that is more precise than previously used ones, yet less computationally demanding, especially for the exotic source function shapes. Mathematically, the method is interesting because it exactly handles many emerging integrals and limits. Practically, it is ready for use in experimental analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of a particle with vacuum fluctuations -- which theoretically exist even in the complete absence of matter -- can lead to observable irreversible decoherence, if it were possible to switch on and off the particle charge suddenly. We compute the leading order decoherence effect for such a scenario and propose an experimental setup for its detection. Such a measurement might provide further insights into the nature of vacuum fluctuations and a novel precision test for the decoherence theory.</description>

      <title>Ringdown nonlinearities in the eikonal regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eikonal limit of black hole quasinormal modes (the large multipole limit $\ell \gg 1$) can be realized geometrically as a next-to-leading order solution to the geometric optics approximation, and also as linear fluctuations about the Penrose limit plane wave adapted to the lightring. Extending this interpretation beyond the linear order in perturbation theory requires a robust understanding of quadratic quasinormal modes for large values of $\ell$. We analyze numerically the relative excitation of quadratic to linear quasinormal modes of Schwarzschild black holes, with two independent methods. Our results suggest that the ratio of quadratic to linear amplitudes for the $\ell \times \ell \to 2\ell$ channel converges towards a finite value for large $\ell$, in sharp contrast with a recent proposal inspired by the Penrose limit perspective. On the other hand, the $2 \times \ell \to \ell + 2$ channel seems to have a linearly growing ratio. Nevertheless, we show that there is no breakdown of black hole perturbation theory for physically realistic initial data.</description>

      <title>Unifying Inflation, dark energy and dark matter with a scalar field and exotic fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a new approach to unify inflation and the late universe with dark energy and dark matter formulated in a model that includes a non-Riemannian metric independent measure and a scalar field with spontaneously broken scale symmetry. Here first of all inflation is possible, which is then followed by a reheating oscillating period and this leads to the formation of all kind of particles, including fermions, which as the universe expands can contribute to the dark energy and the to the dark matter of the universe. During the inflationary epoch, we find different constraints on the parameter space associated to the effective potential of the scalar field from the observational data. After reheating the scalar field retraces its trajectory in field space but now the scalar field potential can be drastically modified by the effect of the fermions. In this sense, the present dark energy with its very small value in comparison to the inflationary phase which can be adjusted by choosing appropriately the parameter space of couplings of the Riemannian and non Riemannian measures to the fermions.</description>

      <title>Deser-Woodard nonlocal gravity in the proper tetrad frame: traversable wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Deser-Woodard model of nonlocal gravity involving four auxiliary scalar fields, introduced to explain the standard cosmological background expansion history without fine-tuning issues. In particular, we propose a novel approach to simplify the complex field equations within the proper tetrad frame, thereby recasting the original system into a more tractable equivalent differential problem. We show that, by only assuming the form of the $tt$ metric component, it is possible to reconstruct the distortion function of the gravitational model through a step-by-step procedure involving the use of either analytical, perturbative, or numerical methods. We then outline a potential strategy for solving the vacuum field equations in the case of a static and spherically symmetric spacetime. Specifically, we applied our technique to find three traversable wormholes supported purely by gravity, discussing then their main geometric properties. The obtained results provide a possible pathway for determining new compact object solutions while offering a deeper understanding of nonlocal theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>There is Room at the Top: Fundamental Quantum Limits for Detecting Ultra-high Frequency Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sky of astrophysical gravitational waves is expected to be quiet above $\sim 10{\rm kHz}$, which is the upper limit of characteristic frequencies of dynamical processes involving astrophysical black holes and neutron stars. Therefore, the ultrahigh ($\ge 10{\rm kHz}$) frequency window is particularly promising for detecting primordial gravitational waves, as isolating the contribution from the astrophysical foreground has always been a challenging problem for gravitational wave background detection at ${\rm nHz, mHz}$ and the audio band studied so far. While there are various types of detectors proposed targeting the ultra-high frequency gravitational waves, they have to satisfy the (loss-constrained) fundamental limits of quantum measurements. We develop a universal framework for the quantum limit under different measurement schemes and input quantum states, and apply them to several plausible detector configurations. The fundamental limits are expressed as the strength of gravitational wave background at different frequencies, which should serve as a lower limit for ultra-high frequency gravitational wave signal possibly detectable, to probe early-universe phase transitions, and/or other primordial gravitational wave sources. We discover that a GUT-motivated phase transition from $10^7-10^{10}\,\rm{GeV}$ can naturally lead to possibly detectable GW signals within the band of $\rm{kHz-MHz}$. For phase transition above $10^{10}\,\rm{GeV}$, the signals are however below the quantum limit and are thus not detectable. Ultra-high frequency GWs also provide a window to test topological defects such as domain walls and cosmic strings generated close to the GUT scale.</description>

      <title>Baryon construction with $\eta^\prime$ meson field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the low-energy regime, baryons with $N_f \geq 2$ have long been constructed as skyrmions or through bag models, but such constructions for $N_f = 1$ are hindered by the trivial topological structure of the meson field. Recent proposals suggest that one-flavor baryons can instead be interpreted as quantum Hall droplets on the $\eta'$ domain wall, providing a possible link to quark-hadron continuity at high density. Retrospect to the qualitative or semi-qualitative construction of one-flavor baryon on $\eta'$ domain wall, one-flavor baryons can be described as quantum Hall droplets, resemble topological solitons, akin to skyrmions. Using the effective theory on the $\eta'$ domain wall which is conjectured to be the Chern-Simons-Higgs theory, it is discussed that its vortex solution with unit baryon number naturally has spin $N_c/2$ thus can be interpreted as baryon or multi-baryon structure, while particle-vortex duality suggests that quarks carry a fractional topological charge $1/N_c$ and obey fractional statistics. In terms of chiral bag models, confinement can be attributed to the monopoles confined within the bag, and the vector meson fields on the bag surface are essential for ensuring the correct baryon number in the chiral bag framework and thus provide deeper insights into baryons as nontrivial topological structures of the meson field. In this paper, we review the progress in this development with special interests in the $\eta^\prime$ domain wall dynamics. Naive extensions to $N_f\geq 2$ are also concerned.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beyond leading-order, perturbative QCD requires a choice of factorisation scheme to define the parton distribution functions (PDFs) and hard-process cross-section. The modified minimal-subtraction ($\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$) scheme has long been adopted as the default choice due to its simplicity. Alternative schemes have been proposed with specific purposes, including, recently, PDF positivity and NLO parton-shower matching. In this paper we assemble these schemes in a common notation for the first time. We perform a detailed comparison of their features, both analytically and numerically, and estimate the resulting factorisation-scheme uncertainty for LHC phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Cosmological quantum mechanics on FLRW spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply our recent formulation of general relativistic quantum mechanics to the case of an FLRW cosmological background. The formalism comes from noncommutative geometry and provides an operator version of the equations of a geodesic, while its Schroedinger picture has wave functions on spacetime and evolution by the Klein-Gordon operator and with respect to geodesic proper time. Stationary states in this Klein-Gordon quantum mechanics are solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation for different eigenvalues and in the case of positive spatial curvature we find a discrete spectrum of cosmological atom-like modes. For nonstationary states, we show that the system can be factorised and appears for each spatial Laplacian eigenvector as a novel 1-dimensional quantum system on the time axis with potential $1/a(t)^2$, where $a(t)$ is the Friedmann expansion factor. We also show how this is relevant to quantum mechanics on space with respect to time $t$, identifying potentially new physics when the Hubble constant exceeds $2/3$ of the particle mass, as typically occurs during inflation. We also find washout of the evolution of spatial observables at late times and a backward-traveling reflected mode generated when the value of $H$ transitions to a larger value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor-network methods are valuable Hamiltonian-simulation methods which enable probing dynamics of strongly-interacting quantum-many-body systems, including gauge theories, without encountering sign problems. They also have the potential to inform efficient quantum-simulation algorithms of the same theories. We develop and benchmark a matrix-product-state (MPS) ansatz for the SU(2) lattice gauge theory using the loop-string-hadron (LSH) framework. The LSH framework has been demonstrated to be advantageous in Hamiltonian simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories. It is applicable to varying gauge groups [SU(2) and SU(3)], boundary conditions, and in higher dimensions. In this work, we report on progress in achieving the continuum limit of the static observables in a SU(2) gauge theory in (1+1) D and pushing the boundary of dynamical studies. The current toolbox can be applied to studying scattering processes in this model. It can also be straightforwardly generalized to (2+1)D given the simplified constraints in an LSH framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we use the latest cosmological observations, including SNe, BAO, CC and RSD, to reconstruct the cosmological evolution via the Gaussian process. At the background level, we find consistency with the quintom dynamics for different data combinations and divide the characteristics of dark energy into three different categories, which are negative-energy dark energy, late-dominated dark energy and oscillating dark energy, respectively. Considering the effect of modified gravity on the growth of matter perturbations, the reconstruction results at the perturbative level show that we only need minor corrections to general relativity. Furthermore, we provide theoretical interpretation for the three different types of dynamical dark-energy behavior, in the framework of modified gravity, scalar fields, and dark-energy equation-of-state parametrizations. Finally, we show that all of these models can be unified in the framework of effective field theory.</description>

      <title>Global Structure in the Presence of a Topological Defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the global structure of topological defects which wrap a submanifold $F\subset M$ in a quantum field theory defined on a closed manifold $M$. The Pontryagin-Thom construction oversees the interplay between the global structure of $F$ and the global structure of $M$. We will employ this construction to two distinct mathematical frameworks with physical applications. The first framework is the concept of a characteristic structure, consisting of the data of pairs of manifolds $(M,F)$ where $F$ is Poincar\'e dual to some characteristic class. This concept is discussed in the mathematics literature, and shown here to have meaningful physical interpretations related to defects. In our examples we will mainly focus on the case where $M$ is 4-dimensional and $F$ has codimension 2. The second framework uses obstruction theory and the fact that spontaneously broken finite symmetries leave behind domain walls, to determine the conditions on which dimensions a higher-form finite symmetry can spontaneously break. We explicitly study the cases of higher-form $\mathbb Z/2$ symmetry, but the method can be generalized to other groups.</description>

Abstract: A growing number of applications in particle physics and beyond use neural networks as unbinned likelihood ratio estimators applied to real or simulated data. Precision requirements on the inference tasks demand a high-level of stability from these networks, which are affected by the stochastic nature of training. We show how physics concepts can be used to stabilize network training through a physics-inspired optimizer. In particular, the Energy Conserving Descent (ECD) optimization framework uses classical Hamiltonian dynamics on the space of network parameters to reduce the dependence on the initial conditions while also stabilizing the result near the minimum of the loss function. We develop a version of this optimizer known as $ECD_{q=1}$, which has few free hyperparameters with limited ranges guided by physical reasoning. We apply $ECD_{q=1}$ to representative likelihood-ratio estimation tasks in particle physics and find that it out-performs the widely-used Adam optimizer. We expect that ECD will be a useful tool for wide array of data-limited problems, where it is computationally expensive to exhaustively optimize hyperparameters and mitigate fluctuations with ensembling.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian catalysis of density-wave orders on Euclidean and hyperbolic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depending on the lattice geometry, the nearest-neighbor (NN) tight-binding model for free fermions gives rise to particle-hole symmetric emergent Dirac liquid, Fermi liquid, and flat bands near the half-filling or zero-energy on bipartite Euclidean and hyperbolic lattices, respectively embedded on the flat and negatively curved spaces. Such noninteracting electronic fluids are characterized by a vanishing, a finite, and a diverging density of states near half-filling, respectively. A non-Hermitian generalization of this scenario resulting from an imbalance of the hopping amplitudes in the opposite directions between any pair of NN sites continues to accommodate a real eigenvalue spectrum over an extended non-Hermitian parameter regime. Most importantly, it reduces the band width without altering the characteristic scaling of the density of states close to the zero-energy. Here, we show that on two-dimensional bipartite Euclidean and hyperbolic lattices such a non-Hermiticity catalyzes the formation of both charge-density-wave and spin-density-wave orders at weaker (in comparison to the counterparts in conventional or Hermitian systems) NN Coulomb and on-site Hubbard repulsions, respectively. These two ordered states correspond to staggered patterns of average electronic density and spin between the NN sites, respectively, and both cause insulation in half-filled systems. We arrive at these conclusions by combining biorthogonal quantum mechanics and lattice-based self-consistent numerical mean-field analysis in the Hartree channel. We discuss the scaling of the associated mass gaps near the zero-energy with the non-Hermitian parameter, and also address the finite size scaling of the order parameters specifically on hyperbolic lattices with open boundary conditions. A robust general mathematical criterion for the proposed non-Hermitian catalysis mechanism for ordered phases is showcased.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a model for the initial state of the universe based on a gravitational path integral that includes connected geometries which simultaneously produce bra and ket of the wave function. We argue that a natural object to describe this state is the Wigner distribution, which is a function on a classical phase space obtained by a certain integral transform of the density matrix. We work with Lorentzian de Sitter Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity in which we find semiclassical saddle-points for pure gravity, as well as when we include matter components such as a CFT and a classical inflaton field. We also discuss different choices of fixing time reparametrizations. In the regime of large universes our connected geometry dominates over the Hartle-Hawking saddle and gives a distribution that has a meaningful probabilistic interpretation for local observables. It does not, however, give a normalizable probability measure on the entire phase space of the theory.</description>

      <title>$\beta$ symmetry of heterotic supergravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The low energy effective action describing the Kaluza-Klein reduction of string theory on a $d$-torus possesses a continuous O($d, d$) global symmetry. The non-geometric piece of this symmetry, parameterized by a bi-vector $\beta$, was recently shown to effectively act as a hidden symmetry on the massless RR and universal NSNS fields of the ten dimensional parent theory, fixing their couplings. Here we extend the analysis of this symmetry to the massless gauge and fermion fields of heterotic supergravity. While the interactions of the boson fields are univocally fixed by $\beta$ symmetry, we find four bilinear and two quartic $\beta$ invariant combinations of fermions whose relative coefficients in the action must be determined by supersymmetry. Although not fully fixed, bilinear and quartic fermion couplings are strongly restricted by $\beta$ symmetry at leading order in $\alpha'$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore and analyze bulk geometric aspects corresponding to a driven two-dimensional holographic CFT, where the drive Hamiltonian is constructed from the $sl^{(q)}(2,\mathbb{R})$ generators. In particular, we demonstrate that starting with a thermal initial state, the evolution of the event horizon is characterized by distinct geometric transformations in the bulk which are associated to the conjugacy classes of the corresponding transformations on the CFT. Namely, the bulk evolution of the horizon is geometrically classified into an oscillatory (non-heating) behaviour, an exponentially growing (heating) behaviour and a power-law growth with an angular rotation (the phase boundary), all as a function of the stroboscopic time. We also show that the explicit symmetry breaking of the drive is manifest in a flowery structure of the event horizon that displays a $U(1) \to {\mathbb Z}_q$ symmetry breaking. In the $q\to \infty$ limit, the $U(1)$ symmetry is effectively restored. Furthermore, by analyzing the integral curves generated by the asymptotic Killing vectors, we also demonstrate how the fixed points of these curves approximate a bulk Ryu-Takayanagi surface corresponding to a modular Hamiltonian for a sub-region in the CFT. Since the CFT modular Hamiltonian has an infinitely many in-equivalent extensions in the bulk, the fixed points of the integral curves can also lie outside the entanglement wedge of the CFT sub-region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study perturbative Wilsonian renormalisation group (RG) for the scalar $\phi^4$ theory at finite temperature to one loop order in the Schwinger-Keldysh closed-time-path (CTP) formalism. By explicitly integrating out the UV modes, we show how effective interactions coupling the two branches of the CTP contour arise. This provides a microscopic derivation of the type of effective CTP actions used in the literature. While the full effective theory has no critical points, we instead proceed to study critical properties of the RG flow in a reduced space of complex couplings that characterise certain time-ordered correlators and show the existence of two novel fixed points in $d=4$ spacetime dimensions. We relate one to the Wilson-Fisher fixed point known to exist only in $4-\epsilon$ dimensions, and the other to the standard Gaussian fixed point.</description>

      <title>High-Quality Axions from Higher-Form Symmetries in Extra Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extra-dimensional axion solves the strong CP problem while largely circumventing the quality problem that plagues its four-dimensional counterparts. Such high quality can be clearly understood in terms of the generalized global symmetries of the higher-dimensional theory. We emphasize that an electric one-form symmetry is entirely responsible for protecting the potential of axions arising from 5D gauge theories and use this to systematically characterize the extra-dimensional axion quality problem. We identify three ways of breaking this one-form symmetry to generate an axion potential: adding electrically charged matter, gauging a magnetic higher-form symmetry, and turning on an ABJ anomaly. In the latter case, we identify new ways of generating an axion potential via extra-dimensional magnetic monopoles. We also discuss how the axion is modified if the protective electric one-form symmetry is itself gauged. Finally, we relate these effects to gravitational expectations for the quality problem via generalized weak gravity conjectures. The clarity that generalized symmetries bring to the extra-dimensional axion quality problem highlights their relevance to particle phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Primordial regular black holes as all the dark matter. II. Non-time-radial-symmetric and loop quantum gravity-inspired metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02807v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is a common belief that a theory of quantum gravity should ultimately cure curvature singularities which are inevitable within General Relativity, and plague for instance the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics, usually considered as prototypes for primordial black holes (PBHs) as dark matter (DM) candidates. We continue our study, initiated in a companion paper, of non-singular objects as PBHs, considering three regular non-tr (non-time-radial)-symmetric metrics, all of which are one-parameter extensions of the Schwarzschild space-time: the Simpson-Visser, Peltola-Kunstatter, and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli space-times, with the latter two motivated by loop quantum gravity. We study evaporation constraints on PBHs described by these regular metrics, deriving upper limits on $f_{\text{pbh}}$, the fraction of DM in the form of PBHs. Compared to their Schwarzschild counterparts, these limits are weaker, and result in a larger asteroid mass window where all the DM can be in the form of PBHs, with the lower edge moving potentially more than an order of magnitude. Our work demonstrates as a proof-of-principle that quantum gravity-inspired space-times can simultaneously play an important role in the resolution of singularities and in the DM problem.</description>

      <title>Eisenhart Lift for Scalar Fields in the FLRW Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Eisenhart lift of Riemannian type describes the motion of a particle as a geodesic in a higher-dimensional Riemannian manifold with one additional coordinate. It has recently been generalized to a scalar field system by introducing one additional vector field. We apply this approach to a scalar field system in the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe and classify the symmetries of the system. In particular, for a scalar field potential consisting of the square of a combination of exponential functions with specific index $e^{\pm\frac{\sqrt{6}}{4}\phi}$, we find nontrivial (conformal) Killing vector fields and Killing tensor fields. Moreover, for a potential written as an exponentiation of a combination of exponential potentials with general index, we find nontrivial conformal Killing vector fields. By introducing the coordinate along the conformal Killing vector field, we can solve the equations of motion completely. We also classify the symmetries of multiple scalar field system.</description>

      <title>Threefold Way for Typical Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A typical quantum state with no symmetry can be realized by letting a random unitary act on a fixed state, and the subsystem entanglement spectrum follows the Laguerre unitary ensemble (LUE). For integer-spin time reversal symmetry, we have an analogous scenario where we prepare a time-reversal symmetric state and let random orthogonal matrices act on it, leading to the Laguerre orthogonal ensemble (LOE). However, for half-integer-spin time reversal symmetry, a straightforward analogue leading to the Laguerre symplectic ensemble (LSE) is no longer valid due to that time reversal symmetric state is forbidden by the Kramers' theorem. We devise a system in which the global time reversal operator is fractionalized on the subsystems, and show that LSE arises in the system. Extending this idea, we incorporate general symmetry fractionalization into the system, and show that the statistics of the entanglement spectrum is decomposed into a direct sum of LOE, LUE, and/or LSE. Here, various degeneracies in the entanglement spectrum may appear, depending on the non-Abelian nature of the symmetry group and the cohomology class of the non-trivial projective representation on the subsystem. Our work establishes the entanglement counterpart of the Dyson's threefold way for Hamiltonians with symmetries.</description>

      <title>Is the finite temperature effective potential, effective for dynamics?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21633v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the applicability of the finite temperature effective potential in the equation of motion of a homogeneous "misaligned" scalar condensate $\varphi$, and find important caveats that severely restrict its domain of validity: i:) the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) is in general not warranted, ii:) we show a direct relation between the effective potential and the thermodynamic entropy density $\mathcal{S}= - \partial V_{eff}(T,\varphi)/\partial T$, which entails that for a dynamical $\varphi(t)$ the entropy becomes a non-monotonic function of time, iii:) parametric instabilities in both cases with and without spontaneous symmetry breaking lead to profuse particle production with non-thermal distribution functions, iv:) in the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking spinodal instabilities yield a complex effective potential, internal energy and entropy, an untenable situation in thermodynamics. All these caveats associated with dynamical aspects, cannot be overcome by finite temperature equilibrium resummation schemes. We argue that the dynamics of the condensate leads to decoupling and freeze-out from (LTE), and propose a closed quantum system approach based on unitary time evolution. It yields the correct equations of motion without the caveats of the effective potential, and provides a fully renormalized and thermodynamically consistent framework to study the dynamics of the "misaligned" condensate, with real and conserved energy and entropy amenable to numerical study. The evolution of the condensate leads to profuse stimulated particle production with non-thermal distribution functions. Possible emergent asymptotic non-thermal states and eventual re-thermalization are conjectured.</description>

Abstract: We report on the ongoing study of symmetry of $N_f=2$ QCD around the critical temperature. Our simulations of $N_f = 2$ QCD employ the M\"obius domain-wall fermion action with residual mass $\sim 1\mbox{MeV}$ or less, maintaining a good chiral symmetry. Using the screening masses from the two point spatial correlators we compare the mass difference between channels connected through various symmetry transformations. Our analysis focuses on restoration of the $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ as well as anomalously broken axial $U(1)_A$. We also present additional study of a potential $SU(2)_{CS}$ symmetry which may emerge at sufficiently high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Theory of Irreversibility in Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the longstanding challenge in quantum many-body theory of reconciling unitary dynamics with irreversible relaxation. In classical chaos, the unitary evolution operator develops Ruelle-Pollicott (RP) resonances inside the unit circle in the continuum limit, leading to mixing. In the semiclassical limit, chaotic single-particle quantum systems relax with the same RP resonances. In contrast, the theory of quantum many-body RP resonances and their link to irreversibility remain underdeveloped. Here, we relate the spectral form factor to the sum of autocorrelation functions and, in generic many-body lattice systems without conservation laws, argue that all quantum many-body RP resonances converge inside the unit disk, highlighting the role of nonunitary and the thermodynamic limit. While we conjecture this picture to be general, we analytically prove the emergence of irreversibility in the random phase model (RPM), a paradigmatic Floquet quantum circuit model, in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension. To this end, we couple it to local environments and compute the exact time evolution of autocorrelation functions, the dissipative form factor, and out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs). Although valid for any dissipation strength, we then focus on weak dissipation to clarify the origin of irreversibility in unitary systems. When the dissipationless limit is taken after the thermodynamic limit, the unitary quantum map develops an infinite tower of decaying RP resonances -- chaotic systems display so-called anomalous relaxation. We also show that the OTOC in the RPM can undergo a two-stage relaxation and that during the second stage, the approach to the stationary value is again controlled by the leading RP resonance.

Concentrated in a decade, they mark the transition of the theory of strong interactions from a set of loosely connected ideas based on models, to a quantum field theory that is now an integral part of the standard model of fundamental interactions. Parisi's contributions have established at a very early stage ideas, methods and tools that are now standard, and in several cases anticipated results that only became prominent in the XXIst century.</description>
