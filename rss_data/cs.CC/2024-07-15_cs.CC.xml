      <title>On Equivalence of Parameterized Inapproximability of k-Median, k-Max-Coverage, and 2-CSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameterized Inapproximability Hypothesis (PIH) is a central question in the field of parameterized complexity. PIH asserts that given as input a 2-CSP on $k$ variables and alphabet size $n$, it is W[1]-hard parameterized by $k$ to distinguish if the input is perfectly satisfiable or if every assignment to the input violates 1% of the constraints.
  An important implication of PIH is that it yields the tight parameterized inapproximability of the $k$-maxcoverage problem. In the $k$-maxcoverage problem, we are given as input a set system, a threshold $\tau&gt;0$, and a parameter $k$ and the goal is to determine if there exist $k$ sets in the input whose union is at least $\tau$ fraction of the entire universe. PIH is known to imply that it is W[1]-hard parameterized by $k$ to distinguish if there are $k$ input sets whose union is at least $\tau$ fraction of the universe or if the union of every $k$ input sets is not much larger than $\tau\cdot (1-\frac{1}{e})$ fraction of the universe.
  In this work we present a gap preserving FPT reduction (in the reverse direction) from the $k$-maxcoverage problem to the aforementioned 2-CSP problem, thus showing that the assertion that approximating the $k$-maxcoverage problem to some constant factor is W[1]-hard implies PIH. In addition, we present a gap preserving FPT reduction from the $k$-median problem (in general metrics) to the $k$-maxcoverage problem, further highlighting the power of gap preserving FPT reductions over classical gap preserving polynomial time reductions.</description>

      <title>Limitations of Affine Integer Relaxations for Solving Constraint Satisfaction Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that various known algorithms for finite-domain constraint satisfaction problems (CSP), which are based on solving systems of linear equations over the integers, fail to solve all tractable CSPs correctly. The algorithms include $\mathbb{Z}$-affine $k$-consistency, BLP+AIP, every fixed level of the BA$^{k}$-hierarchy, and the CLAP algorithm. In particular, we refute the conjecture by Dalmau and Opr\v{s}al that there is a fixed constant $k$ such that the $\mathbb{Z}$-affine $k$-consistency algorithm solves all tractable finite domain CSPs.</description>

      <title>Simple Linear Loops: Algebraic Invariants and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic generation of loop invariants is a fundamental challenge in software verification. While this task is undecidable in general, it is decidable for certain restricted classes of programs. This work focuses on invariant generation for (branching-free) loops with a single linear update.
  Our primary contribution is a polynomial-space algorithm that computes the strongest algebraic invariant for simple linear loops, generating all polynomial equations that hold among program variables across all reachable states. The key to achieving our complexity bounds lies in mitigating the blowup associated with variable elimination and Gr\"obner basis computation, as seen in prior works. Our procedure runs in polynomial time when the number of program variables is fixed.
  We examine various applications of our results on invariant generation, focusing on invariant verification and loop synthesis. The invariant verification problem investigates whether a polynomial ideal defining an algebraic set serves as an invariant for a given linear loop. We show that this problem is coNP-complete and lies in PSPACE when the input ideal is given in dense or sparse representations, respectively. In the context of loop synthesis, we aim to construct a loop with an infinite set of reachable states that upholds a specified algebraic property as an invariant. The strong synthesis variant of this problem requires the construction of loops for which the given property is the strongest invariant. In terms of hardness, synthesising loops over integers (or rationals) is as hard as Hilbert's Tenth problem (or its analogue over the rationals). When loop constants are constrained to bit-bounded rational numbers, we demonstrate that loop synthesis and its strong variant are both decidable in PSPACE, and in NP when the number of program variables is fixed.</description>

      <title>Optimization of DNN-based speaker verification model through efficient quantization technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) rapidly advance in various fields, including speech verification, they typically involve high computational costs and substantial memory consumption, which can be challenging to manage on mobile systems. Quantization of deep models offers a means to reduce both computational and memory expenses. Our research proposes an optimization framework for the quantization of the speaker verification model. By analyzing performance changes and model size reductions in each layer of a pre-trained speaker verification model, we have effectively minimized performance degradation while significantly reducing the model size. Our quantization algorithm is the first attempt to maintain the performance of the state-of-the-art pre-trained speaker verification model, ECAPATDNN, while significantly compressing its model size. Overall, our quantization approach resulted in reducing the model size by half, with an increase in EER limited to 0.07%.</description>

      <title>Convergence in total variation for the kinetic Langevin algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove non asymptotic total variation estimates for the kinetic Langevin algorithm in high dimension when the target measure satisfies a Poincar\'e inequality and has gradient Lipschitz potential. The main point is that the estimate improves significantly upon the corresponding bound for the non kinetic version of the algorithm, due to Dalalyan. In particular the dimension dependence drops from $O(n)$ to $O(\sqrt n)$.</description>

      <title>Positivity of the symmetric group characters is as hard as the polynomial time hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.05423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that deciding the vanishing of the character of the symmetric group is $C_=P$-complete. We use this hardness result to prove that the the square of the character is not contained in $\#P$, unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the second level. This rules out the existence of any (unsigned) combinatorial description for the square of the characters. As a byproduct of our proof we conclude that deciding positivity of the character is $PP$-complete under many-one reductions, and hence $PH$-hard under Turing-reductions.</description>
