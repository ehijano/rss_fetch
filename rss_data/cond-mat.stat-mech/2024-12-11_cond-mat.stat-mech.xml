      <title>Introduction of Additive Particle Theory for Path Integral Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Path integral approaches have been used for boson and fermion systems. The path integral approach has been successful in the many-boson system. However, in the many-fermion system, the path integral approach is not feasible due to the sign problem. In this letter, I introduce additive particle (AP) theory in order to generate an approximation method that avoids the sign problem. The AP theory considers one electron as a string polymer and virtual particles are added into the system. The AP theory is an approximation, but it is constructed to be able to generate the pair distribution function between free electrons and the density of states of the free electrons at an arbitrary temperature. Hence, when the electrostatic interactions are decreased, the AP theory converges to the free electron system. On the other hand, it deviates from the actual system when the electrostatic interactions are increased.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature series expansion of square lattice Ising model: A study based on Fisher zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-temperature expansion of Ising model has long been a topic of significant interest in condensed matter and statistical physics. In this paper we present new results of the coefficients in the low-temperature series of the Ising partition function on the square lattice, in the cases of a zero field and of an imaginary field $i(\pi/2)k_BT$. The coefficients in the low-temperature series of the free energy in the thermodynamic limit are represented using the explicit expression of the density function of the Fisher zeros. The asymptotic behaviour of the sequence of the coefficients when the order goes to infinity is determined exactly, for both the series of the free energy and of the partition function. Our analytic and numerical results demonstrate that, the convergence radius of the sequence is dependent on the accumulation points of the Fisher zeros which have the smallest modulus. In the zero field case this accumulation point is the physical critical point, while in the imaginary field case it corresponds to a non-physical singularity. We further discuss the relation between the series coefficients and the energy state degeneracies, using the combinatorial expression of the coefficients and the subgraph expansion.</description>

      <title>Critical exponents at the Nishimori point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nishimori point of the random bond Ising model is a prototype of renormalization group fixed points with strong disorder. We show that the exact correlation length and crossover critical exponents at this point can be identified in two and three spatial dimensions starting from properties of the Nishimori line. These are the first exact exponents for frustrated random magnets, a circumstance to be also contrasted with the fact that the exact exponents of the Ising model without disorder are not known in three dimensions. Our considerations extend to higher dimensions and models other than Ising.</description>

      <title>Controlling discrete time crystals via single-site operations in zero-field diamond quantum simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete time crystals (DTCs) have emerged as novel nonequilibrium phases of matter that spontaneously break discrete time-translation symmetry in periodically driven systems. Rigorous experimental validation of DTCs, which requires highly controllable quantum simulators, has stimulated extensive research across diverse fields in condensed matter physics and quantum information technologies. Among these advances, DTCs were demonstrated in a hybrid spin register within diamond, comprising a processor spin and surrounding memory spins. However, in conventional strategies involving a bias magnetic field, the field application effectively restricts the controllability of the processor spin. This limitation can be a significant barrier to the next goal of DTCs: achieving multifunctionality through enhanced local controllability. In this study, we theoretically propose multiple DTC protocols through the design of specific single-site control within the entire system. To this end, we consider a concrete model of a diamond-based quantum simulator operating without a bias magnetic field, thereby eliminating the restrictions on the processor spin. Our findings demonstrate that single-site operations enable access to DTCs with multiple distinct features in terms of periodicity and lifetime. Therefore, this approach provides a promising platform for creating diverse DTCs induced by single-site operations.</description>

      <title>KPZ-like scaling on a high-dimensional hypersphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the orientational diffusion controlled by the hyperspherical Laplacian, $\nabla^2_D$, on the surface of the $D$--dimensional hypersphere in the limit $D \to \infty$. We find that for stretched paths with lengths relatively short compared to the hypersphere's radius, the finite-size corrections in orientational correlations are controlled by the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) scaling exponent, $\gamma = 1/3$. In addition, we speculate about the topology of the orientational target space representing the surface of the hypersphere.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic theory for a double layer capacitance in concentrated ionic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effect of an oscillatory decay of the charge density in concentrated ionic solutions and ionic liquids on the double-layer capacitance is studied in a framework of a mesoscopic theory. Only Coulomb and steric forces between the ions that are present in all ionic systems are taken into account. We show that the charge oscillations lead to a rescaled distance between the electrode and the virtual monolayer of counterions in the Helmholtz capacitance, and the scaling factor depends on the period of the charge oscillations.
  Our very simple formula for large density of ions and small voltage can serve as a reference point for the double layer capacitance in concentrated ionic solutions and ionic liquids, and can help to disentangle the universal and specific contributions to the capacitance in particular systems.</description>

      <title>Anti-thermalization: Heating by cooling and vice versa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Common intuition tells us that if one part of a connected system is cooled continuously, the other parts should also cool down. This intuition can be given a microscopic foundation for the case of a generic quantum system coupled to a "lead" that is maintained at a given temperature. We show that by suppressing resonant energy exchange between the two parts, one can reverse the fate of the system, namely, it can heat up toward its most excited state as the lead is cooled to its ground state, and vice versa. This anti-thermal dynamics arises in a broad class of systems with a conserved $U(1)$ charge, and can be tested with two qubits in existing setups. We show that the mechanism allows one to prepare mid-spectrum nonclassical states, stable temperature gradients in closed systems, and highly athermal states where subspaces heat in the presence of overall cooling. Our findings highlight the critical role played by the nature of the coupling and reveal a rich interplay between symmetry and resonance effects in the dynamics of thermalization.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation Theorems for Heat exchanges between passive and active baths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addition to providing general constraints on probability distributions, fluctuation theorems allow to infer essential information on the role played by temperature in heat exchange phenomena. In this numerical study, we measure the temperature of an out of equilibrium active bath using a fluctuation theorem that relates the fluctuations of the heat exchanged between two baths to their temperatures. Our setup consists of a single particle moving between two wells of a quartic potential accommodating two different baths. The heat exchanged between the two baths is monitored according to two definitions: as the kinetic energy carried by the particle whenever it jumps from one well to the other and as the work performed by the particle on one of the two baths when immersed in it. First, we consider two equilibrium baths at two different temperatures and verify that a fluctuation theorem featuring the baths temperatures holds for both heat definitions. Then, we introduce an additional Gaussian coloured noise in one of the baths, so as to make it effectively an active (out-of-equilibrium) bath. We find that a fluctuation theorem is still satisfied with both heat definitions. Interestingly, in this case the temperature obtained through the fluctuation theorem for the active bath corresponds to the kinetic temperature when considering the first heat definition, while it is larger with the second one. We interpret these results by looking at the particle jump phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Work fluctuations for a confined Brownian particle: the role of initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the large fluctuations of the work injected by the random force into a Brownian particle under the action of a confining harmonic potential. In particular, we compute analytically the rate function for generic uncorrelated initial conditions, showing that, depending on the initial spread, it can exhibit no, one, or two singularities associated to the onset of linear tails. A dependence on the potential strength is observed for large initial spreads (entailing two singularities), which is lost for stationary initial conditions (giving one singularity) and concentrated initial values (no singularity). We discuss the mechanism responsible for the singularities of the rate function, identifying it as a big jump in the initial values. Analytical results are corroborated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that reaction-diffusion processes in three dimensions can be efficiently handled by event-driven numerical simulations, based on statistical waiting times (Gillespie's Monte-Carlo method). The algorithm is efficient for dilute systems, since diffusion is not simulated, only the result of diffusion between events needs to be implemented.</description>

      <title>Continuous order-to-order quantum phase transitions from fixed-point annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central concept in the theory of phase transitions beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm is fractionalization: the formation of new quasiparticles that interact via emergent gauge fields. This concept has been extensively explored in the context of continuous quantum phase transitions between distinct orders that break different symmetries. We propose a mechanism for continuous order-to-order quantum phase transitions that operates independently of fractionalization. This mechanism is based on the collision and annihilation of two renormalization group fixed points: a quantum critical fixed point and an infrared stable fixed point. The annihilation of these fixed points rearranges the flow topology, eliminating the disordered phase associated with the infrared stable fixed point and promoting a second critical fixed point, unaffected by the collision, to a quantum critical point between distinct orders. We argue that this mechanism is relevant to a broad spectrum of physical systems. In particular, it can manifest in Luttinger fermion systems in three spatial dimensions, leading to a continuous quantum phase transition between an antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal state, which breaks time-reversal symmetry, and a nematic topological insulator, characterized by broken lattice rotational symmetry. This continuous antiferromagnetic-Weyl-to-nematic-insulator transition might be observed in rare-earth pyrochlore iridates $R_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$. Other possible realizations include kagome quantum magnets, quantum impurity models, and quantum chromodynamics with supplemental four-fermion interactions.</description>

      <title>The long-range origin of the black hole entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, has emerged as a powerful tool for exploring the quantum nature of black holes, particularly their residual entropy at zero temperature. In this work, we investigate the role of long-range interactions in a chain of SYK dots with power-law decaying couplings and demonstrate how these interactions can lead to finite residual entropy in the strong non-local case. Indeed, as a function of the interaction range, the black-hole phase, found in the isolated SYK, melts into a long-range Fermi-liquid phase in the weak long-range regime and finally reaches the non Fermi-liquid phase in the purely local case. Our results pave the way to the understanding of the role of the interaction range in black hole thermodynamics and quantum information.</description>

      <title>Rapid optimal work extraction from a quantum-dot information engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conversion of thermal energy into work is usually more efficient in the slow-driving regime, where the power output is vanishingly small. Efficient work extraction for fast driving protocols remains an outstanding challenge at the nanoscale, where fluctuations play a significant role. In this Letter, we use a quantum-dot Szilard engine to extract work from thermal fluctuations with maximum efficiency over two decades of driving speed. We design and implement a family of optimised protocols ranging from the slow- to the fast-driving regime, and measure the engine's efficiency as well as the mean and variance of its power output in each case. These optimised protocols exhibit significant improvements in power and efficiency compared to the naive approach. Our results also show that, when optimising for efficiency, boosting the power output of a Szilard engine inevitably comes at the cost of increased power fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Entrywise application of non-linear functions on orthogonally invariant matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate how the entrywise application of a non-linear function to symmetric orthogonally invariant random matrix ensembles alters the spectral distribution. We treat also the multivariate case where we apply multivariate functions to entries of several orthogonally invariant matrices; where even correlations between the matrices are allowed. We find that in all those cases a Gaussian equivalence principle holds, that is, the asymptotic effect of the non-linear function is the same as taking a linear combination of the involved matrices and an additional independent GOE. The ReLU-function in the case of one matrix and the max-function in the case of two matrices provide illustrative examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following seminal work by J. Fr\"ohlich and T. Spencer on the critical exponent $\alpha=2$, we give a proof via contours of phase transition in the one-dimensional long-range ferromagnetic Ising model in the entire region of decay, where phase transition is known to occur, i.e., polynomial decay $\alpha \in (1,2]$. No assumptions that the nearest-neighbor interaction $J(1)$ is large are made. The robustness of the method also yields a proof of phase transition in the presence of a nonsummable external field that decays sufficiently fast.</description>

      <title>Ultimate precision limit of quantum thermal machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancing the precision of a thermodynamic process inevitably necessitates a thermodynamic cost - a principle formulated as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. In stochastic thermodynamics, the thermodynamic uncertainty relation revealed a trade-off between the relative variance of a thermodynamic current and the entropy production. Although the thermodynamic uncertainty relation states that infinitely-large entropy production enables unbounded precision improvements, this is infeasible in reality. In this Letter, we establish the ultimate limits of precision for open quantum thermal machines operating within a finite-dimensional system and environment. We derive bounds on the relative variance and the expectation of observables, applicable to any unitary evolution of the composite system. These bounds are governed by the minimum eigenvalue factor, which serves as a maximal entropy production attainable by the quantum dynamics and parallels the concept of dynamical activity in classical stochastic thermodynamic. Our findings provide insights into fundamental limits on the precision of quantum thermal machines.</description>

      <title>Quasi-universal behaviour of shear relaxation times in simple fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the shear relaxation times in four important simple monatomic model fluids: Lennard-Jones, Yukawa, soft-sphere and hard-sphere fluids. It is observed that in properly reduced units, the shear relaxation times exhibit quasi-universal behaviour when the density increases from the gas-like low values to the high-density regime near crystallization. They first decrease with density at low densities, reach minima at moderate densities, and then increase toward the freezing point. The reduced relaxation times at the minima and at the fluid-solid phase transition are all comparable for the various systems investigated, despite more than ten orders of magnitude difference in real systems. Important implications of these results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Effects of diameter polydispersity and small-range interactions on the structure of biocompatible colloidal nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The particles of synthetic colloids are usually treated with chemical techniques to prevent the loss of colloidal stability caused by van der Waals and magnetic dipolar attractive interactions. However, understanding the counterbalance between the attractive and repulsive interactions is challenging due to the limitations of the conventional mesoscopic models at short nanoparticle separations. In this study, we examined three models that describe short-range interactions by proposing different corrections to the van der Waals energy for short distances. The three models show only a minimal deviation from energy extensivity, as expected of a system with a comparatively short interaction range. Our analysis shows that a more detailed microscopic model at short-range separations is crucial for proper sampling, which is necessary to estimate physical quantities adequately. The same model predicts that polydispersity can lead to an overall decrease in mean particle distance for a configuration with 5% colloidal volume fraction. The other, simpler models make the opposite prediction, which opens an interesting venue for experimental exploration that could shed light on the validity of this model. The predicted decrease in particle distance could lead to coagulation, suggesting a preference for ferrofluids with more uniform particle sizes, leading to lower attraction, but still responding to applied fields, as needed in most applications.</description>

      <title>Hysteresis Behind A Freeway Bottleneck With Location-Dependent Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Macroscopic fundamental diagrams (MFDs) and related network traffic dynamics models have received both theoretical support and empirical validation with the emergence of new data collection technologies. However, the existence of well-defined MFD curves can only be expected for traffic networks with specific topologies and is subject to various disturbances, most importantly hysteresis phenomena. This study aims to improve the understanding of hysteresis in Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams and Network Exit Functions (NEFs) during rush hour conditions. We apply the LWR theory to a highway corridor featuring a location-dependent downstream bottleneck to identify a figure-eight hysteresis pattern, clockwise on the top and counter-clockwise on the bottom. Our empirical observations confirm the occurrence of counter-clockwise loops in real conditions, an effect which we can attribute to demand asymmetries through theoretical analysis. The paper discusses the impact of the road topology and demand patterns on the formation and intensity of hysteresis loops analytically. To substantiate these findings, we analyze empirical MFD data from two bottlenecks and present statistical evidence that, under otherwise identical conditions, a continuous bottleneck causes less hysteresis than a discontinuous one. We conduct numerical experiments using the Cell Transmission Model (CTM) to show that even a slight reduction in the capacity of the homogeneous section can significantly decrease MFD hysteresis while maintaining outflow at the corridor's downstream end. These reductions can be achieved with minimal intervention through standard traffic control measures, such as dynamic speed limits or ramp metering.</description>

      <title>Random walks with long-range memory on networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11814v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an exactly solvable random walk model with long-range memory on arbitrary networks. The walker performs unbiased random steps to nearest-neighbor nodes and intermittently resets to previously visited nodes in a preferential way, such that the most visited nodes have proportionally a higher probability to be chosen for revisit. The occupation probability can be expressed as a sum over the eigenmodes of the standard random walk matrix of the network, where the amplitudes slowly decay as power-laws at large time, instead of exponentially. The stationary state is the same as in the absence of memory and detailed balance is fulfilled. However, the relaxation of the transient part becomes critically self-organized at late times, as it is dominated by a single power-law whose exponent depends on the second largest eigenvalue and on the resetting probability. We apply our findings to finite networks such as rings, complete graphs, Watts-Strogatz and Barab\'asi-Albert networks, and to Barbell and comb-like graphs. Our study could be of interest for modeling complex transport phenomena, such as human mobility, epidemic spreading, or animal foraging.</description>

Abstract: . We study the statistical properties of the eigenvalues of non-Hermitian operators assoicated with the dissipative complex systems. By considering the Gaussian ensembles of such operators, a hierarchical relation between the correlators is obtained. Further the eigenvalues are found to behave like particles moving on a complex plane under 2-body (inverse square) and 3-body interactions and there seems to underlie a deep connection and universality in the spectral behaviour of different complex systems. .</description>

Abstract: We theoretically derive the probability densities of the entanglement measures of a pure non-ergodic many-body state, represented in a bipartite product basis and with its reduced density matrix described by a generalized, multi-parametric Wishart ensemble with unit trace. Our results indicate significant fluctuations of the measures around their average behavior (specifically for the states away from separability and maximum entanglement limits). The information is relevant not only for hierarchical arrangement of entangled states (e.g., revealing the flaws in their characterization based on average behavior) but also for phase transition studies of many body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We observe an inverse turbulent-wave cascade, from small to large lengthscales, in a driven homogeneous 2D Bose gas. Starting with an equilibrium condensate, we drive the gas isotropically on a lengthscale much smaller than its size, and observe a nonthermal population of modes with wavelengths larger than the drive one. At long drive times, the gas exhibits a steady nonthermal momentum distribution. At lengthscales increasing from the drive one to the system size, this distribution features in turn: (i) a power-law spectrum with an exponent close to the analytical result for a particle cascade in weak-wave turbulence, and (ii) a spectrum reminiscent of a nonthermal fixed point associated with universal coarsening in an isolated 2D gas. In further experiments, based on anisotropic driving, we reveal the complete qualitative picture of how the steady-state cascade forms.</description>

      <title>Fusion rule in conformal field theories and topological orders: A unified view of correspondence and (fractional) supersymmetry and their relation to topological holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05178v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The algebraic or ring structure of anyons called the fusion rule, is one of the most fundamental research interests in contemporary studies on topological orders (TOs) and the corresponding conformal field theories (CFTs). Recently, the algebraic structure realized as generalized symmetry, including non-invertible and categorical symmetry, captured attention in the fields. Such non-abelian anyonic objects appear in a bulk CFT or chiral CFT (CCFT), but it has been known that the construction of a CCFT contains theoretical difficulties in general. In this work, we study the structure of the fusion rule in $Z_{N}$ symmetric chiral and bulk conformal field theories and the corresponding TOs. We propose a nontrivial expression of subalgebra structure in the fusion rule of a bulk CFT. We name this subalgebra ``bulk semion". This corresponds to the fusion rule of the CCFTs and categorical symmetry of the TOs or symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT). This gives a bulk-edge correspondence based on the symmetry analysis and corresponds to an anyon algebraic expression of topological holography in the recent literature. The topological holography is expected to apply to systems in general space-time dimensions. Moreover, we give a concise way of unifying duality (or fractional supersymmetry), generalized or categorical symmetry, and Lagrangian subalgebra. Our method is potentially useful to formulate and study general TOs, fundamentally only from the data of bulk CFTs or vice versa, and gives a clue in understanding CCFT (or ancillary CFT more generally).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20326v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interface localised interactions are studied for multiscalar universality classes accessible with the perturbative $\varepsilon$ expansion in $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. The associated beta functions at one loop and partially at two loops are derived, and a wide variety of interface conformal field theories (CFTs) is found, even in cases where the bulk universality class is free or as simple as the Wilson-Fisher description of the $O(N)$ model. For up to three scalar fields in the bulk, interface fixed points are classified for all bulk universality classes encountered in this case. Numerical results are obtained for interface CFTs that exist for larger numbers of multiscalar fields. Our analytic and numerical results indicate the existence of a vast space of interface CFTs, much larger than the space of defect CFTs found for line and surface defect deformations of multiscalar models in $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. In this vast space, stable interfaces found for free and $O(N)$ bulks belong to the $F_4$ family, with global symmetries $SO(3), SU(3), Sp(6)$ and $F_4$, realised with $N=5,8,16,24$ scalar fields, respectively.</description>

      <title>Snap and Jump: How Elastic Shells Pop Out</title>

Abstract: Grip, walk, crawl, and jump. Soft robots are integrated functional structures composed of compliant mechanisms, whose activity spans various industrial applications such as surgery, healthcare, surveillance, and even planetary exploration. One of their promising mobility mechanism is snap-buckling; the instability mode of flexible structures passing from one equilibrium state to another can instantaneously generate large power for its motion. Predicting their performance with even simple geometry requires disentangling material, geometric nonlinearity, and contact, thereby still being a challenging problem to date. Here, we study the jumping dynamics of hemispherical elastic shells driven by snap-buckling, as a model system of soft jumping mechanisms, combining experiments, simulations, and analytical theory. We find that the contact transition dynamics trigger the jumping phenomenon upon snap-buckling by constructing the analytical predictions with shell elasticity in excellent agreement with both experiments and simulations. Despite the simple geometry of the shell, its dynamical performance primarily relies on a complex interplay between elasticity, geometry, and contact friction. By elucidating the dynamics of the building blocks of soft robots that undergo large deformations, we can build their predictive experimental and numerical framework. Our research paves the way for designing soft robots suitable for the required loading conditions or structural requirements without empirical methods.</description>

      <title>Discrete distributions are learnable from metastable samples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physically motivated stochastic dynamics are often used to sample from high-dimensional distributions. However such dynamics often get stuck in specific regions of their state space and mix very slowly to the desired stationary state. This causes such systems to approximately sample from a metastable distribution which is usually quite different from the desired, stationary distribution of the dynamic. We rigorously show that, in the case of multi-variable discrete distributions, the true model describing the stationary distribution can be recovered from samples produced from a metastable distribution under minimal assumptions about the system. This follows from a fundamental observation that the single-variable conditionals of metastable distributions that satisfy a strong metastability condition are on average close to those of the stationary distribution. This holds even when the metastable distribution differs considerably from the true model in terms of global metrics like Kullback-Leibler divergence or total variation distance. This property allows us to learn the true model using a conditional likelihood based estimator, even when the samples come from a metastable distribution concentrated in a small region of the state space. Explicit examples of such metastable states can be constructed from regions that effectively bottleneck the probability flow and cause poor mixing of the Markov chain. For specific cases of binary pairwise undirected graphical models (i.e. Ising models), we extend our results to further rigorously show that data coming from metastable states can be used to learn the parameters of the energy function and recover the structure of the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24142v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum field theories which have quantum groups as global internal symmetries. We show that in such theories operators are generically non-local, and should be thought as living at the ends of topological lines. We describe the general constraints of the quantum group symmetry, given by Ward identities, that correlation functions of the theory should satisfy. We also show that generators of the symmetry can be represented by topological lines with some novel properties. We then discuss a particular example of $U_q(sl_2)$ symmetric CFT, which we solve using the bootstrap techniques and relying on the symmetry. We finally show strong evidence that for a special value of $q$ a subsector of this theory reproduces the fermionic formulation of the Ising model. This suggests that a quantum group can act on local operators as well, however, it generically transforms them into non-local ones.</description>

      <title>Fundamental bounds on precision and response for quantum trajectory observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The precision and response of trajectory observables offer valuable insights into the behavior of nonequilibrium systems. For classical systems, trade-offs between these characteristics and thermodynamic costs, such as entropy production and dynamical activity, have been established through uncertainty relations. Quantum systems, however, present unique challenges, where quantum coherence can enhance precision and violate classical uncertainty relations. In this study, we derive trade-off relations for stochastic observables in Markovian open quantum systems. Specifically, we present three key results: (i) a quantum generalization of the thermo-kinetic uncertainty relation, which bounds the relative fluctuations of currents in terms of entropy production and dynamical activity; (ii) a quantum inverse uncertainty relation, which constrains the relative fluctuations of arbitrary counting observables based on their instantaneous fluctuations and the spectral gap of the symmetrized Liouvillian; and (iii) a quantum response kinetic uncertainty relation, which bounds the response of general observables to kinetic perturbations in terms of dynamical activity. These fundamental bounds, validated numerically using a three-level maser and a boundary-driven XXZ spin chain, provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between precision, response, and thermodynamic costs in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>A unified framework of unitarily residual measures for quantifying dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open quantum systems are governed by both unitary and non-unitary dynamics, with dissipation arising from the latter. Traditional quantum divergence measures, such as quantum relative entropy, fail to account for the non-unitary oriented dissipation as the divergence is positive even between unitarily connected states. We introduce a framework for quantifying the dissipation by isolating the non-unitary components of quantum dynamics. We define equivalence relations among hermitian operators through unitary transformations and characterize the resulting quotient set. By establishing an isomorphism between this quotient set and a set of real vectors with ordered components, we induce divergence measures that are invariant under unitary evolution, which we refer to as the unitarily residual measures. These unitarily residual measures inherit properties such as monotonicity and convexity and, in certain cases, correspond to classical information divergences between sorted eigenvalue distributions. Our results provide a powerful tool for quantifying dissipation in open quantum systems, advancing the understanding of quantum thermodynamics.</description>
