      <title>CNUCTRAN: A program for computing final nuclide concentrations using a direct simulation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is essential to precisely determine the evolving concentrations of radioactive nuclides within transmutation problems. It is also a crucial aspect of nuclear physics with widespread applications in nuclear waste management and energy production. This paper introduces CNUCTRAN, a novel computer program that employs a probabilistic approach to estimate nuclide concentrations in transmutation problems. CNUCTRAN directly simulates nuclei transformations arising from various nuclear reactions, diverging from the traditional deterministic methods that solve the Bateman equation using matrix exponential approximation. This approach effectively addresses numerical challenges associated with solving the Bateman equations, therefore, circumventing the need for matrix exponential approximations that risk producing nonphysical concentrations. Our sample calculations using CNUCTRAN shows that the concentration predictions of CNUCTRAN have a relative error of less than 0.001% compared to the state-of-the-art method, CRAM, in different test cases. This makes CNUCTRAN a valuable alternative tool for transmutation analysis</description>

      <title>The Steepest Slope to a Quantum Few-body Solution:Gradient Variational Methods to the Quantum Few-body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum few-body systems are deceptively simple. Indeed, with the notable exception of a few special cases, their associated Schrodinger equation cannot be solved analytically for more than two particles. One has to resort to approximation methods to tackle quantum few-body problems. In particular, variational methods have been proposed to ease numerical calculations and obtain precise solutions. One such method is the Stochastic Variational Method, which employs a stochastic search to determine the number and parameters of correlated Gaussian basis functions used to construct an ansatz of the wave function. Stochastic methods, however, face numerical and optimization challenges as the number of particles increases.
  We introduce a family of gradient variational methods that replace stochastic search with gradient optimization. We comparatively and empirically evaluate the performance of the baseline Stochastic Variational Method, several instances of the gradient variational method family, and some hybrid methods for selected few-body problems. We show that gradient and hybrid methods can be more efficient and effective than the Stochastic Variational Method. We discuss the role of singularities, oscillations, and gradient optimization strategies in the performance of the respective methods.</description>

      <title>Flat-plane based double-counting free and parameter free many-body DFT+U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Burgess et al. have recently introduced the BLOR corrective exchange-correlation functional that is, by construction, the unique simplified rotationally-invariant DFT+U functional that enforces the flat-plane condition separately on each effective orbital of a localized subspace. Detached from the Hubbard model, functionals of this type are both double-counting correction free and, when optimized in situ using appropriate error quantifiers, effectively parameter free. In this work, the extension of the BLOR functional to address many-body errors (mBLOR) is derived. The mBLOR functional is built to enforce the flat-plane condition on the entire subspace, rather than on each orbital individually. In this way inter-orbital errors are corrected on the same footing as the single-particle ones. Focusing on exact test cases with strong inter-orbital interactions, the BLOR and mBLOR functionals were benchmarked against contemporary DFT+U functionals using the total energy extensivity condition on stretched homo-nuclear p-block dimers that represent various self-interaction and static-correlation error regimes. The BLOR functional outperformed all other DFT+$U$ functionals tested, which often act to increase total-energy errors, yet it still yielded large errors in some systems. mBLOR instead yielded low energy errors across all four strongly-correlated dimers, while being constructed using only semi-local approximation ingredients. As mBLOR would not otherwise introduce a band-gap correction in the manner that is a desirable feature of DFT+U, we developed a cost-free technique to reintroduce it automatically by moving the functional's unusual explicit derivative discontinuity into the potential. With this in place, mBLOR is the only known DFT$+U$ functional that opens the bandgap of stretched neutral homo-nuclear dimers without the aid of unphysical spin-symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Structure and Stability of Oxide Nanoscrolls from Dichalcogenide Precursors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-dimensional nanostructures such as nanotubes, nanoscrolls, and nanofilms have found applications in a wide variety of fields such as photocatalysis, sensing, and drug delivery. Recently, Chu et al. demonstrated that nanoscrolls of Mo and W transition metal oxides, which do not exhibit van der Waals (vdW) layering in their bulk counterparts, can be successfully synthesized using a plasma processing of corresponding layered transition metal dichalcogenides. In this work, we employ data mining, first-principles simulations, and physio-mechanical models to theoretically examine the potential of other dichalcogenide precursors to form oxide nanoscrolls. Through data mining of bulk and two-dimensional materials databases, we first identify dichalcogenides that would be mostly amenable to plasma processing on the basis of their vdW layering and thermodynamic stability. To determine the propensity of forming a nanoscroll, we develop a first-principles simulation-based physio-mechanical model to determine the thermodynamic stability of nanoscrolling as well as the equilibrium structure of the nanoscrolls, i.e. their inner radius, outer radius, and interlayer spacing. We validate this model using the experimental observations of Chu et al.'s study and find an excellent agreement for the equilibrium nanoscroll structure. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the model's energies can be utilized for a generalized quantitative categorization of nanoscroll stability. We apply the model to study the oxide nanoscroll formation in MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WSe$_2$, PdS$_2$, HfS$_2$ and GeS$_2$, paving the way for a systematic study of oxide nanoscroll formation atop other dichalcogenide substrates.</description>

      <title>QWalkVec: Node Embedding by Quantum Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose QWalkVec, a quantum walk-based node embedding method. A quantum walk is a quantum version of a random walk that demonstrates a faster propagation than a random walk on a graph. We focus on the fact that the effect of the depth-first search process is dominant when a quantum walk with a superposition state is applied to graphs. Simply using a quantum walk with its superposition state leads to insufficient performance since balancing the depth-first and breadth-first search processes is essential in node classification tasks. To overcome this disadvantage, we formulate novel coin operators that determine the movement of a quantum walker to its neighboring nodes. They enable QWalkVec to integrate the depth-first search and breadth-first search processes by prioritizing node sampling. We evaluate the effectiveness of QWalkVec in node classification tasks conducted on four small-sized real datasets. As a result, we demonstrate that the performance of QWalkVec is superior to that of the existing methods on several datasets. Our code will be available at \url{https://github.com/ReiSato18/QWalkVec}.</description>

      <title>Tailoring light holes in $\beta$-$Ga_{2}O_{3}$ via Anion-Anion Antibonding Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A significant limitation of wide-bandgap materials is their low hole mobility related to localized holes with heavy effective masses ($m_h^*$). We identify in low-symmetric wide-bandgap compounds an anion-anion antibonding coupling (AAAC) effect as the intrinsic factor behind hole localization, which explains the extremely heavy $m_h^*$ and self-trapped hole (STH) formation observed in gallium oxide ($\beta$-$Ga_{2}O_{3}$). We propose a design principle for achieving light holes by manipulating AAAC, demonstrating that specific strain conditions can reduce $m_h^*$ in $\beta$-$Ga_{2}O_{3}$ from 4.77 $m_0$ to 0.38 $m_0$, making it comparable to the electron mass (0.28 $m_0$), while also suppressing STH. The light holes show significant anisotropy, potentially enabling two-dimensional transport in bulk material. This study provides a fundamental understanding of hole mass enhancement and STH formation in novel wide-bandgap materials and suggest new pathways for engineering hole mobilities.</description>

      <title>Dissipative split-charge formalism: Ohm's law, Nyquist noise, and non-contact friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The split-charge equilibration method is extended to describe dissipative charge transfer similarly as the Drude model, whereby the generic frequency-dependent dielectric permitivitties or conductivities of dielectrics and metals can be mimicked. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, a resistor-capacitor circuit is simulated using an all-atom representation for resistor and capacitor. The simulated dynamics reproduce the expected charging process and Nyquist noise, the latter resulting from the thermal voltages acting on individual split charges. The method bears promise to model friction caused by the motion of charged particles past metallic or highly polarizable media.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With advancements in computational molecular modeling and powerful structure search methods, it is now possible to systematically screen crystal structures for small organic molecules. In this context, we introduce the Python package High-throughput Organic Crystal Structure Prediction (HTOCSP), which enables the prediction and screening of crystal packing for small organic molecules in an automated, high-throughput manner. Specifically, we describe the workflow, which encompasses molecular analysis, force field generation, and crystal generation and sampling, all within customized constraints based on user input. We demonstrate the application of \texttt{HTOCSP} by systematically screening organic crystals for 100 molecules using different sampling strategies and force field options. Furthermore, we analyze the benchmark results to understand the underlying factors that influence the complexity of the crystal energy landscape. Finally, we discuss the current limitations of the package and potential future extensions.</description>

Abstract: The QMol-grid package provides a suite of routines for performing quantum-mechanical simulations in atomic and molecular systems in one spatial dimension. It supports ground- and excited-state calculations for the Schrodinger equation, density-functional theory, and Hartree-Fock levels of theory as well as propagators for field-free and field-driven time-dependent Schrodinger equation (TDSE) and real-time time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT), using symplectic-split schemes. The package is written using MATLAB's object-oriented features and handle classes. It is designed to facilitate access to the wave function(s) (TDSE) and the Kohn-Sham orbitals (TDDFT) within MATLAB's environment.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Machine-Learned Exchange Functional for Molecules and Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00682v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The design of better exchange-correlation functionals for Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a central challenge of modern electronic structure theory. However, current developments are limited by the mathematical form of the functional, with efficient semilocal functionals being inaccurate for many technologically important systems and the more accurate hybrid functionals being too expensive for large solid-state systems due to the use of the exact exchange operator. In this work, we use machine learning combined with exact physical constraints to design an exchange functional that is both orbital-dependent and nonlocal, but which can be evaluated at roughly the cost of semilocal functionals and is significantly faster than hybrid DFT in plane-wave codes. By training functionals with several different feature sets, we elucidate the roles of orbital-dependent and nonlocal features in learning the exchange energy and determine that both types of features provide vital and independently important information to the model. Having trained our new exchange functional with an expressive, nonlocal feature set, we substitute it into existing hybrid functionals to achieve hybrid-DFT accuracy on thermochemical benchmark sets and improve the accuracy of band gap predictions over semilocal DFT. To demonstrate the scalability of our approach as well as the practical benefits of improved band gap prediction, we compute charged defect transition levels in silicon using large supercells. Due to its transferability and computational efficiency for both molecular and extended systems, our model overcomes the cost-accuracy trade-off between semilocal and hybrid DFT, and our general approach provides a feasible path toward a universal exchange-correlation functional with post-hybrid DFT accuracy and semilocal DFT cost.</description>

Abstract: The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are catalyzing transformative changes in atomic modeling, simulation, and design. AI-driven potential energy models have demonstrated the capability to conduct large-scale, long-duration simulations with the accuracy of ab initio electronic structure methods. However, the model generation process remains a bottleneck for large-scale applications. We propose a shift towards a model-centric ecosystem, wherein a large atomic model (LAM), pre-trained across multiple disciplines, can be efficiently fine-tuned and distilled for various downstream tasks, thereby establishing a new framework for molecular modeling. In this study, we introduce the DPA-2 architecture as a prototype for LAMs. Pre-trained on a diverse array of chemical and materials systems using a multi-task approach, DPA-2 demonstrates superior generalization capabilities across multiple downstream tasks compared to the traditional single-task pre-training and fine-tuning methodologies. Our approach sets the stage for the development and broad application of LAMs in molecular and materials simulation research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce CrystalFormer, a transformer-based autoregressive model specifically designed for space group-controlled generation of crystalline materials. The incorporation of space group symmetry significantly simplifies the crystal space, which is crucial for data and compute efficient generative modeling of crystalline materials. Leveraging the prominent discrete and sequential nature of the Wyckoff positions, CrystalFormer learns to generate crystals by directly predicting the species and locations of symmetry-inequivalent atoms in the unit cell. We demonstrate the advantages of CrystalFormer in standard tasks such as symmetric structure initialization and element substitution compared to conventional methods implemented in popular crystal structure prediction software. Moreover, we showcase the application of CrystalFormer of property-guided materials design in a plug-and-play manner. Our analysis shows that CrystalFormer ingests sensible solid-state chemistry knowledge and heuristics by compressing the material dataset, thus enabling systematic exploration of crystalline materials. The simplicity, generality, and flexibility of CrystalFormer position it as a promising architecture to be the foundational model of the entire crystalline materials space, heralding a new era in materials modeling and discovery.</description>

      <title>TRACE: a Time-Reversible Algorithm for Close Encounters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present TRACE, an almost time-reversible hybrid integrator for the planetary N-body problem. Like hybrid symplectic integrators, TRACE can resolve close encounters between particles while retaining many of the accuracy and speed advantages of a fixed timestep symplectic method such the Wisdom--Holman map. TRACE switches methods time-reversibly during close encounters following the prescription of Hernandez &amp; Dehnen. In this paper we describe the derivation and implementation of TRACE and study its performance for a variety of astrophysical systems. In all our test cases TRACE is at least as accurate and fast as the hybrid symplectic integrator MERCURIUS. In many cases TRACE's performance is vastly superior to that of MERCURIUS. In test cases with planet-planet close encounters, TRACE is as accurate as MECURIUS with a 12x speedup. If close encounters with the central star are considered, TRACE achieves good error performance while MERCURIUS fails to give qualitatively correct results. In ensemble tests of violent scattering systems, TRACE matches the high-accuracy IAS15 while providing a 15x speed-up. In large N systems simulating lunar accretion, TRACE qualitatively gives the same results as IAS15 but at a 41x speedup. We also discuss some cases such as von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai cycles where hybrid integrators perform poorly and provide some guidance on which integrator to use for which system. TRACE is freely available within the REBOUND package.</description>

      <title>Extending GPU-Accelerated Gaussian Integrals in the TeraChem Software Package to f Type Orbitals: Implementation and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing availability of GPUs for scientific computing has prompted interest in accelerating quantum chemical calculations through their use. The complexity of integral kernels for high angular momentum basis functions however often limits the utility of GPU implementations with large basis sets or for metal containing systems. In this work, we report implementation of $f$ function support in the GPU-accelerated TeraChem software package through the development of efficient kernels for the evaluation of Hamiltonian integrals. The high efficiency of the resulting code is demonstrated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations on increasingly large organic molecules and transition metal complexes, as well as coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) calculations on water clusters. Preliminary investigations into Ni(I) catalysis with DFT and the photochemistry of MnH(CH$_3$) with complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) are also carried out. Overall, our GPU-accelerated software appears to be well-suited for fast simulation of large transition metal containing systems, as well as organic molecules.</description>
