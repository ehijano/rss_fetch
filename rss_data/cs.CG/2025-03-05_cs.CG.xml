      <title>French Onion Soup, Ipelets for Points and Polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are many structures, both classical and modern, involving point-sets and polygons whose deeper understanding can be facilitated through interactive visualizations. The Ipe extensible drawing editor, developed by Otfried Cheong, is a widely used software system for generating geometric figures. One of its features is the capability to extend its functionality through programs called Ipelets. In this media submission, we showcase a collection of new Ipelets that construct a variety of geometric based structures based on point sets and polygons. These include quadtrees, trapezoidal maps, beta skeletons, floating bodies of convex polygons, onion graphs, fractals (Sierpi\'nski triangle and carpet), simple polygon triangulations, and random point sets in simple polygons. All of our Ipelets are programmed in Lua and are freely available.</description>

      <title>Software for the Thompson and Funk Polygonal Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metric spaces defined within convex polygons, such as the Thompson, Funk, reverse Funk, and Hilbert metrics, are subjects of recent exploration and study in computational geometry. This paper contributes an educational piece of software for understanding these unique geometries while also providing a tool to support their research. We provide dynamic software for manipulating the Funk, reverse Funk, and Thompson balls in convex polygonal domains. Additionally, we provide a visualization program for traversing the Hilbert polygonal geometry.</description>

      <title>Minimum-Length Coordinated Motions For Two Convex Centrally-Symmetric Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of determining coordinated motions, of minimum total length, for two arbitrary convex centrally-symmetric (CCS) robots in an otherwise obstacle-free plane. Using the total path length traced by the two robot centres as a measure of distance, we give an exact characterization of a (not necessarily unique) shortest collision-avoiding motion for all initial and goal configurations of the robots. The individual paths are composed of at most six convex pieces, and their total length can be expressed as a simple integral with a closed form solution depending only on the initial and goal configuration of the robots. The path pieces are either straight segments or segments of the boundary of the Minkowski sum of the two robots (circular arcs, in the special case of disc robots). Furthermore, the paths can be parameterized in such a way that (i) only one robot is moving at any given time (decoupled motion), or (ii) the orientation of the robot configuration changes monotonically.</description>

      <title>Minimum spanning blob-trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate blob-trees, a new way of connecting a set of points, by a mixture of enclosing them by cycles (as in the convex hull) and connecting them by edges (as in a spanning tree). We show that a minimum-cost blob-tree for $n$ points can be computed in $O(n^3)$ time.</description>

      <title>Bounds for k-centers of point sets under $L_{\infty}$-bottleneck distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the $k$-center problem on the space of fixed-size point sets in the plane under the $L_{\infty}$-bottleneck distance. While this problem is motivated by persistence diagrams in topological data analysis, we illustrate it as a \emph{Restaurant Supply Problem}: given $n$ restaurant chains of $m$ stores each, we want to place supermarket chains, also of $m$ stores each, such that each restaurant chain can select one supermarket chain to supply all its stores, ensuring that each store is matched to a nearby supermarket. How many supermarket chains are required to supply all restaurants? We address this questions under the constraint that any two restaurant chains are close enough under the $L_{\infty}$-distance to be satisfied by a single supermarket chain. We provide both upper and lower bounds for this problem and investigate its computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Flipping Matchings is Hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a point set $\mathcal{P}$ and a plane perfect matching $\mathcal{M}$ on $\mathcal{P}$, a flip is an operation that replaces two edges of $\mathcal{M}$ such that another plane perfect matching on $\mathcal{P}$ is obtained. Given two plane perfect matchings on $\mathcal{P}$, we show that it is NP-hard to minimize the number of flips that are needed to transform one matching into the other.</description>

      <title>Boosting Rectilinear Steiner Minimum Tree Algorithms with Augmented Bounding Volume Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rectilinear Steiner minimum tree (RSMT) problem computes the shortest network connecting a given set of points using only horizontal and vertical lines, possibly adding extra points (Steiner points) to minimize the total length. RSMT solvers seek to balance speed and accuracy. In this work, we design a framework to boost existing RSMT solvers, extending the Pareto front. Combined with GeoSteiner, our algorithm reaches 5.16\% length error on nets with 1000 pins. The average time needed is 0.46 seconds. This provides an effective way to solve large-scale RSMT problems with small-scale solvers.</description>

      <title>NumPSLA -- An experimental research tool for pseudoline arrangements and order types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a program for enumerating all pseudoline arrangements with a small number of pseudolines and abstract order types of small point sets. This program supports computer experiments with these structures, and it complements the order-type database of Aichholzer, Aurenhammer, and Krasser. This system makes it practical to explore the abstract order types for 12 points, and the pseudoline arrangements of 11 pseudolines.</description>

      <title>Hardness of computation of quantum invariants on 3-manifolds with restricted topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum invariants in low dimensional topology offer a wide variety of valuable invariants of knots and 3-manifolds, presented by explicit formulas that are readily computable. Their computational complexity has been actively studied and is tightly connected to topological quantum computing. In this article, we prove that for any 3-manifold quantum invariant in the Reshetikhin-Turaev model, there is a deterministic polynomial time algorithm that, given as input an arbitrary closed 3-manifold $M$, outputs a closed 3-manifold $M'$ with same quantum invariant, such that $M'$ is hyperbolic, contains no low genus embedded incompressible surface, and is presented by a strongly irreducible Heegaard diagram. Our construction relies on properties of Heegaard splittings and the Hempel distance. At the level of computational complexity, this proves that the hardness of computing a given quantum invariant of 3-manifolds is preserved even when severely restricting the topology and the combinatorics of the input. This positively answers a question raised by Samperton.</description>

      <title>On The Heine-Borel Property and Minimum Enclosing Balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we contribute a proof that minimum radius balls over metric spaces with the Heine-Borel property are always LP type. Additionally, we prove that weak metric spaces, those without symmetry, also have this property if we fix the direction in which we take their distances from the centers of the balls. We use this to prove that the minimum radius ball problem is LP type in the Hilbert and Thompson metrics and Funk weak metric. In doing so, we contribute a proof that the topology induced by the Thompson metric coincides with the Hilbert. We provide explicit primitives for computing the minimum radius ball in the Hilbert metric.</description>
