      <title>A rare gas mixture: From rigid to gas-like fluid by a mutual concentration change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a number of mixtures of rate gases at high pressures, sound speed minima are experimentally observed depending on the concentration. This behavior has not yet been explained. We have studied the behavior of a mixture of argon and helium using computer simulation. Sound speed minima have been discovered at a certain concentration, which is in good agreement with experimental data. It is shown that this behavior is due to the fact that the P and T parameters for gas mixtures are near the Frenkel line, separating the states of "rigid" and quasi-gas fluid.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of swimmer diffusion through regular kicks: analytic mapping of a scale independent parameter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depending on their mechanism of self-propulsion, active particles can exhibit a time-dependent, often periodic, propulsion velocity. The precise propulsion velocity profile determines their mean square displacement and their effective diffusion coefficient at long times. Here we demonstrate that any periodic propulsion profile results in a larger diffusion coefficient than the corresponding case with constant propulsion velocity. We investigate in detail the case of periodic exponentially decaying velocity pulses, expected in propulsion mechanisms based on sudden absorption of finite amounts of energy. We show both analytically and with numerical simulations that in these cases the effective diffusion coefficient can be arbitrarily enhanced with respect to the case with constant velocity equal to the average speed. Our results may help interpret in a new light observations on the diffusion enhancement of active particles.</description>

      <title>Proliferation-driven mechanical feedback regulates cell dynamics in growing tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local stresses in a tissue, a collective property, regulate cell division and apoptosis. In turn, cell growth and division induce active stresses in the tissue. As a consequence, there is a feedback between cell growth and local stresses. However, how the cell dynamics depend on local stress-dependent cell division and the feedback strength is not fully understood. Here, we probe the consequences of stress-mediated growth and cell division on cell dynamics using agent-based simulations of a two-dimensional growing tissue. We discover a rich dynamical behavior of individual cells, ranging from jamming (mean square displacement, $\Delta (t) \sim t^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha$ less than unity), to hyperdiffusion ($\alpha &gt; 2$) depending on cell division rate and the strength of the mechanical feedback. Strikingly, $\Delta (t)$ is determined by the tissue growth law, which quantifies cell proliferation (number of cells $N(t)$ as a function of time). The growth law ($N(t) \sim t^{\lambda}$ at long times) is regulated by the critical pressure that controls the strength of the mechanical feedback and the ratio between cell division-apoptosis rates. We show that $\lambda \sim \alpha$, which implies that higher growth rate leads to a greater degree of cell migration. The variations in cell motility are linked to the emergence of highly persistent forces extending over several cell cycle times. Our predictions are testable using cell-tracking imaging techniques.</description>

      <title>Mobility-induced kinetic effects in multicomponent mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an overview exploring the role of kinetics in multicomponent mixtures. Compared to the most commonly studied binary (single species plus solvent) case, multicomponent fluids show a rich interplay between kinetics and thermodynamics due to the possibility of fractionation, interdiffusion of mixture components and collective motion. This leads to a competition between multiple timescales that change depending on the underlying kinetics. At high densities, crowding effects are relevant and non-equilibrium structures can become long-lived. We present the main approaches for the study of kinetic effects in multicomponents mixtures, including the role of crowding, and explore their consequences for equilibrium and non-equilibrium scenarios. We conclude by identifying the main challenges in the field.</description>

      <title>Tangentially Active Polymers in Cylindrical Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytical and computational study characterizing the structural and dynamical properties of an active filament confined in cylindrical channels. We first outline the effects of the interplay between confinement and polar self-propulsion on the conformation of the chains. We observe that the scaling of the polymer size in the channel, quantified by the end-to-end distance, shows different anomalous behaviours at different confinement and activity conditions. Interestingly, we show that the universal relation, describing the ratio between the end-to-end distance of passive polymer chains in cylindrical channels and in bulk is broken by activity. Finally, we show that the long-time diffusion coefficient under confinement can be rationalised by an analytical model, that takes into account the presence of the channel and the elongated nature of the polymer.</description>

      <title>Intermittent thermal convection in jammed emulsions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the process of thermal convection in jammed emulsions with a yield-stress rheology. We find that heat transfer occurs via an intermittent mechanism, whereby intense short-lived convective "heat bursts" are spaced out by long-lasting conductive periods. This behaviour is the result of a sequence of fluidization-rigidity transitions, rooted in a non-trivial interplay between emulsion yield-stress rheology and plastic activity, which we characterize via a statistical analysis of the dynamics at the droplet scale. We also show that droplets' coalescence induced during heat bursts leads to a spatially heterogeneous phase-inversion of the emulsion which eventually supports a sustained convective state.</description>

      <title>Local number fluctuations in ordered and disordered phases of water across temperatures: Higher-order moments and degrees of tetrahedrality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The isothermal compressibility (i.e., the asymptotic number variance) of equilibrium liquid water as a function of temperature is minimal near ambient conditions. This anomalous non-monotonic temperature dependence is due to a balance between thermal fluctuations and the formation of tetrahedral hydrogen-bond networks. Since tetrahedrality is a many-body property, it will also influence the higher-order moments of density fluctuations, including the skewness and kurtosis. To gain a more complete picture, we examine these higher-order moments that encapsulate many-body correlations using a recently developed, advanced platform for local density fluctuations. We study an extensive set of simulated phases of water across a range of temperatures (80 K to 1600 K) with various degrees of tetrahedrality, including ice phases, equilibrium liquid water, supercritical water, and disordered nonequilibrium quenches. We find clear signatures of tetrahedrality in the higher-order moments, including the skewness and excess kurtosis, that scale for all cases with the degree of tetrahedrality. More importantly, this scaling behavior leads to non-monotonic temperature dependencies in the higher-order moments for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium phases. Specifically, at near-ambient conditions, the higher-order moments vanish most rapidly for large length scales, and the distribution quickly converges to a Gaussian in our metric. However, at non-ambient conditions, higher-order moments vanish more slowly and hence become more relevant especially for improving information-theoretic approximations of hydrophobic solubility. The temperature non-monotonicity that we observe in the full distribution across length-scales could shed light on water's nested anomalies, i.e., reveal new links between structural, dynamic, and thermodynamic anomalies.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic constraints on polar active matter hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter we use the thermodynamics of a passive fluid to constrain transport in the corresponding active fluid which is subsequently described by the Toner-Tu equations. Acknowledging that the system fundamentally breaks boost symmetry we compel what were previously entirely phenomenological parameters in the Toner-Tu model to satisfy precise relationships among themselves. Consequently, we determine exact scalings for the transport coefficients under dynamical renormalisation group flow that reproduce the results of recent simulations.</description>

      <title>Design rules for controlling active topological defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.00666v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological defects play a central role in the physics of many materials, including magnets, superconductors and liquid crystals. In active fluids, defects become autonomous particles that spontaneously propel from internal active stresses and drive chaotic flows stirring the fluid. The intimate connection between defect textures and active flow suggests that properties of active materials can be engineered by controlling defects, but design principles for their spatiotemporal control remain elusive. Here we propose a symmetry-based additive strategy for using elementary activity patterns, as active topological tweezers, to create, move and braid such defects. By combining theory and simulations, we demonstrate how, at the collective level, spatial activity gradients act like electric fields which, when strong enough, induce an inverted topological polarization of defects, akin to a negative susceptibility dielectric. We harness this feature in a dynamic setting to collectively pattern and transport interacting active defects. Our work establishes an additive framework to sculpt flows and manipulate active defects in both space and time, paving the way to design programmable active and living materials for transport, memory and logic.</description>

      <title>Shear flow of non-Brownian rod-sphere mixtures near jamming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01508v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the discrete element method, taking particle contact and hydrodynamic lubrication into account, to unveil the shear rheology of suspensions of frictionless non-Brownian rods in the dense packing fraction regime. We find that, analogously to the random close packing volume fraction, the shear-driven jamming point of this system varies in a non-monotonic fashion as a function of the rod aspect ratio. The latter strongly influences how the addition of rod-like particles affects the rheological response of a suspension of frictionless non-Brownian spheres to an external shear flow. At fixed values of the total (rods plus spheres) packing fraction, the viscosity of the suspension is reduced by the addition of "short" ( $\leq 2$) rods but is instead increased by the addition of "long" ( $\geq2$) rods. A mechanistic interpretation is provided in terms of packing and excluded-volume arguments.</description>

      <title>3D characterization of kinematic fields and poroelastic swelling near the tip of a propagating crack in a hydrogel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In fracture mechanics, polyacrylamide hydrogels have been widely used as a model material for experiments, benefited from its optical transparency, fracture brittleness, and low Rayleigh wave velocity. To describe the brittle fracture in the hydrogels, linear elastic fracture mechanics comes as the first choice. However, in soft materials such as hydrogels, the crack opening can be extremely large, leading to substantial geometric nonlinearity and material nonlinearity at the crack tip. Furthermore, poroelasticity may also modify the local mechanical state within the polymer network. Direct characterization of the kinematic fields and poroelastic effect at the crack tip is lacking. Here, based on a hybrid method of digital image correlation and particle tracking technique, we retrieved high-resolution 3D particle trajectories near the tip of a slowly propagating crack and measured the near-tip 3D kinematic fields, including the displacement fields, rotation fields, stretch fields, strain fields, and swelling fields. Results confirmed the complex multi-axial stretching near the crack tip and the substantial geometric nonlinearity, particularly on the two wakes of the crack where rotation exceeds $30^{\circ}$. Comparison between the measured and predicted displacement and strain fields, derived from linear elastic fracture mechanics, highlights a disagreement in the direct vicinity of the crack tip, particularly for displacement component $u_x$ and through-thickness strain component $\varepsilon_{zz}$. Significant swelling, due to the poroelastic solvent migration, is also observed, with a strong correlation to the local stretch. Our experimental method, without any assumption of the material properties, can be readily extended to study 3D crack tips in a huge varieties of materials, and our results can shed light on the fundamental fracture mechanics.</description>
