      <title>Generalized local charge conservation in many-body quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of the quantum theory of many-particle systems, we study the compatibility of approximated Non-Equilibrium Green Functions (NEGFs) and of approximated solutions of the Dyson equation with a modified continuity equation of the form $\partial_t \langle \rho \rangle+(1-\gamma)\nabla\cdot \langle\mathbf{J} \rangle=0$. A continuity equation of this kind allows the e.m.\ coupling of the system in the extended Aharonov-Bohm electrodynamics, but not in Maxwell electrodynamics. Focusing on the case of molecular junctions simulated numerically with the Density Functional Theory (DFT), we further discuss the re-definition of local current density proposed by Wang et al., which also turns out to be compatible with the extended Aharonov-Bohm electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Soft quantum back reaction to the Hubble tension: a smeared-out early time cosmological energy density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theoretical explanation for the so-called Hubble tension is provided within the framework of phase-space quantum mechanics extended to (quantum) cosmology. Following a description of the overall nature of this tension, with due attention to recent observational developments, a quantum cosmology framework based on the Weyl-Wigner phase-space quantum approach is presented. This circumvents the discrepancy between early- and late-time Universe predictions for the Hubble constant, $H_0$. The emergence of quantum-origin corrections dependent on a single parameter -- mediated by (generic) localized phase-space quantum states free of data analysis -- yields predictions for $H_0$ that smoothly interpolate between early- and late-time phenomenological values, thereby joining the plethora of solutions for the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>No space-time singularity in black-hole physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive stellar gravitational collapse is not an endless process. The Standard Model of particle physics predicts the existence of a repulsive interaction, two-neutrino mediated, with a coherent weak charge of macroscopic matter proportional to the number of constituents. After gravity, this is the second longest range -- microns -- force and, below nanometers, its magnitude overcomes the attractive gravitation. The layer distribution of pressure inside a compact neutronized uniform sphere, independent of its size, is compared for the two interactions with opposite pressure gradient. Taking as reference the mean square radius, the volume evolution of the pressure, for fixed mass and weak charge, leads to an equilibrium scenario with a characteristic black-hole radius $R_B = 1.58$ nm. This size scale should be universal, independent of the mass, as long as the mass is nearly proportional to the weak charge.</description>

      <title>Equivalence between the zero distributions of the Riemann zeta function and a two-dimensional Ising model with randomly distributed competing interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we prove the equivalence between the zero distributions of the Riemann zeta function {\zeta}(s) and a two-dimensional (2D) Ising model with a mixture of ferromagnetic and randomly distributed competing interactions. At first, we review briefly the characteristics of the Riemann hypothesis and its connections to physics, in particular, to statistical physics. Second, we build a 2D Ising model, M_(FI+SGI)^2D, in which interactions between the nearest neighboring spins are ferromagnetic along one crystallographic direction while competing ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic interactions are randomly distributed along another direction. Third, we prove that all energy eigenvalues of this 2D Ising model M_(FI+SGI)^2D are real and randomly distributed as the M\"obius function {\mu}(n), the Dirichlet L(s,\c{hi}_k ) function as well as the Riemann zeta function {\zeta}(s). Fourth, we prove that the eigenvectors of the 2D Ising model M_(FI+SGI)^2D are constructed by the eigenvectors of the 1D Ising model with phases related to the Riemann zeta function {\zeta}(s), via the relation {\omega}({\gamma}_2j) between the angle {\omega} and the energy eigenvalues {\gamma}_2j, which form the Hilbert-P\'olya space. Fifth, we prove that all the zeros of the partition function of the 2D Ising model M_(FI+SGI)^2D lie on an unit circle in a complex temperature plane (i.e. Fisher zeros), which can be mapped to the zero distribution of the Dirichlet L(s,\c{hi}_k ) function and also the Riemann zeta function {\zeta}(s) in the critical line. In a conclusion, we have proven the closure of the nontrivial zero distribution of the L(s,\c{hi}_k ) function (including the Riemann zeta function {\zeta}(s)).</description>

      <title>Spacetime foam correlation renders the cosmological constant (dark energy)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wheeler's spacetime foams (wormholes) at the Planck length undergo quantum nucleation, oscillation and annihilation. Their collective excitations over foamy spacetime interact with field operators at large distances. We describe such collective excitation and interaction using an effective ``foamon'' field coupled with field operators. The Wilson renormalisation group approach shows that the foamon field theory evolves from an infrared scaling invariant domain to an ultraviolet one, when numerous particles are present. In these domains, the foamon field induces an effective action of field operators, and its correlation length sets a natural scale. Applying this to cosmology, we obtain the effective Einstein action for the Ricci scalar and the cosmological constant (dark energy), including its equation of state and interaction with matter.</description>
