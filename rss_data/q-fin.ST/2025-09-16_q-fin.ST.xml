      <title>Momentum-integrated Multi-task Stock Recommendation with Converge-based Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stock recommendation is critical in Fintech applications, which use price series and alternative information to estimate future stock performance. Although deep learning models are prevalent in stock recommendation systems, traditional time-series forecasting training often fails to capture stock trends and rankings simultaneously, which are essential consideration factors for investors. To tackle this issue, we introduce a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework for stock recommendation, \textbf{M}omentum-\textbf{i}ntegrated \textbf{M}ulti-task \textbf{Stoc}k \textbf{R}ecommendation with Converge-based Optimization (\textbf{MiM-StocR}). To improve the model's ability to capture short-term trends, we novelly invoke a momentum line indicator in model training. To prioritize top-performing stocks and optimize investment allocation, we propose a list-wise ranking loss function called Adaptive-k ApproxNDCG. Moreover, due to the volatility and uncertainty of the stock market, existing MTL frameworks face overfitting issues when applied to stock time series. To mitigate this issue, we introduce the Converge-based Quad-Balancing (CQB) method. We conducted extensive experiments on three stock benchmarks: SEE50, CSI 100, and CSI 300. MiM-StocR outperforms state-of-the-art MTL baselines across both ranking and profitable evaluations.</description>

      <title>Equity Premium Prediction: Taking into Account the Role of Long, even Asymmetric, Swings in Stock Market Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through a novel approach, this paper shows that substantial change in stock market behavior has a statistically and economically significant impact on equity risk premium predictability both on in-sample and out-of-sample cases. In line with Auer's ''Bullish ratio'', a ''Bullish index'' is introduced to measure the changes in stock market behavior, which we describe through a ''fluctuation detrending moving average analysis'' (FDMAA) for returns. We consider 28 indicators. We find that a ''positive shock'' of the Bullish Index is closely related to strong equity risk premium predictability for forecasts based on macroeconomic variables for up to six months. In contrast, a ''negative shock'' is associated with strong equity risk premium predictability with adequate forecasts for up to nine months when based on technical indicators.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Temporal Fusion Transformers for Cryptocurrency Price Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise short-term price prediction in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market is critical for informed trading strategies. Although Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFTs) have shown potential, their direct use often struggles in the face of the market's non-stationary nature and extreme volatility. This paper introduces an adaptive TFT modeling approach leveraging dynamic subseries lengths and pattern-based categorization to enhance short-term forecasting. We propose a novel segmentation method where subseries end at relative maxima, identified when the price increase from the preceding minimum surpasses a threshold, thus capturing significant upward movements, which act as key markers for the end of a growth phase, while potentially filtering the noise. Crucially, the fixed-length pattern ending each subseries determines the category assigned to the subsequent variable-length subseries, grouping typical market responses that follow similar preceding conditions. A distinct TFT model trained for each category is specialized in predicting the evolution of these subsequent subseries based on their initial steps after the preceding peak. Experimental results on ETH-USDT 10-minute data over a two-month test period demonstrate that our adaptive approach significantly outperforms baseline fixed-length TFT and LSTM models in prediction accuracy and simulated trading profitability. Our combination of adaptive segmentation and pattern-conditioned forecasting enables more robust and responsive cryptocurrency price prediction.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Model for Illiquid Stock Prices and its Conclusion about Correlation Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the behavioral dynamics of illiquid stock prices in a listed stock market. Illiquidity, characterized by wide bid and ask spreads affects price formation by decoupling prices from standard risk and return relationships and increasing sensitivity to market sentiment. We model the prices at the Uganda Securities Exchange (USE) which is illiquid in that the prices remain constant much of the time thus complicating price modelling. We circumvent this challenge by combining the Markov model (MM) with two models; the exponential Ornstein Uhlenbeck model (XOU) and geometric Brownian motion (gBm). In the combined models, the MM was used to capture the constant prices in the stock prices while the XOU and gBm captured the stochastic price dynamics. We modelled stock prices using the combined models, as well as XOU and gBm alone. We found that USE stocks appeared to have low correlation with one another. Using theoretical analysis, simulation study and empirical analysis, we conclude that this apparent low correlation is due to illiquidity. In particular data simulated from combined MM-gBm, in which the gBm portion were highly correlated resulted in a low measured correlation when the Markov chain had a higher transition from zero state to zero state.</description>

      <title>ProteuS: A Generative Approach for Simulating Concept Drift in Financial Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial markets are complex, non-stationary systems where the underlying data distributions can shift over time, a phenomenon known as regime changes, as well as concept drift in the machine learning literature. These shifts, often triggered by major economic events, pose a significant challenge for traditional statistical and machine learning models. A fundamental problem in developing and validating adaptive algorithms is the lack of a ground truth in real-world financial data, making it difficult to evaluate a model's ability to detect and recover from these drifts. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a novel framework, named ProteuS, for generating semi-synthetic financial time series with pre-defined structural breaks. Our methodology involves fitting ARMA-GARCH models to real-world ETF data to capture distinct market regimes, and then simulating realistic, gradual, and abrupt transitions between them. The resulting datasets, which include a comprehensive set of technical indicators, provide a controlled environment with a known ground truth of regime changes. An analysis of the generated data confirms the complexity of the task, revealing significant overlap between the different market states. We aim to provide the research community with a tool for the rigorous evaluation of concept drift detection and adaptation mechanisms, paving the way for more robust financial forecasting models.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Machine Learning Models for Predicting the Next Targets of Activist Funds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16169v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research presents a predictive model to identify potential targets of activist investment funds--entities that acquire significant corporate stakes to influence strategic and operational decisions, ultimately enhancing shareholder value. Predicting such targets is crucial for companies aiming to mitigate intervention risks, activist funds seeking optimal investments, and investors looking to leverage potential stock price gains. Using data from the Russell 3000 index from 2016 to 2022, we evaluated 123 model configurations incorporating diverse imputation, oversampling, and machine learning techniques. Our best model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.782, demonstrating its capability to effectively predict activist fund targets. To enhance interpretability, we employed the Shapley value method to identify key factors influencing a company's likelihood of being targeted, highlighting the dynamic mechanisms underlying activist fund target selection. These insights offer a powerful tool for proactive corporate governance and informed investment strategies, advancing understanding of the mechanisms driving activist investment decisions.</description>

      <title>Modelling the term-structure of default risk under IFRS 9 within a multistate regression framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14479v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lifetime behaviour of loans is notoriously difficult to model, which can compromise a bank's financial reserves against future losses, if modelled poorly. Therefore, we present a data-driven comparative study amongst three techniques in modelling a series of default risk estimates over the lifetime of each loan, i.e., its term-structure. The behaviour of loans can be described using a nonstationary and time-dependent semi-Markov model, though we model its elements using a multistate regression-based approach. As such, the transition probabilities are explicitly modelled as a function of a rich set of input variables, including macroeconomic and loan-level inputs. Our modelling techniques are deliberately chosen in ascending order of complexity: 1) a Markov chain; 2) beta regression; and 3) multinomial logistic regression. Using residential mortgage data, our results show that each successive model outperforms the previous, likely as a result of greater sophistication. This finding required devising a novel suite of simple model diagnostics, which can itself be reused in assessing sampling representativeness and the performance of other modelling techniques. These contributions surely advance the current practice within banking when conducting multistate modelling. Consequently, we believe that the estimation of loss reserves will be more timeous and accurate under IFRS 9.</description>
