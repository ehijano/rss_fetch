      <title>Mimicry and the Emergence of Cooperative Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many situations, communication between agents is a critical component of cooperative multi-agent systems, however, it can be difficult to learn or evolve. In this paper, we investigate a simple way in which the emergence of communication may be facilitated. Namely, we explore the effects of when agents can mimic preexisting, externally generated useful signals. The key idea here is that these signals incentivise listeners to develop positive responses, that can then also be invoked by speakers mimicking those signals. This investigation starts with formalising this problem, and demonstrating that this form of mimicry changes optimisation dynamics and may provide the opportunity to escape non-communicative local optima. We then explore the problem empirically with a simulation in which spatially situated agents must communicate to collect resources. Our results show that both evolutionary optimisation and reinforcement learning may benefit from this intervention.</description>

      <title>Knowing What Not to Do: Leverage Language Model Insights for Action Space Pruning in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is employed to develop autonomous agents that can learn to adopt cooperative or competitive strategies within complex environments. However, the linear increase in the number of agents leads to a combinatorial explosion of the action space, which may result in algorithmic instability, difficulty in convergence, or entrapment in local optima. While researchers have designed a variety of effective algorithms to compress the action space, these methods also introduce new challenges, such as the need for manually designed prior knowledge or reliance on the structure of the problem, which diminishes the applicability of these techniques. In this paper, we introduce Evolutionary action SPAce Reduction with Knowledge (eSpark), an exploration function generation framework driven by large language models (LLMs) to boost exploration and prune unnecessary actions in MARL. Using just a basic prompt that outlines the overall task and setting, eSpark is capable of generating exploration functions in a zero-shot manner, identifying and pruning redundant or irrelevant state-action pairs, and then achieving autonomous improvement from policy feedback. In reinforcement learning tasks involving inventory management and traffic light control encompassing a total of 15 scenarios, eSpark consistently outperforms the combined MARL algorithm in all scenarios, achieving an average performance gain of 34.4% and 9.9% in the two types of tasks respectively. Additionally, eSpark has proven to be capable of managing situations with a large number of agents, securing a 29.7% improvement in scalability challenges that featured over 500 agents.

      <title>CoSLight: Co-optimizing Collaborator Selection and Decision-making to Enhance Traffic Signal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective multi-intersection collaboration is pivotal for reinforcement-learning-based traffic signal control to alleviate congestion. Existing work mainly chooses neighboring intersections as collaborators. However, quite an amount of congestion, even some wide-range congestion, is caused by non-neighbors failing to collaborate. To address these issues, we propose to separate the collaborator selection as a second policy to be learned, concurrently being updated with the original signal-controlling policy. Specifically, the selection policy in real-time adaptively selects the best teammates according to phase- and intersection-level features. Empirical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets provide robust validation for the superiority of our approach, offering significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/AnonymousAccountss/CoSLight.</description>

      <title>GAMEOPT+: Improving Fuel Efficiency in Unregulated Heterogeneous Traffic Intersections via Optimal Multi-agent Cooperative Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Better fuel efficiency leads to better financial security as well as a cleaner environment. We propose a novel approach for improving fuel efficiency in unstructured and unregulated traffic environments. Existing intelligent transportation solutions for improving fuel efficiency, however, apply only to traffic intersections with sparse traffic or traffic where drivers obey the regulations, or both. We propose GameOpt+, a novel hybrid approach for cooperative intersection control in dynamic, multi-lane, unsignalized intersections. GameOpt+ is a hybrid solution that combines an auction mechanism and an optimization-based trajectory planner. It generates a priority entrance sequence for each agent and computes velocity controls in real-time, taking less than 10 milliseconds even in high-density traffic with over 10,000 vehicles per hour. Compared to fully optimization-based methods, it operates 100 times faster while ensuring fairness, safety, and efficiency. Tested on the SUMO simulator, our algorithm improves throughput by at least 25%, reduces the time to reach the goal by at least 70%, and decreases fuel consumption by 50% compared to auction-based and signaled approaches using traffic lights and stop signs. GameOpt+ is also unaffected by unbalanced traffic inflows, whereas some of the other baselines encountered a decrease in performance in unbalanced traffic inflow environments.</description>

      <title>Towards Imitation Learning in Real World Unstructured Social Mini-Games in Pedestrian Crowds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) strategies are used to generate policies for robot motion planning and navigation by learning from human trajectories. Recently, there has been a lot of excitement in applying IL in social interactions arising in urban environments such as university campuses, restaurants, grocery stores, and hospitals. However, obtaining numerous expert demonstrations in social settings might be expensive, risky, or even impossible. Current approaches therefore, focus only on simulated social interaction scenarios. This raises the question: \textit{How can a robot learn to imitate an expert demonstrator from real world multi-agent social interaction scenarios}? It remains unknown which, if any, IL methods perform well and what assumptions they require. We benchmark representative IL methods in real world social interaction scenarios on a motion planning task, using a novel pedestrian intersection dataset collected at the University of Texas at Austin campus. Our evaluation reveals two key findings: first, learning multi-agent cost functions is required for learning the diverse behavior modes of agents in tightly coupled interactions and second, conditioning the training of IL methods on partial state information or providing global information in simulation can improve imitation learning, especially in real world social interaction scenarios.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Incentive Design with Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can the system operator learn an incentive mechanism that achieves social optimality based on limited information about the agents' behavior, who are dynamically updating their strategies? To answer this question, we propose an \emph{adaptive} incentive mechanism. This mechanism updates the incentives of agents based on the feedback of each agent's externality, evaluated as the difference between the player's marginal cost and society's marginal cost at each time step. The proposed mechanism updates the incentives on a slower timescale compared to the agents' learning dynamics, resulting in a two-timescale coupled dynamical system. Notably, this mechanism is agnostic to the specific learning dynamics used by agents to update their strategies. We show that any fixed point of this adaptive incentive mechanism corresponds to the optimal incentive mechanism, ensuring that the Nash equilibrium coincides with the socially optimal strategy. Additionally, we provide sufficient conditions that guarantee the convergence of the adaptive incentive mechanism to a fixed point. Our results apply to both atomic and non-atomic games. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism, we verify the convergence conditions in two practically relevant games: atomic networked quadratic aggregative games and non-atomic network routing games.</description>

      <title>LLM-Based Cooperative Agents using Information Relevance and Plan Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of multi-agent cooperation, where agents achieve a common goal by interacting with a 3D scene and cooperating with decentralized agents under complex partial observations. This involves managing communication costs and optimizing interaction trajectories in dynamic environments. Our research focuses on three primary limitations of existing cooperative agent systems. Firstly, current systems demonstrate inefficiency in managing acquired information through observation, resulting in declining planning performance as the environment becomes more complex with additional objects or goals. Secondly, the neglect of false plans in partially observable settings leads to suboptimal cooperative performance, as agents struggle to adapt to environmental changes influenced by the unseen actions of other agents. Lastly, the failure to incorporate spatial data into decision-making processes restricts the agent's ability to construct optimized trajectories. To overcome these limitations, we propose the RElevance and Validation-Enhanced Cooperative Language Agent (REVECA), a novel cognitive architecture powered by GPT-3.5. REVECA leverages relevance assessment, plan validation, and spatial information to enhance the efficiency and robustness of agent cooperation in dynamic and partially observable environments while minimizing continuous communication costs and effectively managing irrelevant dummy objects. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of REVECA over previous approaches, including those driven by GPT-4.0. Additionally, a user study highlights REVECA's potential for achieving trustworthy human-AI cooperation. We expect that REVECA will have significant applications in gaming, XR applications, educational tools, and humanoid robots, contributing to substantial economic, commercial, and academic advancements.</description>

      <title>A Large Language Model-based multi-agent manufacturing system for intelligent shopfloor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As productivity advances, the demand of customers for multi-variety and small-batch production is increasing, thereby putting forward higher requirements for manufacturing systems. When production tasks frequent changes due to this demand, traditional manufacturing systems often cannot response promptly. The multi-agent manufacturing system is proposed to address this problem. However, because of technical limitations, the negotiation among agents in this kind of system is realized through predefined heuristic rules, which is not intelligent enough to deal with the multi-variety and small batch production. To this end, a Large Language Model-based (LLM-based) multi-agent manufacturing system for intelligent shopfloor is proposed in the present study. This system delineates the diverse agents and defines their collaborative methods. The roles of the agents encompass Machine Server Agent (MSA), Bid Inviter Agent (BIA), Bidder Agent (BA), Thinking Agent (TA), and Decision Agent (DA). Due to the support of LLMs, TA and DA acquire the ability of analyzing the shopfloor condition and choosing the most suitable machine, as opposed to executing a predefined program artificially. The negotiation between BAs and BIA is the most crucial step in connecting manufacturing resources. With the support of TA and DA, BIA will finalize the distribution of orders, relying on the information of each machine returned by BA. MSAs bears the responsibility for connecting the agents with the physical shopfloor. This system aims to distribute and transmit workpieces through the collaboration of the agents with these distinct roles, distinguishing it from other scheduling approaches. Comparative experiments were also conducted to validate the performance of this system.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Multiscale Reinforcement Q-Learning Algorithms for Mean Field Control Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean Field Control Games (MFCG), introduced in [Angiuli et al., 2022a], represent competitive games between a large number of large collaborative groups of agents in the infinite limit of number and size of groups. In this paper, we prove the convergence of a three-timescale Reinforcement Q-Learning (RL) algorithm to solve MFCG in a model-free approach from the point of view of representative agents. Our analysis uses a Q-table for finite state and action spaces updated at each discrete time-step over an infinite horizon. In [Angiuli et al., 2023], we proved convergence of two-timescale algorithms for MFG and MFC separately highlighting the need to follow multiple population distributions in the MFC case. Here, we integrate this feature for MFCG as well as three rates of update decreasing to zero in the proper ratios. Our technique of proof uses a generalization to three timescales of the two-timescale analysis in [Borkar, 1997]. We give a simple example satisfying the various hypothesis made in the proof of convergence and illustrating the performance of the algorithm.</description>

Abstract: Identification and analysis of symmetrical patterns in the natural world have led to significant discoveries across various scientific fields, such as the formulation of gravitational laws in physics and advancements in the study of chemical structures. In this paper, we focus on exploiting Euclidean symmetries inherent in certain cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problems and prevalent in many applications. We begin by formally characterizing a subclass of Markov games with a general notion of symmetries that admits the existence of symmetric optimal values and policies. Motivated by these properties, we design neural network architectures with symmetric constraints embedded as an inductive bias for multi-agent actor-critic methods. This inductive bias results in superior performance in various cooperative MARL benchmarks and impressive generalization capabilities such as zero-shot learning and transfer learning in unseen scenarios with repeated symmetric patterns. The code is available at: https://github.com/dchen48/E3AC.</description>

      <title>A Decision-Language Model (DLM) for Dynamic Restless Multi-Armed Bandit Tasks in Public Health</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14807v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Restless multi-armed bandits (RMAB) have demonstrated success in optimizing resource allocation for large beneficiary populations in public health settings. Unfortunately, RMAB models lack flexibility to adapt to evolving public health policy priorities. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as adept automated planners across domains of robotic control and navigation. In this paper, we propose a Decision Language Model (DLM) for RMABs, enabling dynamic fine-tuning of RMAB policies in public health settings using human-language commands. We propose using LLMs as automated planners to (1) interpret human policy preference prompts, (2) propose reward functions as code for a multi-agent RMAB environment, and (3) iterate on the generated reward functions using feedback from grounded RMAB simulations. We illustrate the application of DLM in collaboration with ARMMAN, an India-based non-profit promoting preventative care for pregnant mothers, that currently relies on RMAB policies to optimally allocate health worker calls to low-resource populations. We conduct a technology demonstration in simulation using the Gemini Pro model, showing DLM can dynamically shape policy outcomes using only human prompts as input.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ad hoc teamwork poses a challenging problem, requiring the design of an agent to collaborate with teammates without prior coordination or joint training. Open ad hoc teamwork further complicates this challenge by considering environments with a changing number of teammates, referred to as open teams. One promising solution to this problem is leveraging the generalizability of graph neural networks to handle an unrestricted number of agents and effectively address open teams, named graph-based policy learning (GPL). However, its joint Q-value representation over a coordination graph lacks convincing explanations. In this paper, we establish a new theory to understand the joint Q-value representation from the perspective of cooperative game theory, and validate its learning paradigm in open team settings. Building on our theory, we propose a novel algorithm named CIAO compatible with GPL framework, with additional provable implementation tricks that can facilitate learning. The demo of experiments is available on https://sites.google.com/view/ciao2024, and the code of experiments is published on https://github.com/hsvgbkhgbv/CIAO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02124v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems are increasingly employed in intricate social environments, a pressing query emerges: Can these NLP systems mirror human-esque collaborative intelligence, in a multi-agent society consisting of multiple large language models (LLMs)? This paper probes the collaboration mechanisms among contemporary NLP systems by melding practical experiments with theoretical insights. We fabricate four unique `societies' comprised of LLM agents, where each agent is characterized by a specific `trait' (easy-going or overconfident) and engages in collaboration with a distinct `thinking pattern' (debate or reflection). Through evaluating these multi-agent societies on three benchmark datasets, we discern that certain collaborative strategies not only outshine previous top-tier approaches, but also optimize efficiency (using fewer API tokens). Moreover, our results further illustrate that LLM agents manifest human-like social behaviors, such as conformity and consensus reaching, mirroring foundational social psychology theories. In conclusion, we integrate insights from social psychology to contextualize the collaboration of LLM agents, inspiring further investigations into the collaboration mechanism for LLMs. We commit to sharing our code and datasets\footnote{\url{https://github.com/zjunlp/MachineSoM}.}, hoping to catalyze further research in this promising avenue.</description>

      <title>Optimistic Multi-Agent Policy Gradient</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: *Relative overgeneralization* (RO) occurs in cooperative multi-agent learning tasks when agents converge towards a suboptimal joint policy due to overfitting to suboptimal behavior of other agents. No methods have been proposed for addressing RO in multi-agent policy gradient (MAPG) methods although these methods produce state-of-the-art results. To address this gap, we propose a general, yet simple, framework to enable optimistic updates in MAPG methods that alleviate the RO problem. Our approach involves clipping the advantage to eliminate negative values, thereby facilitating optimistic updates in MAPG. The optimism prevents individual agents from quickly converging to a local optimum. Additionally, we provide a formal analysis to show that the proposed method retains optimality at a fixed point. In extensive evaluations on a diverse set of tasks including the *Multi-agent MuJoCo* and *Overcooked* benchmarks, our method outperforms strong baselines on 13 out of 19 tested tasks and matches the performance on the rest.</description>

      <title>AutoAct: Automatic Agent Learning from Scratch for QA via Self-Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05268v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language agents have achieved considerable performance on various complex question-answering tasks by planning with external tools. Despite the incessant exploration in this field, existing language agent systems still struggle with costly, non-reproducible data reliance and face the challenge of compelling a single model for multiple functions. To this end, we introduce AutoAct, an automatic agent learning framework for QA that does not rely on large-scale annotated data and synthetic planning trajectories from closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4). Given limited data with a tool library, AutoAct first automatically synthesizes planning trajectories without any assistance from humans or strong closed-source models. Then, AutoAct leverages a division-of-labor strategy to automatically differentiate based on the target task information and synthesized trajectories, producing a sub-agent group to complete the task. We conduct comprehensive experiments with different LLMs, which demonstrates that AutoAct yields better or parallel performance compared to various strong baselines. Further analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the division-of-labor strategy, with the trajectory quality generated by AutoAct generally outperforming that of others.

      <title>Policy Space Response Oracles: A Survey</title>

Abstract: Game theory provides a mathematical way to study the interaction between multiple decision makers. However, classical game-theoretic analysis is limited in scalability due to the large number of strategies, precluding direct application to more complex scenarios. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of a framework for large games, known as Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO), which holds promise to improve scalability by focusing attention on sufficient subsets of strategies. We first motivate PSRO and provide historical context. We then focus on the strategy exploration problem for PSRO: the challenge of assembling effective subsets of strategies that still represent the original game well with minimum computational cost. We survey current research directions for enhancing the efficiency of PSRO, and explore the applications of PSRO across various domains. We conclude by discussing open questions and future research.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient LLM Grounding for Embodied Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grounding the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) for embodied tasks is challenging due to the complexity of the physical world. Especially, LLM planning for multi-agent collaboration requires communication of agents or credit assignment as the feedback to re-adjust the proposed plans and achieve effective coordination. However, existing methods that overly rely on physical verification or self-reflection suffer from excessive and inefficient querying of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for multi-agent collaboration that introduces Reinforced Advantage feedback (ReAd) for efficient self-refinement of plans. Specifically, we perform critic regression to learn a sequential advantage function from LLM-planned data, and then treat the LLM planner as an optimizer to generate actions that maximize the advantage function. It endows the LLM with the foresight to discern whether the action contributes to accomplishing the final task. We provide theoretical analysis by extending advantage-weighted regression in reinforcement learning to multi-agent systems. Experiments on Overcooked-AI and a difficult variant of RoCoBench show that ReAd surpasses baselines in success rate, and also significantly decreases the interaction steps of agents and query rounds of LLMs, demonstrating its high efficiency for grounding LLMs. More results are given at https://read-llm.github.io/.</description>
