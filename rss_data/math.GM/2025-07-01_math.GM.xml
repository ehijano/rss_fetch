      <title>Iteration Steps of 3x+1 Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the 3x+1 problem, given a positive integer $N$, let $D\left( N \right) $, $O\left( N \right) $, $E\left( N \right) $ be the total iteration steps, the odd iteration steps and the even iteration steps when $N$ iterates to 1(except 1) respectively. Trivially, we have $D\left( N \right) =O\left( N \right) +E\left( N \right) $. In this paper, we propose a so-called weak residue conjecture(i.e., $\frac{2^{E\left( N \right)}}{3^{O\left( N \right)}\cdot N}\le 2$). We prove that if 3x+1 conjecture is true and the weak residue conjecture is true, there exist non-trivial relationships among $D\left( N \right) $, $O\left( N \right) $, $E\left( N \right) $, i.e., $O\left( N \right) =\left[ \log _62\cdot D\left( N \right) -\log _6N \right] $(it implies that we can calculate $O\left( N \right) $, $E\left( N \right) $ directly by $D\left( N \right) $ only, of course given $N$), and 5 more similar equations are derived simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Something about Inter-universal Teichmuller Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02448v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There was a lot of controversy about corollary 3.12, which was described in the paper Inter-universal Teichmuller Theory III. In this article, another proof of Corollary 3.12 will be derived, where the basis of the proof will be the Erdos-Kac theorem. Also in Inter-universal Teichmuller Theory IV it was said that the theory has a strong connection with the theory of Weil cohomology, based on this connection, very important physical applications will be derived in this article: generalization of non-Abelian Hodge correspondence, non-Abelian gauge theory, proof of the mass gap based on corollary 3.12, T duality is $\Theta^{\pm ell}$NF Hodge Theater, the limit at which a black hole appears, the inflationary growth of the universe for the observer.</description>

      <title>Zeta function for convex domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Each irreducible fraction $p/q&gt;0$ corresponds to a primitive vector $(p,q)\in\mathbb Z^2$ with $p,q&gt;0$. Such a vector $(p,q)$ can be uniquely written as the sum of two primitive vectors $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$ that span a parallelogram of oriented area one.
  We present new summation formulae over the set of such parallelograms. These formulae depend explicitly on $a,b,c,d$ and thus define a summation over primitive vectors $(p,q)=(a+c,b+d)$ indirectly. Equivalently, these sums may be interpreted as running over pairs of consecutive Farey fractions $c/d$ and $a/b$, $ad-bc=1$.
  The input for our formulae is the graph of a strictly concave function $g$. The terms are the areas of certain triangles formed by tangents to the graph of $g$. Several of these formulae for different $g$ yield values involving $\pi$. For $g$ being a parabola we recover the famous Mordell-Tornheim series (also called the Witten series). As a nice application we also discuss formulae for continued fractions of an arbitrary real number $\alpha$ that involve coefficients of the continued fraction and the differences between the convergents and $\alpha$.
  Using Hata's work, we interpret the above terms as the coefficients of the Legendre transform of $g$ in a certain Schauder basis, allowing us to interpret our formulae as Parseval-type identities. We hope that the Legendre duality sheds new light on Hata's approach.
  Raising the terms in the above summation formula to the power $s$ we obtain an analytic function $F_g(s)$ which may be thought as the zeta function corresponding to the convex domain bounded by the graph of $g$. We show that for a concave $g$ in $C^2[0,1]$ the residue of $F_g(s)$ at $s=2/3$ is proportional to the affine length of the graph of $g$.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Solution to the Isoperimetric Problem and its Quantitative Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a geometric solution to the classical isoperimetric problem by analysing the area efficiency of n-sided regular polygons through a novel apothem-hypotenuse ratio framework. Many new formulas are derived to quantify polygonal efficiency based on apothem, hypotenuse, and perimeter, demonstrating how regular polygons approach the optimal area-enclosing efficiency of the circle as the number of sides increases. This paper derives several bounded efficiency metrics for regular polygons. This approach provides fresh insight into quantitative isoperimetric inequalities through direct geometric reasoning, with accuracy confirmed by both analytical derivation and numerical testing.</description>
