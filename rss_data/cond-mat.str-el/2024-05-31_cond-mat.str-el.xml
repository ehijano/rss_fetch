      <title>Ground state phases of the two-dimension electron gas with a unified variational approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) is a fundamental model, which is drawing increasing interest because of recent advances in experimental and theoretical studies of 2D materials. Current understanding of the ground state of the 2DEG relies on quantum Monte Carlo calculations, based on variational comparisons of different ansatze for different phases. We use a single variational ansatz, a general backflow-type wave function using a message-passing neural quantum state architecture, for a unified description across the entire density range. The variational optimization consistently leads to lower ground-state energies than previous best results. Transition into a Wigner crystal (WC) phase occurs automatically at rs = 37 +/- 1, a density lower than currently believed. Between the liquid and WC phases, the same ansatz and variational search strongly suggest the existence of intermediate states in a broad range of densities, with enhanced short-range nematic spin correlations.</description>

      <title>A possible spin Jahn-Teller material: ordered pseudobrookite FeTi2O5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the spin-lattice coupling in orthorhombic pseudobrookite FeTi2O5 single crystal with highly ordered $ Fe^{2+} / Ti^{4+}$ occupation, which consists of quasi-1D S=2 chains running along a-axis. Both the magnetization and specific heat measurements confirm that the antiferromagnetic phase transition of FeTi2O5 occurs at TN = 42 K. The structural distortions were also observed around TN in the thermal expansion $ \Delta L / L (T)$ data. Moreover, the magnetic field was found to strongly affect the thermal expansion both along chains and in the perpendicular direction clearly signaling a substantial magnetoelastic coupling, which was recently proposed to be the origin of a rare spin Jahn-Teller effect, when frustration is lifted via additional lattice distortions. Experimentally observed change in the thermal conductivity slope around TN is usually associated with the orbital ordering, but DFT+U calculations do not detect modification of the orbital structure across the transition. However, the first-principles calculation results confirm that FeTi2O5 is a quasi-1D magnet with a ratio of frustrating inter-chain to intra-chain exchanges $ J' / J = 0 . 0 3$ and a substantial single-ion anisotropy (A = 4K) of easy-axis type making this material interesting for studying quantum criticality in transverse magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>A frustrated antipolar phase analogous to classical spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of magnetic frustration in classical spin systems was motivated by the prediction and discovery of classical spin liquid states. These uncommon magnetic phases are characterized by a massive degeneracy of their ground state implying a finite magnetic entropy at zero temperature. While the classical spin liquid state was originally predicted in the Ising triangular lattice antiferromagnet in 1950, this state has never been experimentally observed in any triangular magnets. We report here the discovery of an electric analogue of classical spin liquids on a triangular lattice of uniaxial electric dipoles in EuAl$_{12}$O$_{19}$. This new type of frustrated antipolar phase is characterized by a highly degenerate state at low temperature implying an absence of long-range antiferroelectric order, despite short range antipolar correlations. Its dynamics are governed by a thermally activated process, slowing down upon cooling towards a complete freezing at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Quantum Thermalization via Travelling Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isolated quantum many-body systems which thermalize under their own dynamics are expected to act as their own thermal baths, thereby bringing their local subsystems to thermal equilibrium. Here we show that the infinite-dimensional limit of a quantum lattice model, as described by Dynamical Mean-Field theory (DMFT), provides a natural framework to understand this self-consistent thermalization process. Using the Fermi-Hubbard model as working example, we demonstrate that the emergence of a self-consistent bath thermalising the system is characterized by a sharp thermalization front, moving balistically and separating the initial condition from the long-time thermal fixed point. We characterize the full DMFT dynamics through an effective temperature for which we derive a travelling-wave equation of the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (FKPP) type. This equation allows to predict the asymptotic shape of the front and its velocity, which match perfectly the full DMFT numerics. Our results provide a new angle to understand the onset of quantum thermalisation in closed isolated systems.</description>

      <title>Scanning tunneling spectroscopy of magnetic quantum impurities in two-dimensional magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) of magnetic quantum impurities in (partially) polarized phases of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals magnets. Focusing on the Kitaev-Heisenberg honeycomb model for transition metal trihalides, e.g., CrI$_3$ or $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, we consider adatom and substitutional impurity positions. Unlike the non-magnetic case, magnetic impurities can induce bound states below the magnon gap, whose energy one can measured by STS at finite bias voltage. Whenever the bound state energy vanishes as function of the magnetic field, we predict discontinuous local spin transitions which are expected to be ubiquitous in 2D magnets. They can be detected by STS in the zero-bias limit.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of Biskyrmions by chiral interaction in centrosymmetric magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a microscopic mechanism for stabilization of biskyrmions in nature by investigating a minimal classical spin lattice model with nearest neighbour ferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange and static chiral magnetic interaction on the triangular lattice. The model is physically motivated model from the Mott insulators with broken time-reversal symmetry, that is, in the large-$U$ limit of the one band Hubbard model at half-filling on a two-dimensional lattice in the presence of external magnetic field. At order $1/U^{2}$, the external magnetic field can induce a chiral interaction between the three neighbouring spins. We demonstrate that the chiral magnetic interaction results in biskyrmion states above a critical value and its strength affects the size of biskyrmions forming.</description>

      <title>High-order Van Hove singularities and their connection to flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flattening of single-particle band structures plays an important role in the quest for novel quantum states of matter due to the crucial role of interactions. Recent advances in theory and experiment made it possible to construct and tune systems with nearly flat bands, ranging from graphene multilayers and moire' materials to kagome' metals and ruthenates. While theoretical models predict exactly flat bands under certain ideal conditions, evidence was provided that these systems host high-order Van Hove points, i.e., points of high local band flatness and power-law divergence in energy of the density of states. In this review, we examine recent developments in engineering and realising such weakly dispersive bands. We focus on high-order Van Hove singularities and explore their connection to exactly flat bands. We provide classification schemes and discuss interaction effects. We also review experimental evidence for high-order Van Hove singularities and point out future research directions.</description>

      <title>Massless Quasiparticles in Bogoliubov-de Gennes Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gapless quasiparticles can exist in the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonians in the mean field description of superconductors (SCs), fermionic superfluids (SFs) and quantum spin liquids (QSLs). The mechanism of gapless quasiparticles in superconductors was studied in literature based on the homotopy theory or symmetry-indicators. However, important properties of the gapless quasiparticles including the degeneracy, the energy-momentum dispersion and the responses to external probe fields need to be determined. In the present work, we investigate gapless quasiparticles in general BdG systems by using projective representation theory for the full `symmetry' groups formed by combinations of lattice, spin and charge operations. We found that (I) charge conjugation (or effective charge conjugation) symmetry can yield gapless quasiparticles with linear, quadratic or higher order dispersions at high symmetry points of the Brillouin zone; (II) different quantum numbers protected level crossing can give rise to zero modes along high symmetry lines; (III) combined spatial inversion and time reversal symmetry can protect zero modes appearing at generic $k$ point. To obtain the low energy properties of gapless quasiparticles, the $k\cdot p$ theory is provided using a high efficient method--the Hamiltonian approach. Based on generalized band representation theory for BdG systems, several lattice models are constructed to illustrate the above results. Our theory provides a method to classify nodal SCs/SFs/QSLs with given symmetries, and enlightens the realization of Majorana type massless quasiparticles in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Magnetic structure and magnetoelectric coupling in antiferromagnet Co5(TeO3)4Cl2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The van der Waals (vdW) layered multiferroics, which host simultaneous ferroelectric and magnetic orders, have attracted attention not only for their potentials to be utilized in nanoelectric devices and spintronics, but also offer alternative opportunities for emergent physical phenomena. To date, the vdW layered multiferroic materials are still very rare. In this work, we have investigated the magnetic structure and magnetoelectric effects in Co5(TeO3)4Cl2, a promising new multiferroic compound with antiferromagnetic (AFM) Neel point TN = 18 K. The neutron powder diffraction reveals the non-coplanar AFM state with preferred Neel vector along the c-axis, while a spin re-orientation occurring between 8 K and 15 K is identified, which results from the distinct temperature dependence of the non-equivalent Co sites moment in Co5(TeO3)4Cl2. What is more, it is found that Co5(TeO3)4Cl2 is one of the best vdW multiferroics studied so far in terms of the multiferroic performance. The measured linear ME coefficient exhibits the emergent oscillation dependence of the angle between magnetic field and electric field, and the maximal value is as big as 45 ps/m. It is suggested that Co5(TeO3)4Cl2 is an appreciated platform for exploring the emergent multiferroicity in vdW layered compounds.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced crystalline topology of excitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the topological theory of symmetry indicators to interaction-induced exciton band structures in centrosymmetric semiconductors. Crucially, we distinguish between the topological invariants inherited from the underlying electron and hole bands, and those that are intrinsic to the exciton wavefunction itself. Focusing on the latter, we show that there exists a class of exciton bands for which the maximally-localised exciton Wannier states are shifted with respect to the electronic Wannier states by a quantised amount; we call these excitons shift excitons. Our analysis explains how the exciton spectrum can be topologically nontrivial and sustain exciton edge states in open boundary conditions even when the underlying noninteracting bands have a trivial atomic limit. We demonstrate the presence of shift excitons as the lowest energy neutral excitations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model in its trivial phase when supplemented by local two-body interactions, and show that they can be accessed experimentally in local optical conductivity measurements.</description>

      <title>Quarter- and half-filled quantum Hall states and their competing interactions in bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bilayer graphene has emerged as a key platform for studying non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states. Its multiple half-filled plateaus with large energy gaps combined with its tunability offer an opportunity to distill the principles that determine their topological order. Here, we report four additional plateaus at $\nu=\frac{1}{2}$ for different spin and valley, revealing a systematic pattern of non-Abelian states according to their Levin--Halperin daughter states. Whenever a pair of $N=1$ Landau levels cross, anti-Pfaffian and Pfaffian develop at half filling of the lower and higher levels, respectively. In the $N=0$ levels, where half-filled plateaus are absent, we instead observe four unexpected incompressible quarter-filled states along with daughters. The mutual exclusion of half- and quarter-filled states indicates a robust competition between the interactions favoring either paired states of two-flux or four-flux composite fermions. Finally, we observe several FQH states that require strong interactions between composite fermions. Our combined findings herald a new generation of quantum Hall physics in graphene-based heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study multiscalar theories with $\text{O}(N) \times \text{O}(2)$ symmetry. These models have a stable fixed point in $d$ dimensions if $N$ is greater than some critical value $N_c(d)$. Previous estimates of this critical value from perturbative and non-perturbative renormalization group methods have produced mutually incompatible results. We use numerical conformal bootstrap methods to constrain $N_c(d)$ for $3 \leq d &lt; 4$. Our results show that $N_c&gt; 3.78$ for $d = 3$. This favors the scenario that the physically relevant models with $N = 2,3$ in $d=3$ do not have a stable fixed point, indicating a first-order transition. Our result exemplifies how conformal windows can be rigorously constrained with modern numerical bootstrap algorithms.</description>

      <title>On stability of k-local quantum phases of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current theoretical framework for topological phases of matter is based on the thermodynamic limit of a system with geometrically local interactions. A natural question is to what extent the notion of a phase of matter remains well-defined if we relax the constraint of geometric locality, and replace it with a weaker graph-theoretic notion of $k$-locality. As a step towards answering this question, we analyze the stability of the energy gap to perturbations for Hamiltonians corresponding to general quantum low-density parity-check codes, extending work of Bravyi and Hastings [Commun. Math. Phys. 307, 609 (2011)]. A corollary of our main result is that if there exist constants $\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2&gt;0$ such that the size $\Gamma(r)$ of balls of radius $r$ on the interaction graph satisfy $\Gamma(r) = O(\exp(r^{1-\varepsilon_1}))$ and the local ground states of balls of radius $r\le\rho^\ast = O(\log(n)^{1+\varepsilon_2})$ are locally indistinguishable, then the energy gap of the associated Hamiltonian is stable against local perturbations. This gives an almost exponential improvement over the $D$-dimensional Euclidean case, which requires $\Gamma(r) = O(r^D)$ and $\rho^\ast = O(n^\alpha)$ for some $\alpha &gt; 0$. The approach we follow falls just short of proving stability of finite-rate qLDPC codes, which have $\varepsilon_1 = 0$; we discuss some strategies to extend the result to these cases. We discuss implications for the third law of thermodynamics, as $k$-local Hamiltonians can have extensive zero-temperature entropy.</description>

      <title>Exploring Replica-Potts CFTs in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate a numerical conformal bootstrap study of CFTs with $S_n \ltimes (S_Q)^n$ global symmetry. These include CFTs that can be obtained as coupled replicas of two-dimensional critical Potts models. Particular attention is paid to the special case $S_3 \ltimes (S_3)^3$, which governs the critical behaviour of three coupled critical 3-state Potts models, a multi-scalar realisation of a (potentially) non-integrable CFT in two dimensions. The model has been studied in earlier works using perturbation theory, transfer matrices, and Monte Carlo simulations. This work represents an independent non-perturbative analysis. Our results are in agreement with previous determinations: we obtain an allowed peninsula within parameter space for the scaling dimensions of the three lowest-lying operators in the theory, which contains the earlier predictions for these scaling dimensions. Additionally, we derive numerous bounds on admissible scaling dimensions in the theory, which are compatible with earlier results. Our work sets the necessary groundwork for a future precision study of these theories in the conformal bootstrap.</description>

Abstract: Fracton phases of matter constitute an interesting point of contact between condensed matter and high-energy physics. The limited mobility property of fracton quasiparticles finds applications in many different contexts, including quantum information, spin liquids, elasticity, hydrodynamics, gravity and holography. In this paper we adopt a field theoretical approach to investigate the three dimensional action of a rank-2 symmetric tensor field invariant under the covariant fracton symmetry. The theory appears as a non-topological higher rank generalization of the ordinary Chern-Simons model, depending only on the traceless part of the tensor gauge field. After defining a field strength, a rank-2 traceless ``electric'' field and a ``magnetic'' vector field are identified, in analogy with the standard Chern-Simons ones. Once matter is introduced, a Hall-like behaviour with fractonic features emerges. In particular, our model shows a Hall-like dipole current, together with a vectorial ``flux-attachment'' relation for dipoles. This gives a possible starting point for a fracton - vortex duality. A gauge-fixing term is then introduced, from which propagators are computed and the counting of the degrees of freedom is performed. Finally, the energy-momentum tensor is shown to be conserved and the integrated energy density is proved to be zero, which reminds the topological nature of the standard Chern-Simons model.</description>

      <title>Correlated Electronic Structure and Density-Wave Gap in Trilayer Nickelate La4Ni3O10</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of pressurized superconductivity at 80 K in La3Ni2O7 officially brings nickelates into the family of high-temperature superconductors, which gives rise to not only new insights but also mysteries in the strongly correlated superconductivity. More recently, the sibling compound La4Ni3O10 was also shown to be superconducting below about 25 K under pressure, further boosting the popularity of nickelates in the Ruddlesden-Popper phase. In this study, combining high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ab initio calculation, we systematically investigate the electronic structures of La4Ni3O10 at ambient pressure. We reveal a high resemblance of La4Ni3O10 with La3Ni2O7 in the orbital-dependent fermiology and electronic structure, suggesting a similar electronic correlation between the two compounds. The temperature-dependent measurements imply an orbital-dependent energy gap related to the density-wave transition in La4Ni3O10. By comparing the theoretical pressure-dependent electronic structure, clues about the superconducting high-pressure phase can be deduced from the ambient measurements, providing crucial information for deciphering the unconventional superconductivity in nickelates.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Quantum Many-Body Scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a type of phase transition in quantum many-body systems, which occurs in highly excited quantum many-body scar states, while the rest of the spectrum is largely unaffected. Such scar state phase transitions can be realized by embedding a matrix product state, known to undergo a phase transition, as a scar state into the thermal spectrum of a parent Hamiltonian. We find numerically that the mechanism for the scar state phase transition involves the formation or presence of low-entropy states at energies similar to the scar state in the vicinity of the phase transition point.</description>

      <title>Beyond spin-charge separation: Helical modes and topological quantum phase transitions in one-dimensional Fermi gases with spin-orbit and Rabi couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the experimental observation of spin-charge separation in one-dimensional interacting Fermi gases, we investigate these systems in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and Rabi fields. We demonstrate that spin-charge-separated modes evolve into helical collective modes due to the special mixing of spin and charge induced by spin-orbit coupling and Rabi fields. We obtain the phase diagram of chemical potential versus Rabi fields for given spin-orbit coupling and interactions, and find several topological quantum phase transitions of the Lifshitz type. We show that the velocities of the collective modes are nonanalytic at the boundaries between different phases. Lastly, we analyze the charge-charge, spin-charge and spin-spin dynamical structure factors to show that the dispersions, spectral weights and helicities of the collective modes can be experimentally extracted in systems such as $^{6}{\rm Li}$, $^{40}{\rm K}$ and $^{173}{\rm Yb}$.</description>

      <title>Variational Mapping of Chern Bands to Landau Levels: Application to Fractional Chern Insulators in Twisted MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of mapping between Chern bands and generalized Landau levels in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$, where fractional Chern insulators have been observed. We construct an exact Landau-level representation of moir\'e bands, where the bases are derived from Landau-level wavefunctions dressed by spinors aligned or antialigned with the layer pseudospin skyrmion field and maintain uniform quantum geometry. We further generalize the dressed zeroth Landau level to a variational wavefunction with an ideal yet nonuniform quantum geometry and variationally maximize its weight in the first moir\'e band. The variational wavefunction quantitatively reproduces the exact diagonalization spectra of fractional Chern insulators at hole-filling factors $\nu_h=2/3$ and $3/5$ across a large twist-angle range. Our work introduces a new approach to studying fractional states by bridging the gap between Chern bands and Landau levels.</description>

      <title>Quasi-one-dimensional exchange interactions and short-range magnetic correlations in CuTeO4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.06696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CuTeO4 has been proposed as a crystallographically distinct, yet electronic structure analog, of the superconducting cuprates. Here, we present detailed characterization of the of the physical properties of CuTeO4 to address this proposal. Fitting of magnetic susceptibility data indicates unexpected quasi-one-dimensional, antiferromagnetic correlations at high temperature, with a nearest neighbour Heisenberg exchange of J1=165(4) K. Low temperature heat capacity measurements reveal a sizable T-linear contribution of $\gamma = 9.58(8) mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2}$, qualitatively consistent with expectations for a S=1/2, uniform, Heisenberg spin chain. Below T ~ 40 K, the susceptibility shows an upturn inconsistent with quasi-one-dimensional behaviour. While heat capacity measurements show no signs of magnetic order down to low temperature, the upturn in the magnetic susceptibility coincides with the emergence of a diffuse peak (centered at |Q| ~ 0.7 Angstrom) in the neutron diffraction data, indicative of persistent, short-range, antiferromagnetic order with a correlation length of $\xi$ = 10.1(9) Angstrom at T = 10 K. The onset of nonlinearity and hysteresis in the isothermal magnetization curves suggest the presence of a small ferromagnetic component. This persistent, short-range order is understood in the context of structural modeling of the x-ray and neutron diffraction data that show the presence of a significant density of stacking faults. No evidence for substantive dopability is observed and CuTeO4 appears qualitatively, to have a larger band gap than predicted by density functional theory. We ascribe this finding to the inductive withdrawal effect from high-valence Te and suggest that superconductivity in the copper tellurates is more likely to be found in compounds with a decreased reductive withdrawal effect from Te.</description>

      <title>Unifying Emergent Hydrodynamics and Lindbladian Low Energy Spectra across Symmetries, Constraints, and Long-Range Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13028v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify emergent hydrodynamics governing charge transport in Brownian random circuits with various symmetries, constraints, and ranges of interactions. This is accomplished via a mapping between the averaged dynamics and the low energy spectrum of a Lindblad operator, which acts as an effective Hamiltonian in a doubled Hilbert space. By explicitly constructing dispersive excited states of this effective Hamiltonian using a single mode approximation, we provide a comprehensive understanding of diffusive, subdiffusive, and superdiffusive relaxation in many-body systems with conserved multipole moments and variable interaction ranges. Our approach further allows us to identify exotic Krylov-space-resolved hydrodynamics exhibiting diffusive relaxation despite the presence of dipole conservation, which we verify numerically. Our approach provides a general and versatile framework to qualitatively understand the dynamics of conserved operators under random unitary time evolution.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality with emergent symmetry in the extended Shastry-Sutherland model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the novel phenomena observed in the layered material $\rm SrCu_2(BO_3)_2$, the Shastry-Sutherland model (SSM) has been extensively studied as the minimal model for $\rm SrCu_2(BO_3)_2$. However, the nature of its quantum phase transition from the plaquette valence-bond solid (PVBS) to antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase is under fierce debate, posing a challenge to understand the underlying quantum criticality. Via the state-of-the-art tensor network simulations, we study the ground state of the SSM on large-scale size up to $20 \times 20$ sites. We identify the continuous transition nature accompanied by an emergent O(4) symmetry between the PVBS and AFM phase, which strongly suggests a deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP). Furthermore, we map out the phase diagram of an extended SSM that can be continuously tuned to the SSM, which demonstrates the same DQCP phenomena along a whole critical line. Our results indicate a compelling scenario for understanding the origin of the proposed proximate DQCP in recent experiments of $\rm SrCu_2(BO_3)_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07533v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the lattice relaxation effect on moir\'e band structures in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ with two approaches: (a) large-scale plane-wave basis first principle calculation down to $2.88^{\circ}$, (b) transfer learning structure relaxation + local-basis first principles calculation down to $1.1^{\circ}$. Two types of van der Waals corrections have been examined: the D2 method of Grimme and the density-dependent energy correction. We note the density-dependent energy correction yields a continuous evolution of bandwidth with twist angles. Including second harmonic of intralayer potential/interlayer tunneling and the strain induced gauge field, we develop a more complete continuum model with a single set of parameters for a wide range of twist angles, \textcolor{red}{ and perform many-body simulations at $\nu=-1,-2/3, -1/3$. We further identify a series of $C=1$ Chern bands around $2^{\circ}$ from Wilson loop and edges state calculation, which serves as the foundation point for even-denominator non-Abelian states.</description>

Abstract: The widely-used Kohn-Sham implementation of density functional theory (DFT) maps a system of interacting electrons onto an auxiliary non-interacting one and is presumably inaccurate for strongly correlated materials. We present a concrete benchmark for DFT by examining the electronic ground state phase diagram of a strongly interacting chain with uneven, non-integer nuclear charges. The interplay between charge imbalance and Coulomb repulsion yields two competing phases, a band insulator and a Mott insulator. By including infinitesimal lattice distortions, DFT stabilizes the intermediate spontaneously dimerized insulator phase that results from this competition. We assess the phase diagram by mapping the bond length and nuclear charge ratio of the chain to the ionic Hubbard model and performing highly accurate density matrix renormalization group calculations. Our comparative study provides foundational insight into the utility of symmetry-broken DFT as a predictive tool for elucidating phase diagrams with competing orders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01549v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism is a long-standing issue in superconductivity due to the antagonistic nature of these two ordered states. Experimentally identifying and characterizing novel heterointerface superconductors that coexist with magnetism presents significant challenges. Here, we report the experimental observation of two-dimensional long-range ferromagnetic order in the KTaO$_3$ heterointerface superconductor, showing the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism. Remarkably, our direct current superconducting quantum interference device measurements reveal an in-plane magnetization hysteresis loop persisting above room temperature. Moreover, the first-principles calculations and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements provide decisive insights into the origin of the observed robust ferromagnetism, attributing it to oxygen vacancies that localize electrons in nearby Ta 5$d$ states. Our findings not only suggest KTaO$_3$ heterointerfaces as time-reversal symmetry breaking superconductors, but also inject fresh momentum into the exploration of the intricate interplay between superconductivity and magnetism, enhanced by the strong spin-orbit coupling inherent to the heavy Ta in 5$d$ orbitals of KTaO$_3$ heterointerfaces.</description>

Abstract: Tensor networks are factorizations of high-dimensional tensors into networks of smaller tensors. They have applications in physics and mathematics, and recently have been proposed as promising machine learning architectures. To ease the integration of tensor networks in machine learning pipelines, we introduce TensorKrowch, an open source Python library built on top of PyTorch. Providing a user-friendly interface, TensorKrowch allows users to construct any tensor network, train it, and integrate it as a layer in more intricate deep learning models. In this paper, we describe the main functionality and basic usage of TensorKrowch, and provide technical details on its building blocks and the optimizations performed to achieve efficient operation.</description>

Abstract: In this short note, we present a simple and elementary proof that meromorphic conformal field theories (CFTs) have central charges of the form: $c=8N$ with $N\in\mathbb{N}$ (the set of natural numbers) using the modular linear differential equations (MLDEs) approach. We first set up the 1-character MLDE for arbitrary value of the Wronskian index: $\ell$. From this we get the general form of the meromorphic CFT's character. We then study its modular transformations and the asymptotic value of it's Fourier coefficients -- using Rademacher series -- to conclude that odd values of $\ell$ make the character in-admissible implying that the central charge for admissible character has to be a multiple of 8.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of fractional quantum anomalous Hall states in moir\'e systems, we consider the possibility of realizing non-Abelian phases in topological minibands. We study a family of moir\'e systems, skyrmion Chern band (SCB) models, which can be realized in two-dimensional semiconductor/magnetic skyrmion heterostructures and also capture the essence of twisted transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) homobilayers. We show using many-body exact diagonalization that, in spite of strong Berry curvature variations in momentum space, the non-Abelian Moore-Read state can be realized at half filling of the second miniband. These results demonstrate the feasibility of non-Abelian fractionalization in moir\'e systems without Landau levels and shed light on the desirable conditions for their realization. In particular, we highlight the prospect of realizing the Moore-Read state in twisted semiconductor bilayers.</description>

      <title>Topological Weyl Altermagnetism in CrSb</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets constitute a novel, third fundamental class of collinear magnetic ordered materials, alongside with ferro- and antiferromagnets. They share with conventional antiferromagnets the feature of a vanishing net magnetization. At the same time they show a spin-splitting of electronic bands, just as in ferromagnets, caused by the atomic exchange interaction. On the other hand, topology has recently revolutionized our understanding of condensed matter physics, introducing new phases of matter classified by intrinsic topological order. Here we connect the worlds of altermagnetism and topology, showing that the electronic structure of the altermagnet CrSb is topological and hosts a novel Weyl semimetallic state. Using high-resolution and spin angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe a large momentum-dependent spin-splitting in CrSb, reaching up to 1 eV, that induces altermagnetic Weyl nodes with an associated magnetic quantum number. At the surface we observe their spin-polarized topological Fermi-arcs. This establishes that in altermagnets the large energy scale intrinsic to the spin-splitting - orders of magnitude larger than the relativistic spin-orbit coupling - creates its own realm of robust electronic topology.</description>
