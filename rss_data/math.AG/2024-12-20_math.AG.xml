      <title>Derived equivalence for the simple flop of type $G_2^{\dagger}$ via tilting bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to prove the derived equivalence for a local model of the simple flop of type $G_2^{\dagger}$, which was found by Kanemitsu. This flop is the only known simple flop that comes from a non-homogeneous roof. The proof of the derived equivalence is done by using tilting bundles, and also produces a noncommutative crepant resolution of the singularity that is derived equivalent to both sides of the flop.</description>

      <title>On the geography of log-surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This survey is devoted to the geography problem of log-surfaces constructed as pairs consisting of a smooth projective surface and a reduced boundary divisor. In the first part we focus on the geography problem for log-surfaces associated with pairs of the form $(\mathbb{P}^{2}, C)$, where $C$ is an arrangement of smooth plane curves admitting ordinary singularities. In particular, we focus on the case where $C$ is an arrangement of smooth rational curves. In the second part, containing original new results, we study log surfaces constructed as pairs consisting of a $K3$ surface and a rational curve arrangement. In particular, we provide some combinatorial conditions for such pairs to have the log-Chern slope equal to $3$. Our survey is illustrated with many explicit examples of log-surfaces.</description>

      <title>On the standard models of del Pezzo fibrations of degree four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Corti defined the notion of standard models of del Pezzo fibrations, and studied their existence over $\mathbb{C}$ with a fixed generic fibre. In this paper, we prove the existence of standard models of del Pezzo fibrations of degree $4$ in characteristic $&gt;2$. To show this, we use the notion of Koll\'ar stability, which was introduced by Koll\'ar and Abban-Fedorchuk-Krylov.</description>

      <title>Terminal singularities of the moduli space of curves on low degree hypersurfaces and the circle method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the singularities of the moduli space of degree $e$ maps from smooth genus $g$ curves to an arbitrary smooth hypersurface of low degree. For $e$ large compared to $g$, we show that these moduli spaces have at worst terminal singularities. Our main approach is to study the jet schemes of these moduli spaces by developing a suitable form of the circle method.</description>

      <title>Symmetric products and puncturing Campana-special varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a counterexample to the Arithmetic Puncturing Conjecture and Geometric Puncturing Conjecture of Hassett-Tschinkel using symmetric powers of uniruled surfaces, and propose a corrected conjecture inspired by Campana's conjectures on special varieties. We verify Campana's conjecture on potential density for symmetric powers of products of curves. As a by-product, we obtain an example of a surface without a potentially dense set of rational points, but for which some symmetric power does have a dense set of rational points, and even satisfies Corvaja-Zannier's version of the Hilbert property.</description>

      <title>A refinement of the coherence conjecture of Pappas and Rapoport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherence conjecture of Pappas and Rapoport, proved by Zhu, asserts the equality of dimensions for the global sections of a line bundle over a spherical Schubert variety in the affine Grassmannian and those of another line bundle over a certain union of Schubert varieties in a partial affine flag variety. In this paper, we upgrade this equality of dimensions to an isomorphism of representations. This has interesting consequences in the setting of affine Demazure modules. Zhu's proof of coherence conjcture and our comparison theorem are established by introducing a parahoric Bruhat-Tits group scheme $\mathcal{G}$ over the affine line that is ramified at $0$. We further strengthen this comparison theorem by equipping any line bundle on the global affine Grassmannian of $\mathcal{G}$ with a unique equivariant structure of the global jet group scheme of $\mathcal{G}$.</description>

      <title>Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of finite schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma \subset \mathbb{P}^n$ be a nondegenerate finite subscheme of degree $d$. Then the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity ${\rm reg} ({\Gamma})$ of $\Gamma$ is at most $\left\lceil \frac{d-n-1}{t(\Gamma)} \right\rceil +2$ where $t(\Gamma)$ is the smallest integer such that $\Gamma$ admits a $(t+2)$-secant $t$-plane. In this paper, we show that ${\rm reg} ({\Gamma})$ is close to this upper bound if and only if there exists a unique rational normal curve $C$ of degree $t(\Gamma)$ such that the ${\rm reg} (\Gamma \cap C) = {\rm reg} (\Gamma)$.</description>

      <title>Towards Common Zeros of Iterated Morphisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the authors have proved the finiteness of common zeros of two iterated rational maps under some compositional independence assumptions. In this article, we advance towards a question of Hsia and Tucker on a Zariski non-density of common zeros of iterated morphisms on a variety. More precisely, we provide an affirmative answer in the case of H\'{e}non type maps on $\mathbb{A}^2$, endomorphisms on $(\mathbb{P}^1)^n$, and polynomial skew products on $\mathbb{A}^2$ defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. As a by-product, we prove a Tits' alternative analogy for semigroups generated by two regular polynomial skew products.</description>

      <title>Quadratically enriched binomial coefficients over a finite field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute an analogue of Pascal's triangle enriched in bilinear forms over a finite field. This gives an arithmetically meaningful count of the ways to choose $j$ embeddings into an \'etale extension of degree $n$. We also compute a quadratic twist. These (twisted) enriched binomial coefficients are defined in joint work of Brugall\'e and the second-named author, building on work of Garibaldi, Merkurjev, and Serre. Such binomial coefficients support curve counting results over non-algebraically closed fields, using $A^1$-homotopy theory.</description>

      <title>Schottky invariant diffusion on the transcendent p-adic upper half plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transcendent part of the Drinfeld p-adic upper half plane is shown to be a Polish space. Using Radon measures associated with regular differential 1-forms invariant under Schottky groups allows to construct self-adjoint diffusion operators as Laplacian integral operators with kernel functions determined by the p-adic absolute value on the complex p-adic numbers. Their spectra are explicitly calculated and the corresponding Cauchy problems for their associated heat equations are found to be uniquely solvable and to determine Markov processes having paths which are cadlag. The heat kernels are shown to have explicitly given distribution functions, as well as boundary value problems associated with the heat equations under Dirchlet and von Neumann conditions are solved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12538v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct qualitatively new examples of superabundant tropical curves which are non-realizable in genus $3$ and $4$. These curves are in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and $\mathbb{R}^4$ respectively, and have properties resembling canonical embeddings of genus $3$ and $4$ algebraic curves. In particular, the genus $3$ example is a degree $4$ planar tropical curve, and the genus $4$ example is contained in the product of a tropical line and a tropical conic. They have excess dimension of deformation space equal to $1$. Non-realizability follows by combining this with a dimension calculation for the corresponding space of logarithmic curves.</description>

      <title>Ceresa cycles of bielliptic Picard curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Ceresa cycle $\kappa(C_t)$ of the genus $3$ curve $C_t \colon y^3 = x^4 + 2tx^2 + 1$ is torsion if and only if $Q_t=( \sqrt[3]{t^2 -1},t)$ is a torsion point on the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + 1$. This shows that there are infinitely many smooth plane quartic curves over $\mathbb{C}$ (resp. $\mathbb{Q}$) with torsion (resp. infinite order) Ceresa cycle. Over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, we show that the Beilinson--Bloch height of $\kappa(C_t)$ is proportional to the Neron--Tate height of $Q_t$. Thus, the height of $\kappa(C_t)$ is nondegenerate and satisfies a Northcott property. To prove all this, we show that the Chow motive that controls $\kappa(C_t)$ is isomorphic to $\mathfrak{h}^1$ of an appropriate elliptic curve.</description>

Abstract: We provide some conditions for the image of a morphism of abelian schemes to again be an abelian scheme. For context, in characteristic 0, the image is always an abelian scheme; in mixed and positive characteristic the image can fail to be an abelian scheme, and so it is in this setting that the conditions we provide are pertinent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After Jacobians of curves, Prym varieties are perhaps the next most studied abelian varieties. They turn out to be quite useful in a number of contexts. For technical reasons, there does not appear to be any systematic treatment of Prym varieties in characteristic 2, and due to our recent interest in this topic, the purpose of this paper is to fill in that gap. Our main result is a classification of branched covers of curves in characteristic 2 that give rise to Prym varieties. We are also interested in the case of Prym varieties in the relative setting, and so we develop that theory here as well, including an extension of Welters' Criterion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the $\ell$-primary torsion of the Brauer group of the moduli stack of smooth curves of genus three over any field of characteristic different from two and the Brauer group of the moduli stacks of smooth plane curves of degree $d$ over any algebraically closed field of characteristic different from two, three and coprime to $d$. We achieve this result by computing the low degree cohomological invariants of these stacks. As a corollary we are additionally able to compute the $\ell$-primary torsion of the Brauer group of the moduli stack of principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension three over any field of characteristic different from two.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we construct the ADHM quiver representations and the corresponding sheaves as the mirror objects of formal deformations of the framed immersed Lagrangian sphere decorated with flat bundles. More generally, we construct Nakajima quiver varieties as localized mirrors of framed nodal unions of Lagrangian spheres in dimension two. This produces a mirror functor from the Fukaya category of a framed plumbing of surfaces to the dg category of complexes of bundles over the corresponding Nakajima quiver varieties.
  For affine ADE quivers in specific multiplicities, the corresponding (unframed) Lagrangian immersions are homological tori, whose moduli of stable deformations are asymptotically locally Euclidean (ALE) spaces. We show that framed stable Lagrangian branes are transformed into monadic complexes of framed torsion-free sheaves over the ALE spaces.
  A main ingredient is the notion of framed Lagrangian immersions and their Maurer-Cartan deformations. Moreover, using the formalism of quiver algebroid stacks, we find isomorphisms between the moduli of stable Lagrangian immersions and that of special Lagrangian fibers of an SYZ fibration in the affine $A_n$ cases.</description>

      <title>L\"uroth's theorem for fields of rational functions in infinitely many permuted variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: L\"uroth's theorem describes the dominant maps from rational curves over a field.
  In this note we study those dominant rational maps from cartesian powers $X^{\Psi}$ of geometrically irreducible varieties $X$ over a field $k$ for infinite sets $\Psi$ that are equivariant with respect to all permutations of the factors $X$. At least some of such maps arise as compositions $h:X^{\Psi}\xrightarrow{f^{\Psi}}Y^{\Psi}\to H\backslash Y^{\Psi}$, where $X\xrightarrow{f}Y$ is a dominant $k$-map and $H$ is a group of birational automorphisms of $Y|k$, acting diagonally on $Y^{\Psi}$.
  In characteristic 0, we show that this construction, when properly modified, gives all dominant equivariant maps from $X^{\Psi}$, if $\dim X=1$. For arbitrary $X$, the results are only partial.
  Also, a somewhat similar problem of describing the equivariant integral schemes over $X^{\Psi}$ of finite type is touched very briefly.</description>

      <title>Cubic fourfolds with birational Fano varieties of lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22259v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give several examples of pairs of non-isomorphic cubic fourfolds whose Fano varieties of lines are birationally equivalent (and in one example isomorphic). Two of our examples, which are special families of conjecturally irrational cubics in $\calC_{12}$, provide new evidence for the conjecture that Fourier-Mukai partners are birationally equivalent. We explore how various notions of equivalence for cubic fourfolds are related, and we conjecture that cubic fourfolds with birationally equivalent Fano varieties of lines are themselves birationally equivalent.</description>

      <title>Euler Discriminant of Complements of Hyperplanes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Euler discriminant of a family of very affine varieties is defined as the locus where the Euler characteristic drops. In this work, we study the Euler discriminant of families of complements of hyperplanes. We prove that the Euler discriminant is a hypersurface in the space of coefficients, and provide its defining equation in two cases: (1) when the coefficients are generic, and (2) when they are constrained to a proper subspace. In the generic case, we show that the multiplicities of the components can be recovered combinatorially. This analysis also recovers the singularities of an Euler integral. In the appendix, we discuss a relation to cosmological correlators.</description>

      <title>Flag versions of quiver Grassmannians for Dynkin quivers have no odd cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04907</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.04907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the conjecture that flag versions of quiver Grassmannians (also known as Lusztig's fibers) for Dynkin quivers (types $A$, $D$, $E$) have no odd cohomology groups over an arbitrary ring. Moreover, for types A and D we prove that these varieties have affine pavings. We also show that to prove the same statement for type E, it is enough to check this for indecomposable representations.
  We also give a flag version of the result of Cerulli Irelli-Esposito-Franzen-Reineke on rigid representations: we prove that flag versions of quiver Grassmannians for rigid representations have a diagonal decomposition. In particular, they have no odd cohomology groups.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Lagrangian correspondence and a conjecture of Teleman</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13926v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Floer theory of equivariant Lagrangian correspondences and apply it to deduce a conjecture of Teleman, which finds the relation between the disc potential of an invariant Lagrangian submanifold and that of its quotient. A main step is to extend Fukaya's construction of an $A_\infty$ tri-module for Lagrangian correspondences to Borel spaces. We find that the equivariant obstruction of a Lagrangian correspondence plays an essential role, which leads to quantum corrections in the disc potentials of quotients. We solve the obstruction in the toric setup and find the relation with mirror maps for compact semi-Fano toric manifolds.</description>

      <title>Sum of Squares Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing expressive generative models that support exact and efficient inference is a core question in probabilistic ML. Probabilistic circuits (PCs) offer a framework where this tractability-vs-expressiveness trade-off can be analyzed theoretically. Recently, squared PCs encoding subtractive mixtures via negative parameters have emerged as tractable models that can be exponentially more expressive than monotonic PCs, i.e., PCs with positive parameters only. In this paper, we provide a more precise theoretical characterization of the expressiveness relationships among these models. First, we prove that squared PCs can be less expressive than monotonic ones. Second, we formalize a novel class of PCs -- sum of squares PCs -- that can be exponentially more expressive than both squared and monotonic PCs. Around sum of squares PCs, we build an expressiveness hierarchy that allows us to precisely unify and separate different tractable model classes such as Born Machines and PSD models, and other recently introduced tractable probabilistic models by using complex parameters. Finally, we empirically show the effectiveness of sum of squares circuits in performing distribution estimation.</description>

      <title>Kolyvagin's conjecture for modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our main result in this article is a proof (under mild technical assumptions) of an analogue for $p$-adic Galois representations attached to a newform $f$ of even weight $k\geq4$ of Kolyvagin's conjecture on the $p$-indivisibility of derived Heegner points on elliptic curves, where $p$ is a prime number that is ordinary for $f$. Our strategy, which is inspired by work of W. Zhang in weight $2$, is based on a variant for modular forms of the congruence method originally introduced by Bertolini-Darmon to prove one divisibility in the anticyclotomic Iwasawa main conjecture for rational elliptic curves. We adapt to higher (even) weight modular forms this approach via congruences, building crucially on results of Wang on the indivisibility of Heegner cycles over Shimura curves. Then we offer an application of our results on Kolyvagin's conjecture to the Tamagawa number conjecture for the motive of $f$ and describe other (standard) consequences on structure theorems for Bloch-Kato-Selmer groups, $p$-parity results and converse theorems for $f$. Since in the present paper we need $p&gt;k+1$, our main theorem and its applications can be viewed as complementary to results obtained by the first and third authors in their article on the Tamagawa number conjecture for modular motives, where Kolyvagin's conjecture was proved (in a completely different way exploiting the arithmetic of Hida families) under the assumption that $k$ is congruent to $2$ modulo $2(p-1)$, which forces $p&lt;k$. In forthcoming work, we will use results contained in this paper to prove (under analogous assumptions) the counterpart for an even weight newform $f$ of Perrin-Riou's Heegner point main conjecture for elliptic curves ("Heegner cycle main conjecture" for $f$).</description>
