      <title>Countering underproduction of peer produced goods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peer produced goods such as online knowledge bases and free/libre open source software rely on contributors who often choose their tasks regardless of consumer needs. These goods are susceptible to underproduction: when popular goods are relatively low quality. Although underproduction is a common feature of peer production, very little is known about how to counteract it. We use a detailed longitudinal dataset from English Wikipedia to show that more experienced contributors -- including those who contribute without an account -- tend to contribute to underproduced goods. A within-person analysis shows that contributors' efforts shift toward underproduced goods over time. These findings illustrate the value of retaining contributors in peer production, including those contributing without accounts, as a means to counter underproduction.</description>

      <title>Passive Measurement of Autonomic Arousal in Real-World Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is activated during stress, which can have negative effects on cardiovascular health, sleep, the immune system, and mental health. While there are ways to quantify ANS activity in laboratories, there is a paucity of methods that have been validated in real-world contexts. We present the Fitbit Body Response Algorithm, an approach to continuous remote measurement of ANS activation through widely available remote wrist-based sensors. The design was validated via two experiments, a Trier Social Stress Test (n = 45) and ecological momentary assessments (EMA) of perceived stress (n=87), providing both controlled and ecologically valid test data. Model performance predicting perceived stress when using all available sensor modalities was consistent with expectations (accuracy=0.85) and outperformed models with access to only a subset of the signals. We discuss and address challenges to sensing that arise in real world settings that do not present in conventional lab environments.</description>

      <title>MagicCraft: Natural Language-Driven Generation of Dynamic and Interactive 3D Objects for Commercial Metaverse Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metaverse platforms are rapidly evolving to provide immersive spaces for user interaction and content creation. However, the generation of dynamic and interactive 3D objects remains challenging due to the need for advanced 3D modeling and programming skills. To address this challenge, we present MagicCraft, a system that generates functional 3D objects from natural language prompts for metaverse platforms. MagicCraft uses generative AI models to manage the entire content creation pipeline: converting user text descriptions into images, transforming images into 3D models, predicting object behavior, and assigning necessary attributes and scripts. It also provides an interactive interface for users to refine generated objects by adjusting features such as orientation, scale, seating positions, and grip points.
  Implemented on Cluster, a commercial metaverse platform, MagicCraft was evaluated by 7 expert CG designers and 51 general users. Results show that MagicCraft significantly reduces the time and skill required to create 3D objects. Users with no prior experience in 3D modeling or programming successfully created complex, interactive objects and deployed them in the metaverse. Expert feedback highlighted the system's potential to improve content creation workflows and support rapid prototyping. By integrating AI-generated content into metaverse platforms, MagicCraft makes 3D content creation more accessible.</description>

      <title>Cross-Reality Lifestyle: Integrating Physical and Virtual Lives through Multi-Platform Metaverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Technological advances are redefining the relationship between physical and virtual space. Traditionally, when users engage in virtual reality (VR), they are completely cut off from the physical space; similarly, they are unable to access virtual experiences while engaged in physical activities. However, modern multi-platform metaverse environments allow simultaneous participation through mobile devices, creating new opportunities for integrated experiences. This study introduces the concept of "cross-reality lifestyles" to examine how users actively combine their physical and virtual activities. We identify three patterns of integration: 1) amplification: one space enhances experiences in the other; 2) complementary: spaces offer different but equally valuable alternatives; and 3) emergence: simultaneous engagement creates entirely new experiences. By analyzing commercial platforms, we create a technical framework that addresses content design, platform infrastructure, and device interfaces. This framework guides the development of cross-reality applications while demonstrating how metaverse technologies blur the traditional boundaries between physical and virtual experiences.</description>

      <title>ImaginateAR: AI-Assisted In-Situ Authoring in Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While augmented reality (AR) enables new ways to play, tell stories, and explore ideas rooted in the physical world, authoring personalized AR content remains difficult for non-experts, often requiring professional tools and time. Prior systems have explored AI-driven XR design but typically rely on manually-defined environments and fixed asset libraries, limiting creative flexibility and real-world relevance. We introduce ImaginateAR, a mobile AI-assisted AR authoring system that aims to let anyone build anything, anywhere -- simply by speaking their imagination. ImaginateAR is powered by custom pipelines for offline scene understanding, fast 3D asset generation, and LLM-driven speech interaction. Users might say "a dragon enjoying a campfire" (P7) and iteratively refine the scene using both AI and manual tools. Our technical evaluation shows that ImaginateAR produces more accurate outdoor scene graphs and generates 3D meshes faster than prior methods. A three-part user study (N=20) revealed preferred roles for AI in authoring, what and how users create in free-form use, and design implications for future AR authoring tools.</description>

      <title>Coping with Uncertainty in UX Design Practice: Practitioner Strategies and Judgment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity of UX design practice extends beyond ill-structured design problems to include uncertainties shaped by shifting stakeholder priorities, team dynamics, limited resources, and implementation constraints. While prior research in related fields has addressed uncertainty in design more broadly, the specific character of uncertainty in UX practice remains underexplored. This study examines how UX practitioners experience and respond to uncertainty in real-world projects, drawing on a multi-week diary study and follow-up interviews with ten designers. We identify a range of practitioner strategies-including adaptive framing, negotiation, and judgment-that allow designers to move forward amid ambiguity. Our findings highlight the central role of design judgment in navigating uncertainty, including emergent forms such as temporal and sacrificial judgment, and extend prior understandings by showing how UX practitioners engage uncertainty as a persistent, situated feature of practice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Haptic perception and feedback play a pivotal role in interactive experiences, forming an essential component of human-computer interaction (HCI). In recent years, the field of haptic interaction has witnessed significant advancements, particularly in the area of electrical haptic feedback, driving innovation across various domains. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the current state of research and the latest developments in electrical haptic interaction, this study systematically reviews the literature in this area. Our investigation covers key aspects including haptic devices, haptic perception mechanisms, the comparison and integration of electrical haptic feedback with other feedback modalities, and their diverse applications. Specifically, we conduct a systematic analysis of 110 research papers to explore the forefront of electrical haptic feedback, providing insights into its latest trends, challenges, and future directions.</description>

      <title>A User-Centered Teleoperation GUI for Automated Vehicles: Identifying and Evaluating Information Requirements for Remote Driving and Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teleoperation emerged as a promising fallback for situations beyond the capabilities of automated vehicles. Nevertheless, teleoperation still faces challenges, such as reduced situational awareness. Since situational awareness is primarily built through the remote operator's visual perception, the Graphical User Interface (GUI) design is critical. In addition to video feeds, supplemental informational elements are crucial - not only for the predominantly studied Remote Driving but also for the arising desk-based Remote Assistance concepts. This work develops a GUI for different teleoperation concepts by identifying key informational elements during the teleoperation process through expert interviews (N = 9). Following this, a static and dynamic GUI prototype is developed and evaluated in a click-dummy study (N = 36). Thereby, the dynamic GUI adapts the number of displayed elements according to the teleoperation phase. Results show that both GUIs achieve good System Usability Scale (SUS) ratings, with the dynamic GUI significantly outperforming the static version in both usability and task completion time. The User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) score shows potential for improvement. To enhance the user experience, the GUI should be evaluated in a follow-up study that includes interaction with a real vehicle.</description>

      <title>A Conversational Approach to Well-being Awareness Creation and Behavioural Intention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The promotion of a healthy lifestyle is one of the main drivers of an individual's overall physical and psycho-emotional well-being. Digital technologies are more and more adopted as ''facilitators'' for this goal, to raise awareness and solicit healthy lifestyle habits.
  This study aims to experiment the effects of the adoption of a digital conversational tool to influence awareness creation and behavioural change in the context of a well-being lifestyle. Our aim is to collect evidence of the aspects that must be taken into account when designing and implementing such tools in well-being promotion campaigns.
  To this end, we created a conversational application for promoting well-being and healthy lifestyles, which presents relevant information and asks specific questions to its intended users within an interaction happening through a chat interface; the conversational tool presents itself as a well-being counsellor named Allegra and follows a coaching approach to structure the interaction with the user. In our user study, participants were asked to first interact with Allegra in one of three experimental conditions, corresponding to different conversational styles; then, they answered a questionnaire about their experience. The questionnaire items were related to intrinsic motivation factors as well as awareness creation and behavioural change. The collected data allowed us to assess the hypotheses of our model that put in connection those variables.
  Our results confirm the positive effect of intrinsic motivation factors on both awareness creation and behavioural intention in the context of well-being and healthy lifestyle; on the other hand, we did not record any statistically significant effect of different language and communication styles on the outcomes.</description>

      <title>Adaptive 3D UI Placement in Mixed Reality Using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed Reality (MR) could assist users' tasks by continuously integrating virtual content with their view of the physical environment. However, where and how to place these content to best support the users has been a challenging problem due to the dynamic nature of MR experiences. In contrast to prior work that investigates optimization-based methods, we are exploring how reinforcement learning (RL) could assist with continuous 3D content placement that is aware of users' poses and their surrounding environments. Through an initial exploration and preliminary evaluation, our results demonstrate the potential of RL to position content that maximizes the reward for users on the go. We further identify future directions for research that could harness the power of RL for personalized and optimized UI and content placement in MR.</description>

      <title>PiXi: Password Inspiration by Exploring Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10728v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Passwords, a first line of defense against unauthorized access, must be secure and memorable. However, people often struggle to create secure passwords they can recall. To address this problem, we design Password inspiration by eXploring information (PiXi), a novel approach to nudge users towards creating secure passwords. PiXi is the first of its kind that employs a password creation nudge to support users in the task of generating a unique secure password themselves. PiXi prompts users to explore unusual information right before creating a password, to shake them out of their typical habits and thought processes, and to inspire them to create unique (and therefore stronger) passwords. PiXi's design aims to create an engaging, interactive, and effective nudge to improve secure password creation. We conducted a user study ($N=238$) to compare the efficacy of PiXi to typical password creation. Our findings indicate that PiXi's nudges do influence users' password choices such that passwords are significantly longer and more secure (less predictable and guessable).</description>

      <title>IRL Dittos: Embodied Multimodal AI Agent Interactions in Open Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the In Real Life (IRL) Ditto, an AI-driven embodied agent designed to represent remote colleagues in shared office spaces, creating opportunities for real-time exchanges even in their absence. IRL Ditto offers a unique hybrid experience by allowing in-person colleagues to encounter a digital version of their remote teammates, initiating greetings, updates, or small talk as they might in person. Our research question examines: How can the IRL Ditto influence interactions and relationships among colleagues in a shared office space? Through a four-day study, we assessed IRL Ditto's ability to strengthen social ties by simulating presence and enabling meaningful interactions across different levels of social familiarity. We find that enhancing social relationships depended deeply on the foundation of the relationship participants had with the source of the IRL Ditto. This study provides insights into the role of embodied agents in enriching workplace dynamics for distributed teams.</description>

      <title>Visual Analytics Challenges and Trends in the Age of AI: The BigVis Community Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report provides insights into the challenges, emerging topics, and opportunities related to human-data interaction and visual analytics in the AI era. The BigVis 2024 organizing committee conducted a survey among experts in the field. They invite the Program Committee members and the authors of accepted papers to share their views. Thirty-two scientists from diverse research communities, including Databases, Information Visualization, and Human-Computer Interaction, participated in the study. These scientists, representing both industry and academia, provided valuable insights into the current and future landscape of the field.
  In this report, we analyze the survey responses and compare them to the findings of a similar study conducted four years ago. The results reveal some interesting insights. First, many of the critical challenges identified in the previous survey remain highly relevant today, despite being unrelated to AI. Meanwhile, the field's landscape has significantly evolved, with most of today's vital challenges not even being mentioned in the earlier survey, underscoring the profound impact of AI-related advancements.
  By summarizing the perspectives of the research community, this report aims to shed light on the key challenges, emerging trends, and potential research directions in human-data interaction and visual analytics in the AI era.</description>

      <title>Efficient Conversational Search via Topical Locality in Dense Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained language models have been widely exploited to learn dense representations of documents and queries for information retrieval. While previous efforts have primarily focused on improving effectiveness and user satisfaction, response time remains a critical bottleneck of conversational search systems. To address this, we exploit the topical locality inherent in conversational queries, i.e., the tendency of queries within a conversation to focus on related topics. By leveraging query embedding similarities, we dynamically restrict the search space to semantically relevant document clusters, reducing computational complexity without compromising retrieval quality. We evaluate our approach on the TREC CAsT 2019 and 2020 datasets using multiple embedding models and vector indexes, achieving improvements in processing speed of up to 10.4X with little loss in performance (4.4X without any loss). Our results show that the proposed system effectively handles complex, multiturn queries with high precision and efficiency, offering a practical solution for real-time conversational search.</description>

      <title>TheraQuest: A Gamified, LLM-Powered Simulation for Massage Therapy Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massage therapy training emphasizes hands-on techniques and effective therapist--patient communication. However, many educational programs struggle to provide realistic practice scenarios. To address this problem, we propose TheraQuest, a gamified, web-based simulation platform that employs large language models (LLMs) to generate diverse virtual patients with varying symptoms and cultural backgrounds. Through interactive dialogue, anatomical decision-making, and immediate assessment, trainees develop both diagnostic reasoning and empathetic communication skills in a low-risk environment. Unlike exclusively VR-based solutions, TheraQuest remains accessible via standard web browsers, mitigating the cost and discomfort associated with extended headset use. Preliminary testing suggests that integrating LLM-driven virtual patients with real-time skill metrics can enhance trainee engagement and help bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and clinical proficiency.</description>

      <title>How Real Are Synthetic Therapy Conversations? Evaluating Fidelity in Prolonged Exposure Dialogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing adoption of synthetic data in healthcare is driven by privacy concerns, limited access to real-world data, and the high cost of annotation. This work explores the use of synthetic Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapeutic conversations for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as a scalable alternative for training and evaluating clinical models. We systematically compare real and synthetic dialogues using linguistic, structural, and protocol-specific metrics, including turn-taking patterns and treatment fidelity. We also introduce and evaluate PE-specific metrics derived from linguistic analysis and semantic modeling, offering a novel framework for assessing clinical fidelity beyond surface fluency. Our findings show that although synthetic data holds promise for mitigating data scarcity and protecting patient privacy, it can struggle to capture the subtle dynamics of therapeutic interactions. In our dataset, synthetic dialogues match structural features of real-world dialogues (e.g., speaker switch ratio: 0.98 vs. 0.99), however, synthetic interactions do not adequately reflect key fidelity markers (e.g., distress monitoring). We highlight gaps in existing evaluation frameworks and advocate for fidelity-aware metrics that go beyond surface fluency to uncover clinically significant failures. Our findings clarify where synthetic data can effectively complement real-world datasets -- and where critical limitations remain.</description>

      <title>Public Opinion and The Rise of Digital Minds: Perceived Risk, Trust, and Regulation Support</title>

Abstract: Governance institutions must respond to societal risks, including those posed by generative AI. This study empirically examines how public trust in institutions and AI technologies, along with perceived risks, shape preferences for AI regulation. Using the nationally representative 2023 Artificial Intelligence, Morality, and Sentience (AIMS) survey, we assess trust in government, AI companies, and AI technologies, as well as public support for regulatory measures such as slowing AI development or outright bans on advanced AI. Our findings reveal broad public support for AI regulation, with risk perception playing a significant role in shaping policy preferences. Individuals with higher trust in government favor regulation, while those with greater trust in AI companies and AI technologies are less inclined to support restrictions. Trust in government and perceived risks significantly predict preferences for both soft (e.g., slowing development) and strong (e.g., banning AI systems) regulatory interventions. These results highlight the importance of public opinion in AI governance. As AI capabilities advance, effective regulation will require balancing public concerns about risks with trust in institutions. This study provides a foundational empirical baseline for policymakers navigating AI governance and underscores the need for further research into public trust, risk perception, and regulatory strategies in the evolving AI landscape.</description>

      <title>'SSL?! What on earth is that?': Towards Designing Age-Inclusive Secure Smartphone Browsing</title>

Abstract: Owing to the increase in 'certified' phishing websites, there is a steady increase in the number of phishing cases and general susceptibility to phishing. Trust mechanisms (e.g., HTTPS Lock Indicators, SSL Certificates) that help differentiate genuine and phishing websites should therefore be evaluated for their effectiveness in preventing vulnerable users from accessing phishing websites. In this article, we present a study involving 18 adults (male-6; female-12) and 12 older adults (male-4; female-8) to understand the usability of current trust mechanisms and preferred modalities in a conceptualized mechanism. In the first part of the study, using Chrome browser on Android, we asked the participants to browse a banking website and a government website for digital particulars. We asked them to identify which one of the two was a phishing website, rate the usability of both websites and provide qualitative feedback on the trust mechanisms. In the second part, we conceptualized an alternative trust mechanism, which allows seeking social, community and AI-based support to make website trust-related decisions. Herein, we asked the participants as to which modality (social, community or AI) they prefer to seek support from and why it is preferred. Using the current trust mechanisms, none of the participants were able to identify the phishing website. As the participants rated the current mechanisms poorly in terms of usability, they expressed various difficulties that largely did not differ between adults and older adults. In the conceptualized mechanism, we observed a notable difference in the preferred modalities, in that, older adults primarily preferred social support. In addition to these overall findings, specific observations suggest that future trust mechanisms should not only consider age-specific needs but also incorporate substantial improvement in terms of usability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This narrative review on emotional expression in Speech-to-Text (STT) interfaces with Extended Reality (XR) aims to identify advancements, limitations, and research gaps in incorporating emotional expression into transcribed text generated by STT systems. Using a rigorous search strategy, relevant articles published between 2020 and 2024 are extracted and categorized into themes such as communication enhancement technologies, innovations in captioning, visual and affective augmentation, emotion recognition in AR and VR, and empathic machines. The findings reveal the evolution of tools and techniques to meet the needs of individuals with hearing impairments, showcasing innovations in live transcription, closed captioning, AR, VR, and emotion recognition technologies. Despite improvements in accessibility, the absence of emotional nuance in transcribed text remains a significant communication challenge. The study underscores the urgency for innovations in STT technology to capture emotional expressions. The research discusses integrating emotional expression into text through strategies like animated text captions, emojilization tools, and models associating emotions with animation properties. Extending these efforts into AR and VR environments opens new possibilities for immersive and emotionally resonant experiences, especially in educational contexts. The study also explores empathic applications in healthcare, education, and human-robot interactions, highlighting the potential for personalized and effective interactions. The multidisciplinary nature of the literature underscores the potential for collaborative and interdisciplinary research.</description>

      <title>ObjectFinder: An Open-Vocabulary Assistive System for Interactive Object Search by Blind People</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Searching for objects in unfamiliar scenarios is a challenging task for blind people. It involves specifying the target object, detecting it, and then gathering detailed information according to the user's intent. However, existing description- and detection-based assistive technologies do not sufficiently support the multifaceted nature of interactive object search tasks. We present ObjectFinder, an open-vocabulary wearable assistive system for interactive object search by blind people. ObjectFinder allows users to query target objects using flexible wording. Once the target object is detected, it provides egocentric localization information in real-time, including distance and direction. Users can then initiate different branches to gather detailed information based on their intent towards the target object, such as navigating to it or perceiving its surroundings. ObjectFinder is powered by a seamless combination of open-vocabulary models, namely an open-vocabulary object detector and a multimodal large language model. The ObjectFinder design concept and its development were carried out in collaboration with a blind co-designer. To evaluate ObjectFinder, we conducted an exploratory user study with eight blind participants. We compared ObjectFinder to BeMyAI and Google Lookout, popular description- and detection-based assistive applications. Our findings indicate that most participants felt more independent with ObjectFinder and preferred it for object search, as it enhanced scene context gathering and navigation, and allowed for active target identification. Finally, we discuss the implications for future assistive systems to support interactive object search.</description>

      <title>Explanation format does not matter; but explanations do -- An Eggsbert study on explaining Bayesian Optimisation tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian Optimisation (BO) is a family of methods for finding optimal parameters when the underlying function to be optimised is unknown. BO is used, for example, for hyperparameter tuning in machine learning and as an expert support tool for tuning cyberphysical systems. For settings where humans are involved in the tuning task, methods have been developed to explain BO (Explainable Bayesian Optimization, XBO). However, there is little guidance on how to present XBO results to humans so that they can tune the system effectively and efficiently. In this paper, we investigate how the XBO explanation format affects users' task performance, task load, understanding and trust in XBO. We chose a task that is accessible to a wide range of users. Specifically, we set up an egg cooking scenario with 6 parameters that participants had to adjust to achieve a perfect soft-boiled egg. We compared three different explanation formats: a bar chart, a list of rules and a textual explanation in a between-subjects online study with 213 participants. Our results show that adding any type of explanation increases task success, reduces the number of trials needed to achieve success, and improves comprehension and confidence. While explanations add more information for participants to process, we found no increase in user task load. We also found that the aforementioned results were independent of the explanation format; all formats had a similar effect. This is an interesting finding for practical applications, as it suggests that explanations can be added to BO tuning tasks without the burden of designing or selecting specific explanation formats. In the future, it would be interesting to investigate scenarios of prolonged use of the explanation formats and whether they have different effects on users' mental models of the underlying system.</description>

      <title>Learning 6-DoF Fine-grained Grasp Detection Based on Part Affordance Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robotic grasping is a fundamental ability for a robot to interact with the environment. Current methods focus on how to obtain a stable and reliable grasping pose in object level, while little work has been studied on part (shape)-wise grasping which is related to fine-grained grasping and robotic affordance. Parts can be seen as atomic elements to compose an object, which contains rich semantic knowledge and a strong correlation with affordance. However, lacking a large part-wise 3D robotic dataset limits the development of part representation learning and downstream applications. In this paper, we propose a new large Language-guided SHape grAsPing datasEt (named LangSHAPE) to promote 3D part-level affordance and grasping ability learning. From the perspective of robotic cognition, we design a two-stage fine-grained robotic grasping framework (named LangPartGPD), including a novel 3D part language grounding model and a part-aware grasp pose detection model, in which explicit language input from human or large language models (LLMs) could guide a robot to generate part-level 6-DoF grasping pose with textual explanation. Our method combines the advantages of human-robot collaboration and LLMs' planning ability using explicit language as a symbolic intermediate. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we perform 3D part grounding and fine-grained grasp detection experiments on both simulation and physical robot settings, following language instructions across different degrees of textual complexity. Results show our method achieves competitive performance in 3D geometry fine-grained grounding, object affordance inference, and 3D part-aware grasping tasks. Our dataset and code are available on our project website https://sites.google.com/view/lang-shape</description>

      <title>LEyes: A Lightweight Framework for Deep Learning-Based Eye Tracking using Synthetic Eye Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06129v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has bolstered gaze estimation techniques, but real-world deployment has been impeded by inadequate training datasets. This problem is exacerbated by both hardware-induced variations in eye images and inherent biological differences across the recorded participants, leading to both feature and pixel-level variance that hinders the generalizability of models trained on specific datasets. While synthetic datasets can be a solution, their creation is both time and resource-intensive. To address this problem, we present a framework called Light Eyes or "LEyes" which, unlike conventional photorealistic methods, only models key image features required for video-based eye tracking using simple light distributions. LEyes facilitates easy configuration for training neural networks across diverse gaze-estimation tasks. We demonstrate that models trained using LEyes are consistently on-par or outperform other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of pupil and CR localization across well-known datasets. In addition, a LEyes trained model outperforms the industry standard eye tracker using significantly more cost-effective hardware. Going forward, we are confident that LEyes will revolutionize synthetic data generation for gaze estimation models, and lead to significant improvements of the next generation video-based eye trackers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) has proven effective, yet limited research has explored cross-lingual scenarios. This study presents a comparative analysis between human performance and SSL models, beginning with a layer-wise analysis and an exploration of parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies in monolingual, cross-lingual, and transfer learning contexts. We further compare the SER ability of models and humans at both utterance- and segment-levels. Additionally, we investigate the impact of dialect on cross-lingual SER through human evaluation. Our findings reveal that models, with appropriate knowledge transfer, can adapt to the target language and achieve performance comparable to native speakers. We also demonstrate the significant effect of dialect on SER for individuals without prior linguistic and paralinguistic background. Moreover, both humans and models exhibit distinct behaviors across different emotions. These results offer new insights into the cross-lingual SER capabilities of SSL models, underscoring both their similarities to and differences from human emotion perception.</description>

      <title>Conformalized Interactive Imitation Learning: Handling Expert Shift and Intermittent Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In interactive imitation learning (IL), uncertainty quantification offers a way for the learner (i.e. robot) to contend with distribution shifts encountered during deployment by actively seeking additional feedback from an expert (i.e. human) online. Prior works use mechanisms like ensemble disagreement or Monte Carlo dropout to quantify when black-box IL policies are uncertain; however, these approaches can lead to overconfident estimates when faced with deployment-time distribution shifts. Instead, we contend that we need uncertainty quantification algorithms that can leverage the expert human feedback received during deployment time to adapt the robot's uncertainty online. To tackle this, we draw upon online conformal prediction, a distribution-free method for constructing prediction intervals online given a stream of ground-truth labels. Human labels, however, are intermittent in the interactive IL setting. Thus, from the conformal prediction side, we introduce a novel uncertainty quantification algorithm called intermittent quantile tracking (IQT) that leverages a probabilistic model of intermittent labels, maintains asymptotic coverage guarantees, and empirically achieves desired coverage levels. From the interactive IL side, we develop ConformalDAgger, a new approach wherein the robot uses prediction intervals calibrated by IQT as a reliable measure of deployment-time uncertainty to actively query for more expert feedback. We compare ConformalDAgger to prior uncertainty-aware DAgger methods in scenarios where the distribution shift is (and isn't) present because of changes in the expert's policy. We find that in simulated and hardware deployments on a 7DOF robotic manipulator, ConformalDAgger detects high uncertainty when the expert shifts and increases the number of interventions compared to baselines, allowing the robot to more quickly learn the new behavior.</description>

      <title>OS-Genesis: Automating GUI Agent Trajectory Construction via Reverse Task Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated human-like computer control capability. Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods. Our codes, data, and checkpoints are available at https://qiushisun.github.io/OS-Genesis-Home/.</description>

      <title>ForceGrip: Reference-Free Curriculum Learning for Realistic Grip Force Control in VR Hand Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realistic Hand manipulation is a key component of immersive virtual reality (VR), yet existing methods often rely on kinematic approach or motion-capture datasets that omit crucial physical attributes such as contact forces and finger torques. Consequently, these approaches prioritize tight, one-size-fits-all grips rather than reflecting users' intended force levels. We present ForceGrip, a deep learning agent that synthesizes realistic hand manipulation motions, faithfully reflecting the user's grip force intention. Instead of mimicking predefined motion datasets, ForceGrip uses generated training scenarios-randomizing object shapes, wrist movements, and trigger input flows-to challenge the agent with a broad spectrum of physical interactions. To effectively learn from these complex tasks, we employ a three-phase curriculum learning framework comprising Finger Positioning, Intention Adaptation, and Dynamic Stabilization. This progressive strategy ensures stable hand-object contact, adaptive force control based on user inputs, and robust handling under dynamic conditions. Additionally, a proximity reward function enhances natural finger motions and accelerates training convergence. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal ForceGrip's superior force controllability and plausibility compared to state-of-the-art methods. Demo videos are available as supplementary material and the code is provided at https://han-dongheun.github.io/ForceGrip.</description>

Abstract: The rise of LLM-driven AI characters raises safety concerns, particularly for vulnerable human users with psychological disorders. To address these risks, we propose EmoAgent, a multi-agent AI framework designed to evaluate and mitigate mental health hazards in human-AI interactions. EmoAgent comprises two components: EmoEval simulates virtual users, including those portraying mentally vulnerable individuals, to assess mental health changes before and after interactions with AI characters. It uses clinically proven psychological and psychiatric assessment tools (PHQ-9, PDI, PANSS) to evaluate mental risks induced by LLM. EmoGuard serves as an intermediary, monitoring users' mental status, predicting potential harm, and providing corrective feedback to mitigate risks. Experiments conducted in popular character-based chatbots show that emotionally engaging dialogues can lead to psychological deterioration in vulnerable users, with mental state deterioration in more than 34.4% of the simulations. EmoGuard significantly reduces these deterioration rates, underscoring its role in ensuring safer AI-human interactions. Our code is available at: https://github.com/1akaman/EmoAgent</description>

      <title>Thousand Voices of Trauma: A Large-Scale Synthetic Dataset for Modeling Prolonged Exposure Therapy Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13955</link>

Abstract: The advancement of AI systems for mental health support is hindered by limited access to therapeutic conversation data, particularly for trauma treatment. We present Thousand Voices of Trauma, a synthetic benchmark dataset of 3,000 therapy conversations based on Prolonged Exposure therapy protocols for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The dataset comprises 500 unique cases, each explored through six conversational perspectives that mirror the progression of therapy from initial anxiety to peak distress to emotional processing. We incorporated diverse demographic profiles (ages 18-80, M=49.3, 49.4% male, 44.4% female, 6.2% non-binary), 20 trauma types, and 10 trauma-related behaviors using deterministic and probabilistic generation methods. Analysis reveals realistic distributions of trauma types (witnessing violence 10.6%, bullying 10.2%) and symptoms (nightmares 23.4%, substance abuse 20.8%). Clinical experts validated the dataset's therapeutic fidelity, highlighting its emotional depth while suggesting refinements for greater authenticity. We also developed an emotional trajectory benchmark with standardized metrics for evaluating model responses. This privacy-preserving dataset addresses critical gaps in trauma-focused mental health data, offering a valuable resource for advancing both patient-facing applications and clinician training tools.</description>

      <title>TreeHop: Generate and Filter Next Query Embeddings Efficiently for Multi-hop Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face significant challenges in multi-hop question answering (MHQA), where complex queries require synthesizing information across multiple document chunks. Existing approaches typically rely on iterative LLM-based query rewriting and routing, resulting in high computational costs due to repeated LLM invocations and multi-stage processes. To address these limitations, we propose TreeHop, an embedding-level framework without the need for LLMs in query refinement. TreeHop dynamically updates query embeddings by fusing semantic information from prior queries and retrieved documents, enabling iterative retrieval through embedding-space operations alone. This method replaces the traditional "Retrieve-Rewrite-Vectorize-Retrieve" cycle with a streamlined "Retrieve-Embed-Retrieve" loop, significantly reducing computational overhead. Moreover, a rule-based stop criterion is introduced to further prune redundant retrievals, balancing efficiency and recall rate. Experimental results show that TreeHop rivals advanced RAG methods across three open-domain MHQA datasets, achieving comparable performance with only 5\%-0.4\% of the model parameter size and reducing the query latency by approximately 99\% compared to concurrent approaches. This makes TreeHop a faster and more cost-effective solution for deployment in a range of knowledge-intensive applications. For reproducibility purposes, codes and data are available here: https://github.com/allen-li1231/TreeHop-RAG.</description>

      <title>Conversations with AI Chatbots Increase Short-Term Vaccine Intentions But Do Not Outperform Standard Public Health Messaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based chatbots show promise in persuasive communication, but existing studies often rely on weak controls or focus on belief change rather than behavioral intentions or outcomes. This pre-registered multi-country (US, Canada, UK) randomized controlled trial involving 930 vaccine-hesitant parents evaluated brief (three-minute) multi-turn conversations with LLM-based chatbots against standard public health messaging approaches for increasing human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine intentions for their children. Participants were randomly assigned to: (1) a weak control (no message), (2) a strong control reflecting the standard of care (reading official public health materials), or (3 and 4) one of two chatbot conditions. One chatbot was prompted to deliver short, conversational responses, while the other used the model's default output style (longer with bullet points). While chatbot interactions significantly increased self-reported vaccination intent (by 7.1-10.3 points on a 100-point scale) compared to no message, they did not outperform standard public health materials, with the conversational chatbot performing significantly worse. Additionally, while the short-term effects of chatbot interactions faded during a 15-day follow-up, the effects of public health material persisted relative to no message. These findings suggest that while LLMs can effectively shift vaccination intentions in the short-term, their incremental value over existing public health communications is questionable, offering a more tempered view of their persuasive capabilities and highlighting the importance of integrating AI-driven tools alongside, rather than replacing, current public health strategies.</description>
