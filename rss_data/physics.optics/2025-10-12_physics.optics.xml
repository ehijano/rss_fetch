      <title>Experimental observation of energy-band Riemann surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity naturally arises in many physical systems that exchange energy with their environment. The presence of non-Hermiticity leads to many novel topological physics phenomena and device applications. In the non-Hermitian energy band theory, the foundation of these physics and applications, both energies and wavevectors can take complex values. The energy bands thus become a Riemann surface, and such an energy-band Riemann surface underlies all the important signatures of non-Hermitian topological physics phenomena. Despite a long history and recent theoretical interests, the energy-band Riemann surface has not been experimentally studied. Here we provide a photonic observation of the energy-band Riemann surface of a non-Hermitian system. This is achieved by applying a tunable imaginary gauge transformation on the platform of the photonic synthetic frequency dimension. From the measured topology of the Riemann surface, we reveal the complex-energy winding, the open-boundary-condition spectrum, the generalized Brillouin zone, and the branch points. Our findings demonstrate a unified framework in the studies of diverse effects in non-Hermitian topological physics through an experimental observation of energy-band Riemann surfaces.</description>

      <title>Topologically-protected superluminal pair annihilation in photonic time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic time crystals (PTCs) - dielectric media whose permittivity is periodically modulated in time - map to a Dirac equation with an imaginary mass, opening a momentum gap (k-gap) where modes grow or decay exponentially. Here, we introduce a sequence of temporal Jackiw-Rebbi kinks that act as a programmable flip of the Dirac mass, exchanging the amplifying and decaying in-gap modes. By launching two seeded pulses with a controlled relative phase, we demonstrate topological pair annihilation in spacetime domain, the phase-selective cancellation of counter-propagating, k-gap-amplified modes. The resulting spatiotemporal cascade appears superluminal, yet causality is preserved because the cascaded pattern carries no net energy flux. To facilitate implementation, we construct a minimal time-varying non-Hermitian lattice model and reproduce the phase-selective pair annihilation behavior, establishing a direct continuum-lattice correspondence. Our results identify topological kinks as temporal gating to manipulate the growth and wave propagation of time-varying media.</description>

      <title>Polarization Dependence of Excess Loss of Amorphous Coating Supermirror in Optical Region for Cavity Ringdown Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long optical path length is critical in achieving sensitive spectroscopy. For cavity ringdown spectroscopy, a cavity consisting of two supermirrors provides a long path length, where high reflectance of the supermirrors results from their slight excess loss. In the case of a crystal coating supermirror, the excess loss has been suggested to depend on polarization. On the other hand, an amorphous coating supermirror was expected to have a negligible polarization dependence. In this work, we measured the excess loss as a function of mirror rotation around its optical axis in the optical region at 681.2 nm for the three amorphous coating supermirrors produced simultaneously by vapor deposition in the same furnace. The back mirror of the cavity was rotated, and the ringdown time as a function of rotational angle was measured every 10 degrees. As a result, sinusoidal variations in excess loss were observed depending on the rotation. The difference in excess loss between the best and worst rotational angles during the rotation of the back mirror reached a maximum of 5.8 +- 1.2 ppm. This difference demonstrates the importance of optimizing the rotational angle alignment of supermirrors to achieve high sensitivity via a long path length in cavity ringdown spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Performance limit of on-chip speckle spectrometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disorder-driven, integrated speckle spectrometers offer exceptional spectral resolution within a compact design. They benefit from enhanced optical path lengths due to multiple light scattering events, however, often at the cost of low optical throughput. Here, we investigate the relationship between these two figures of merit by systematically varying the scattering strength of random-uniform disorder distributions. Furthermore, we also investigate the temperature stability of such spectrometers. Our study shows that the device resolution can be tuned from 2 nm to 20 pm, while the operating temperature ranges from 1 to more than 6 degrees and throughput can be varied by more than a factor of 10, paving the way for application-tailored design of microscale high-resolution spectrometers.</description>

      <title>Riemann-Silberstein geometric phase for high-dimensional light manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric phases provide a powerful mechanism for light manipulation. In particular, the Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) phase has enabled optical metasurfaces with broad applications. However, the PB phase is based on polarization evolution in a two-dimensional space, which fails to account for other polarization degrees of freedom. Here, we generalize the concept of geometric phase to a four-dimensional (4D) Riemann-Silberstein (RS) space that characterizes the complete electromagnetic polarization, including electric, magnetic, and hybrid polarizations. We show that the 4D polarization evolution in the RS space can give rise to a new geometric phase-the RS phase-in addition to the PB phase. The PB phase depends on optical spin and usually manifests in circularly polarized light, whereas the RS phase depends on optical linear momentum and can manifest in arbitrarily polarized light. Their synergy provides a unified geometric framework for light propagation at interfaces and enables unprecedented high-dimensional light control. As a proof of principle, we propose and demonstrate RS metasurfaces capable of multiplexed wavefront shaping, which can reconfigure up to twelve distinct outputs via switching incident 4D polarization. Our work uncovers a new class of optical geometric phases, with promising applications in high-capacity optical communication, parallel information processing, and multifunctional nanophotonic design.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling of collective optical resonances in dielectric metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectric metasurfaces can achieve strong light-matter interaction based on several types of collective (nonlocal) resonances, such as surface lattice resonances (SLRs) and quasi bound states in the continuum (quasi-BICs). Spectral selectivity, field enhancement, and high and controllable Q-factors make these resonances appealing for technological applications in lasing, sensing, nonlinear optics, and quantum photon sources. An emerging challenge focuses on tailoring light-matter interaction via mode coupling and hybridization between the fundamental resonances of a metasurface. While strong coupling phenomena have been demonstrated between various resonant modes, the interplay between collective resonances of different natures has not been observed to date. Here, we theoretically, numerically, and experimentally demonstrate the onset of coupling and hybridization between symmetry-protected quasi-BICs and SLRs in a dielectric metasurface. We show (1) the emergence of anticrossing (or Rabi splitting) in the strong coupling regime with suppression of reflection, observed under TE-polarized excitation, and (2) the manifestation of an accidental BIC under TM-polarized illumination as a result of energy exchange between the participating collective resonances in the weak coupling regime. Both effects are accompanied by hybridized near-fields of the modes. The observed coupling mechanisms can be controlled by modifying the angle of incidence, polarization, and surrounding environment. This foundational study on the coupling and hybridization of collective resonances offers insights that can be leveraged for the design of metasurfaces with targeted quasi-aBIC and collective hybridized resonances. It could also open new possibilities to control the near fields associated with such resonances, with promising applications in tunable nanophotonics and light manipulation.</description>

      <title>Alignment conditions of the human eye for few-photon vision experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In experiments probing human vision at the few-photon level, precise alignment of the eye is necessary such that stimuli reach the highest-density rod region of the retina. However, in literature there seems to be no consensus on the optimal eye alignment for such experiments. Typically, experiments are performed by presenting stimuli nasally or temporally, but the angle under which the few-photon pulses are presented varies between 7 deg and 23 deg. Here we combine a $3$-dimensional eye model with retinal rod density measurements from literature in a ray tracing simulation to study the optimal eye alignment conditions and necessary alignment precision. We find that stimuli, directed at the eye's nodal point, may be best presented under an inferior angle of 13.1 deg with respect to the visual axis. Defining a target area on the retina with a radius of 0.5 mm around the optimum location, we find the horizontal and vertical angular precision should be better than 0.85 deg given a horizontal and vertical translational precision of 1 mm and a depth translational precision of 5 mm.</description>

      <title>A quantum-coherent photon--emitter interface in the original telecom band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum dots stand out as the most advanced and versatile light-matter interface available today. Their ability to deliver high-quality, high-rate, and pure photons has set benchmarks that far surpass other emitters. Yet, a critical frontier has remained elusive: achieving these exceptional capabilities at telecom wavelengths, bridging the gap to fiber-optic infrastructure and scalable silicon photonics. Overcoming this challenge demands high quality quantum materials and devices which, despite extensive efforts, have not been realized yet. Here, we demonstrate waveguide-integrated quantum dots and realize a fully quantum-coherent photon-emitter interface operating in the original telecommunication band. The quality is assessed by recording transform-limited linewidths only 8 % broader than the inverse lifetime and bright 41.7 MHz emission rate under 80 MHz $\pi$-pulse excitation, unlocking the full potential of quantum dots for scalable quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Photonic Metalattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When coherent light interacts with an ordered lattice whose periodicity is comparable to its wavelength, constructive interference produces a diffraction pattern as in crystallography, where x-rays are employed to reveal atomic structures. By asking 'when' the diffractive object exist, rather than 'where', we implicitly introduce time as a design parameter, thus enabling the creation of spatio-temporal metalattices. In these structures, temporal modulation of optical properties complements the spatial patterning, unlocking advanced functionalities such as dynamic reconfigurability, nonreciprocal behavior, coherent amplification, and tailored spectral response. However, for these effects to be relevant an extreme temporal modulation of the refractive index is necessary. In this work, we realize a two-dimensional spatio-temporal metalattice by integrating a physically patterned spatial modulation with an orthogonal temporal lattice induced by interfering ultrafast pulses, using highly nonlinear, low-index transparent conducting films. While the optical pumps experience a uniform medium, the lattice emerges through a strongly enhanced and internally generated third harmonic signal. The transient lattice shows comparable diffraction efficiency to the physical structure and is also dynamically reconfigurable via a broad range of parameters, including pump pulse delay, incidence angle, and wavelength, offering exceptional versatility for ultra-fast transient lithography and photon manipulation in both momentum and frequency. This approach shifts device design from fixed fabrication constraints to radiation engineering, opening new pathways towards ultrafast reconfigurable photonics.</description>

      <title>Multiplexed back focal plane imaging with on-chip integrated microlens array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-chip optical architectures that enable angle-resolved spectroscopy are essential for advancing photonic platforms towards low-volume, scalable, and cryo-compatible devices. Here, we introduce spatially resolved momentum-space imaging using arrays of 3D-printed microlenses directly integrated onto semiconductor optical microcavities. Each microlens functions as an independent optical element with a high numerical aperture (approx. 0.95), enabling parallel back focal plane imaging across, in our implementation, 64 distinct locations. This approach eliminates the need for bulky microscope objectives while maintaining broad wavevector access, even under cryogenic conditions. We demonstrate its versatility across various cavity systems, including dielectric planar resonators, GaAs-based polariton microcavities, and CdTe platforms supporting nonequilibrium Bose-Einstein condensation of exciton-polaritons. The microlenses not only enhance collection efficiency but also enable tightly focused excitation, yielding an order of magnitude reduction in condensation thresholds compared with conventional setups. Our results establish 3D-printed microlens arrays as a compact, versatile, integrated platform for next-generation angle-resolved spectroscopy in nanophotonics and quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Skyrmionic polarization textures in structured dielectric planar media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skyrmionic patterns of optical fields have recently emerged across diverse photonic platforms. Here, we show that such textures also arise in the polarization eigenstates of light propagation through flat dielectric devices with an engineered, space-dependent optic-axis orientation. We focus on two-dimensional periodic structures, where propagation through multiple devices maps onto quantum dynamics on a synthetic optical lattice. Adopting the condensed-matter framework, a spatial period defines an effective Brillouin zone, and polarization eigenstates can be grouped in two bands, with the role of energy played by the opposite phase delay. When such eigenstates exhibit skyrmionic textures, the corresponding lattice model shows the topology of a Chern insulator. These structures result from the interaction between the optical field and the medium and do not reflect a topological structure of the medium itself. We validate these concepts in a system of three tunable liquid-crystal metasurfaces. Using quantum process tomography based on supervised machine learning, we reconstruct the polarization eigenmodes over one spatial period. We identify configurations of the devices' parameters that lead to topologically non-trivial bands, where we directly observe skyrmionic eigenpolarization textures. Along the analogy with condensed matter, we also extract local observables of lattice models, such as the Berry curvature and the quantum metric. We finally report a numerical simulation of an all-optical quantum Hall effect emerging when light propagates through a sequence of such devices, arranged so as to mimic the effect of an external force on the lattice.</description>

      <title>Engineering High-Order Harmonic Generation through Gas Confinement at Sub-Millimeter Lengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attosecond light sources based on high-order harmonic generation (HHG) constitute to date the only table-top solution for producing coherent broadband radiation covering the spectral range from the extreme ultraviolet to the soft X-rays. The so-called emission cutoff can be extended towards higher photon energies by increasing the driving wavelength at the expense of conversion efficiency. An alternative route is to overdrive the process by using higher laser intensities, with the challenging requirement of interacting with higher plasma densities over short propagation distances. Here, we address this challenge by using a differentially pumped glass chip designed for optimal gas confinement over sub-mm lengths. By driving HHG with multicycle pulses at either 800 nm or 1500 nm, we demonstrate a cutoff extension by a factor of two compared to conventional phase matching approaches and surpassing the present record using multicycle fields. Our three-dimensional propagation simulations, in excellent agreement with the experiment, confirm that gas confinement is crucial since efficient phase matching of cutoff harmonics occurs only for short propagation lengths. Additionally, we show that the high photon energy component is not only temporally confined to the leading edge of the driving pulse, but also spatially confined in the near-field to an off-axis contribution due to reshaping of the driving field along propagation inside the medium. Our findings contribute to the fundamental understanding of HHG across different regimes.</description>

      <title>Chern insulators and topological flat bands in cavity-embedded kagome systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate topological band structures of a kagome system coupled to a circularly polarized cavity mode, using a model based on a muffin-tin potential and quantum light-matter interaction. We show that Chern insulating phases emerge in the cavity-embedded kagome system due to the light-matter interaction that breaks time-reversal symmetry. We also find that a nearly flat band can be topologically nontrivial with a nonzero Chern number. By varying the light-matter interaction, we also reveal that topological phase transitions occur between different Chern insulating phases in the ultrastrong coupling regime. The phase transitions change the sign of the Chern number, switching the direction of the edge current. We demonstrate the existence of topological edge modes in the cavity-embedded kagome Chern insulators by constructing a low-energy effective tight-binding model.</description>

      <title>Optical Link Tomography: First Field Trial and 4D Extension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical link tomography (OLT) is a rapidly evolving field that allows the multi-span, end-to-end visualization of optical power along fiber links in multiple dimensions from network endpoints, solely by processing signals received at coherent receivers. This paper has two objectives: (1) to report the first field trial of OLT, using a commercial transponder under standard DWDM transmission, and (2) to extend its capability to visualize across 4D (distance, time, frequency, and polarization), allowing for locating and measuring multiple QoT degradation causes, including time-varying power anomalies, spectral anomalies, and excessive polarization dependent loss. We also address a critical aspect of OLT, i.e., its need for high fiber launch power, by improving power profile signal-to-noise ratio through averaging across all available dimensions. Consequently, multiple loss anomalies in a field-deployed link are observed even at launch power lower than the system-optimal level. The applications and use cases of OLT from network commissioning to provisioning and operation for current and near-term network scenarios are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Acousto-optic lens for 3D shuttling of atoms in a neutral atom quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel acousto-optic lens (AOL) design for neutral atom quantum computing. This approach enhances atom rearrangement in optical tweezer arrays and addresses the speed limitations imposed by the cylindrical lensing effect of acousto-optic deflectors (AODs). By combining a double-pass AOD configuration for dynamic focal tuning with a standard pair of crossed AODs for transverse beam steering, our design enables the generation of arbitrary focal point trajectories. This configuration enables shuttling of atoms in 3D space, thereby helping to realise fully connected two-qubit gates and mid-circuit measurements. We detail the optical implementation, characterize its performance, and discuss its applications in scalable quantum computing architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wavefield speckle patterns are generated by interference of randomly scattered coherent light. In the weak-coupling regime of the It\^o-Schr\"odinger paraxial model for long-distance wave propagation, we show the following multiscale character: a macroscopic envelope solves a deterministic diffusion equation while the local wavefield (the speckle) is described by a complex Gaussian process both in terms of spatial axial and lateral displacements as well as frequency and angular variations of the incident wavebeam. These results describe speckle patterns and corroborate chromato-spatial memory effects observed in laser light propagation through heterogeneous media.</description>

      <title>Long Living Hot and Dense Plasma from Relativistic Laser-Nanowire Array Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-living, hot and dense plasmas generated by ultra-intense laser beams are of critical importance for laser-driven nuclear physics, bright hard X-ray sources, and laboratory astrophysics. We report the experimental observation of plasmas with nanosecond-scale lifetimes, near-solid density, and keV-level temperatures, produced by irradiating periodic arrays of composite nanowires with ultra-high contrast, relativistically intense femtosecond laser pulses. Jet-like plasma structures extending up to 1~mm from the nanowire surface were observed, emitting K-shell radiation from He-like Ti$^{20+}$ ions. High-resolution X-ray spectra were analyzed using 3D Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations of the laser-plasma interaction combined with collisional--radiative modeling (FLYCHK). The results indicate that the jets consist of plasma with densities of $10^{20}$-$10^{22}$ cm$^{-3}$ and keV-scale temperatures, persisting for several nanoseconds. We attribute the formation of these jets to the generation of kiloTesla-scale global magnetic fields during the laser interaction, as predicted by PIC simulations. These fields may drive long-timescale current instabilities that sustain magnetic fields of several hundred tesla, sufficient to confine hot, dense plasma over nanosecond durations.</description>

      <title>A Decoy-like Protocol for Quantum Key Distribution: Enhancing the Performance with Imperfect Single Photon Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) relies on single photon sources (SPSs), e.g. from solid-state systems, as flying qubits, where security strongly requires sub-Poissonian photon statistics with low second-order correlation values (\$g^{(2)}(0)\$). However, achieving such low \$g^{(2)}(0)\$ remains experimentally challenging. We therefore propose a decoy-like QKD protocol that relaxes this constraint while maintaining security. This enables the use of many SPSs with \$g^{(2)}(0) &gt; \$0.1, routinely achieved in experiments but rarely considered viable for QKD. Monte Carlo simulations and our experiment from defects in hexagonal boron nitride show that, under linear loss, \$g^{(2)}(0)\$ remains constant, whereas photon-number-splitting (PNS) attacks introduce nonlinear effects that modify the measured \$g^{(2)}(0)\$ statistics. Exploiting this \$g^{(2)}(0)\$ variation as a diagnostic tool, our protocol detects PNS attacks analogously to decoy-state methods. Both single- and two-photon pulses consequently securely contribute to the secret key rate. Our protocol outperforms the Gottesman--Lo--Lutkenhaus--Preskill (GLLP) framework under high channel loss across various solid-state SPSs and is applicable to the satellite-based communication. Since \$g^{(2)}(0)\$ can be extracted from standard QKD experiments, no additional hardware is required. The relaxed \$g^{(2)}(0)\$ requirement simplifies the laser system for SPS generation. This establishes a practical route toward high-performance QKD without the need for ultra-pure SPSs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a diffusion equation for light scattering from ejecta produced by extreme shocks on metallic samples. This model is easier to handle than a more conventional model based on the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE), and is a relevant tool to analyze spectrograms obtained from Photon Doppler Velocimetry (PDV) measurements in the deep multiple scattering regime. We also determine the limits of validity of the diffusive model compared to the RTE, based on a detailed analysis of various ejecta properties in configurations with increasing complexity.</description>

      <title>Broadband birefringence spectroscopy with sub-kHz precision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although current amorphous high-reflective mirror coatings have had tremendous success in metrology applications, they are inherently limited by thermal fluctuations in their coating structure. Alternatively, crystalline coating technology has demonstrated superior thermal noise performance. However, recent studies have revealed birefringent noise sources, raising questions about the limits of frequency stability of high-finesse cryogenic silicon cavities with crystalline mirror coatings. Here, we show the applicability of cavity-mode dispersion spectroscopy to measure birefringent cavity mode splitting. We measured birefringence induced cavity mode splitting by probing the resonance frequencies of a high-finesse, ultra-low expansion glass cavity with all-crystalline mirror coatings, reaching fractional frequency sensitivity of \SI{5e-14}{} utilizing an optical frequency comb for two orthogonal polarizations. Subsequently, we calculated the static birefringent splitting of the refractive index for \SI{23.8}{\celsius} and \SI{31.3}{\celsius} on the order of \SI{305 \pm 3}{ppm} and \SI{294 \pm 3}{ppm} over \SI{30}{nm} respectively. Furthermore, we propose measurements of dispersive birefringent noise based on optical frequency combs. Our results not only extend the use of optical frequency combs to measure static birefringence, but also implicate a possibility to further study spectrally dependent frequency noise.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Topological Combs for Robust High-Dimensional Information Transmission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sculpting light across its independent degrees of freedom-from orbital angular momentum to the discrete wavelengths of optical frequency combs-has unlocked vast communication bandwidth by enabling massively parallel information channels. However, the Shannon-Hartley theorem sets a hard limit by tying channel capacity to the trade-off between SNR and rate, a central challenge in communication. Inspired by lock-in amplification in electronics, we encode data on THz optical burst carriers so the signal resides beyond the conventional noise band, yielding exceptional robustness. By leveraging a programmable all-degree-of-freedom (All-DoF) modulator, we generate a spatiotemporal topological comb (ST-Comb) that structures light into a vast, highentropy state space for high-dimensional information encoding. Crucially, we find that the associated topological winding number is preserved under diverse perturbations, ensuring stable information encoding and retrieval. This paradigm illustrates how structured light can simultaneously expand channel dimensionality and maintain robustness, charting a pathway to chip-scale, reconfigurable photonic platforms for the PHz era, while also opening previously inaccessible regimes of light-matter interaction.</description>

Abstract: Large Sagnac interferometers in the form of active ring lasers have emerged as unique rotation sensors in the geosciences, where their sensitivity allows to detect geodetic and seismological signals. The passive laser gyroscope variant, however, is still at a stage of development, and adequate laser frequency stabilization techniques are explored to reach the desired levels of sensitivity and stability. Here, we present the first H\"ansch-Couillaud locked passive laser gyroscope. We employ a lock-in scheme to overcome the flicker floor to achieve a sensitivity of 3.1 nrad/s, corresponding to a fraction of $7.7 \cdot 10^{5}$ in the Earth's rotation rate.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric bounds in spinful systems with trivial band topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive quantum geometric bounds in spinful systems with spin topology characterized by a single $\mathbb{Z}$ index protected by a spin gap. Our bounds provide geometric conditions on the spin topology, distinct from the known quantum geometric bounds associated with Wilson loops and nontrivial band topologies. As a result, we obtain broader bounds in time-reversal symmetric systems with a nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index and also bounds in systems with a trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index, where the quantum metric should be otherwise unbounded. We benchmark these findings with first-principles calculations in elemental bismuth realizing a nontrivial even spin-Chern number. Moreover, we connect these bounds to optical responses and show their robustness in the presence of disorder within a real space marker formulation, demonstrating that spin-resolved quantum geometry is observable in realistic experimental settings of impure materials. Finally, we connect spin bounds to quantum Cram\'er-Rao bounds that are central to quantum metrology, showing that elemental Bi and other spin-topological phases hold promises for topological free fermion quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics of light's orbital angular momentum under a Lorentz boost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The idea behind entanglement is counterintuitive to any classical viewpoint of physical realism. An entangled state is a nonlocal superposition of realities that belong to a physical system. The common test of such a state has been done through Bell measurements. In this work, we attempt to look at this notion from a different perspective. We study the evolution of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) entanglement in inertia reference frames under a Lorentz boost. We consider two specific motions for the observers of the entanglement. First, we consider co-moving observers, i.e., with zero relative motion (Zero-RM). Second, we introduce a non-zero relative motion (Non-Zero RM) between them. In the second case, we distinguish between observer's perspective of the amplitude probability, i.e., from the perspective of rest (Non-Zero RM1) and moving (Non-Zero RM2) observers. As a result, the transition probability amplitudes are altered in all cases. We observe that entanglement undergoes significant changes and is not preserved maximally from the viewpoint of the stationary observers at the rest (source) frame and asymptotically approaches a minimum at very large velocities close to the light cone (LC). However, from the viewpoint of moving observer in the Non-Zero RM2, entanglement will not survive, and the final state is separable. This is an extremely important observation since the concept of entanglement is supposed to be nonlocal, and therefore free from any spacetime transformation. Our results demonstrated through the entanglement metrics such as entanglement entropy and purity show that OAM entanglement is observer dependent, hence, local. Ironically, even entanglement is influenced by motion. Finally, based on this study, one can predict that within photon's frame of reference, there is no OAM relevance, and this property is only emergent at the light-matter interaction limit.</description>
