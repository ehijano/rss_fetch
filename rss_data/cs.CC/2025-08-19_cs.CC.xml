      <title>NP-Completeness of Multicast Beamforming in Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the classical problem of multi-cast beamforming in wireless communication is reconsidered. An existing work has shown that the multi-cast beamforming problem is NP-hard. In this project, we show that the corresponding decision problem for real channel matrices and beamformers is NP-complete. Finally, we carry out simulations to reveal the computational complexity of solving the NP-complete beamforming problem in various setting using SAT/SMT solvers.</description>

      <title>Geometry Matters in Planar Storyplans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A storyplan visualizes a graph $G=(V,E)$ as a sequence of $\ell$ frames $\Gamma_1, \dots, \Gamma_\ell$, each of which is a drawing of the induced subgraph $G[V_i]$ of a vertex subset $V_i \subseteq V$. Moreover, each vertex $v \in V$ is contained in a single consecutive sequence of frames $\Gamma_i, \dots, \Gamma_j$, all vertices and edges contained in consecutive frames are drawn identically, and the union of all frames is a drawing of $G$. In GD 2022, the concept of planar storyplans was introduced, in which each frame must be a planar (topological) drawing. Several (parameterized) complexity results for recognizing graphs that admit a planar storyplan were provided, including NP-hardness. In this paper, we investigate an open question posed in the GD paper and show that the geometric and topological settings of the planar storyplan problem differ: We provide an instance of a graph that admits a planar storyplan, but no planar geometric storyplan, in which each frame is a planar straight-line drawing. Still, by adapting the reduction proof from the topological to the geometric setting, we show that recognizing the graphs that admit planar geometric storyplans remains NP-hard.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of constrained reconfiguration and motion planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13032v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coordinating the motion of multiple agents in constrained environments is a fundamental challenge in robotics, motion planning, and scheduling. A motivating example involves $n$ robotic arms, each represented as a line segment. The objective is to rotate each arm to its vertical orientation, one at a time (clockwise or counterclockwise), without collisions nor rotating any arm more than once. This scenario is an example of the more general $k$-Compatible Ordering problem, where $n$ agents, each capable of $k$ state-changing actions, must transition to specific target states under constraints encoded as a set $\mathcal{G}$ of $k$ pairs of directed graphs.
  We show that $k$-Compatible Ordering is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete, even when $\mathcal{G}$ is planar, degenerate, or acyclic. On the positive side, we provide polynomial-time algorithms for cases such as when $k = 1$ or $\mathcal{G}$ has bounded treewidth. We also introduce generalized variants supporting multiple state-changing actions per agent, broadening the applicability of our framework. These results extend to a wide range of scheduling, reconfiguration, and motion planning applications in constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Raising the Bar: An Asymptotic Comparison of Classical and Quantum Shortest Path Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP) problem is a cornerstone of computer science with vast applications, for which Dijkstra's algorithm has long been the classical baseline. While various quantum algorithms have been proposed, their performance has typically been benchmarked against this decades-old approach. This landscape was recently reshaped by the introduction of a new classical algorithm by Duan et al. with a complexity of $O(m \cdot (\log n)^{2/3})$. This development necessitates a re-evaluation of the quantum advantage narrative for SSSP. In this paper, we conduct a systematic theoretical comparison of modern quantum and classical SSSP algorithms in light of this new classical frontier. Through an analysis of their theoretical cost functions, we illustrate how their relative scaling compares across scenarios that vary in graph density and path length. Our analysis suggests a nuanced picture: sophisticated quantum algorithms, such as the one by Wesolowski and Piddock, can exhibit more favorable asymptotic scaling, but only in regimes characterized by short solution paths. Conversely, for problems involving long paths, state-of-the-art classical algorithms appear to maintain a scaling advantage. Our work provides an updated perspective for future quantum algorithm development and underscores that the pursuit of quantum advantage is a dynamic race where the classical goalposts are continually shifting.</description>

      <title>Two-State Spin Systems with Negative Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04735v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the approximability of computing the partition functions of two-state spin systems. The problem is parameterized by a $2\times 2$ symmetric matrix. Previous results on this problem were restricted either to the case where the matrix has non-negative entries, or to the case where the diagonal entries are equal, i.e. Ising models. In this paper, we study the generalization to arbitrary $2\times 2$ interaction matrices with real entries. We show that in some regions of the parameter space, it's \#P-hard to even determine the sign of the partition function, while in other regions there are fully polynomial approximation schemes for the partition function. Our results reveal several new computational phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Canonization of a random circulant graph by counting walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05788v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that almost all graphs are canonizable by a simple combinatorial routine known as color refinement, also referred to as the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm. With high probability, this method assigns a unique label to each vertex of a random input graph and, hence, it is applicable only to asymmetric graphs. The strength of combinatorial refinement techniques becomes a subtle issue if the input graphs are highly symmetric. We prove that the combination of color refinement and vertex individualization yields a canonical labeling for almost all circulant digraphs (i.e., Cayley digraphs of a cyclic group). This result provides first evidence of good average-case performance of combinatorial refinement within the class of vertex-transitive graphs. Remarkably, we do not even need the full power of the color refinement algorithm. We show that the canonical label of a vertex $v$ can be obtained just by counting walks of each length from $v$ to an individualized vertex. Our analysis also implies that almost all circulant graphs are compact in the sense of Tinhofer, that is, their polytops of fractional automorphisms are integral. Finally, we show that a canonical Cayley representation can be constructed for almost all circulant graphs by the more powerful 2-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm.</description>

      <title>NP-Hardness and ETH-Based Inapproximability of Communication Complexity via Relaxed Interlacing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05597v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that computing the deterministic communication complexity D(f) of a Boolean function is NP-hard in the standard protocol-tree model, answering, independently and concurrently with Hirahara-Llango-Loff (arXiv:2507.10426), a question first posed by Yao (1979). Our reduction builds and expands on a suite of structural "interlacing" lemmas introduced by Mackenzie and Saffidine (arXiv:2411.19003); these lemmas can be reused as black boxes in future lower-bound constructions.
  The instances produced by our reduction admit optimal protocols for self-similar constructions with strong structural properties, giving a flexible framework for the design of reductions showing NP-hardness of deciding the communication complexity of a Boolean matrix. This complements the work by Hirahara, Ilango, and Loff, which establishes NP-hardness in the same model via a different route; our analysis additionally yields reusable structural guarantees and underpins further consequences concerning inapproximability.
  Because the gadgets in our construction are self-similar, they can be recursively embedded. We sketch how this yields, under the Exponential-Time Hypothesis, an additive inapproximability gap that grows without bound. Furthermore we outline a route toward NP-hardness of approximating D(f) within a fixed constant additive error. Full details of the ETH-based inapproximability results will appear in a future version.
  Beyond settling the complexity of deterministic communication complexity itself, the modular framework we develop opens the door to a wider class of reductions and, we believe, will prove useful in tackling other long-standing questions in communication complexity.</description>

      <title>Matrix-by-matrix multiplication algorithm with $O(N^2log_2N)$ computational complexity for variable precision arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that assuming the availability of the processor with variable precision arithmetic, we can compute matrix-by-matrix multiplications in $O(N^2log_2N)$ computational complexity. We replace the standard matrix-by-matrix multiplications $\begin{bmatrix} A_{11} &amp; A_{12} \\ A_{21} &amp; A_{22}\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} B_{11} &amp; B_{12} \\ B_{21} &amp; B_{22}\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} A_{11}B_{11}+A_{12}B_{21} &amp; A_{11}B_{12}+A_{12}B_{22} \\ A_{21}B_{11}+A_{22}B_{21} &amp; A_{21}B_{12}+A_{22}B_{22}\end{bmatrix}$ by $\begin{bmatrix} A_{11} &amp; A_{12} \\ A_{21} &amp; A_{22}\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} B_{11} &amp; B_{12} \\ B_{21} &amp; B_{22}\end{bmatrix}=\Bigl\lfloor\begin{bmatrix} (A_{11}+\epsilon A_{12})(B_{11}+1/{\epsilon}B_{21}) &amp; (A_{11}+\epsilon A_{12})(B_{12}+1/{\epsilon}B_{22}) \\ (A_{21}+\epsilon A_{22})(B_{11}+1/{\epsilon}B_{21}) &amp;(A_{21}+\epsilon A_{22})(B_{12}+1/{\epsilon}B_{22})\end{bmatrix} \Bigr\rfloor \% \frac{1}{\epsilon}$ where $\lfloor \rfloor$ denotes the floor, and $\%$ denotes the modulo operators. We reduce the number of block matrix-by-matrix multiplications from 8 to 4, keeping the number of additions equal to 4, and additionally introducing 4 multiplications of a block matrices by $\epsilon$ or $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$, and 4 floor and 4 modulo operations. The resulting computational complexity for two matrices of size $N\times N$ can be estimated from recursive equation $T(N)=4(N/2)^2$ (multiplication of a matrix by $\epsilon$ and $1/\epsilon$) plus $4(N/2)^2$ (additions of two matrices) plus $2N^2$ (floor and modulo) plus $4T(N/2)$ (four recursive calls) as $O(N^2log_2N)$. These multiplications of blocks of a matrix by number scales like $O((N/2)^2)$. We also present a MATLAB code using \emph{vpa} variable precision arithmetic emulator that can multiply matrices of size $N\times N$ using $(4log_2N+1)N^2$ vpa operations. This emulator uses $O(N)$ digits to run our algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reduce the additive cost of general (non-commutative) 3x3 matrix multiplication from the previous records of 61 (Schwartz-Vaknin, 2023) and 62 (Martensson-Wagner, 2025) to 60 without a change of basis. To our knowledge, this represents a new state-of-the-art.</description>
