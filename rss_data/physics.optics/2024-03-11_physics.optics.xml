      <title>Bound-extended mode transition in type-II synthetic photonic Weyl heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic structures with Weyl points (WPs), including type-I and type-II, promise nontrivial surface modes and intriguing light manipulations for their three-dimensional topological bands. While previous studies mainly focus on exploring WPs in a uniform Weyl structure, here we establish Weyl heterostructures (i.e., a nonuniform Weyl lattice) with different rotational orientations in the synthetic dimension by nanostructured photonic waveguides. In this work, we unveil a transition between bound and extended modes on the interface of type-II Weyl heterostructures by tuning their rotational phases, despite the reversed topological order across the interface. This mode transition is also manifested from the total transmission to total reflection at the interface. All of these unconventional effects are attributed to the tilted dispersion of type-II Weyl band structure that can lead to mismatched bands and gaps across the interface. As a comparison, the type-I Weyl heterostructures lack the phase transition due to the untilted band structure. This work establishes a flexible scheme of artificial Weyl heterostructures that opens a new avenue towards high-dimensional topological effects and significantly enhances our capabilities in on-chip light manipulations.</description>

      <title>Theoretical estimation of stimulated and spontaneous Raman signals in Raman microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a highly sensitive vibrational imaging method, stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy is finding various applications, while its theoretical treatment seems still under development. Here we present a theoretical estimation of spontaneous Raman signal and SRS signal from Raman scattering cross section, irrespective of the numerical aperture of the objective lens. We confirm a reasonable agreement between our theory with a recently proposed treatment based on the stimulated Raman scattering cross section. Furthermore, we point out that the acceleration factor of SRS can be interpreted as the number of Stokes photons in the vibrational coherence time.</description>

      <title>Optimized detection modality for double resonance alignment based optical magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive and comparative analysis of two detection modalities, i.e., polarization rotation and absorption measurement of light, for a double resonance alignment based optical magnetometer (DRAM). We derive algebraic expressions for magnetometry signals based on multipole moments description. Experiments are carried out using a room-temperature paraffin-coated Caesium vapour cell and measuring either the polarization rotation or absorption of the transmitted laser light. A detailed experimental analysis of the resonance spectra is performed to validate the theoretical findings for various input parameters. The results signify the use of a single isotropic relaxation rate thus simplifying the data analysis for optimization of the DRAM. The sensitivity measurements are performed and reveal that the polarization rotation detection mode yields larger signals and better sensitivity than absorption measurement of light.</description>

      <title>Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy with undetected photons from high-gain spontaneous parametric down-conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is an indispensable analytical method that allows label-free identification of substances via fundamental molecular vibrations. However, the sensitivity of FTIR is often limited by the low efficiency of mid-infrared (MIR) photodetectors. SU(1,1) interferometry has previously enabled FTIR with undetected MIR photons via spontaneous parametric down-conversion in the low-parametric-gain regime, where the number of photons per mode is much less than one and sensitive photodetectors are needed. In this work, we develop a high-parametric-gain SU(1,1) interferometer for MIR-range FTIR with undetected photons. Using our new method, we demonstrate three major advantages: a high photon number at the interferometer output, a considerably lower photon number at the sample, and improved interference contrast. In addition, we analyze different methods to broaden the spectral range of the interferometer by aperiodic poling and temperature gradient in the gain medium. Exploiting the broadband SU(1,1) interferometer, we measure and evaluate the MIR absorption spectra of polymers in the 3-{\mu}m region.</description>

      <title>Angular momentum transfer from swift electrons to non-spherical nanoparticles within the dipolar approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the angular momentum transfer from a single swift electron to non-spherical metallic nanoparticles, specifically investigating spheroidal and polyhedral (Platonic Solids) shapes. While previous research has predominantly focused on spherical nanoparticles, our work expands the knowledge by exploring various geometries. Employing classical electrodynamics and the small particle limit, we calculate the angular momentum transfer by integrating the spectral density, ensuring causality through Fourier-transform analysis. Our findings demonstrate that prolate spheroidal nanoparticles exhibit a single blueshifted plasmonic resonance, compared to spherical nanoparticles of equivalent volume, resulting in lower angular momentum transfer. Conversely, oblate nanoparticles display two resonances (one blueshifted and one redshifted) resulting in a higher angular momentum transfer than their spherical counterparts. Additionally, Platonic Solids with fewer faces exhibit significant redshifts in plasmonic resonances, leading to higher angular momentum transfer due to edge effects. We also observe resonances and angular momentum transfers with similar characteristics in specific pairs of Platonic Solids, known as duals. These results highlight promising applications, particularly in electron tweezers technology.</description>

      <title>Efficient Measurement of the Bi-photon Spatial Mode Entanglement with Stimulated Emission Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The technique of stimulated emission tomography (SET) provides excellent characterization of SPDC sources of bi-photon states since it increases the average number of photons detected by several orders of magnitude than the traditional coincidence counting method. In a SET experiment, the signal caused by the vacuum fluctuation in SPDC is replaced by a more intense prepared seed with the same mode properties, resulting in an amplification of the corresponding idler. Based on this idea, our experiment uses the difference frequency generation (DFG), a purely classical second-order nonlinear process, to measure the orbital angular momentum (OAM) spectrum of an entangled photon pair produced by a Type-II SPDC crystal. We inject the seed beam at 780 nm with different Laguerre-Gaussian modes together with a pump beam at 405 nm into a Type-II BBO crystal and measure the Laguerre-Gaussian mode distribution of the idler at 842 nm. We observe a strong idler production and good agreement with the theoretical prediction of the OAM spectrum. We expect that this experiment paves the way for the efficient measurement of bi-photon wavefunctions produced by ultra-thin SPDC sources and also the characterization of high-dimensional entangled photon pairs produced in SPDC.</description>

      <title>Gain-Loss-Induced Bipolar Non-Hermitian Skin Effect With Purely Imaginary Eigenenergies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study one-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices characterized by $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric gain and loss, where the real-gap transforms into an imaginary-gap with increasing strength of gain/loss. The energy spectrum, under open boundary conditions, consists of real eigenenergies in the presence of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry, and the corresponding eigenstates are bulk modes. As the gain/loss is increased, $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaks, leading to an increase in the proportion of imaginary eigenenergies and the appearance of bipolar Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). Notably, the NHSE depending on the sign of their imaginary energy components. For Im$(E_{OBC})&gt;(&lt;)0$, the eigenstates localize at the right (left) boundary. These findings not only affirm the validity of our theoretical framework but also showcase the capability of engineered circuit systems to replicate intricate non-Hermitian phenomena. Our study unveils the unique characteristics of gain/loss-induced bipolar NHSE, shedding light on the exotic properties of non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Experimental Evidence of Direct Exchange Interaction Mediating Intramolecular Singlet Fission in Weakly-Coupled Dimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electronic interaction between an optically active singlet state ($S_1S_0$) and a dark state of singlet multiplicity, known as correlated triplet pair ($^1[TT]$), plays a crucial role in the effective transformation from $S_1S_0$ to $^1[TT]$ during intramolecular singlet fission (iSF). This process is understood through mechanisms such as direct exchange coupling and incoherent processes that involve super-exchange coupling through charge-transfer states. However, most insights into these mechanisms are derived from theoretical studies due to the difficulties in obtaining experimental evidence. In this study, we investigate the excited-state interactions between $S_1S_0$ and $^1[TT]$ in spiro-conjugated iSF sensitizers by employing transient two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy. This approach allows us to focus on the early stages of the conversion from $S_1S_0$ to $^1[TT]$. Upon optical excitation, a superposition of $S_1S_0$ and $^1[TT]$ is created, which gradually transitions to favor $^1[TT]$ within the characteristic time frames of iSF. The observed high-order signals indicate circular repopulation dynamic that effectively reinitiates the iSF process from higher energy electronic states. Our findings, supported by semi-quantum-mechanical simulations of the experimental data, suggest the presence of a direct iSF mechanism in the dimers, facilitated by weak non-adiabatic coupling between $S_1S_0$ and $^1[TT]$. This experiment provides new insights into the equilibrium between the two electronic states, a phenomenon previously understood primarily through theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Theory of Multimode Squeezed Light Generation in Lossy Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A unified theoretical approach to describe the properties of multimode squeezed light generated in a lossy medium is presented. This approach is valid for Markovian environments and includes both a model of discrete losses based on the beamsplitter approach and a generalized continuous loss model based on the spatial Langevin equation. For an important class of Gaussian states, we derive master equations for the second-order correlation functions and illustrate their solution for both frequency-independent and frequency-dependent losses. Studying the mode structure, we demonstrate that in a lossy environment no broadband basis without quadrature correlations between the different broadband modes exists. Therefore, various techniques and strategies to introduce broadband modes can be considered. We show that the Mercer expansion and the Williamson decomposition do not provide modes in which the maximal squeezing contained in the system can be measured. In turn, we find a new broadband basis that maximizes squeezing in the lossy system and present an algorithm to construct it.</description>

      <title>Optically-biased Rydberg microwave receiver enabled by hybrid nonlinear interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development in Rydberg-atomic detection of microwave fields has paved the way to a new type of intrinsically calibrated RF measurements. The coupling of Rydberg vapors medium both to microwave and optical fields allows harnessing the merits of all-optical detection, e.g.~weak disruption of the measured field and invulnerability to extremely strong fields, owing to the lack of conventional RF antenna in the detector. The trouble with this approach arises, as the greatest sensitivity is exhibited with the use of additional microwave field acting as a local oscillator, and the measurement can no longer be all-optical. Here we propose a different solution, optical-bias detection, that allows truly all-optical operation, while retaining most of the sensitivity. We tackle the issue of uncorrelated laser phase, emerging in this type of detection, by facilitating separate measurement of the phase spectrum in a nonlinear process and using the results in post-processing. We report the sensitivity of $176\ \mathrm{nV/cm/\sqrt{Hz}}$ and reliable operation up to $3.5\ \mathrm{mV/cm}$ of $13.9\ \mathrm{GHz}$ electric field, while comparing with the state of the art (although not all-optical) method realized in the same setup.</description>

      <title>Quantum phenomena in attosecond science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attosecond science has opened up new frontiers in our understanding of processes happening on the intrinsic timescale of electrons. The ability to manipulate and observe phenomena at the attosecond level has yielded groundbreaking insights into processes such as electron dynamics and the behavior of matter under extreme conditions. This interdisciplinary field bridges various research areas such as quantum optics, quantum chemistry and quantum information science facilitating a cohesive understanding. However, despite many emerging successful applications, the discussion about intrinsic quantum effects has mainly been ignored. In this Perspective, we explore the latest advancements in quantum phenomena within attosecond science, encompassing both experimental and theoretical progress. Specifically, in the context of high-harmonic generation and above-threshold ionization, we focus on discerning genuinely quantum observations and distinguishing them from classical phenomena. Additionally, we illuminate the often overlooked yet significant role of entanglement in attosecond processes, elucidating its influence on experimental outcomes.</description>

      <title>Optical and thermal characterization of a group-III nitride semiconductor membrane by microphotoluminescence spectroscopy and Raman thermometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the simultaneous optical and thermal analysis of a freestanding photonic semiconductor membrane made from wurtzite III-nitride material. By linking micro-photoluminescence ($\mu$PL) spectroscopy with Raman thermometry, we demonstrate how a robust value for the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ can be obtained using only optical, non-invasive means. For this, we consider the balance of different contributions to thermal transport given by, e.g., excitons, charge carriers, and heat carrying phonons. Further complication is given by the fact that this membrane is made from direct bandgap semiconductors, designed to emit light based on an In$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$N ($x=0.15$) quantum well embedded in GaN. To meet these challenges, we designed a novel experimental setup that enables the necessary optical and thermal characterizations in parallel. We perform micro-Raman thermometry, either based on a heating laser that acts as a probe laser (1-laser Raman thermometry), or based on two lasers, providing the heating and the temperature probe separately (2-laser Raman thermometry). For the latter technique, we obtain temperature maps over tens of micrometers with a spatial resolution less than $1\,\mu\text{m}$, yielding $\kappa\,=\,95^{+11}_{-7}\,\frac{\text{W}}{\text{m}\cdot \text{K}}$ for the $\textit{c}$-plane of our $\approx\,250\text{-nm}$-thick membrane at around room temperature, which compares well to our $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations applied to a simplified structure. Based on these calculations, we explain the particular relevance of the temperature probe volume, as quasi-ballistic transport of heat-carrying phonons occurs on length scales beyond the penetration depths of the heating laser and even its focus spot radius. The present work represents a significant step towards non-invasive, highly spatially resolved, and still quantitative thermometry performed on a photonic membrane.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics of femtosecond laser interaction with the central nervous system in zebrafish</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05453v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the photodamage mechanism underlying the highly nonlinear interaction of femtosecond pulses at 1030 nm with the central nervous system tissue in living zebrafish (Danio rerio). Our study identifies two different cavitation regimes. The damage is confined and well-controlled at low repetition rates due to plasma-based ablation and sudden local temperature rise. At high repetition rates, the damage becomes collateral due to plasma-mediated photochemistry and is not influenced by the thermal accumulation of consecutive laser pulses. Furthermore, we investigate and quantify the role of fluorescence labels with linear and nonlinear absorption pathways in optical breakdown. To verify our findings, we examined cell death and cellular responses to tissue damage, including the recruitment of fibroblasts and immune cells at different time points post-irradiation. These findings contribute to advancing the emerging nonlinear optical microscopy techniques and provide a strategy for inducing deep-tissue, precise, and localized injuries using near-infrared femtosecond laser pulses</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) and exceptional points (EPs) are unique singularities of non-Hermitian systems. BICs demonstrate enhancement of the electromagnetic field at the nanoscale, while EPs exhibit high sensitivity to small perturbations. Here, we demonstrate that several BICs can be merged into one EP, forming an EP-BIC. The resulting state inherits properties from both BICs and EP, namely, it does not radiate and shows extremely high sensitivity to perturbations. We validate the developed theory with numerical simulations and demonstrate the formation of second and third-order EP-BICs in stacked dielectric metasurfaces. We also show that the losses of the resulting leaky resonances exhibit an anomalous behavior when the unit cell is broken, which differs from the asymptotics commonly attributed to BICs.</description>

      <title>Geometric Phase-Driven Scattering Evolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the classical topic of scattering manipulation, from a different perspective of controlled excitations and interferences of quasi-normal modes (QNMs). Scattered waves can be expanded as coherent additions of radiations from the QNMs excited, and thus relative amplitudes and phases among them are crucial factors to engineer for scattering shaping. Here relying on the electromagnetic reciprocity, we provide full geometric representations based on the Poincar\'e sphere for those factors, and identify the hidden underlying geometric phases that drive the scattering evolutions. Further synchronous exploitations of the incident polarization-dependent geometric phases and excitation amplitudes enable efficient manipulations of both scattering intensities and polarizations. Continuous geometric phase spanning $2\pi$ is directly manifest through scattering variations, even in the rather elementary configuration of an individual particle scattering waves of varying polarizations. We have essentially merged three vibrant fields of geometric phase, Mie scattering and QNM, and unlocked an extra dimension of geometric phase for scattering manipulations, which will greatly broaden the horizons of many disciplines associated with not only electromagnetic scatterings, but also scatterings of waves in other forms.</description>

Abstract: Numerical simulation of a solar cell can provide various information that can be useful to maximize its power conversion efficiency (PCE). In that respect we carried out a set of numerical simulation using AFORS-HET simulation program. Separately, in order to get a better understanding, the optical absorption in individual layers devices were analyzed. Current-voltage characteristic curve of a reference cell (Cell-A) was used as the starting device. The PCE of the reference device was $8.85\%$ with short circuit current density $J_{sc}$ of 15.43 mA/cm$^{2}$ and fill factor (FF) of $68.3\%$. However, it was noticed that the reference cell had high parasitic optical absorption at the window layer and the device structure was also not optimized. After suitable optimization the PCE of this device (Cell-B2) improves to $11.59\%$ ($J_{sc}$ and FF of 13.0 mA/cm$^{2}$ and $87\%$ respectively). The results show that the effective optical absorption in the active layer can be improved significantly by optimizing the device structure. The short wavelength response can be improved by reducing the parasitic optical absorption by the doped window layer, while its long wavelength response improves by raising effective absorption length of the active layer. Furthermore, its optimum thickness, for the highest possible PCE, is found to be dependent upon the material properties, more importantly on its defect density.</description>

      <title>Efficient Light Propagation Algorithm using Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms can potentially overcome the boundary of computationally hard problems. One of the cornerstones in modern optics is the beam propagation algorithm, facilitating the calculation of how waves with a particular dispersion relation propagate in time and space. This algorithm solves the wave propagation equation by Fourier transformation, multiplication with a transfer function, and subsequent back transformation. This transfer function is determined from the respective dispersion relation, which can often be expanded as a polynomial. In the case of paraxial wave propagation in free space or picosecond pulse propagation, this expansion can be truncated after the quadratic term. The classical solution to the wave propagation requires $\mathcal{O}(N log N)$ computation steps, where $N$ is the number of points into which the wave function is discretized. Here, we show that the propagation can be performed as a quantum algorithm with $\mathcal{O}((log{}N)^2)$ single-controlled phase gates, indicating exponentially reduced computational complexity. We herein demonstrate this quantum beam propagation method (QBPM) and perform such propagation in both one- and two-dimensional systems for the double-slit experiment and Gaussian beam propagation. We highlight the importance of the selection of suitable observables to retain the quantum advantage in the face of the statistical nature of the quantum measurement process, which leads to sampling errors that do not exist in classical solutions.</description>

      <title>Signatures of vacuum birefringence in low-power flying focus pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vacuum birefringence produces a differential phase between orthogonally polarized components of a weak electromagnetic probe in the presence of a strong electromagnetic field. Despite representing a hallmark prediction of quantum electrodynamics, vacuum birefringence remains untested in pure light configurations due to the extremely large electromagnetic fields required for a detectable phase difference. Here, we exploit the programmable focal velocity and extended focal range of a flying focus laser pulse to substantially lower the laser power required for detection of vacuum birefringence. In the proposed scheme, a linearly polarized x-ray probe pulse counter-propagates with respect to a flying focus pulse, whose focus moves at the speed of light in the same direction as the x-ray probe. The peak intensity of the flying focus pulse overlaps the probe over millimeter-scale distances and induces a polarization ellipticity on the order of $10^{-10}$, which lies within the detection sensitivity of existing x-ray polarimeters.</description>

      <title>Design and Optimization of a Graphene-On-Silicon Nitride Integrated Waveguide Dual-Mode Electro-Absorption Modulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the design, simulation and optimization of a graphene-on-silicon nitride (GOSiN) integrated waveguide dual-mode electro-absorption modulator operating with a speed between 21-84 GHz and an energy consumption below 6 pJ/bit. This device individually modulates the TE$_0$ and TE$_1$ modes in a one-arm dual-mode waveguide with modulation depths up to 678 dB/cm and 284 dB/cm, respectively. It has promising applications in Multimode Division Multiplexing (MDM) systems, where single-mode modulation induces high losses and costs. We have started from the design of GOSiN TE$_0$ and TE$_1$ passive low-loss mode filters. Then, applying a gate voltage to graphene, we have combined both filters and shown that the light absorption can be modulated to obtain four logical values in transmission: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0) and (1,1). Our proposed devices can potentially boost the development of efficient MDM systems for ultra-fast on-chip interconnections.</description>

      <title>Free Space Optical Frequency Comparison Over Rapidly Moving Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The comparison of optical reference frequency signals over free-space optical links is limited by the relative motion between local and remote sites. Extreme Doppler shifts experienced in rapidly moving optical links, such as for ground-to-space, prevent the narrow-band detection required to compare or transfer optical frequencies at the highest levels of stability. We demonstrate a system capable of optical frequency comparison in the presence of extreme Doppler shifts, using an electro-optic phase modulator with an actuation bandwidth of 10 GHz, sufficient to enable ground-to-space frequency comparison. This system was demonstrated over a retro-reflected drone link, with a maximum line-of-sight velocity of 15 m/s and Doppler shift of 20 MHz. The best fractional frequency stability obtained was 2E-17 at an integration time of 2 s. These results suggest that optical frequency comparison between rapidly moving targets, as in ground-to-space applications, is possible with further system development.</description>
