      <title>On P\'olya groups of some non-Galois number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove two conjectures proposed by Chabert and Halberstadt concerning P\'olya groups of $S_4$-fields and $D_4$-fields. More generally, the latter will be proved for $D_n$-fields with $n \geq 4$ an even integer. Further, generalizing a result of Zantema, we also prove that the pre-P\'olya group of a non-Galois field of a prime degree, e.g. an $A_5$-field, coincides with its P\'olya group.</description>

      <title>On the Density of Low Lying Zeros of a Large Family of Automorphic $L$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under the generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), Baluyot, Chandee, and Li nearly doubled the range in which the density of low lying zeros predicted by Katz and Sarnak is known to hold for a large family of automorphic $L$-functions with orthogonal symmetry. We generalize their main techniques to the study of higher centered moments of the one-level density of this family, leading to better results on the behavior near the central point. Numerous technical obstructions emerge that are not present in the one-level density. Averaging over the level of the forms and assuming GRH, we prove the density predicted by Katz and Sarnak holds for the $n$-th centered moments for test functions whose Fourier transform is compactly supported in $(-\sigma, \sigma)$ for $\sigma~=~\min\left\{3/2(n-1), 4/(2n-\mathbf{1}_{2\nmid n})\right\}$. For $n=3$, our results improve the previously best known $\sigma=2/3$ to $\sigma=3/4$. We also prove the two-level density agrees with the Katz-Sarnak density conjecture for test functions whose Fourier transform is compactly supported in $\sigma_1 = 3/2$ and $\sigma_2 = 5/6$, respectively, extending the previous best known sum of supports $\sigma_1 + \sigma_2 = 2$. This work is the first evidence of an interesting new phenomenon: by taking different test functions, we are able to extend the range in which the Katz-Sarnak density predictions hold. The techniques we develop can be applied to understanding quantities related to this family containing sums over multiple primes.</description>

      <title>Zeros and $S$-units in sums of terms of recurrence sequences in function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(U_n)_{n\geq 0}$ be a non-degenerate linear recurrence sequence with order at least two defined over a function field and $\mathcal{O}_S^*$ be the set of $S$-units. In this paper, we use a result of Brownawell and Masser to prove effective results related to the Diophantine equations concerning linear recurrence sequences and $S$-units. In particular, we provide a finiteness result for the solutions of the Diophantine equation $U_{n_1} + \cdots + U_{n_r} \in \mathcal{O}_S^*$ in nonnegative integers $n_1, \ldots, n_r$. Furthermore, we study the finiteness result of the Diophantine equation $U_{n_1}^{(1)}+ U_{n_2}^{(2)}+\cdots+U_{n_k}^{(k)} = 0$ in $(n_1, \ldots, n_k)\in \N^k$, where $U_n^{(1)}, \ldots, U_n^{(k)}$ are simple linear recurrence sequences in the function field.</description>

      <title>A simple closed formula for Fourier coefficients of certain eta-quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a list of $83$ holomorphic eta-quotients of integral weight. For each of them we give a simple closed formula for its Fourier coefficients $c(l)$ where $l\equiv1\bmod{m}$ with some fixed $m\mid24$. The proof involves Wohlfahrt's extension of Hecke operators and a dimension formula for spaces of modular forms of general multiplier system.</description>

      <title>Automatic convergence and arithmeticity of modular forms on exceptional groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the space of cuspidal quaternionic modular forms on the groups of type $F_4$ and $E_n$ have a purely algebraic characterization. This characterization involves Fourier coefficients and Fourier-Jacobi expansions of the cuspidal modular forms. The main component of the proof of the algebraic characterization is to show that certain infinite sums, which are potentially the Fourier expansion of a cuspidal modular form, converge absolutely. As a consequence of the algebraic characterization, we deduce that the cuspidal quaternionic modular forms have a basis consisting of forms all of whose Fourier coefficients are algebraic numbers.</description>

      <title>Orbits of Second Order Linear Recurrences over Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $Q$ be the matrix $\displaystyle \begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}$ in $GL_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$ where $\mathbb{F}_q$ is a finite field, and let $G$ be the finite cyclic group generated by $Q$. We consider the action of $G$ on the set $\mathbb{F}_q \times \mathbb{F}_q$. In particular, we study certain relationships between the lengths of the non-trivial orbits of $G$, and their frequency of occurrence. This is done in part by investigating the order of elements of a product in an abelian group when the product has prime power order. For $q$ a prime and $b=1$, the orbits correspond to Fibonacci type linear recurrences modulo $q$ for different initial conditions. We also derive certain conditions under which the roots of the characteristic polynomial of $Q$ are generators of $\mathbb{F}_q^\times$. Examples are included to illustrate the theory.</description>

      <title>Corresponding Abelian Extensions of Integrally Equivalent Number Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrally equivalent number fields admit a natural correspondence of abelian extensions. It is natural to ask which aspects of the extensions' arithmetic are invariant under this bijection. We show that corresponding extensions share many of the same features enjoyed by arithmetically equivalent fields, despite not generally being arithmetically equivalent themselves. In the process of elaborating on this, we observe that arithmetically equivalent fields have the same odd K-groups, and we prove a simple lemma allowing for quick proofs of theorems characterizing Kronecker and weak Kronecker equivalence. We also extend a group cohomological result of Arapura et. al. and conclude with a geometric application.</description>

      <title>Supercongruences via Beukers' method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, using modular forms F. Beukers posed a unified method that can deal with a large number of supercongruences involving binomial coefficients and Ap\'ery-like numbers. In this paper, we use Beukers' method to prove some conjectures of the first author concerning the congruences for $$\sum_{k=0}^{(p-1)/2}\frac{\binom{2k}k^3}{m^k}, \quad\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\frac{\binom{2k}k^2\binom{4k}{2k}}{m^k}, \quad \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\frac{\binom{2k}k\binom{3k}k\binom{6k}{3k}}{m^k}, \quad \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\frac{V_k}{m^k} \quad\hbox{and}\quad \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\frac{T_k}{m^k} $$ modulo $p^3$, where $p&gt;3$ is a prime, $m$ is an integer not divisible by $p$, $V_n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{2k}k^2\binom{2n-2k}{n-k}^2$ and $T_n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom nk^2\binom{2k}n^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two-parameter generalizations of Hecke-Appell type expansions for the generating functions of unimodal and special unimodal sequences. We then determine their explicit representations which involve mixed false theta functions. These results complement recent striking work of Mortenson and Zwegers on the mixed mock modularity of the generalized $U$-function due to Hikami and Lovejoy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we report on the conjectural identification of paramodular forms from Calabi-Yau motives of Hodge type (1, 1, 1, 1) of moderately low conductor. We calculate Euler factors from Calabi-Yau operators from the AESZ database by the method described in P. Candelas, X. dela Ossa and D. van Straten, seek a fit with the tables provided by E. Assaf, W. Ladd, G. Rama, G. Tornaria, and J. Voight and for consistency check the approximate functional equation for the Euler product for primes &lt; 1000 numerically, using the PARI implementation of T. Dokchitser's method.</description>

      <title>The Number of Subgroups and Cyclic Subgroups of Finite Group and Its Application by GAP Program</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach for calculating the set of subgroups of a finite group, focusing on cyclic subgroups, and using it to establish the quantity of all subgroups in the direct product of two groups. Specifically, we consider the Dicyclic group of order \(4n\) and the Cyclic group of order \(p\). Let \(\tau(n)\) denote the total number of divisors of \(n\), and \(\sigma(n)\) denote the summation of all divisors of \(n\). Using these functions, we derive a formula for the number of subgroups in the group \(T_{4n} \times C_p\). We then use the computer program GAP to find all \(T_{4n} \times C_p\) with exactly \(|T_{4n} \times C_p| - t\) cyclic subgroups for \(t \geq 1\).</description>

      <title>On sets with missing differences in compact abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A much-studied problem posed by Motzkin asks to determine, given a finite set $D$ of integers, the so-called Motzkin density of $D$, i.e., the supremum of upper densities of sets of integers whose difference set avoids $D$. We study the natural analogue of this problem in compact abelian groups. Using ergodic-theoretic tools, this is shown to be equivalent to the following discrete problem: given a lattice $\Lambda\subset \mathbb{Z}^r$, letting $D$ be the image in $\mathbb{Z}^r/\Lambda$ of the standard basis, determine the Motzkin density of $D$ in $\mathbb{Z}^r/\Lambda$. We study in particular the periodicity question: is there a periodic $D$-avoiding set of maximal density? The Greenfeld--Tao counterexample to the periodic tiling conjecture implies that the answer can be negative. On the other hand, we prove that the answer is positive in several cases, including the case rank$(\Lambda)=1$ (in which we give a formula for the Motzkin density), the case rank$(\Lambda)=r-1$, and hence also the case $r\leq 3$.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of the Humbert surface of square discriminant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For every positive integer $N$ we determine the Enriques--Kodaira type of the Humbert surface of discriminant $N^2$ which parametrises principally polarised abelian surfaces that are $(N,N)$-isogenous to a product of elliptic curves. A key step in the proof is to analyse the fixed point locus of a Fricke-like involution on the Hilbert modular surface of discriminant $N^2$ which was studied by Hermann and by Kani and Schanz. To this end, we construct certain "diagonal" Hirzebruch--Zagier divisors which are fixed by this involution. In our analysis we obtain a genus formula for these divisors, which includes the case of modular curves associated to (any) extended Cartan subgroup of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})$ and which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A theory for the zeros of Riemann $\zeta$ and other $L$-functions (updated)</title>

      <description>arXiv:1407.4358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In these lectures we first review the important properties of the Riemann $\zeta$-function that are necessary to understand the nature and importance of the Riemann hypothesis (RH). In particular this first part describes the analytic continuation, the functional equation, trivial zeros, the Euler product formula, Riemann's main result relating the zeros on the critical strip to the distribution of primes, the exact counting formula for the number of zeros on the strip $N(T)$, and the GUE statistics of the zeros on the critical line. We then turn to presenting some new results obtained in the past year and describe several strategies towards proving the RH. First we describe an electrostatic analogy and argue that if the electric potential along the line $\Re (z) =1$ is a regular alternating function, the RH would follow. The main new result is that the zeros on the critical line are in one-to-one correspondence with the zeros of the cosine function, and this leads to a transcendental equation for the $n$-th zero on the critical line that depends only on $n$. If there is a unique solution to this equation for every $n$, denoting $N_0 (T)$ the number of zeros on the critical line, then $N_0(T) = N(T)$, i.e. all zeros are on the critical line. These results are generalized to two infinite classes of functions, Dirichlet $L$-functions and $L$-functions based on modular forms. We present extensive numerical analysis of the solutions of these equations. We apply these methods to the Davenport-Heilbronn $L$-function, which is known to have zeros off of the line, and explain why the RH fails in this case. We also present a new approximation to the $\zeta$-function that is analogous to the Stirling approximation to the $\Gamma$-function.
  In this updated version we added references to subsequent publications that made progress on open questions posed in the previous version from 10 years ago.</description>

      <title>Tropical formulae for summation over a part of SL(2, Z)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02089</link>
      <description>arXiv:1711.02089v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f(a,b,c,d)=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}+\sqrt{c^2+d^2}-\sqrt{(a+c)^2+(b+d)^2}$, let $(a,b,c,d)$ stand for $a,b,c,d\in\mathbb Z_{\geq 0}$ such that $ad-bc=1$. Define \begin{equation} \label{eq_main} F(s) = \sum_{(a,b,c,d)} f(a,b,c,d)^s. \end{equation} In other words, we consider the sum of the powers of the triangle inequality defects for the lattice parallelograms (in the first quadrant) of area one.
  We prove that $F(s)$ converges when $s&gt;1$ and diverges at $s=1/2$. (This papers differs from its published version: Fedor Petrov showed us how to easily prove that $F(s)$ converges for $s&gt;2/3$ and diverges for $s\leq 2/3$, see below.) We also prove $$\sum\limits_{\substack{(a,b,c,d), 1\leq a\leq b, 1\leq c\leq d}} \frac{1}{(a+b)^2(c+d)^2(a+b+c+d)^2} = 1/24,$$ and show a general method to obtain such formulae. The method comes from the consideration of the tropical analogue of the caustic curves, whose moduli give a complete set of continuous invariants on the space of convex domains.</description>

      <title>On Algebraic Conditions for the Non-Vanishing of Linear Forms in Jacobi Theta-Constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.06513</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.06513v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elsner, Luca and Tachiya proved in 2019 that the values of the Jacobi-theta constants $\theta_3(m\tau)$ and $\theta_3(n\tau)$ are algebraically independent over $\mathbb{Q}$ for distinct integers $m,n$ under some conditions on $\tau$. On the other hand, in 2018 Elsner and Tachiya also proved that three values $\theta_3(m\tau),\theta_3(n\tau)$ and $\theta_3(\ell \tau)$ are algebraically dependent over $\mathbb{Q}$. In this article we prove the non-vanishing of linear forms in $\theta_3(m\tau)$, $\theta_3(n\tau)$ and $\theta_3(\ell \tau)$ under various conditions on $m,n,\ell$, and $\tau$. Among other things we prove that for odd and distinct positive integers $m,n&gt;3$ the three numbers $\theta_3(\tau)$, $\theta_3(m\tau)$ and $\theta_3(n \tau)$ are linearly independent over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ when $\tau$ is an algebraic number of some degree greater or equal to 3. In some sense this fills the gap between the above-mentioned former results on theta constants. A theorem on the linear independence over $\mathbb{C(\tau)}$ of the functions $\theta_3(a_1 \tau),\ldots,\theta_3(a_m \tau)$ for distinct positive rational numbers $a_1, \ldots a_m$ is also established.</description>

      <title>On the First Cohomology of Local Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.03299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The groups of units $U^i_L$ of a local field $L$ play an important role in algebraic number theory, especially in class field theoretic topics. Therefore, it is interesting to study these groups from a cohomological point of view. In this article, we study and compute the first cohomology of $U_L^1$, $U^2_L$ and $U^3_L$ under certain mild hypotheses, and discuss some results about general $U^i_L$'s.</description>

Abstract: Let $\varepsilon &gt;0$. Let $f$ be a Steinhaus or Rademacher random multiplicative function. We prove that we have almost surely, as $x \to +\infty$,
  $$
  \sum_{n \leqslant x} f(n) \ll \sqrt{x} (\log_2 x)^{\frac{3}{4}+ \varepsilon}.

      <title>Almost sure upper bound for a model problem for multiplicative chaos in number theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to prove a new sure upper bound in a setting that can be thought of as a simplified function field analogue. This result is comparable to a recent result of the author concerning almost sure upper bound of random multiplicative functions. Having a simpler quantity allows us to make the proof more accessible.</description>

      <title>Explicit estimates for the sum $\sum_{k=0}^{n} k! {n\choose k}^2 (-1)^{k}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11468v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are interested in finding an explicit estimate to the binomial sum $Q_n(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{n} k! {n\choose k}^2 (-x)^{k}$ at $x=1$ for $n=0,1,2,\ldots$. Despite of its own interest the polynomial $Q_n(x)$ is important as the denominator in the Pad\'e identity of the Euler's factorial series $E(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} k! x^k$ as well as its close connection to a classical Laguerre polynomial $L_n(x) = \frac{1}{n!} e^x \left(\frac{d}{dx}\right)^n (e^{-x}x^n)$. Our main result is the explicit bound $$\left|L_n(1)-\sqrt{\frac{e}{\pi}}\cdot \frac{\cos (2\sqrt{n}-\frac{\pi}{4})}{n^{1/4}} +\frac{17}{48}\sqrt{\frac{e}{\pi}}\frac{\sin(2\sqrt{n}-\frac{\pi}{4})}{n^{3/4}}\right|&lt;\frac{0.51}{n}$$ for all $n=0,1,2,\ldots$, which replaces the Fej\'er's asymptotic formula from 1909. As a corollary of this, one also gets a new proof for the bound $|Q_{n}(1)| \le n!$, and even more.</description>

      <title>On an Erd\H{o}s-type conjecture on $\mathbb{F}_2[x]$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1970, R. B. Crittenden and C. L. Vanden Eynden\cite{CV1970} proved that any system of $n$ congruence classes covering positive integers $1,2,... 2^n$ covers all integers, which was originally conjectured by P. Erd\H{o}s\cite{Erdos1962} in 1962, who first proved a weaker version of this conjecture, replacing $2^n$ with $C(n)$, where $C(n)$ is a constant determined by $n$. The constant $2^n$ here cannot be improved, since one can find $n$ congruences covering any given $2^n$ consecutive integers with any one given exception among them exactly. In 2019, P. Balister, B. Bollob\'as, R. Morris, J. Sahasrabudhe and M. Tiba\cite{BBST2020} gave a simpler proof of this conjecture also by the proof by contradiction,including constructing polymials using parameters from the counter-example congruences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each prime number $\ell$ and for each imaginary quadratic order of class number one or two, we determine all the possible $\ell$-adic Galois representations that occur for any elliptic curve with complex multiplication by such an order over its minimal field of definition, and then we determine all the isomorphism classes of elliptic curves that have a prescribed $\ell$-adic Galois representation.</description>

      <title>Toward Shimurian analogs of Barsotti-Tate groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02346v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We first recall Grothendieck's notion of n-truncated Barsotti-Tate group. Such groups form an algebraic stack over the integers. The problem is to give an illuminating description of its reductions modulo powers of p. A related problem is to construct analogs of these reductions related to general Shimura varieties with good reduction at p. We discuss some conjectures on this subject based on the theory of prismatic cohomology.</description>

      <title>Quasi-\'etale covers of Du Val del Pezzo surfaces and Zariski dense exceptional sets in Manin's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the first examples of singular del Pezzo surfaces with Zariski dense exceptional sets in Manin's conjecture, varying in degrees $1, 2$ and $3$. These examples arise from quasi-\'etale covers with higher $b$-invariants. We classify all quasi-\'etale covers of Du Val del Pezzo surfaces up to singularity types, extending earlier works of Miyanishi-Zhang. Then, we identify all potential examples by studying group actions on the pseudo-effective cones, and show that no such example exists in degree $\geq4$. Finally, we prove that Manin's conjecture with proper closed exceptional sets fails for specific examples, for which we also determine the conjectural exceptional set proposed by Lehmann-Sengupta-Tanimoto.</description>
