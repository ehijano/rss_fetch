      <title>Hunting for Neutrino Texture Zeros with Muon and Tau Flavor Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the minimal type II seesaw mechanism generating the Majorana neutrino mass matrix $M^{\nu}$, under the assumption that two entries of $M^{\nu}$ vanish. Such flavor structures are known as two-zero textures. Processes with charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV), absent in the Standard Model (SM), can have sizable rates in this framework and are directly linked to the flavor structure of $M^{\nu}$. For each allowed two-zero texture, we quantify the predicted correlations among various CLFV observables using current neutrino oscillation data and show that they lead to distinctive patterns of CLFV processes that could be discriminated between at running and upcoming experiments. In addition, together with information from colliders, the sensitivity of these correlations to renormalization group (RG) effects could shed light on the potentially ultra-high scale where new dynamics (e.g. some underlying flavor symmetry) give rise to the two-zero texture. Furthermore, we find that certain zero textures, although not third-generation specific, can suppress $\mu\to e$ transitions while allowing the rate of the process $\tau\to \bar\mu ee$ to be within the future experimental sensitivity, even when the RG evolution is taken into account. The lowest possible cut-off scale of the effective theory, constructed by treating the two-zero flavor structure of $M^{\nu}$ as a CLFV spurion, can therefore reach $5-6$ TeV. Our results provide further motivation for searches for $\tau$ CLFV at Belle II, as probes of new physics complementary to MEG II and the upcoming Mu3e, COMET, and Mu2e experiments, as well as for collider searches for doubly charged scalar bosons.</description>

      <title>Isospin-breaking in the $\pi \pi$ scattering amplitude I: Effects due to the pion mass difference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the first of a series of papers devoted to a detailed analysis of isospin-breaking effects in the $\pi \pi$ scattering amplitude and the vector form factor of the pion. Isospin breaking originates from the mass difference between up and down quarks and from electromagnetic effects. The latter can be further split into effects due to the pion-mass difference and the remaining virtual and real photonic effects. In this paper, we derive the modifications to the Roy equations for $\pi\pi$ scattering due to the mass difference between the charged and the neutral pion. We solve the equations numerically after matching them to the chiral representation of the $\pi \pi$ scattering amplitude evaluated in the same approximation, which is also provided. Numerical results are presented and discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Design of a Six-band, 2.4-Octave (80--420 GHz) Hierarchically Summed Phased-Array Slot-Dipole Antenna Array for NEW-MUSIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Next-generation Extended Wavelength Multi-band Sub/millimeter Inductance Camera (NEW-MUSIC), located on the Leighton Chajnantor Telescope (LCT), will be the first six-band trans-millimeter wave polarimeter. This paper proposes a broadband, hierarchical phased-array antenna with integrated band-defining filters necessary to realize NEW-MUSIC. It covers a spectral bandwidth of 2.4 octaves from 80~GHz to 420~GHz, a frequency range ideal for studying trans-millimeter emission from a range of time-domain sources, using the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects to study hot plasmas in galaxy clusters and galaxies, and to observe dusty sources, from star-forming regions in our galaxy to high-redshift dusty, star-forming galaxies. To achieve these goals, three groups of superconducting lumped-element on-chip low-pass/band-pass filter-banks were designed to hierarchically sum the superconducting, broadband, non-resonant, slot-dipole antenna arrays and band-pass filter the trans-mm light before outputting it on microstripline to detectors (KIDs in the case of NEW-MUSIC).</description>

      <title>Learning to Validate Generative Models: a Goodness-of-Fit Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models are increasingly central to scientific workflows, yet their systematic use and interpretation require a proper understanding of their limitations through rigorous validation. Classic approaches struggle with scalability, statistical power, or interpretability when applied to high-dimensional data, making it difficult to certify the reliability of these models in realistic, high-dimensional scientific settings. Here, we propose the use of the New Physics Learning Machine (NPLM), a learning based approach to goodness-of-fit testing inspired by the Neyman-Pearson construction, to test generative networks trained on high-dimensional scientific data. We demonstrate the performance of NPLM for validation in two benchmark cases: generative models trained on mixtures of Gaussian models with increasing dimensionality, and a public end-to-end generator for the Large Hadron Collider called FlashSim, trained on jet data, typical in the field of high-energy physics. We demonstrate that the NPLM can serve as a powerful validation method while also providing a means to diagnose sub-optimally modeled regions of the data.</description>

      <title>Impact of reactor antineutrinos on the neutrino floor in low-mass WIMP-like dark matter searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sensitivity of conventional direct dark matter searches for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) is ultimately limited by coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS), which produces nuclear recoils indistinguishable from WIMP signals and defines the so-called neutrino floor. While the effects of solar, geoneutrino, diffuse supernova, and atmospheric neutrinos have been extensively studied in this context, the contribution from reactor antineutrinos has received comparatively little attention. We present the first systematic evaluation of how reactor antineutrino fluxes, modeled as a function of reactor-detector distance, modify the neutrino floor for low-mass WIMP searches using SuperCDMS-like high-voltage germanium detectors. Both discovery-limit and opacity-based formulations of the neutrino floor are examined under consistent assumptions. We find that proximity to gigawatt-scale reactors within about 10 km can raise the neutrino floor by up to a few orders of magnitude, significantly reducing the sensitivity to sub-10 GeV/c^2 dark matter. Beyond roughly 100 km, the reactor contribution becomes negligible. These results establish reactor proximity as a critical site-dependent parameter in defining the neutrino floor and provide guidance for optimizing the design and siting of future low-threshold dark matter experiments.</description>

      <title>Explaining higher-order correlations between elliptic and triangular flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ALICE Collaboration has analyzed a number of cumulants mixing elliptic flow ($v_2$) and triangular flow ($v_3$), involving up to $8$ particles, in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC. We unravel an unexpected simplicity in these complex mathematical quantities for collisions at fixed impact parameter. We show that as one increases the order in $v_2$, for a given order in $v_3$, the changes in the cumulants are solely determined by the mean elliptic flow in the reaction plane, which originates from the almond-shaped geometry of the overlap area between the colliding nuclei. We derive simple analytic relations between cumulants of different orders on this basis. Some of these relations are in reasonable agreement with existing data. We postulate that agreement will be much improved if the analysis is repeated with a finer centrality binning and a larger pseudorapidity acceptance.</description>

      <title>Compton Scattering Total Cross Section at Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order and Resummation of Leading Logarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compton scattering is a fundamental process in QED with broad applications, yet its theoretical description at high energies is challenged by substantial next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections arising from double-logarithmic enhancements. To address this, we report the first calculation of the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) total cross section with full electron mass dependence. Our analysis reveals that the NNLO correction, albeit still containing double logarithms, is numerically small due to a suppressing prefactor. By identifying the origin of these logarithms in a kinematic regime featuring a Glauber electron exchange, we successfully resum the leading logarithmic series to all orders, obtaining a compact result in terms of a modified Bessel function. The all-order structure reveals a suppression mechanism, with double factorial terms in the denominator, which explains the negligible nature of higher-order contributions. The combination of our NNLO calculation and all-orders resummation delivers a reliable and precise prediction, poised to serve the needs of high-precision experiments in the foreseeable future.</description>

      <title>A Methodology for Developing Foundational Transformer Models in Collider Physics Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a methodology for training foundational transformer models capable of processing collider data with diverse kinematic signatures. Our universal foundation model is designed for simultaneous analysis of all processes involving from one to four top-quarks production with their corresponding background processes. The approach employs multi-task pre-training on combined datasets of simulated events, enabling the model to capture the full spectrum of interaction physics while extracting universal patterns across different final states prior to task-specific fine-tuning. This unified architecture eliminates the need for separate analysis frameworks for different final signatures and specific tasks. The transformer-based pre-training strategy explicitly preserves unique interaction patterns through adaptive attention mechanisms while establishing cross-process correlations. We plan to demonstrate how this architecture maintains sensitivity to rare high-multiplicity topologies (3t and 4t) without compromising performance on conventional channels ($t\bar{t}$, $tX$, $t\bar{t}H$), effectively bridging the gap between disparate analysis paradigms in collider physics.</description>

      <title>An ultrafast plenoptic-camera system for high-resolution 3D particle tracking in unsegmented scintillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09442v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detectors deployed in high-resolution neutrino experiments, particle calorimetry, or dark matter candidate searches require dense and massive active materials and, in some cases, extremely fine segmentation. This is essential for achieving precise three-dimensional tracking of the interaction products and enabling accurate particle-flow reconstruction. Organic scintillator detectors, for example, in the form of scintillating fibres, offer sub-millimetre spatial and sub-nanosecond temporal resolution. However, such systems introduce significant challenges in construction and demand a large number of readout electronics channels, leading to extremely high costs that are difficult to mitigate. In this article, we propose a paradigm shift in the detection of elementary particles that leads to ultrafast three-dimensional high-resolution imaging in large volumes of unsegmented scintillator. The key enabling technologies are plenoptic systems and time-resolving single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array imaging sensors. Together, they allow us, for the first time ever with a plenoptic camera, the reconstruction of the origin of single photons in the scintillator, thereby facilitating an event-by-event analysis. A case study focused on neutrino detection demonstrates the unique potential of this approach, achieving full event reconstruction with a spatial resolution on the order of two hundred micrometres. This work paves the way for a new class of particle scintillator-based detectors, whose capabilities should be further enhanced through future developments and expanded to Cherenkov light detection and calorimetry at collider neutrino experiments, searches for neutrinoless double beta decay, as well as applications such as medical imaging and fast neutron detection.</description>

      <title>Search for Accelerator-Produced Sub-GeV Dark Matter with the NOvA Near Detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The NuMI facility at Fermilab produces a high-intensity beam of muon neutrinos and antineutrinos, designed to study neutrino oscillations. This beam may also be a source of dark matter particles produced through a light mediator. We search for dark matter particles with masses between 1 and 200 MeV that interact with Standard Model particles via a vector portal, producing forward-scattered single-electron events in the NOvA near detector. We set limits on the dark-visible coupling based on an exposure of 2.55x10^21 protons of 120 GeV energy on the NuMI target. For the dark matter mass range 10-20 MeV, this analysis sets the tightest constraints on the coupling to date.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Born Cross Sections and Effective Form Factors of $e^+e^-\to \Omega^{-}\bar{\Omega}^{+}$ from$\sqrt{s}$ = 3.7 to 4.7 GeV</title>

Abstract: Using $e^+e^-$ collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 22.7 fb$^{-1}$, collected at center-of-mass energies between 3.7 and 4.7 GeV with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII storage ring, we measure the energy-dependent Born cross sections of $e^+e^-\to \Omega^{-}\bar{\Omega}^+$ and the effective form factors of the $\Omega^-$ baryon. The analysis employs a single baryon tagging method, and the results are consistent with theoretical predictions, providing critical constraints on the electromagnetic structure of the $\Omega^-$ hyperon. No significant signal of charmonium or charmonium-like states decaying to $\Omega^{-}\bar{\Omega}^+$ is observed in the investigated energy range.</description>

      <title>A simple tool for weighted averaging of inconsistent data sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The weighted average of inconsistent data is a common and tedious problem that many scientists have encountered. The standard weighted average is not recommended for these cases, and various alternative methods have been proposed. These approaches vary in suitability depending on the nature of the data, which can make selecting the appropriate method difficult without expertise in metrology or statistics. For the analysis of simple data sets presenting inconsistencies, we discuss the method proposed by Sivia in 1996 based on Bayesian statistics. This choice has the intention of maintaining generality while minimising the number of assumptions. In this approach, the uncertainty associated with each input value is considered to be just a lower bound of the true unknown uncertainty. The resulting likelihood function is no longer Gaussian but has smoothly decreasing wings, which allows for a better treatment of scattered data and outliers. To demonstrate the robustness and the generality of the method, we apply it to a series of critical data sets: simulations, CODATA recommended values of the Newtonian gravitational constant, and some particle properties from the Particle Data Group, including the proton charge radius. A freely available Python library is also provided for a simple implementation of the proposed averaging method.</description>

      <title>QCD analysis of $B \to \pi\pi$ form factors and the $\vert V_{ub} \vert$ extraction from $B_{l4}$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $B_{l4}$ decays offer an independent method for determining the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $\vert V_{ub} \vert$, with a QCD analysis of the underlying $B \to \pi\pi$ form factors serving as a crucial component. We present a comprehensive QCD analysis of the $B \to \pi\pi$ form factors within the framework of light-cone sum rules, employing two-pion light-cone distribution amplitudes. For the first time, we derive the twist-three $2\pi$DAs explicitly by exploiting the conformal symmetry of massless QCD. This breakthrough enables the first systematic calculation of higher-power corrections to the $B \to \pi\pi$-type transitions. Leveraging the recently measured partial decay fractions of $B^+ \to \pi^+\pi^- l^+ \nu_l$ by the Belle detector, we obtain $\vert V_{ub} \vert = \left( 4.27 \pm 0.49\vert_{\rm data} \pm 0.55\vert_{\rm LCSRs} \right) \times 10^{-3}$ within the dominant region of the $\rho$ resonance. We clarify that the relatively small value of $\vert V_{ub} \vert$ extracted from $B \to \rho l \nu$, when compared to the golden channel $B \to \pi l\nu$, arises due to the finite width and nonresonant effects. We anticipate future measurements of purely isovector and isoscalar $B_{l4}$ decays, which will aid in reducing uncertainties by enhancing our understanding of the $\pi\pi$ phase shifts in the two-pion distribution amplitudes through heavy flavor decays.</description>

      <title>Bayesian network 3D event reconstruction in the Cygno optical TPC for dark matter direct detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The CYGNO experiment is developing a high-resolution gaseous Time Projection Chamber with optical readout for directional dark matter searches. The detector uses a helium-tetrafluoromethane (He:CF$_4$ 60:40) gas mixture at atmospheric pressure and a triple Gas Electron Multiplier amplification stage, coupled with a scientific camera for high-resolution 2D imaging and fast photomultipliers for time-resolved scintillation light detection. This setup enables 3D event reconstruction: photomultipliers signals provide depth information, while the camera delivers high-precision transverse resolution. In this work, we present a Bayesian Network-based algorithm designed to reconstruct the events using only the photomultipliers signals, yielding a full 3D description of the particle trajectories. The algorithm models the light collection process probabilistically and estimates spatial and intensity parameters on the Gas Electron Multiplier plane, where light emission occurs. It is implemented within the Bayesian Analysis Toolkit and uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling for posterior inference. Validation using data from the CYGNO LIME prototype shows accurate reconstruction of localized and extended tracks. Results demonstrate that the Bayesian approach enables robust 3D description and, when combined with camera data, further improves the precision of track reconstruction. This methodology represents a significant step forward in directional dark matter detection, enhancing the identification of nuclear recoil tracks with high spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>SMEFT ATLAS: The Landscape Beyond the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) based on the unbroken gauge group $\text{SU(3)}_C\otimes\text{SU(2)}_L\otimes\text{U(1)}_Y$ and containing only particles of the Standard Model (SM) has developed in the last decade to a mature field. It is the framework to be used in the energy gap from scales sufficiently higher than the electroweak scale up to the lowest energy scale at which new particles show up. We summarize the present status of this theory with a particular emphasize on its role in the indirect search for new physics (NP). While flavour physics of both quarks and leptons is the main topic of our review, we also discuss electric dipole moments, anomalous magnetic moments $(g-2)_{\mu,e}$, $Z$-pole observables, Higgs observables and high-$p_T$ scattering processes within the SMEFT. We group the observables into ten classes and list for each class the most relevant operators and the corresponding renormalization group equations (RGEs). We exhibit the correlations between different classes implied both by the operator mixing and the $\text{SU(2)}_L$ gauge symmetry. Our main goal is to provide an insight into the complicated operator structure of this framework which hopefully will facilitate the identification of valid ultraviolet completions behind possible anomalies observed in future data. Numerous colourful charts, and 85 tables, while representing rather complicated RG evolution from the NP scale down to the electroweak scale, beautify the involved SMEFT landscape. Over 950 references to the literature underline the importance and the popularity of this field. We discuss both top-down and bottom-up approaches as well as their interplay. This allows us eventually to present an atlas of different landscapes beyond the SM that includes heavy gauge bosons and scalars, vector-like quarks and leptons and leptoquarks.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Point Set Transformers for Segmentation of Multiple View Particle Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: NOvA is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment that detects neutrino particles from the NuMI beam at Fermilab. Before data from this experiment can be used in analyses, raw hits in the detector must be matched to their source particles, and the type of each particle must be identified. This task has commonly been done using a mix of traditional clustering approaches and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Due to the construction of the detector, the data is presented as two sparse 2D images: an XZ and a YZ view of the detector, rather than a 3D representation. We propose a point set neural network that operates on the sparse matrices with an operation that mixes information from both views. Our model uses less than 10% of the memory required using previous methods while achieving a 96.8% AUC score, a higher score than obtained when both views are processed independently (85.4%).</description>
