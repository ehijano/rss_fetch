      <title>Khintchine inequalities, trace monoids and Tur\'an-type problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove scalar and operator-valued Khintchine inequalities for mixtures of free and tensor-independent semicircle variables, interpolating between classical and free Khintchine-type inequalities. Specifically, we characterize the norm of sums of $G$-independent semicircle variables in terms of the spectral radius of the Cayley graph associated with the trace monoid determined by the graph $G$. Our approach relies on a precise correspondence between closed paths in trace monoids and the norms of such operator sums. This correspondence uncovers connections between non-commutative probability, combinatorial group theory, and extremal graph theory. In particular, we formulate Tur\'an-type extremal problems that govern maximal norm growth under classical commutation constraints, and identify the extremal configurations. We hope that the methods and connections developed here will be useful in the study of non-commutative structures constrained by combinatorial symmetries.</description>

      <title>Equivariant $KK$-theory of Bernoulli shifts on $C^*$-algebras with approximately inner flip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00061v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on Enders--Schemeitat--Tikuisis' classification, we show that a separable $C^*$-algebra $A$ with approximately inner flip in the UCT class is $K$-theoretically self-absorbing if and only if for every finite group $G$, the Bernoulli shift on $A^{\otimes G}$ is $KK^G$-equivalent to the trivial action. This in particular applies to UHF-algebras of infinite type and computes the $K$-theory of the associated crossed product. In the latter case, we moreover recover that the Bernoulli shift of $G$ absorbs the trivial action up to conjugacy. For more general amenable groups $G$, we develop $K$-theory formulas for Bernoulli shifts on UHF-absorbing $C^*$-algebras, and establish $KK^G$-triviality for Bernoulli shifts on strongly self-absorbing $C^*$-algebras satisfying the UCT.</description>

      <title>Structural properties of reduced $C^*$-algebras associated with higher-rank lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first examples of higher-rank lattices whose reduced $C^{*}$-algebras satisfy strict comparison, stable rank one, selflessness, uniqueness of embeddings of the Jiang--Su algebra, and allow explicit computations of the Cuntz semigroup. This resolves a question raised in recent groundbreaking work of Amrutam, Gao, Kunnawalkam Elayavalli, and Patchell, in which they exhibited a large class of finitely generated non-amenable groups satisfying these properties. Our proof relies on quantitative estimates in projective dynamics, crucially using the exponential mixing for diagonalizable flows. As a result, we obtain an effective mixed-identity-freeness property, which, combined with V. Lafforgue's rapid decay theorem, yields the desired conclusions.</description>

      <title>One-ended spanning subforests and treeability of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.07431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that several new classes of groups are measure strongly treeable. In particular, finitely generated groups admitting planar Cayley graphs, elementarily free groups, and the group of isometries of the hyperbolic plane and all its closed subgroups. This provides the first examples of one-ended nonamenable groups which are measure strongly treeable. In higher dimensions, we also prove a dichotomy that the fundamental group of a closed aspherical $3$-manifold is either amenable or has strong ergodic dimension $2$. Our main technical tool is a method for finding measurable treeings of Borel planar graphs by constructing one-ended spanning subforests in their planar dual. Our techniques for constructing one-ended spanning subforests also give a complete classification of the locally finite pmp graphs which admit Borel a.e.\ one-ended spanning subforests.</description>

      <title>On Modulation and Translation Invariant Operators and the Heisenberg Module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09119v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate spaces of operators which are invariant under translations or modulations by lattices in phase space. The natural connection to the Heisenberg module is considered, giving results on the characterisation of such operators as limits of finite--rank operators. Discrete representations of these operators in terms of elementary objects and the composition calculus are given. Different quantisation schemes are discussed with respect to the results.</description>

      <title>Frobenius subalgebra lattices in tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19876v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies Frobenius subalgebra posets within abelian monoidal categories--refined by rigidity invariance--and shows that under general conditions--satisfied in all semisimple tensor categories--these posets are lattices. Based on this, we extend Watatani's finiteness theorem for intermediate subfactors by proving that, under a weak positivity assumption--met by all semisimple tensor categories over the complex field--and a compatibility condition--fulfilled by all pivotal ones--the lattices arising from connected Frobenius algebras are finite. We also derive a non-semisimple version via semisimplification. Our approach relies on the concept of a formal angle, and the extension of key results--such as the planar algebraic exchange relation and Landau's theorems--to linear monoidal categories.
  Major applications of our findings include a stronger version of the Ino-Watatani result: we show that the finiteness of intermediate C*-algebras holds in a finite-index unital irreducible inclusion of C*-algebras without requiring the simple assumption. Moreover, for a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra H, we demonstrate that H* contains a finite number of Frobenius subalgebra objects in Rep(H). Finally, we explore a range of applications, including abstract spin chains, vertex operator algebras, and speculations on quantum arithmetic involving the generalization of Ore's theorem, Euler's totient and sigma functions, and RH.</description>

      <title>Geometric Banach property (T) for metric spaces via Banach representations of Roe algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a notion of geometric Banach property (T) for metric spaces, which jointly generalizes Banach property (T) for groups and geometric property (T) for metric spaces. Our framework is achieved by Banach representations of Roe algebras of metric spaces. We show that geometric Banach property (T) is a coarse geometric invariant, and it is equivalent to the existence of the Kazhdan projections in the Banach-Roe algebras. Further, we study the implications of this property for sequences of finite Cayley graphs, establishing two key results: 1. geometric Banach property (T) of such sequences implies Banach property (T) for their limit groups; 2. while the Banach coarse fixed point property implies geometric Banach property (T), the converse fails. Additionally, we provide a geometric characterization of V. Lafforgue's strong Banach property (T) for a residually finite group in terms of geometric Banach property (T) of its box spaces.</description>
