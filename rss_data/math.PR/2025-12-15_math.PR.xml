      <title>Stochastic limits of Quantum repeated measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum systems perturbed by noise in the form of repeated interactions between the system and the environment. As the number of interactions (aka time steps) tends to infinity, we show, following the works by Pellegrini, that this system converges to the solution of a Volterra stochastic differential equation. This development sets interesting future research paths at the intersection of quantum algorithms, stochastic differential equations, weak convergence and large deviations.</description>

      <title>Stochastics of shapes and Kunita flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic processes of evolving shapes are used in applications including evolutionary biology, where morphology changes stochastically as a function of evolutionary processes. Due to the non-linear and often infinite-dimensional nature of shape spaces, the mathematical construction of suitable stochastic shape processes is far from immediate. We define and formalize properties that stochastic shape processes should ideally satisfy to be compatible with the shape structure, and we link this to Kunita flows that, when acting on shape spaces, induce stochastic processes that satisfy these criteria by their construction. We couple this with a survey of other relevant shape stochastic processes and show how bridge sampling techniques can be used to condition shape stochastic processes on observed data thereby allowing for statistical inference of parameters of the stochastic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Universal entrywise eigenvector fluctuations in delocalized spiked matrix models and asymptotics of rounded spectral algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the distribution of the top eigenvector $\widehat{v}$ of a spiked matrix model of the form $H = \theta vv^* + W$, in the supercritical regime where $H$ has an outlier eigenvalue of comparable magnitude to $\|W\|$. We show that, if $v$ is sufficiently delocalized, then the distribution of the individual entries of $\widehat{v}$ (not, we emphasize, merely the inner product $\langle \widehat{v}, v\rangle$) is universal over a large class of generalized Wigner matrices $W$ having independent entries, depending only on the first two moments of the distributions of the entries of $W$. This complements the observation of Capitaine and Donati-Martin (2018) that these distributions are not universal when $v$ is instead sufficiently localized. Further, for $W$ having entrywise variances close to constant and thus resembling a Wigner matrix, we show by comparing to the case of $W$ drawn from the Gaussian orthogonal or unitary ensembles that averages of entrywise functions of $\widehat{v}$ behave as they would if $\widehat{v}$ had Gaussian fluctuations around a suitable multiple of $v$. We apply these results to study spectral algorithms followed by rounding procedures in dense stochastic block models and synchronization problems over the cyclic and circle groups, obtaining the first precise asymptotic characterizations of the error rates of such algorithms.</description>

      <title>On a class of constrained Bayesian filters and their numerical implementation in high-dimensional state-space Markov models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian filtering is a key tool in many problems that involve the online processing of data, including data assimilation, optimal control, nonlinear tracking and others. Unfortunately, the implementation of filters for nonlinear, possibly high-dimensional, dynamical systems is far from straightforward, as computational methods have to meet a delicate trade-off involving stability, accuracy and computational cost. In this paper we investigate the design, and theoretical features, of constrained Bayesian filters for state space models. The constraint on the filter is given by a sequence of compact subsets of the state space that determines the sources and targets of the Markov transition kernels in the dynamical model. Subject to such constraints, we provide sufficient conditions for filter stability and approximation error rates with respect to the original (unconstrained) Bayesian filter. Then, we look specifically into the implementation of constrained filters in a continuous-discrete setting where the state of the system is a continuous-time stochastic It\^o process but data are collected sequentially over a time grid. We propose an implementation of the constraint that relies on a data-driven modification of the drift of the It\^o process using barrier functions, and discuss the relation of this scheme with methods based on the Doob $h$-transform. Finally, we illustrate the theoretical results and the performance of the proposed methods in computer experiments for a partially-observed stochastic Lorenz 96 model.</description>

      <title>Gaussian random field's anisotropy using excursion sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of detecting and estimating the anisotropy of a stationary real-valued random field from a single realization of one of its excursion sets. This setting is challenging as it relies on observing a binary image without prior knowledge of the field's mean, variance, or the specific threshold value.
  Our first contribution is to propose a generalization of Caba\~na's contour method to arbitrary dimensions by analyzing the Palm distribution of normal vectors along the excursion set boundaries. We demonstrate that the anisotropy parameters can be recovered by solving a smooth and strongly convex optimization problem involving the eigenvalues of the empirical covariance matrix of these normal vectors.
  Our second main contribution is a new, model-agnostic statistical test for isotropy in dimension two. We introduce a statistic based on the contour method which is asymptotically distributed as a chi-squared variable with two degrees of freedom under the null hypothesis of quasi-isotropy. Unlike existing methods based on Lipschitz-Killing curvatures, this procedure does not require knowledge of the random field's covariance structure.
  Extensive numerical experiments show that our test is well-calibrated and more powerful than model-based alternatives as well as that the estimation of the anisotropy parameters, including the directions, is robust and efficient. Finally, we apply this framework to test the quasi-isotropy of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) using the Planck data release 3 mission.</description>

      <title>Near-critical Ising, sine-Gordon at the free fermion point, and bosonization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the continuous correlations of the near-critical Ising model in two dimensions with plus boundary conditions, and prove that doubled correlation functions of primary fields (spin, disorder, fermions, energy) in the Ising model are given by correlation functions of the sine-Gordon model at the free fermion point. This is an instance of bosonization.
  The main ideas involve analyticity of correlation functions in a mass parameter in finite volume and proving that in a perturbative regime, the Taylor coefficients of the correlation functions match due to known bosonization results for the critical Ising model in terms of the Gaussian free field.
  The main techniques on the Ising side involve construction and precise estimates of certain massive holomorphic functions while on the sine-Gordon side, we control an iterated Mayer expansion with techniques going back to Brydges and Kennedy.</description>

      <title>Irreducibility of Quantum Markov Semigroups, uniqueness of invariant states and related properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present different characterizations of the notion of irreducibility for Quantum Markov Semigroups (QMSs) and investigate its relationship with other relevant features of the dynamics, such as primitivity, positivity improvement and relaxation; in particular, we show that irreducibility, primitivity and relaxation towards a faithful invariant density are equivalent when the semigroup admits an invariant density. Moreover, in the case of uniformly continuous QMSs, we present several useful ways of checking irreducibility in terms of the operators appearing in the generator in GKLS form. Our exposition is as much self-contained as possible, we present some well known results with elementary proofs (collecting all the relevant literature) and we derive new ones. We study both finite and infinite dimensional evolutions and we remark that many results only require the QMS to be made of Schwarz maps.</description>

      <title>A piecewise deterministic model for a prey-predator community</title>

      <description>arXiv:1503.02492v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are interested in prey-predator communities where the predator population evolves much faster than the prey's (e.g. insect-tree communities). We introduce a piecewise deterministic model for these prey-predator communities that arises as a limit of a microscopic model when the number of predators goes to infinity. We prove that the process has a unique invariant probability measure and that it is exponentially ergodic. Further on, we rescale the predator dynamics in order to model predators of smaller size. This slow-fast system converges to a community process in which the prey dynamics is averaged on the predator equilibria. This averaged process admits an invariant probability measure which can be computed explicitly. We use numerical simulations to study the convergence of the invariant probability measures of the rescaled processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18391v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that any stochastically monotone Feller semigroup on R can be extended by a consistent family of order-preserving Feller semigroups on the successive powers of R. We exhibit a specific such family, which is uniquely characterized by a maximality property with respect to the super-modular order on Rn. A consequence is that, in this fairly general setting, there always exists a coupling between n c{\`a}dl{\`a}g versions of the underlying Markov process starting from n distinct initial positions, which do not cross one another.</description>

      <title>Genetic contribution of advantaged ancestors in the biparental Moran model -- finite selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a population of $N$ individuals evolving according to a biparental Moran model with two types, one being advantaged compared to the other. The advantage is conferred by a Mendelian mutation, that reduces the death probability of individuals carrying it. We assume that a proportion $a$ of individuals initially carry this mutation, which therefore eventually gets fixed with high probability. After a long time, we sample a gene uniformly from the population, at a new locus, independent of the locus under selection, and calculate the probability that this gene originated from one of the initially advantaged individuals, when the population size is large. Our theorem provides quantitative insights, such as the observation that under strong viability selection, if only $1\%$ of the individuals are initially advantaged, up to $19\%$ of the population's genome will originate from them after a long time.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic error distribution for a two-level irregular discretization scheme of the solution to the stochastic differential equations (SDE for short) driven by a continuous semimartingale and obtain a central limit theorem for the error processes with the rate $\sqrt{n}$. As an application, in the spirit of the result of Ben Alaya and Kebaier, we get a central limit theorem of the Linderberg-Feller type for the irregular discretization scheme of the multilevel Monte Carlo method.</description>

Abstract: We give a probabilistic characterization of the set of measures that can be represented by the matrix product ansatz. By suitably enlarging the state space, we show that a probability measure can be described in terms of non negative matrices by the {\it Matrix Product Ansatz}, if and only if it can be written as a mixture of inhomogeneous product measures where the mixing law is a Markov bridge. We give a constructive procedure to identify such probabilistic features. We illustrate the result by examples and show that existing probabilistic representations of the invariant measures of non equilibrium interacting particle systems can be obtained from the matrix product ansatz by this general procedure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by models of cancer metastasis, this paper introduces a type of (multi-type) branching process that records the positions of particles, representing tumor cells or clusters. Particles may be absorbed (removed from the state space), move, or settle. The process is rigorously constructed, and the Markov property is established via embedding into a multidimensional process that tracks the labels, positions, and phases (moving or resting) of living particles. The Feller property for the associated semigroup is investigated. It is proved for a simplified model that tracks the number of particles in each class, and an explicit generator is derived, enabling Feynman-Kac-type formulas in this framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the limit theorem for paths of random walks with $n$ steps in $\mathbb{R}^d$ as $n$ and $d$ both go to infinity. For this, the paths are viewed as finite metric spaces equipped with the $\ell_p$-metric for $p\in[1,\infty)$. Under the assumptions that all components of each step are uncorrelated, centered, have finite $2p$-th moments, and are identically distributed, we show that such random metric space converges in probability to a deterministic limit space with respect to the Gromov-Hausdorff distance. This result generalises earlier work by Kabluchko and Marynych for $p=2$.</description>

      <title>Probability Bracket Notation: Multivariable Systems and Static Bayesian Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.5293</link>
      <description>arXiv:1207.5293v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We expand the Probability Bracket Notation (PBN), a symbolic framework inspired by the Dirac notation in quantum mechanics, to multivariable probability systems and static Bayesian networks (BNs). By defining joint, marginal, and conditional probability distributions (PDs), as well as marginal and conditional expectations, we demonstrate how to express dependencies among multiple random variables and manipulate them algebraically in PBN. Using the well-known Student BN as an example of probabilistic graphical models (PGMs), we illustrate how to apply PBN to analyze predictions, inferences (using both bottom-up and top-down approaches), and expectations. We then extend PBN to BNs with continuous variables. After reviewing linear Gaussian networks, we introduce a customized Healthcare BN that includes both continuous and discrete random variables, utilizes user-specific data, and provides tailored predictions via discrete-display (DD) nodes that proxy for their continuous-variable parents. Compared to traditional probability notation, PBN offers an operator-driven framework that unifies and simplifies the analysis of probabilistic models, with potential as both an educational tool and a practical platform for causal reasoning, inference, expectation, data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Current fluctuations for the boundary-driven zero-range process on graphs: microscopic versus macroscopic approach and a theory of non-reversible resistor-like networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the joint large deviation rate functional in the limit of large time for the current flowing through the edges of a finite graph on which a boundary-driven system of stochastic particles evolves with zero-range dynamics.This generalizes one-dimensional results previously obtained with different approaches; our alternative techniques illuminate various connections and complementary perspectives. In particular, we here use a variational approach to derive the rate functional by contraction from a level 2.5 large deviation rate functional. We perform an exact minimization and finally obtain the rate functional as a variational problem involving a superposition of cost functions for each edge. The contributions from different edges are not independent since they are related by the values of a potential function on the nodes of the graph. The rate functional on the graph is a microscopic version of the continuous rate functional predicted by the macroscopic fluctuation theory, and we indeed show a convergence in the scaling limit. If we split the graph into two connected regions by a cutset and are interested just in the current flowing through the cutset, we find that the result is the same as that of an effective system composed of only one effective edge (as happens at macroscopic level and is expected also for other models). The characteristics of this effective edge are related to the ``capacities'' of the graph and can be obtained by a reduction using elementary transformations as in electrical networks; specifically, we treat components in parallel, in series, and in $N$-star configurations (reduced to effective complete $N$-graphs). Our reduction procedure is directly related to the reduction to the trace process and, since the dynamics is in general not reversible, it is also closely connected to the theory of non-reversible electrical networks.</description>

      <title>Stopping Rules for Monte Carlo Methods of Martingale Difference Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a practical and easy-to-implement sequential stopping rule for the martingale central limit theorem, focusing on Monte Carlo methods for estimating the mean of a non-iid sequence of martingale difference type. Starting with an impractical scheme based on the standard martingale central limit theorem, we progressively address its limitations from implementation perspectives in the non-asymptotic regime. Along the way, we compare the proposed schemes with their counterparts in the asymptotic regime. The developed framework has potential applications in various domains. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed stopping rules in terms of reliability and complexity.</description>

      <title>Numerical Analysis of 2D Stochastic Navier--Stokes Equations with Transport Noise: Regularity and Spatial Semidiscretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes strong convergence rates for the spatial finite element discretization of a two-dimensional stochastic Navier--Stokes
  system with transport noise and no-slip boundary conditions on a convex polygonal domain.
  The main challenge arises from the lack of spatial \(D(A)\)-regularity of the solution (where \(A\) is the Stokes operator),
  which prevents the application of standard error analysis techniques. Under a small-noise assumption, we prove that the weak solution satisfies \[ u \in L^2\bigl(\Omega; C([0,T]; \dot{H}_{\sigma}^{\varrho}) \cap L^2(0,T; \dot{H}_{\sigma}^{1+\varrho})\bigr) \] for some \(\varrho \in (0,\tfrac{1}{2})\). To address the low regularity in the numerical analysis, we introduce a novel smoothing operator \(J_{h,\alpha} = A_h^{\alpha}\mathcal{P}_h A^{-\alpha}\) with \(\alpha \in (0,1)\), where \(A_h\) is the discrete Stokes operator and \(\mathcal{P}_h\) the discrete Helmholtz projection. This tool enables a complete error analysis for a MINI-element spatial semidiscretization, yielding the mean-square convergence estimate \[ \|u - u_h\|_{L^2(\Omega; C([0,T]; L^2(\mathcal O;\mathbb{R}^2)))}
  + \|\nabla(u - u_h)\|_{L^2(\Omega \times (0,T); L^2(\mathcal{O};\mathbb{R}^{2\times2}))} \leqslant c\, h^{\varrho} \log\big(1 + \frac{1}{h}\big). \] The framework can be extended to broader stochastic fluid models with rough noise and Dirichlet boundary conditions.</description>
