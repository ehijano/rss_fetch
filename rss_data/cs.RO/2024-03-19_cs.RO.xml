      <title>Virtual Elastic Tether: a New Approach for Multi-agent Navigation in Confined Aquatic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater navigation is a challenging area in the field of mobile robotics due to inherent constraints in self-localisation and communication in underwater environments. Some of these challenges can be mitigated by using collaborative multi-agent teams. However, when applied underwater, the robustness of traditional multi-agent collaborative control approaches is highly limited due to the unavailability of reliable measurements. In this paper, the concept of a Virtual Elastic Tether (VET) is introduced in the context of incomplete state measurements, which represents an innovative approach to underwater navigation in confined spaces. The concept of VET is formulated and validated using the Cooperative Aquatic Vehicle Exploration System (CAVES), which is a sim-to-real multi-agent aquatic robotic platform. Within this framework, a vision-based Autonomous Underwater Vehicle-Autonomous Surface Vehicle leader-follower formulation is developed. Experiments were conducted in both simulation and on a physical platform, benchmarked against a traditional Image-Based Visual Servoing approach. Results indicate that the formation of the baseline approach fails under discrete disturbances, when induced distances between the robots exceeds 0.6 m in simulation and 0.3 m in the real world. In contrast, the VET-enhanced system recovers to pre-perturbation distances within 5 seconds. Furthermore, results illustrate the successful navigation of VET-enhanced CAVES in a confined water pond where the baseline approach fails to perform adequately.</description>

      <title>Riemannian Flow Matching Policy for Robot Motion Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Riemannian Flow Matching Policies (RFMP), a novel model for learning and synthesizing robot visuomotor policies. RFMP leverages the efficient training and inference capabilities of flow matching methods. By design, RFMP inherits the strengths of flow matching: the ability to encode high-dimensional multimodal distributions, commonly encountered in robotic tasks, and a very simple and fast inference process. We demonstrate the applicability of RFMP to both state-based and vision-conditioned robot motion policies. Notably, as the robot state resides on a Riemannian manifold, RFMP inherently incorporates geometric awareness, which is crucial for realistic robotic tasks. To evaluate RFMP, we conduct two proof-of-concept experiments, comparing its performance against Diffusion Policies. Although both approaches successfully learn the considered tasks, our results show that RFMP provides smoother action trajectories with significantly lower inference times.</description>

      <title>Spiking Neural Networks for Fast-Moving Object Detection on Neuromorphic Hardware Devices Using an Event-Based Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Table tennis is a fast-paced and exhilarating sport that demands agility, precision, and fast reflexes. In recent years, robotic table tennis has become a popular research challenge for robot perception algorithms. Fast and accurate ball detection is crucial for enabling a robotic arm to rally the ball back successfully. Previous approaches have employed conventional frame-based cameras with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or traditional computer vision methods. In this paper, we propose a novel solution that combines an event-based camera with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for ball detection. We use multiple state-of-the-art SNN frameworks and develop a SNN architecture for each of them, complying with their corresponding constraints. Additionally, we implement the SNN solution across multiple neuromorphic edge devices, conducting comparisons of their accuracies and run-times. This furnishes robotics researchers with a benchmark illustrating the capabilities achievable with each SNN framework and a corresponding neuromorphic edge device. Next to this comparison of SNN solutions for robots, we also show that an SNN on a neuromorphic edge device is able to run in real-time in a closed loop robotic system, a table tennis robot in our use case.</description>

      <title>Latent Object Characteristics Recognition with Visual to Haptic-Audio Cross-modal Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recognising the characteristics of objects while a robot handles them is crucial for adjusting motions that ensure stable and efficient interactions with containers. Ahead of realising stable and efficient robot motions for handling/transferring the containers, this work aims to recognise the latent unobservable object characteristics. While vision is commonly used for object recognition by robots, it is ineffective for detecting hidden objects. However, recognising objects indirectly using other sensors is a challenging task. To address this challenge, we propose a cross-modal transfer learning approach from vision to haptic-audio. We initially train the model with vision, directly observing the target object. Subsequently, we transfer the latent space learned from vision to a second module, trained only with haptic-audio and motor data. This transfer learning framework facilitates the representation of object characteristics using indirect sensor data, thereby improving recognition accuracy. For evaluating the recognition accuracy of our proposed learning framework we selected shape, position, and orientation as the object characteristics. Finally, we demonstrate online recognition of both trained and untrained objects using the humanoid robot Nextage Open.</description>

      <title>Mind the Error! Detection and Localization of Instruction Errors in Vision-and-Language Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) is one of the most intuitive yet challenging embodied AI tasks. Agents are tasked to navigate towards a target goal by executing a set of low-level actions, following a series of natural language instructions. All VLN-CE methods in the literature assume that language instructions are exact. However, in practice, instructions given by humans can contain errors when describing a spatial environment due to inaccurate memory or confusion. Current VLN-CE benchmarks do not address this scenario, making the state-of-the-art methods in VLN-CE fragile in the presence of erroneous instructions from human users. For the first time, we propose a novel benchmark dataset that introduces various types of instruction errors considering potential human causes. This benchmark provides valuable insight into the robustness of VLN systems in continuous environments. We observe a noticeable performance drop (up to -25%) in Success Rate when evaluating the state-of-the-art VLN-CE methods on our benchmark. Moreover, we formally define the task of Instruction Error Detection and Localization, and establish an evaluation protocol on top of our benchmark dataset. We also propose an effective method, based on a cross-modal transformer architecture, that achieves the best performance in error detection and localization, compared to baselines. Surprisingly, our proposed method has revealed errors in the validation set of the two commonly used datasets for VLN-CE, i.e., R2R-CE and RxR-CE, demonstrating the utility of our technique in other tasks. Code and dataset will be made available upon acceptance at https://intelligolabs.github.io/R2RIE-CE</description>

      <title>Incentive-Compatible and Distributed Allocation for Robotic Service Provision Through Contract Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robot allocation plays an essential role in facilitating robotic service provision across various domains. Yet the increasing number of users and the uncertainties regarding the users' true service requirements have posed challenges for the service provider in effectively allocating service robots to users to meet their needs. In this work, we first propose a contract-based approach to enable incentive-compatible service selection so that the service provider can effectively reduce the user's service uncertainties for precise service provision. Then, we develop a distributed allocation algorithm that incorporates robot dynamics and collision avoidance to allocate service robots and address scalability concerns associated with increasing numbers of service robots and users. We conduct simulations in eight scenarios to validate our approach. Comparative analysis against the robust allocation paradigm and two alternative uncertainty reduction strategies demonstrates that our approach achieves better allocation efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Stackelberg Meta-Learning Based Shared Control for Assistive Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shared control allows the human driver to collaborate with an assistive driving system while retaining the ability to make decisions and take control if necessary. However, human-vehicle teaming and planning are challenging due to environmental uncertainties, the human's bounded rationality, and the variability in human behaviors. An effective collaboration plan needs to learn and adapt to these uncertainties. To this end, we develop a Stackelberg meta-learning algorithm to create automated learning-based planning for shared control. The Stackelberg games are used to capture the leader-follower structure in the asymmetric interactions between the human driver and the assistive driving system. The meta-learning algorithm generates a common behavioral model, which is capable of fast adaptation using a small amount of driving data to assist optimal decision-making. We use a case study of an obstacle avoidance driving scenario to corroborate that the adapted human behavioral model can successfully assist the human driver in reaching the target destination. Besides, it saves driving time compared with a driver-only scheme and is also robust to drivers' bounded rationality and errors.</description>

      <title>iDb-RRT: Sampling-based Kinodynamic Motion Planning with Motion Primitives and Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) and its variations have emerged as a robust and efficient tool for finding collision-free paths in robotic systems. However, adding dynamic constraints makes the motion planning problem significantly harder, as it requires solving two-value boundary problems (computationally expensive) or propagating random control inputs (uninformative). Alternatively, Iterative Discontinuity Bounded A* (iDb-A*), introduced in our previous study, combines search and optimization iteratively. The search step connects short trajectories (motion primitives) while allowing a bounded discontinuity between the motion primitives, which is later repaired in the trajectory optimization step.
  Building upon these foundations, in this paper, we present iDb-RRT, a sampling-based kinodynamic motion planning algorithm that combines motion primitives and trajectory optimization within the RRT framework. iDb-RRT is probabilistically complete and can be implemented in forward or bidirectional mode. We have tested our algorithm across a benchmark suite comprising 30 problems, spanning 8 different systems, and shown that iDb-RRT can find solutions up to 10x faster than previous methods, especially in complex scenarios that require long trajectories or involve navigating through narrow passages.</description>

      <title>Fully Distributed Cooperative Multi-agent Underwater Obstacle Avoidance Under Dog Walking Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigation in cluttered underwater environments is challenging, especially when there are constraints on communication and self-localisation. Part of the fully distributed underwater navigation problem has been resolved by introducing multi-agent robot teams, however when the environment becomes cluttered, the problem remains unresolved. In this paper, we first studied the connection between everyday activity of dog walking and the cooperative underwater obstacle avoidance problem. Inspired by this analogy, we propose a novel dog walking paradigm and implement it in a multi-agent underwater system. Simulations were conducted across various scenarios, with performance benchmarked against traditional methods utilising Image-Based Visual Servoing in a multi-agent setup. Results indicate that our dog walking-inspired paradigm significantly enhances cooperative behavior among agents and outperforms the existing approach in navigating through obstacles.</description>

      <title>CORN: Contact-based Object Representation for Nonprehensile Manipulation of General Unseen Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonprehensile manipulation is essential for manipulating objects that are too thin, large, or otherwise ungraspable in the wild. To sidestep the difficulty of contact modeling in conventional modeling-based approaches, reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising alternative. However, previous RL approaches either lack the ability to generalize over diverse object shapes, or use simple action primitives that limit the diversity of robot motions. Furthermore, using RL over diverse object geometry is challenging due to the high cost of training a policy that takes in high-dimensional sensory inputs. We propose a novel contact-based object representation and pretraining pipeline to tackle this. To enable massively parallel training, we leverage a lightweight patch-based transformer architecture for our encoder that processes point clouds, thus scaling our training across thousands of environments. Compared to learning from scratch, or other shape representation baselines, our representation facilitates both time- and data-efficient learning. We validate the efficacy of our overall system by zero-shot transferring the trained policy to novel real-world objects.

      <title>NARRATE: Versatile Language Architecture for Optimal Control in Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to various efforts to enable robots to be controlled through natural language instructions, opening exciting possibilities for human-robot interaction The goal is for the motor-control task to be performed accurately, efficiently and safely while also enjoying the flexibility imparted by LLMs to specify and adjust the task through natural language. In this work, we demonstrate how a careful layering of an LLM in combination with a Model Predictive Control (MPC) formulation allows for accurate and flexible robotic control via natural language while taking into consideration safety constraints. In particular, we rely on the LLM to effectively frame constraints and objective functions as mathematical expressions, which are later used in the motor-control module via MPC. The transparency of the optimization formulation allows for interpretability of the task and enables adjustments through human feedback. We demonstrate the validity of our method through extensive experiments on long-horizon reasoning, contact-rich, and multi-object interaction tasks. Our evaluations show that NARRATE outperforms current existing methods on these benchmarks and effectively transfers to the real world on two different embodiments.

      <title>Task-Driven Manipulation with Reconfigurable Parallel Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ReachBot, a proposed robotic platform, employs extendable booms as limbs for mobility in challenging environments, such as martian caves. When attached to the environment, ReachBot acts as a parallel robot, with reconfiguration driven by the ability to detach and re-place the booms. This ability enables manipulation-focused scientific objectives: for instance, through operating tools, or handling and transporting samples. To achieve these capabilities, we develop a two-part solution, optimizing for robustness against task uncertainty and stochastic failure modes. First, we present a mixed-integer stance planner to determine the positioning of ReachBot's booms to maximize the task wrench space about the nominal point(s). Second, we present a convex tension planner to determine boom tensions for the desired task wrenches, accounting for the probabilistic nature of microspine grasping. We demonstrate improvements in key robustness metrics from the field of dexterous manipulation, and show a large increase in the volume of the manipulation workspace. Finally, we employ Monte-Carlo simulation to validate the robustness of these methods, demonstrating good performance across a range of randomized tasks and environments, and generalization to cable-driven morphologies. We make our code available at our project webpage, https://stanfordasl.github.io/reachbot_manipulation/</description>

      <title>DPPE: Dense Pose Estimation in a Plenoxels Environment using Gradient Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present DPPE, a dense pose estimation algorithm that functions over a Plenoxels environment. Recent advances in neural radiance field techniques have shown that it is a powerful tool for environment representation. More recent neural rendering algorithms have significantly improved both training duration and rendering speed. Plenoxels introduced a fully-differentiable radiance field technique that uses Plenoptic volume elements contained in voxels for rendering, offering reduced training times and better rendering accuracy, while also eliminating the neural net component. In this work, we introduce a 6-DoF monocular RGB-only pose estimation procedure for Plenoxels, which seeks to recover the ground truth camera pose after a perturbation. We employ a variation on classical template matching techniques, using stochastic gradient descent to optimize the pose by minimizing errors in re-rendering. In particular, we examine an approach that takes advantage of the rapid rendering speed of Plenoxels to numerically approximate part of the pose gradient, using a central differencing technique. We show that such methods are effective in pose estimation. Finally, we perform ablations over key components of the problem space, with a particular focus on image subsampling and Plenoxel grid resolution.

      <title>Identifying Optimal Launch Sites of High-Altitude Latex-Balloons using Bayesian Optimisation for the Task of Station-Keeping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Station-keeping tasks for high-altitude balloons show promise in areas such as ecological surveys, atmospheric analysis, and communication relays. However, identifying the optimal time and position to launch a latex high-altitude balloon is still a challenging and multifaceted problem. For example, tasks such as forest fire tracking place geometric constraints on the launch location of the balloon. Furthermore, identifying the most optimal location also heavily depends on atmospheric conditions. We first illustrate how reinforcement learning-based controllers, frequently used for station-keeping tasks, can exploit the environment. This exploitation can degrade performance on unseen weather patterns and affect station-keeping performance when identifying an optimal launch configuration. Valuing all states equally in the region, the agent exploits the region's geometry by flying near the edge, leading to risky behaviours. We propose a modification which compensates for this exploitation and finds this leads to, on average, higher steps within the target region on unseen data. Then, we illustrate how Bayesian Optimisation (BO) can identify the optimal launch location to perform station-keeping tasks, maximising the expected undiscounted return from a given rollout. We show BO can find this launch location in fewer steps compared to other optimisation methods. Results indicate that, surprisingly, the most optimal location to launch from is not commonly within the target region.

      <title>Diffusion-Reinforcement Learning Hierarchical Motion Planning in Adversarial Multi-agent Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning- (RL-)based motion planning has recently shown the potential to outperform traditional approaches from autonomous navigation to robot manipulation. In this work, we focus on a motion planning task for an evasive target in a partially observable multi-agent adversarial pursuit-evasion games (PEG). These pursuit-evasion problems are relevant to various applications, such as search and rescue operations and surveillance robots, where robots must effectively plan their actions to gather intelligence or accomplish mission tasks while avoiding detection or capture themselves. We propose a hierarchical architecture that integrates a high-level diffusion model to plan global paths responsive to environment data while a low-level RL algorithm reasons about evasive versus global path-following behavior. Our approach outperforms baselines by 51.2% by leveraging the diffusion model to guide the RL algorithm for more efficient exploration and improves the explanability and predictability.</description>

Abstract: Trajectory prediction and generation are vital for autonomous robots navigating dynamic environments. While prior research has typically focused on either prediction or generation, our approach unifies these tasks to provide a versatile framework and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Diffusion models, which are currently state-of-the-art for learned trajectory generation in long-horizon planning and offline reinforcement learning tasks, rely on a computationally intensive iterative sampling process. This slow process impedes the dynamic capabilities of robotic systems. In contrast, we introduce Trajectory Conditional Flow Matching (T-CFM), a novel data-driven approach that utilizes flow matching techniques to learn a solver time-varying vector field for efficient and fast trajectory generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of T-CFM on three separate tasks: adversarial tracking, real-world aircraft trajectory forecasting, and long-horizon planning. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with an increase of 35% in predictive accuracy and 142% increase in planning performance. Notably, T-CFM achieves up to 100$\times$ speed-up compared to diffusion-based models without sacrificing accuracy, which is crucial for real-time decision making in robotics.</description>

      <title>H3-Mapping: Quasi-Heterogeneous Feature Grids for Real-time Dense Mapping Using Hierarchical Hybrid Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, implicit online dense mapping methods have achieved high-quality reconstruction results, showcasing great potential in robotics, AR/VR, and digital twins applications. However, existing methods struggle with slow texture modeling which limits their real-time performance. To address these limitations, we propose a NeRF-based dense mapping method that enables faster and higher-quality reconstruction. To improve texture modeling, we introduce quasi-heterogeneous feature grids, which inherit the fast querying ability of uniform feature grids while adapting to varying levels of texture complexity. Besides, we present a gradient-aided coverage-maximizing strategy for keyframe selection that enables the selected keyframes to exhibit a closer focus on rich-textured regions and a broader scope for weak-textured areas. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing NeRF-based approaches in texture fidelity, geometry accuracy, and time consumption. The code for our method will be available at: https://github.com/SYSU-STAR/H3-Mapping.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Large-scale Robot Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based reactive planner to solve large-scale Lidar-based autonomous robot exploration problems in 2D action space. Our DRL-based planner allows the agent to reactively plan its exploration path by making implicit predictions about unknown areas, based on a learned estimation of the underlying transition model of the environment. To this end, our approach relies on learned attention mechanisms for their powerful ability to capture long-term dependencies at different spatial scales to reason about the robot's entire belief over known areas. Our approach relies on ground truth information (i.e., privileged learning) to guide the environment estimation during training, as well as on a graph rarefaction algorithm, which allows models trained in small-scale environments to scale to large-scale ones. Simulation results show that our model exhibits better exploration efficiency (12% in path length, 6% in makespan) and lower planning time (60%) than the state-of-the-art planners in a 130m x 100m benchmark scenario. We also validate our learned model on hardware.</description>

      <title>MSI-NeRF: Linking Omni-Depth with View Synthesis through Multi-Sphere Image aided Generalizable Neural Radiance Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Panoramic observation using fisheye cameras is significant in robot perception, reconstruction, and remote operation. However, panoramic images synthesized by traditional methods lack depth information and can only provide three degrees-of-freedom (3DoF) rotation rendering in virtual reality applications. To fully preserve and exploit the parallax information within the original fisheye cameras, we introduce MSI-NeRF, which combines deep learning omnidirectional depth estimation and novel view rendering. We first construct a multi-sphere image as a cost volume through feature extraction and warping of the input images. It is then processed by geometry and appearance decoders, respectively. Unlike methods that regress depth maps directly, we further build an implicit radiance field using spatial points and interpolated 3D feature vectors as input. In this way, we can simultaneously realize omnidirectional depth estimation and 6DoF view synthesis. Our method is trained in a semi-self-supervised manner. It does not require target view images and only uses depth data for supervision. Our network has the generalization ability to reconstruct unknown scenes efficiently using only four images. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing methods in depth estimation and novel view synthesis tasks.</description>

      <title>Robotic Task Success Evaluation Under Multi-modal Non-Parametric Object Pose Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate 6D object pose estimation is essential for various robotic tasks. Uncertain pose estimates can lead to task failures; however, a certain degree of error in the pose estimates is often acceptable. Hence, by quantifying errors in the object pose estimate and acceptable errors for task success, robots can make informed decisions. This is a challenging problem as both the object pose uncertainty and acceptable error for the robotic task are often multi-modal and cannot be parameterized with commonly used uni-modal distributions. In this paper, we introduce a framework for evaluating robotic task success under object pose uncertainty, representing both the estimated error space of the object pose and the acceptable error space for task success using multi-modal non-parametric probability distributions. The proposed framework pre-computes the acceptable error space for task success using dynamic simulations and subsequently integrates the pre-computed acceptable error space over the estimated error space of the object pose to predict the likelihood of the task success. We evaluated the proposed framework on two mobile manipulation tasks. Our results show that by representing the estimated and the acceptable error space using multi-modal non-parametric distributions, we achieve higher task success rates and fewer failures.</description>

      <title>PAAMP: Polytopic Action-Set And Motion Planning For Long Horizon Dynamic Motion Planning via Mixed Integer Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization methods for long-horizon, dynamically feasible motion planning in robotics tackle challenging non-convex and discontinuous optimization problems. Traditional methods often falter due to the nonlinear characteristics of these problems. We introduce a technique that utilizes learned representations of the system, known as Polytopic Action Sets, to efficiently compute long-horizon trajectories. By employing a suitable sequence of Polytopic Action Sets, we transform the long-horizon dynamically feasible motion planning problem into a Linear Program. This reformulation enables us to address motion planning as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). We demonstrate the effectiveness of a Polytopic Action-Set and Motion Planning (PAAMP) approach by identifying swing-up motions for a torque-constrained pendulum within approximately 0.75 milliseconds. This approach is well-suited for solving complex motion planning and long-horizon Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) in dynamic and underactuated systems such as legged and aerial robots.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Design of Off-Policy Gaussian Controllers: Integrating Model Predictive Control and Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an off-policy Gaussian Predictive Control (GPC) framework aimed at solving optimal control problems with a smaller computational footprint, thereby facilitating real-time applicability while ensuring critical safety considerations. The proposed controller imitates classical control methodologies by modeling the optimization process through a Gaussian process and employs Gaussian Process Regression to learn from the Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm. Notably, the Gaussian Process setup does not incorporate a built-in model, enhancing its applicability to a broad range of control problems. We applied this framework experimentally to a differential drive mobile robot, tasking it with trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance. Leveraging the off-policy aspect, the controller demonstrated adaptability to diverse trajectories and obstacle behaviors. Simulation experiments confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed GPC method, emphasizing its ability to learn the dynamics of optimal control strategies. Consequently, our findings highlight the significant potential of off-policy Gaussian Predictive Control in achieving real-time optimal control for handling of robotic systems in safety-critical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Quaternion-Based Sliding Mode Control for Six Degrees of Freedom Flight Control of Quadrotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite extensive research on sliding mode control (SMC) design for quadrotors, the existing approaches suffer from certain limitations. Euler angle-based SMC formulations suffer from poor performance in high-pitch or -roll maneuvers. Quaternion-based SMC approaches have unwinding issues and complex architecture. Coordinate-free methods are slow and only almost globally stable. This paper presents a new six degrees of freedom SMC flight controller to address the above limitations. We use a cascaded architecture with a position controller in the outer loop and a quaternion-based attitude controller in the inner loop. The position controller generates the desired trajectory for the attitude controller using a coordinate-free approach. The quaternion-based attitude controller uses the natural characteristics of the quaternion hypersphere, featuring a simple structure while providing global stability and avoiding unwinding issues. We compare our controller with three other common control methods conducting challenging maneuvers like flip-over and high-speed trajectory tracking in the presence of model uncertainties and disturbances. Our controller consistently outperforms the benchmark approaches with less control effort and actuator saturation, offering highly effective and efficient flight control.</description>

      <title>ViSaRL: Visual Reinforcement Learning Guided by Human Saliency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training robots to perform complex control tasks from high-dimensional pixel input using reinforcement learning (RL) is sample-inefficient, because image observations are comprised primarily of task-irrelevant information. By contrast, humans are able to visually attend to task-relevant objects and areas. Based on this insight, we introduce Visual Saliency-Guided Reinforcement Learning (ViSaRL). Using ViSaRL to learn visual representations significantly improves the success rate, sample efficiency, and generalization of an RL agent on diverse tasks including DeepMind Control benchmark, robot manipulation in simulation and on a real robot. We present approaches for incorporating saliency into both CNN and Transformer-based encoders. We show that visual representations learned using ViSaRL are robust to various sources of visual perturbations including perceptual noise and scene variations. ViSaRL nearly doubles success rate on the real-robot tasks compared to the baseline which does not use saliency.</description>

      <title>Real-to-Sim Adaptation via High-Fidelity Simulation to Control a Wheeled-Humanoid Robot with Unknown Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-based controllers using a linearized model around the system's equilibrium point is a common approach in the control of a wheeled humanoid due to their less computational load and ease of stability analysis. However, controlling a wheeled humanoid robot while it lifts an unknown object presents significant challenges, primarily due to the lack of knowledge in object dynamics. This paper presents a framework designed for predicting the new equilibrium point explicitly to control a wheeled-legged robot with unknown dynamics. We estimated the total mass and center of mass of the system from its response to initially unknown dynamics, then calculated the new equilibrium point accordingly. To avoid using additional sensors (e.g., force torque sensor) and reduce the effort of obtaining expensive real data, a data-driven approach is utilized with a novel real-to-sim adaptation. A more accurate nonlinear dynamics model, offering a closer representation of real-world physics, is injected into a rigid-body simulation for real-to-sim adaptation. The nonlinear dynamics model parameters were optimized using Particle Swarm Optimization. The efficacy of this framework was validated on a physical wheeled inverted pendulum, a simplified model of a wheeled-legged robot. The experimental results indicate that employing a more precise analytical model with optimized parameters significantly reduces the gap between simulation and reality, thus improving the efficiency of a model-based controller in controlling a wheeled robot with unknown dynamics.</description>

      <title>TVIM: Thermo-Active Variable Impedance Module: Evaluating Shear-Mode Capabilities of Polycaprolactone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce an advanced thermo-active variable impedance module which builds upon our previous innovation in thermal-based impedance adjustment for actuation systems. Our initial design harnessed the temperature-responsive, viscoelastic properties of Polycaprolactone (PCL) to modulate stiffness and damping, facilitated by integrated flexible Peltier elements. While effective, the reliance on compressing and the inherent stress relaxation characteristics of PCL led to suboptimal response times in impedance adjustments. Addressing these limitations, the current iteration of our module pivots to a novel 'shear-mode' operation. By conducting comprehensive shear rheology analyses on PCL, we have identified a configuration that eliminates the viscoelastic delay, offering a faster response with improved heat transfer efficiency. A key advantage of our module lies in its scalability and elimination of additional mechanical actuators for impedance adjustment. The compactness and efficiency of thermal actuation through Peltier elements allow for significant downsizing, making these thermal, variable impedance modules exceptionally well-suited for applications where space constraints and actuator weight are critical considerations. This development represents a significant leap forward in the design of variable impedance actuators, offering a more versatile, responsive, and compact solution for a wide range of robotic and biomechanical applications.</description>

      <title>Agonist-Antagonist Pouch Motors: Bidirectional Soft Actuators Enhanced by Thermally Responsive Peltier Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel Mylar-based pouch motor design that leverages the reversible actuation capabilities of Peltier junctions to enable agonist-antagonist muscle mimicry in soft robotics. Addressing the limitations of traditional silicone-based materials, such as leakage and phase-change fluid degradation, our pouch motors filled with Novec 7000 provide a durable and leak-proof solution for geometric modeling. The integration of flexible Peltier junctions offers a significant advantage over conventional Joule heating methods by allowing active and reversible heating and cooling cycles. This innovation not only enhances the reliability and longevity of soft robotic applications but also broadens the scope of design possibilities, including the development of agonist-antagonist artificial muscles, grippers with can manipulate through flexion and extension, and an anchor-slip style simple crawler design. Our findings indicate that this approach could lead to more efficient, versatile, and durable robotic systems, marking a significant advancement in the field of soft robotics.</description>

      <title>Robust Co-Design of Canonical Underactuated Systems for Increased Certifiable Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal behaviours of a system to perform a specific task can be achieved by leveraging the coupling between trajectory optimization, stabilization, and design optimization. This approach is particularly advantageous for underactuated systems, which are systems that have fewer actuators than degrees of freedom and thus require for more elaborate control systems. This paper proposes a novel co-design algorithm, namely Robust Trajectory Control with Design optimization (RTC-D). An inner optimization layer (RTC) simultaneously performs direct transcription (DIRTRAN) to find a nominal trajectory while computing optimal hyperparameters for a stabilizing time-varying linear quadratic regulator (TVLQR). RTC-D augments RTC with a design optimization layer, maximizing the system's robustness through a time-varying Lyapunov-based region of attraction (ROA) analysis. This analysis provides a formal guarantee of stability for a set of off-nominal states. The proposed algorithm has been tested on two different underactuated systems: the torque-limited simple pendulum and the cart-pole. Extensive simulations of off-nominal initial conditions demonstrate improved robustness, while real-system experiments show increased insensitivity to torque disturbances.</description>

      <title>Automatic Spatial Calibration of Near-Field MIMO Radar With Respect to Optical Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite an emerging interest in MIMO radar, the utilization of its complementary strengths in combination with optical sensors has so far been limited to far-field applications, due to the challenges that arise from mutual sensor calibration in the near field. In fact, most related approaches in the autonomous industry propose target-based calibration methods using corner reflectors that have proven to be unsuitable for the near field. In contrast, we propose a novel, joint calibration approach for optical RGB-D sensors and MIMO radars that is designed to operate in the radar's near-field range, within decimeters from the sensors. Our pipeline consists of a bespoke calibration target, allowing for automatic target detection and localization, followed by the spatial calibration of the two sensor coordinate systems through target registration. We validate our approach using two different depth sensing technologies from the optical domain. The experiments show the efficiency and accuracy of our calibration for various target displacements, as well as its robustness of our localization in terms of signal ambiguities.</description>

      <title>Inverse Submodular Maximization with Application to Human-in-the-Loop Multi-Robot Multi-Objective Coverage Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a new type of inverse combinatorial optimization, Inverse Submodular Maximization (ISM), for human-in-the-loop multi-robot coordination.
  Forward combinatorial optimization, defined as the process of solving a combinatorial problem given the reward (cost)-related parameters, is widely used in multi-robot coordination. In the standard pipeline, the reward (cost)-related parameters are designed offline by domain experts first and then these parameters are utilized for coordinating robots online. What if we need to change these parameters by non-expert human supervisors who watch over the robots during tasks to adapt to some new requirements? We are interested in the case where human supervisors can suggest what actions to take, and the robots need to change the internal parameters based on such suggestions. We study such problems from the perspective of inverse combinatorial optimization, i.e., the process of finding parameters given solutions to the problem. Specifically, we propose a new formulation for ISM, in which we aim to find a new set of parameters that minimally deviate from the current parameters and can make the greedy algorithm output actions the same as those suggested by humans. We show that such problems can be formulated as a Mixed Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP). However, MIQP involves exponentially many binary variables, making it intractable for the existing solver when the problem size is large. We propose a new algorithm under the Branch $\&amp;$ Bound paradigm to solve such problems. In numerical simulations, we demonstrate how to use ISM in multi-robot multi-objective coverage control, and we show that the proposed algorithm achieves significant advantages in running time and peak memory usage compared to directly using an existing solver.</description>

      <title>SSUP-HRI: Social Signaling in Urban Public Human-Robot Interaction dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces our dataset featuring human-robot interactions (HRI) in urban public environments. This dataset is rich with social signals that we believe can be modeled to help understand naturalistic human-robot interaction. Our dataset currently comprises approximately 15 hours of video footage recorded from the robots' perspectives, within which we annotated a total of 274 observable interactions featuring a wide range of naturalistic human-robot interactions. The data was collected by two mobile trash barrel robots deployed in Astor Place, New York City, over the course of a week. We invite the HRI community to access and utilize our dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset showcasing robot deployments in a complete public, non-controlled setting involving urban residents.</description>

      <title>A Scalable and Parallelizable Digital Twin Framework for Sustainable Sim2Real Transition of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a sustainable multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework capable of selectively scaling parallelized training workloads on-demand, and transferring the trained policies from simulation to reality using minimal hardware resources. We introduce AutoDRIVE Ecosystem as an enabling digital twin framework to train, deploy, and transfer cooperative as well as competitive multi-agent reinforcement learning policies from simulation to reality. Particularly, we first investigate an intersection traversal problem of 4 cooperative vehicles (Nigel) that share limited state information in single as well as multi-agent learning settings using a common policy approach. We then investigate an adversarial autonomous racing problem of 2 vehicles (F1TENTH) using an individual policy approach. In either set of experiments, a decentralized learning architecture was adopted, which allowed robust training and testing of the policies in stochastic environments. The agents were provided with realistically sparse observation spaces, and were restricted to sample control actions that implicitly satisfied the imposed kinodynamic and safety constraints. The experimental results for both problem statements are reported in terms of quantitative metrics and qualitative remarks for training as well as deployment phases. We also discuss agent and environment parallelization techniques adopted to efficiently accelerate MARL training, while analyzing their computational performance. Finally, we demonstrate a resource-aware transition of the trained policies from simulation to reality using the proposed digital twin framework.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Sim2real Gap for GPS and IMU Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation can and should play a critical role in the development and testing of algorithms for autonomous agents. What might reduce its impact is the ``sim2real'' gap -- the algorithm response differs between operation in simulated versus real-world environments. This paper introduces an approach to evaluate this gap, focusing on the accuracy of sensor simulation -- specifically IMU and GPS -- in velocity estimation tasks for autonomous agents. Using a scaled autonomous vehicle, we conduct 40 real-world experiments across diverse environments then replicate the experiments in simulation with five distinct sensor noise models. We note that direct comparison of raw simulation and real sensor data fails to quantify the sim2real gap for robotics applications. We demonstrate that by using a state of the art state-estimation package as a ``judge'', and by evaluating the performance of this state-estimator in both real and simulated scenarios, we can isolate the sim2real discrepancies stemming from sensor simulations alone. The dataset generated is open-source and publicly available for unfettered use.</description>

      <title>Resilient Fleet Management for Energy-Aware Intra-Factory Logistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel fleet management strategy for battery-powered robot fleets tasked with intra-factory logistics in an autonomous manufacturing facility. In this environment, repetitive material handling operations are subject to real-world uncertainties such as blocked passages, and equipment or robot malfunctions. In such cases, centralized approaches enhance resilience by immediately adjusting the task allocation between the robots. To overcome the computational expense, a two-step methodology is proposed where the nominal problem is solved a priori using a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm for task allocation, resulting in a nominal search tree. When a disruption occurs, the nominal search tree is rapidly updated a posteriori with costs to the new problem while simultaneously generating feasible solutions. Computational experiments prove the real-time capability of the proposed algorithm for various scenarios and compare it with the case where the search tree is not used and the decentralized approach that does not attempt task reassignment.</description>

      <title>PyroTrack: Belief-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning Path Planning for Aerial Wildfire Monitoring in Partially Observable Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by agility, 3D mobility, and low-risk operation compared to human-operated management systems of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), this work studies UAV-based active wildfire monitoring where a UAV detects fire incidents in remote areas and tracks the fire frontline. A UAV path planning solution is proposed considering realistic wildfire management missions, where a single low-altitude drone with limited power and flight time is available. Noting the limited field of view of commercial low-altitude UAVs, the problem formulates as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), in which wildfire progression outside the field of view causes inaccurate state representation that prevents the UAV from finding the optimal path to track the fire front in limited time. Common deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based trajectory planning solutions require diverse drone-recorded wildfire data to generalize pre-trained models to real-time systems, which is not currently available at a diverse and standard scale. To narrow down the gap caused by partial observability in the space of possible policies, a belief-based state representation with broad, extensive simulated data is proposed where the beliefs (i.e., ignition probabilities of different grid areas) are updated using a Bayesian framework for the cells within the field of view. The performance of the proposed solution in terms of the ratio of detected fire cells and monitored ignited area (MIA) is evaluated in a complex fire scenario with multiple rapidly growing fire batches, indicating that the belief state representation outperforms the observation state representation both in fire coverage and the distance to fire frontline.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Wiping Behavior of Low-Rigidity Robots Considering Various Surface Materials and Task Definitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wiping behavior is a task of tracing the surface of an object while feeling the force with the palm of the hand. It is necessary to adjust the force and posture appropriately considering the various contact conditions felt by the hand. Several studies have been conducted on the wiping motion, however, these studies have only dealt with a single surface material, and have only considered the application of the amount of appropriate force, lacking intelligent movements to ensure that the force is applied either evenly to the entire surface or to a certain area. Depending on the surface material, the hand posture and pressing force should be varied appropriately, and this is highly dependent on the definition of the task. Also, most of the movements are executed by high-rigidity robots that are easy to model, and few movements are executed by robots that are low-rigidity but therefore have a small risk of damage due to excessive contact. So, in this study, we develop a method of motion generation based on the learned prediction of contact force during the wiping motion of a low-rigidity robot. We show that MyCobot, which is made of low-rigidity resin, can appropriately perform wiping behaviors on a plane with multiple surface materials based on various task definitions.</description>

      <title>Continuous Jumping of a Parallel Wire-Driven Monopedal Robot RAMIEL Using Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a parallel wire-driven monopedal robot, RAMIEL, which has both speed and power due to the parallel wire mechanism and a long acceleration distance. RAMIEL is capable of jumping high and continuously, and so has high performance in traveling. On the other hand, one of the drawbacks of a minimal parallel wire-driven robot without joint encoders is that the current joint velocities estimated from the wire lengths oscillate due to the elongation of the wires, making the values unreliable. Therefore, despite its high performance, the control of the robot is unstable, and in 10 out of 16 jumps, the robot could only jump up to two times continuously. In this study, we propose a method to realize a continuous jumping motion by reinforcement learning in simulation, and its application to the actual robot. Because the joint velocities oscillate with the elongation of the wires, they are not used directly, but instead are inferred from the time series of joint angles. At the same time, noise that imitates the vibration caused by the elongation of the wires is added for transfer to the actual robot. The results show that the system can be applied to the actual robot RAMIEL as well as to the stable continuous jumping motion in simulation.</description>

      <title>STAIR: Semantic-Targeted Active Implicit Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many autonomous robotic applications require object-level understanding when deployed. Actively reconstructing objects of interest, i.e. objects with specific semantic meanings, is therefore relevant for a robot to perform downstream tasks in an initially unknown environment. In this work, we propose a novel framework for semantic-targeted active reconstruction using posed RGB-D measurements and 2D semantic labels as input. The key components of our framework are a semantic implicit neural representation and a compatible planning utility function based on semantic rendering and uncertainty estimation, enabling adaptive view planning to target objects of interest. Our planning approach achieves better reconstruction performance in terms of mesh and novel view rendering quality compared to implicit reconstruction baselines that do not consider semantics for view planning. Our framework further outperforms a state-of-the-art semantic-targeted active reconstruction pipeline based on explicit maps, justifying our choice of utilising implicit neural representations to tackle semantic-targeted active reconstruction problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Swarm robots, which are inspired from the way insects behave collectively in order to achieve a common goal, have become a major part of research with applications involving search and rescue, area exploration, surveillance etc. In this paper, we present a swarm of robots that do not require individual extrinsic sensors to sense the environment but instead use a single central camera to locate and map the swarm. The robots can be easily built using readily available components with the main chassis being 3D printed, making the system low-cost, low-maintenance, and easy to replicate. We describe Zutu's hardware and software architecture, the algorithms to map the robots to the real world, and some experiments conducted using four of our robots. Eventually, we conclude the possible applications of our system in research, education, and industries.</description>

Abstract: We propose a hybrid feedback control scheme for the autonomous robot navigation problem in three-dimensional environments with arbitrarily-shaped convex obstacles. The proposed hybrid control strategy, which consists in switching between the move-to-target mode and the obstacle-avoidance mode, guarantees global asymptotic stability of the target location in the obstacle-free workspace. We also provide a procedure for the implementation of the proposed hybrid controller in a priori unknown environments and validate its effectiveness through simulation results.</description>

      <title>ManipVQA: Injecting Robotic Affordance and Physically Grounded Information into Multi-Modal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with robotic systems has significantly enhanced the ability of robots to interpret and act upon natural language instructions. Despite these advancements, conventional MLLMs are typically trained on generic image-text pairs, lacking essential robotics knowledge such as affordances and physical knowledge, which hampers their efficacy in manipulation tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce ManipVQA, a novel framework designed to endow MLLMs with Manipulation-centric knowledge through a Visual Question-Answering format. This approach not only encompasses tool detection and affordance recognition but also extends to a comprehensive understanding of physical concepts. Our approach starts with collecting a varied set of images displaying interactive objects, which presents a broad range of challenges in tool object detection, affordance, and physical concept predictions. To seamlessly integrate this robotic-specific knowledge with the inherent vision-reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, we adopt a unified VQA format and devise a fine-tuning strategy that preserves the original vision-reasoning abilities while incorporating the new robotic insights. Empirical evaluations conducted in robotic simulators and across various vision task benchmarks demonstrate the robust performance of ManipVQA. Code and dataset will be made publicly available at https://github.com/SiyuanHuang95/ManipVQA.</description>

      <title>Multi-Sample Long Range Path Planning under Sensing Uncertainty for Off-Road Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on the problem of long-range dynamic replanning for off-road autonomous vehicles, where a robot plans paths through a previously unobserved environment while continuously receiving noisy local observations. An effective approach for planning under sensing uncertainty is determinization, where one converts a stochastic world into a deterministic one and plans under this simplification. This makes the planning problem tractable, but the cost of following the planned path in the real world may be different than in the determinized world. This causes collisions if the determinized world optimistically ignores obstacles, or causes unnecessarily long routes if the determinized world pessimistically imagines more obstacles. We aim to be robust to uncertainty over potential worlds while still achieving the efficiency benefits of determinization. We evaluate algorithms for dynamic replanning on a large real-world dataset of challenging long-range planning problems from the DARPA RACER program. Our method, Dynamic Replanning via Evaluating and Aggregating Multiple Samples (DREAMS), outperforms other determinization-based approaches in terms of combined traversal time and collision cost. https://sites.google.com/cs.washington.edu/dreams/</description>

      <title>Pioneering SE(2)-Equivariant Trajectory Planning for Automated Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planning the trajectory of the controlled ego vehicle is a key challenge in automated driving. As for human drivers, predicting the motions of surrounding vehicles is important to plan the own actions. Recent motion prediction methods utilize equivariant neural networks to exploit geometric symmetries in the scene. However, no existing method combines motion prediction and trajectory planning in a joint step while guaranteeing equivariance under roto-translations of the input space. We address this gap by proposing a lightweight equivariant planning model that generates multi-modal joint predictions for all vehicles and selects one mode as the ego plan. The equivariant network design improves sample efficiency, guarantees output stability, and reduces model parameters. We further propose equivariant route attraction to guide the ego vehicle along a high-level route provided by an off-the-shelf GPS navigation system. This module creates a momentum from embedded vehicle positions toward the route in latent space while keeping the equivariance property. Route attraction enables goal-oriented behavior without forcing the vehicle to stick to the exact route. We conduct experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset to investigate the capability of our planner. The results show that the planned trajectory is stable under roto-translations of the input scene which demonstrates the equivariance of our model. Despite using only a small split of the dataset for training, our method improves L2 distance at 3 s by 20.6 % and surpasses the state of the art.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Simulation-Based Model Preconditions for Fast Action Parameter Optimization with Multiple Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing robotic action parameters is a significant challenge for manipulation tasks that demand high levels of precision and generalization. Using a model-based approach, the robot must quickly reason about the outcomes of different actions using a predictive model to find a set of parameters that will have the desired effect. The model may need to capture the behaviors of rigid and deformable objects, as well as objects of various shapes and sizes. Predictive models often need to trade-off speed for prediction accuracy and generalization. This paper proposes a framework that leverages the strengths of multiple predictive models, including analytical, learned, and simulation-based models, to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of action parameter optimization. Our approach uses Model Deviation Estimators (MDEs) to determine the most suitable predictive model for any given state-action parameters, allowing the robot to select models to make fast and precise predictions. We extend the MDE framework by not only learning sim-to-real MDEs, but also sim-to-sim MDEs. Our experiments show that these sim-to-sim MDEs provide significantly faster parameter optimization as well as a basis for efficiently learning sim-to-real MDEs through finetuning. The ease of collecting sim-to-sim training data also allows the robot to learn MDEs based directly on visual inputs and local material properties.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap between Discrete Agent Strategies in Game Theory and Continuous Motion Planning in Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating competitive strategies and performing continuous motion planning simultaneously in an adversarial setting is a challenging problem. In addition, understanding the intent of other agents is crucial to deploying autonomous systems in adversarial multi-agent environments. Existing approaches either discretize agent action by grouping similar control inputs, sacrificing performance in motion planning, or plan in uninterpretable latent spaces, producing hard-to-understand agent behaviors. This paper proposes an agent strategy representation via Policy Characteristic Space that maps the agent policies to a pre-specified low-dimensional space. Policy Characteristic Space enables the discretization of agent policy switchings while preserving continuity in control. Also, it provides intepretability of agent policies and clear intentions of policy switchings. Then, regret-based game-theoretic approaches can be applied in the Policy Characteristic Space to obtain high performance in adversarial environments. Our proposed method is assessed by conducting experiments in an autonomous racing scenario using scaled vehicles. Statistical evidence shows that our method significantly improves the win rate of ego agent and the method also generalizes well to unseen environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, LLM-powered driver agents have demonstrated considerable potential in the field of autonomous driving, showcasing human-like reasoning and decision-making abilities.However, current research on aligning driver agent behaviors with human driving styles remains limited, partly due to the scarcity of high-quality natural language data from human driving behaviors.To address this research gap, we propose a multi-alignment framework designed to align driver agents with human driving styles through demonstrations and feedback. Notably, we construct a natural language dataset of human driver behaviors through naturalistic driving experiments and post-driving interviews, offering high-quality human demonstrations for LLM alignment. The framework's effectiveness is validated through simulation experiments in the CARLA urban traffic simulator and further corroborated by human evaluations. Our research offers valuable insights into designing driving agents with diverse driving styles.The implementation of the framework and details of the dataset can be found at the link.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadrupedal robots excel in mobility, navigating complex terrains with agility. However, their complex control systems present challenges that are still far from being fully addressed. In this paper, we introduce the use of Sample-Based Stochastic control strategies for quadrupedal robots, as an alternative to traditional optimal control laws. We show that Sample-Based Stochastic methods, supported by GPU acceleration, can be effectively applied to real quadruped robots. In particular, in this work, we focus on achieving gait frequency adaptation, a notable challenge in quadrupedal locomotion for gradient-based methods. To validate the effectiveness of Sample-Based Stochastic controllers we test two distinct approaches for quadrupedal robots and compare them against a conventional gradient-based Model Predictive Control system. Our findings, validated both in simulation and on a real 21Kg Aliengo quadruped, demonstrate that our method is on par with a traditional Model Predictive Control strategy when the robot is subject to zero or moderate disturbance, while it surpasses gradient-based methods in handling sustained external disturbances, thanks to the straightforward gait adaptation strategy that is possible to achieve within their formulation.</description>

      <title>Beyond Uncertainty: Risk-Aware Active View Acquisition for Safe Robot Navigation and 3D Scene Understanding with FisherRF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a novel approach to bolster both the robot's risk assessment and safety measures while deepening its understanding of 3D scenes, which is achieved by leveraging Radiance Field (RF) models and 3D Gaussian Splatting. To further enhance these capabilities, we incorporate additional sampled views from the environment with the RF model. One of our key contributions is the introduction of Risk-aware Environment Masking (RaEM), which prioritizes crucial information by selecting the next-best-view that maximizes the expected information gain. This targeted approach aims to minimize uncertainties surrounding the robot's path and enhance the safety of its navigation. Our method offers a dual benefit: improved robot safety and increased efficiency in risk-aware 3D scene reconstruction and understanding. Extensive experiments in real-world scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, highlighting its potential to establish a robust and safety-focused framework for active robot exploration and 3D scene understanding.</description>

      <title>Expert Composer Policy: Scalable Skill Repertoire for Quadruped Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the expert composer policy, a framework to reliably expand the skill repertoire of quadruped agents. The composer policy links pair of experts via transitions to a sampled target state, allowing experts to be composed sequentially. Each expert specializes in a single skill, such as a locomotion gait or a jumping motion. Instead of a hierarchical or mixture-of-experts architecture, we train a single composer policy in an independent process that is not conditioned on the other expert policies. By reusing the same composer policy, our approach enables adding new experts without affecting existing ones, enabling incremental repertoire expansion and preserving original motion quality. We measured the transition success rate of 72 transition pairs and achieved an average success rate of 99.99\%, which is over 10\% higher than the baseline random approach, and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. Using domain randomization during training we ensure a successful transfer to the real world, where we achieve an average transition success rate of 97.22\% (N=360) in our experiments.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Autonomous Vehicle Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of universal function approximators in the domain of reinforcement learning, the number of practical applications leveraging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has exploded. Decision-making in automated driving tasks has emerged as a chief application among them, taking the sensor data or the higher-order kinematic variables as the input and providing a discrete choice or continuous control output. However, the black-box nature of the models presents an overwhelming limitation that restricts the real-world deployment of DRL in autonomous vehicles (AVs). Therefore, in this research work, we focus on the interpretability of an attention-based DRL framework. We use a continuous proximal policy optimization-based DRL algorithm as the baseline model and add a multi-head attention framework in an open-source AV simulation environment. We provide some analytical techniques for discussing the interpretability of the trained models in terms of explainability and causality for spatial and temporal correlations. We show that the weights in the first head encode the positions of the neighboring vehicles while the second head focuses on the leader vehicle exclusively. Also, the ego vehicle's action is causally dependent on the vehicles in the target lane spatially and temporally. Through these findings, we reliably show that these techniques can help practitioners decipher the results of the DRL algorithms.</description>

      <title>ALDM-Grasping: Diffusion-aided Zero-Shot Sim-to-Real Transfer for Robot Grasping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To tackle the "reality gap" encountered in Sim-to-Real transfer, this study proposes a diffusion-based framework that minimizes inconsistencies in grasping actions between the simulation settings and realistic environments. The process begins by training an adversarial supervision layout-to-image diffusion model(ALDM). Then, leverage the ALDM approach to enhance the simulation environment, rendering it with photorealistic fidelity, thereby optimizing robotic grasp task training. Experimental results indicate this framework outperforms existing models in both success rates and adaptability to new environments through improvements in the accuracy and reliability of visual grasping actions under a variety of conditions. Specifically, it achieves a 75\% success rate in grasping tasks under plain backgrounds and maintains a 65\% success rate in more complex scenarios. This performance demonstrates this framework excels at generating controlled image content based on text descriptions, identifying object grasp points, and demonstrating zero-shot learning in complex, unseen scenarios.</description>

      <title>VIHE: Virtual In-Hand Eye Transformer for 3D Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Virtual In-Hand Eye Transformer (VIHE), a novel method designed to enhance 3D manipulation capabilities through action-aware view rendering. VIHE autoregressively refines actions in multiple stages by conditioning on rendered views posed from action predictions in the earlier stages. These virtual in-hand views provide a strong inductive bias for effectively recognizing the correct pose for the hand, especially for challenging high-precision tasks such as peg insertion. On 18 manipulation tasks in RLBench simulated environments, VIHE achieves a new state-of-the-art, with a 12% absolute improvement, increasing from 65% to 77% over the existing state-of-the-art model using 100 demonstrations per task. In real-world scenarios, VIHE can learn manipulation tasks with just a handful of demonstrations, highlighting its practical utility. Videos and code implementation can be found at our project site: https://vihe-3d.github.io.</description>

      <title>Robot Navigation in Unknown and Cluttered Workspace with Dynamical System Modulation in Starshaped Roadmap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel reactive motion planning framework for navigating robots in unknown and cluttered 2D workspace. Typical existing methods are developed by enforcing the robot staying in free regions represented by the locally extracted ellipse or polygon. Instead, we navigate the robot in free space with an alternate starshaped decomposition, which is calculated directly from real-time sensor data. Additionally, a roadmap is constructed incrementally to maintain the connectivity information of the starshaped regions. Compared to the roadmap built upon connected polygons or ellipses in the conventional approaches, the concave starshaped region is better suited to capture the natural distribution of sensor data, so that the perception information can be fully exploited for robot navigation. In this sense, conservative and myopic behaviors are avoided with the proposed approach, and intricate obstacle configurations can be suitably accommodated in unknown and cluttered environments. Then, we design a heuristic exploration algorithm on the roadmap to determine the frontier points of the starshaped regions, from which short-term goals are selected to attract the robot towards the goal configuration. It is noteworthy that, a recovery mechanism is developed on the roadmap that is triggered once a non-extendable short-term goal is reached. This mechanism renders it possible to deal with dead-end situations that can be typically encountered in unknown and cluttered environments. Furthermore, safe and smooth motion within the starshaped regions is generated by employing the Dynamical System Modulation (DSM) approach on the constructed roadmap. Through comprehensive evaluation in both simulations and real-world experiments, the proposed method outperforms the benchmark methods in terms of success rate and traveling time.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Generate Human-Like Wayfinding Instructions? Towards Platform-Agnostic Embodied Instruction Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to automatically synthesize "wayfinding instructions" for an embodied robot agent. In contrast to prior approaches that are heavily reliant on human-annotated datasets designed exclusively for specific simulation platforms, our algorithm uses in-context learning to condition an LLM to generate instructions using just a few references. Using an LLM-based Visual Question Answering strategy, we gather detailed information about the environment which is used by the LLM for instruction synthesis. We implement our approach on multiple simulation platforms including Matterport3D, AI Habitat and ThreeDWorld, thereby demonstrating its platform-agnostic nature. We subjectively evaluate our approach via a user study and observe that 83.3% of users find the synthesized instructions accurately capture the details of the environment and show characteristics similar to those of human-generated instructions. Further, we conduct zero-shot navigation with multiple approaches on the REVERIE dataset using the generated instructions, and observe very close correlation with the baseline on standard success metrics (&lt; 1% change in SR), quantifying the viability of generated instructions in replacing human-annotated data. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first LLM-driven approach capable of generating "human-like" instructions in a platform-agnostic manner, without requiring any form of training.</description>

      <title>MCD: Diverse Large-Scale Multi-Campus Dataset for Robot Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perception plays a crucial role in various robot applications. However, existing well-annotated datasets are biased towards autonomous driving scenarios, while unlabelled SLAM datasets are quickly over-fitted, and often lack environment and domain variations. To expand the frontier of these fields, we introduce a comprehensive dataset named MCD (Multi-Campus Dataset), featuring a wide range of sensing modalities, high-accuracy ground truth, and diverse challenging environments across three Eurasian university campuses. MCD comprises both CCS (Classical Cylindrical Spinning) and NRE (Non-Repetitive Epicyclic) lidars, high-quality IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units), cameras, and UWB (Ultra-WideBand) sensors. Furthermore, in a pioneering effort, we introduce semantic annotations of 29 classes over 59k sparse NRE lidar scans across three domains, thus providing a novel challenge to existing semantic segmentation research upon this largely unexplored lidar modality. Finally, we propose, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, continuous-time ground truth based on optimization-based registration of lidar-inertial data on large survey-grade prior maps, which are also publicly released, each several times the size of existing ones. We conduct a rigorous evaluation of numerous state-of-the-art algorithms on MCD, report their performance, and highlight the challenges awaiting solutions from the research community.</description>

      <title>Sim-to-Real Grasp Detection with Global-to-Local RGB-D Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the sim-to-real issue of RGB-D grasp detection and formulates it as a domain adaptation problem. In this case, we present a global-to-local method to address hybrid domain gaps in RGB and depth data and insufficient multi-modal feature alignment. First, a self-supervised rotation pre-training strategy is adopted to deliver robust initialization for RGB and depth networks. We then propose a global-to-local alignment pipeline with individual global domain classifiers for scene features of RGB and depth images as well as a local one specifically working for grasp features in the two modalities. In particular, we propose a grasp prototype adaptation module, which aims to facilitate fine-grained local feature alignment by dynamically updating and matching the grasp prototypes from the simulation and real-world scenarios throughout the training process. Due to such designs, the proposed method substantially reduces the domain shift and thus leads to consistent performance improvements. Extensive experiments are conducted on the GraspNet-Planar benchmark and physical environment, and superior results are achieved which demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Visual Preference Inference: An Image Sequence-Based Preference Reasoning in Tabletop Object Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In robotic object manipulation, human preferences can often be influenced by the visual attributes of objects, such as color and shape. These properties play a crucial role in operating a robot to interact with objects and align with human intention. In this paper, we focus on the problem of inferring underlying human preferences from a sequence of raw visual observations in tabletop manipulation environments with a variety of object types, named Visual Preference Inference (VPI). To facilitate visual reasoning in the context of manipulation, we introduce the Chain-of-Visual-Residuals (CoVR) method. CoVR employs a prompting mechanism that describes the difference between the consecutive images (i.e., visual residuals) and incorporates such texts with a sequence of images to infer the user's preference. This approach significantly enhances the ability to understand and adapt to dynamic changes in its visual environment during manipulation tasks. Furthermore, we incorporate such texts along with a sequence of images to infer the user's preferences. Our method outperforms baseline methods in terms of extracting human preferences from visual sequences in both simulation and real-world environments.

      <title>LLM^3:Large Language Model-based Task and Motion Planning with Motion Failure Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) approaches rely on manually crafted interfaces connecting symbolic task planning with continuous motion generation. These domain-specific and labor-intensive modules are limited in addressing emerging tasks in real-world settings. Here, we present LLM^3, a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based TAMP framework featuring a domain-independent interface. Specifically, we leverage the powerful reasoning and planning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs to propose symbolic action sequences and select continuous action parameters for motion planning. Crucially, LLM^3 incorporates motion planning feed- back through prompting, allowing the LLM to iteratively refine its proposals by reasoning about motion failure. Consequently, LLM^3 interfaces between task planning and motion planning, alleviating the intricate design process of handling domain- specific messages between them. Through a series of simulations in a box-packing domain, we quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM^3 in solving TAMP problems and the efficiency in selecting action parameters. Ablation studies un- derscore the significant contribution of motion failure reasoning to the success of LLM^3. Furthermore, we conduct qualitative experiments on a physical manipulator, demonstrating the practical applicability of our approach in real-world settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach for scalable domain adaptation in cloud robotics scenarios where robots rely on third-party AI inference services powered by large pre-trained deep neural networks. Our method is based on a downstream proposal-refinement stage running locally on the robots, exploiting a new lightweight DNN architecture, R2SNet. This architecture aims to mitigate performance degradation from domain shifts by adapting the object detection process to the target environment, focusing on relabeling, rescoring, and suppression of bounding-box proposals. Our method allows for local execution on robots, addressing the scalability challenges of domain adaptation without incurring significant computational costs. Real-world results on mobile service robots performing door detection show the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving scalable domain adaptation.</description>

      <title>AGRNav: Efficient and Energy-Saving Autonomous Navigation for Air-Ground Robots in Occlusion-Prone Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exceptional mobility and long endurance of air-ground robots are raising interest in their usage to navigate complex environments (e.g., forests and large buildings). However, such environments often contain occluded and unknown regions, and without accurate prediction of unobserved obstacles, the movement of the air-ground robot often suffers a suboptimal trajectory under existing mapping-based and learning-based navigation methods. In this work, we present AGRNav, a novel framework designed to search for safe and energy-saving air-ground hybrid paths. AGRNav contains a lightweight semantic scene completion network (SCONet) with self-attention to enable accurate obstacle predictions by capturing contextual information and occlusion area features. The framework subsequently employs a query-based method for low-latency updates of prediction results to the grid map. Finally, based on the updated map, the hierarchical path planner efficiently searches for energy-saving paths for navigation. We validate AGRNav's performance through benchmarks in both simulated and real-world environments, demonstrating its superiority over classical and state-of-the-art methods. The open-source code is available at https://github.com/jmwang0117/AGRNav.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-robot rendezvous and exploration are fundamental challenges in the domain of mobile robotic systems. This paper addresses multi-robot rendezvous within an initially unknown environment where communication is only possible after the rendezvous. Traditionally, exploration has been focused on rapidly mapping the environment, often leading to suboptimal rendezvous performance in later stages. We adapt a standard frontier-based exploration technique to integrate exploration and rendezvous into a unified strategy, with a mechanism that allows robots to re-visit previously explored regions thus enhancing rendezvous opportunities. We validate our approach in 3D realistic simulations using ROS, showcasing its effectiveness in achieving faster rendezvous times compared to exploration strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-object grasping is a challenging task. It is important for energy and cost-efficient operation of industrial crane manipulators, such as those used to collect tree logs off the forest floor and onto forest machines. In this work, we used synthetic data from physics simulations to explore how data-driven modeling can be used to infer multi-object grasp poses from images. We showed that convolutional neural networks can be trained specifically for synthesizing multi-object grasps. Using RGB-Depth images and instance segmentation masks as input, a U-Net model outputs grasp maps with corresponding grapple orientation and opening width. Given an observation of a pile of logs, the model can be used to synthesize and rate the possible grasp poses and select the most suitable one, with the possibility to respect changing operational constraints such as lift capacity and reach. When tested on previously unseen data, the proposed model found successful grasp poses with an accuracy of 95%.</description>

      <title>An Accurate and Real-time Relative Pose Estimation from Triple Point-line Images by Decoupling Rotation and Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Line features are valid complements for point features in man-made environments. 3D-2D constraints provided by line features have been widely used in Visual Odometry (VO) and Structure-from-Motion (SfM) systems. However, how to accurately solve three-view relative motion only with 2D observations of points and lines in real time has not been fully explored. In this paper, we propose a novel three-view pose solver based on rotation-translation decoupled estimation. First, a high-precision rotation estimation method based on normal vector coplanarity constraints that consider the uncertainty of observations is proposed, which can be solved by Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm efficiently. Second, a robust linear translation constraint that minimizes the degree of the rotation components and feature observation components in equations is elaborately designed for estimating translations accurately. Experiments on synthetic data and real-world data show that the proposed approach improves both rotation and translation accuracy compared to the classical trifocal-tensor-based method and the state-of-the-art two-view algorithm in outdoor and indoor environments.</description>

      <title>Combining Local and Global Perception for Autonomous Navigation on Nano-UAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A critical challenge in deploying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for autonomous tasks is their ability to navigate in an unknown environment. This paper introduces a novel vision-depth fusion approach for autonomous navigation on nano-UAVs. We combine the visual-based PULP-Dronet convolutional neural network for semantic information extraction, i.e., serving as the global perception, with 8x8px depth maps for close-proximity maneuvers, i.e., the local perception. When tested in-field, our integration strategy highlights the complementary strengths of both visual and depth sensory information. We achieve a 100% success rate over 15 flights in a complex navigation scenario, encompassing straight pathways, static obstacle avoidance, and 90{\deg} turns.</description>

      <title>FE-DeTr: Keypoint Detection and Tracking in Low-quality Image Frames with Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Keypoint detection and tracking in traditional image frames are often compromised by image quality issues such as motion blur and extreme lighting conditions. Event cameras offer potential solutions to these challenges by virtue of their high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. However, they have limited performance in practical applications due to their inherent noise in event data. This paper advocates fusing the complementary information from image frames and event streams to achieve more robust keypoint detection and tracking. Specifically, we propose a novel keypoint detection network that fuses the textural and structural information from image frames with the high-temporal-resolution motion information from event streams, namely FE-DeTr. The network leverages a temporal response consistency for supervision, ensuring stable and efficient keypoint detection. Moreover, we use a spatio-temporal nearest-neighbor search strategy for robust keypoint tracking. Extensive experiments are conducted on a new dataset featuring both image frames and event data captured under extreme conditions. The experimental results confirm the superior performance of our method over both existing frame-based and event-based methods.</description>

      <title>MASSTAR: A Multi-Modal and Large-Scale Scene Dataset with a Versatile Toolchain for Surface Prediction and Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface prediction and completion have been widely studied in various applications. Recently, research in surface completion has evolved from small objects to complex large-scale scenes. As a result, researchers have begun increasing the volume of data and leveraging a greater variety of data modalities including rendered RGB images, descriptive texts, depth images, etc, to enhance algorithm performance. However, existing datasets suffer from a deficiency in the amounts of scene-level models along with the corresponding multi-modal information. Therefore, a method to scale the datasets and generate multi-modal information in them efficiently is essential. To bridge this research gap, we propose MASSTAR: a Multi-modal lArge-scale Scene dataset with a verSatile Toolchain for surfAce pRediction and completion. We develop a versatile and efficient toolchain for processing the raw 3D data from the environments. It screens out a set of fine-grained scene models and generates the corresponding multi-modal data. Utilizing the toolchain, we then generate an example dataset composed of over a thousand scene-level models with partial real-world data added. We compare MASSTAR with the existing datasets, which validates its superiority: the ability to efficiently extract high-quality models from complex scenarios to expand the dataset. Additionally, several representative surface completion algorithms are benchmarked on MASSTAR, which reveals that existing algorithms can hardly deal with scene-level completion. We will release the source code of our toolchain and the dataset. For more details, please see our project page at https://sysu-star.github.io/MASSTAR.</description>

      <title>Hardware Design and Learning-Based Software Architecture of Musculoskeletal Wheeled Robot Musashi-W for Real-World Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various musculoskeletal humanoids have been developed so far. While these humanoids have the advantage of their flexible and redundant bodies that mimic the human body, they are still far from being applied to real-world tasks. One of the reasons for this is the difficulty of bipedal walking in a flexible body. Thus, we developed a musculoskeletal wheeled robot, Musashi-W, by combining a wheeled base and musculoskeletal upper limbs for real-world applications. Also, we constructed its software system by combining static and dynamic body schema learning, reflex control, and visual recognition. We show that the hardware and software of Musashi-W can make the most of the advantages of the musculoskeletal upper limbs, through several tasks of cleaning by human teaching, carrying a heavy object considering muscle addition, and setting a table through dynamic cloth manipulation with variable stiffness.</description>

      <title>SMT-Based Dynamic Multi-Robot Task Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) is a problem that arises in many application domains including package delivery, warehouse robotics, and healthcare. In this work, we consider the problem of MRTA for a dynamic stream of tasks with task deadlines and capacitated agents (capacity for more than one simultaneous task). Previous work commonly focuses on the static case, uses specialized algorithms for restrictive task specifications, or lacks guarantees. We propose an approach to Dynamic MRTA for capacitated robots that is based on Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solving and addresses these concerns. We show our approach is both sound and complete, and that the SMT encoding is general, enabling extension to a broader class of task specifications. We show how to leverage the incremental solving capabilities of SMT solvers, keeping learned information when allocating new tasks arriving online, and to solve non-incrementally, which we provide runtime comparisons of. Additionally, we provide an algorithm to start with a smaller but potentially incomplete encoding that can iteratively be adjusted to the complete encoding. We evaluate our method on a parameterized set of benchmarks encoding multi-robot delivery created from a graph abstraction of a hospital-like environment. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated using a range of encodings, including quantifier-free theories of uninterpreted functions and linear or bitvector arithmetic across multiple solvers.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Model Predictive Control for Legged Robots through Distributed Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to enhance Model Predictive Control (MPC) for legged robots through Distributed Optimization. Our method focuses on decomposing the robot dynamics into smaller, parallelizable subsystems, and utilizing the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to ensure consensus among them. Each subsystem is managed by its own \gls{ocp}, with ADMM facilitating consistency between their optimizations. This approach not only decreases the computational time but also allows for effective scaling with more complex robot configurations, facilitating the integration of additional subsystems such as articulated arms on a quadruped robot. We demonstrate, through numerical evaluations, the convergence of our approach on two systems with increasing complexity. In addition, we showcase that our approach converges towards the same solution when compared to a state-of-the-art centralized whole-body MPC implementation. Moreover, we quantitatively compare the computational efficiency of our method to the centralized approach, revealing up to a 75\% reduction in computational time. Overall, our approach offers a promising avenue for accelerating MPC solutions for legged robots, paving the way for more effective utilization of the computational performance of modern hardware.</description>

      <title>BEVCar: Camera-Radar Fusion for BEV Map and Object Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic scene segmentation from a bird's-eye-view (BEV) perspective plays a crucial role in facilitating planning and decision-making for mobile robots. Although recent vision-only methods have demonstrated notable advancements in performance, they often struggle under adverse illumination conditions such as rain or nighttime. While active sensors offer a solution to this challenge, the prohibitively high cost of LiDARs remains a limiting factor. Fusing camera data with automotive radars poses a more inexpensive alternative but has received less attention in prior research. In this work, we aim to advance this promising avenue by introducing BEVCar, a novel approach for joint BEV object and map segmentation. The core novelty of our approach lies in first learning a point-based encoding of raw radar data, which is then leveraged to efficiently initialize the lifting of image features into the BEV space. We perform extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset and demonstrate that BEVCar outperforms the current state of the art. Moreover, we show that incorporating radar information significantly enhances robustness in challenging environmental conditions and improves segmentation performance for distant objects. To foster future research, we provide the weather split of the nuScenes dataset used in our experiments, along with our code and trained models at http://bevcar.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</description>

      <title>ForzaETH Race Stack - Scaled Autonomous Head-to-Head Racing on Fully Commercial off-the-Shelf Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous racing in robotics combines high-speed dynamics with the necessity for reliability and real-time decision-making. While such racing pushes software and hardware to their limits, many existing full-system solutions necessitate complex, custom hardware and software, and usually focus on Time-Trials rather than full unrestricted Head-to-Head racing, due to financial and safety constraints. This limits their reproducibility, making advancements and replication feasible mostly for well-resourced laboratories with comprehensive expertise in mechanical, electrical, and robotics fields. Researchers interested in the autonomy domain but with only partial experience in one of these fields, need to spend significant time with familiarization and integration. The ForzaETH Race Stack addresses this gap by providing an autonomous racing software platform designed for F1TENTH, a 1:10 scaled Head-to-Head autonomous racing competition, which simplifies replication by using commercial off-the-shelf hardware. This approach enhances the competitive aspect of autonomous racing and provides an accessible platform for research and development in the field. The ForzaETH Race Stack is designed with modularity and operational ease of use in mind, allowing customization and adaptability to various environmental conditions, such as track friction and layout. Capable of handling both Time-Trials and Head-to-Head racing, the stack has demonstrated its effectiveness, robustness, and adaptability in the field by winning the official F1TENTH international competition multiple times.</description>

      <title>Locomotion Generation for a Rat Robot based on Environmental Changes via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research focuses on developing reinforcement learning approaches for the locomotion generation of small-size quadruped robots. The rat robot NeRmo is employed as the experimental platform. Due to the constrained volume, small-size quadruped robots typically possess fewer and weaker sensors, resulting in difficulty in accurately perceiving and responding to environmental changes. In this context, insufficient and imprecise feedback data from sensors makes it difficult to generate adaptive locomotion based on reinforcement learning. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning approach that focuses on extracting effective perceptual information to enhance the environmental adaptability of small-size quadruped robots. According to the frequency of a robot's gait stride, key information of sensor data is analyzed utilizing sinusoidal functions derived from Fourier transform results. Additionally, a multifunctional reward mechanism is proposed to generate adaptive locomotion in different tasks. Extensive simulations are conducted to assess the effectiveness of the proposed reinforcement learning approach in generating rat robot locomotion in various environments. The experiment results illustrate the capability of the proposed approach to maintain stable locomotion of a rat robot across different terrains, including ramps, stairs, and spiral stairs.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning with Latent State Inference for Autonomous On-ramp Merging under Observation Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to address the challenging problem of autonomous on-ramp merging, where a self-driving vehicle needs to seamlessly integrate into a flow of vehicles on a multi-lane highway. We introduce the Lane-keeping, Lane-changing with Latent-state Inference and Safety Controller (L3IS) agent, designed to perform the on-ramp merging task safely without comprehensive knowledge about surrounding vehicles' intents or driving styles. We also present an augmentation of this agent called AL3IS that accounts for observation delays, allowing the agent to make more robust decisions in real-world environments with vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication delays. By modeling the unobservable aspects of the environment through latent states, such as other drivers' intents, our approach enhances the agent's ability to adapt to dynamic traffic conditions, optimize merging maneuvers, and ensure safe interactions with other vehicles. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive simulations generated from real traffic data and compare its performance with existing approaches. L3IS shows a 99.90\% success rate in a challenging on-ramp merging case generated from the real US Highway 101 data. We further perform a sensitivity analysis on AL3IS to evaluate its robustness against varying observation delays, which demonstrates an acceptable performance of 93.84\% success rate in 1-second V2V communication delay.</description>

      <title>Deep Bayesian Future Fusion for Self-Supervised, High-Resolution, Off-Road Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The limited sensing resolution of resource-constrained off-road vehicles poses significant challenges towards reliable off-road autonomy. To overcome this limitation, we propose a general framework based on fusing the future information (i.e. future fusion) for self-supervision. Recent approaches exploit this future information alongside the hand-crafted heuristics to directly supervise the targeted downstream tasks (e.g. traversability estimation). However, in this paper, we opt for a more general line of development - time-efficient completion of the highest resolution (i.e. 2cm per pixel) BEV map in a self-supervised manner via future fusion, which can be used for any downstream tasks for better longer range prediction. To this end, first, we create a high-resolution future-fusion dataset containing pairs of (RGB / height) raw sparse and noisy inputs and map-based dense labels. Next, to accommodate the noise and sparsity of the sensory information, especially in the distal regions, we design an efficient realization of the Bayes filter onto the vanilla convolutional network via the recurrent mechanism. Equipped with the ideas from SOTA generative models, our Bayesian structure effectively predicts high-quality BEV maps in the distal regions. Extensive evaluation on both the quality of completion and downstream task on our future-fusion dataset demonstrates the potential of our approach.</description>

      <title>Visuo-Tactile Pretraining for Cable Plugging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tactile information is a critical tool for fine-grain manipulation. As humans, we rely heavily on tactile information to understand objects in our environments and how to interact with them. We use touch not only to perform manipulation tasks but also to learn how to perform these tasks. Therefore, to create robotic agents that can learn to complete manipulation tasks at a human or super-human level of performance, we need to properly incorporate tactile information into both skill execution and skill learning. In this paper, we investigate how we can incorporate tactile information into imitation learning platforms to improve performance on complex tasks. To do this, we tackle the challenge of plugging in a USB cable, a dexterous manipulation task that relies on fine-grain visuo-tactile serving. By incorporating tactile information into imitation learning frameworks, we are able to train a robotic agent to plug in a USB cable - a first for imitation learning. Additionally, we explore how tactile information can be used to train non-tactile agents through a contrastive-loss pretraining process. Our results show that by pretraining with tactile information, the performance of a non-tactile agent can be significantly improved, reaching a level on par with visuo-tactile agents.

      <title>Learning Dynamical Systems Encoding Non-Linearity within Space Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical Systems (DS) are an effective and powerful means of shaping high-level policies for robotics control. They provide robust and reactive control while ensuring the stability of the driving vector field. The increasing complexity of real-world scenarios necessitates DS with a higher degree of non-linearity, along with the ability to adapt to potential changes in environmental conditions, such as obstacles. Current learning strategies for DSs often involve a trade-off, sacrificing either stability guarantees or offline computational efficiency in order to enhance the capabilities of the learned DS. Online local adaptation to environmental changes is either not taken into consideration or treated as a separate problem. In this paper, our objective is to introduce a method that enhances the complexity of the learned DS without compromising efficiency during training or stability guarantees. Furthermore, we aim to provide a unified approach for seamlessly integrating the initially learned DS's non-linearity with any local non-linearities that may arise due to changes in the environment. We propose a geometrical approach to learn asymptotically stable non-linear DS for robotics control. Each DS is modeled as a harmonic damped oscillator on a latent manifold. By learning the manifold's Euclidean embedded representation, our approach encodes the non-linearity of the DS within the curvature of the space. Having an explicit embedded representation of the manifold allows us to showcase obstacle avoidance by directly inducing local deformations of the space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology through two scenarios: first, the 2D learning of synthetic vector fields, and second, the learning of 3D robotic end-effector motions in real-world settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the real-time estimation of human situation awareness using observations from a robot teammate with limited visibility. In human factors and human-autonomy teaming, it is recognized that individuals navigate their environments using an internal mental simulation, or mental model. The mental model informs cognitive processes including situation awareness, contextual reasoning, and task planning. In teaming domains, the mental model includes a team model of each teammate's beliefs and capabilities, enabling fluent teamwork without the need for explicit communication. However, little work has applied team models to human-robot teaming. We compare the performance of two current methods at estimating user situation awareness over varying visibility conditions. Our results indicate that the methods are largely resilient to low-visibility conditions in our domain, however opportunities exist to improve their overall performance.</description>

      <title>SceneSense: Diffusion Models for 3D Occupancy Synthesis from Partial Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When exploring new areas, robotic systems generally exclusively plan and execute controls over geometry that has been directly measured. When entering space that was previously obstructed from view such as turning corners in hallways or entering new rooms, robots often pause to plan over the newly observed space. To address this we present SceneScene, a real-time 3D diffusion model for synthesizing 3D occupancy information from partial observations that effectively predicts these occluded or out of view geometries for use in future planning and control frameworks. SceneSense uses a running occupancy map and a single RGB-D camera to generate predicted geometry around the platform at runtime, even when the geometry is occluded or out of view. Our architecture ensures that SceneSense never overwrites observed free or occupied space. By preserving the integrity of the observed map, SceneSense mitigates the risk of corrupting the observed space with generative predictions. While SceneSense is shown to operate well using a single RGB-D camera, the framework is flexible enough to extend to additional modalities. SceneSense operates as part of any system that generates a running occupancy map `out of the box', removing conditioning from the framework. Alternatively, for maximum performance in new modalities, the perception backbone can be replaced and the model retrained for inference in new applications. Unlike existing models that necessitate multiple views and offline scene synthesis, or are focused on filling gaps in observed data, our findings demonstrate that SceneSense is an effective approach to estimating unobserved local occupancy information at runtime. Local occupancy predictions from SceneSense are shown to better represent the ground truth occupancy distribution during the test exploration trajectories than the running occupancy map.</description>

      <title>Aligning Learning with Communication in Shared Autonomy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assistive robot arms can help humans by partially automating their desired tasks. Consider an adult with motor impairments controlling an assistive robot arm to eat dinner. The robot can reduce the number of human inputs -- and how precise those inputs need to be -- by recognizing what the human wants (e.g., a fork) and assisting for that task (e.g., moving towards the fork). Prior research has largely focused on learning the human's task and providing meaningful assistance. But as the robot learns and assists, we also need to ensure that the human understands the robot's intent (e.g., does the human know the robot is reaching for a fork?). In this paper, we study the effects of communicating learned assistance from the robot back to the human operator. We do not focus on the specific interfaces used for communication. Instead, we develop experimental and theoretical models of a) how communication changes the way humans interact with assistive robot arms, and b) how robots can harness these changes to better align with the human's intent. We first conduct online and in-person user studies where participants operate robots that provide partial assistance, and we measure how the human's inputs change with and without communication. With communication, we find that humans are more likely to intervene when the robot incorrectly predicts their intent, and more likely to release control when the robot correctly understands their task. We then use these findings to modify an established robot learning algorithm so that the robot can correctly interpret the human's inputs when communication is present. Our results from a second in-person user study suggest that this combination of communication and learning outperforms assistive systems that isolate either learning or communication.</description>

      <title>StereoNavNet: Learning to Navigate using Stereo Cameras with Auxiliary Occupancy Voxels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual navigation has received significant attention recently. Most of the prior works focus on predicting navigation actions based on semantic features extracted from visual encoders. However, these approaches often rely on large datasets and exhibit limited generalizability. In contrast, our approach draws inspiration from traditional navigation planners that operate on geometric representations, such as occupancy maps. We propose StereoNavNet (SNN), a novel visual navigation approach employing a modular learning framework comprising perception and policy modules. Within the perception module, we estimate an auxiliary 3D voxel occupancy grid from stereo RGB images and extract geometric features from it. These features, along with user-defined goals, are utilized by the policy module to predict navigation actions. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that SNN outperforms baseline approaches in terms of success rates, success weighted by path length, and navigation error. Furthermore, SNN exhibits better generalizability, characterized by maintaining leading performance when navigating across previously unseen environments.</description>

      <title>Training Self-localization Models for Unseen Unfamiliar Places via Teacher-to-Student Data-Free Knowledge Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A typical assumption in state-of-the-art self-localization models is that an annotated training dataset is available in the target workspace. However, this does not always hold when a robot travels in a general open-world. This study introduces a novel training scheme for open-world distributed robot systems. In our scheme, a robot ("student") can ask the other robots it meets at unfamiliar places ("teachers") for guidance. Specifically, a pseudo-training dataset is reconstructed from the teacher model and thereafter used for continual learning of the student model. Unlike typical knowledge transfer schemes, our scheme introduces only minimal assumptions on the teacher model, such that it can handle various types of open-set teachers, including uncooperative, untrainable (e.g., image retrieval engines), and blackbox teachers (i.e., data privacy). Rather than relying on the availability of private data of teachers as in existing methods, we propose to exploit an assumption that holds universally in self-localization tasks: "The teacher model is a self-localization system" and to reuse the self-localization system of a teacher as a sole accessible communication channel. We particularly focus on designing an excellent student/questioner whose interactions with teachers can yield effective question-and-answer sequences that can be used as pseudo-training datasets for the student self-localization model. When applied to a generic recursive knowledge distillation scenario, our approach exhibited stable and consistent performance improvement.</description>

      <title>Safe Planning through Incremental Decomposition of Signal Temporal Logic Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trajectory planning is a critical process that enables autonomous systems to safely navigate complex environments. Signal temporal logic (STL) specifications are an effective way to encode complex temporally extended objectives for trajectory planning in cyber-physical systems (CPS). However, planning from these specifications using existing techniques scale exponentially with the number of nested operators and the horizon of specification. Additionally, performance is exacerbated at runtime due to limited computational budgets and compounding modeling errors. Decomposing a complex specification into smaller subtasks and incrementally planning for them can remedy these issues. In this work, we present a way to decompose STL requirements temporally to improve planning efficiency and performance. The key insight in our work is to encode all specifications as a set of reachability and invariance constraints and scheduling these constraints sequentially at runtime. Our proposed technique outperforms the state-of-the-art trajectory synthesis techniques for both linear and non linear dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Scheduling Drone and Mobile Charger via Hybrid-Action Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently there has been a growing interest in industry and academia, regarding the use of wireless chargers to prolong the operational longevity of unmanned aerial vehicles (commonly knowns as drones). In this paper we consider a charger-assisted drone application: a drone is deployed to observe a set points of interest, while a charger can move to recharge the drone's battery. We focus on the route and charging schedule of the drone and the mobile charger, to obtain high observation utility with the shortest possible time, while ensuring the drone remains operational during task execution. Essentially, this proposed drone-charger scheduling problem is a multi-stage decision-making process, in which the drone and the mobile charger act as two agents who cooperate to finish a task. The discrete-continuous hybrid action space of the two agents poses a significant challenge in our problem. To address this issue, we present a hybrid-action deep reinforcement learning framework, called HaDMC, which uses a standard policy learning algorithm to generate latent continuous actions. Motivated by representation learning, we specifically design and train an action decoder. It involves two pipelines to convert the latent continuous actions into original discrete and continuous actions, by which the drone and the charger can directly interact with environment. We embed a mutual learning scheme in model training, emphasizing the collaborative rather than individual actions. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to evaluate HaDMC and compare it with state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning approaches. The experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our solution.</description>

      <title>From Words to Routes: Applying Large Language Models to Vehicle Routing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLMs have shown impressive progress in robotics (e.g., manipulation and navigation) with natural language task descriptions. The success of LLMs in these tasks leads us to wonder: What is the ability of LLMs to solve vehicle routing problems (VRPs) with natural language task descriptions? In this work, we study this question in three steps. First, we construct a dataset with 21 types of single- or multi-vehicle routing problems. Second, we evaluate the performance of LLMs across four basic prompt paradigms of text-to-code generation, each involving different types of text input. We find that the basic prompt paradigm, which generates code directly from natural language task descriptions, performs the best for GPT-4, achieving 56% feasibility, 40% optimality, and 53% efficiency. Third, based on the observation that LLMs may not be able to provide correct solutions at the initial attempt, we propose a framework that enables LLMs to refine solutions through self-reflection, including self-debugging and self-verification. With GPT-4, our proposed framework achieves a 16% increase in feasibility, a 7% increase in optimality, and a 15% increase in efficiency. Moreover, we examine the sensitivity of GPT-4 to task descriptions, specifically focusing on how its performance changes when certain details are omitted from the task descriptions, yet the core meaning is preserved. Our findings reveal that such omissions lead to a notable decrease in performance: 4% in feasibility, 4% in optimality, and 5% in efficiency.

      <description>arXiv:2403.10814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans have the remarkable ability to construct consistent mental models of an environment, even under limited or varying levels of illumination. We wish to endow robots with this same capability. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of constructing a photorealistic scene representation under poorly illuminated conditions and with a moving light source. We approach the task of modeling illumination as a learning problem, and utilize the developed illumination model to aid in scene reconstruction. We introduce an innovative framework that uses a data-driven approach, Neural Light Simulators (NeLiS), to model and calibrate the camera-light system. Furthermore, we present DarkGS, a method that applies NeLiS to create a relightable 3D Gaussian scene model capable of real-time, photorealistic rendering from novel viewpoints. We show the applicability and robustness of our proposed simulator and system in a variety of real-world environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current thesis aims to explore the reinforcement learning field and build on existing methods to produce improved ones to tackle the problem of learning in high-dimensional and complex environments. It addresses such goals by decomposing learning tasks in a hierarchical fashion known as Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning.
  We start in the first chapter by getting familiar with the Markov Decision Process framework and presenting some of its recent techniques that the following chapters use. We then proceed to build our Hierarchical Policy learning as an answer to the limitations of a single primitive policy. The hierarchy is composed of a manager agent at the top and employee agents at the lower level.
  In the last chapter, which is the core of this thesis, we attempt to learn lower-level elements of the hierarchy independently of the manager level in what is known as the "Eigenoption". Based on the graph structure of the environment, Eigenoptions allow us to build agents that are aware of the geometric and dynamic properties of the environment. Their decision-making has a special property: it is invariant to symmetric transformations of the environment, allowing as a consequence to greatly reduce the complexity of the learning task.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Powered Context-aware Motion Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion prediction is among the most fundamental tasks in autonomous driving. Traditional methods of motion forecasting primarily encode vector information of maps and historical trajectory data of traffic participants, lacking a comprehensive understanding of overall traffic semantics, which in turn affects the performance of prediction tasks. In this paper, we utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the global traffic context understanding for motion prediction tasks. We first conducted systematic prompt engineering, visualizing complex traffic environments and historical trajectory information of traffic participants into image prompts -- Transportation Context Map (TC-Map), accompanied by corresponding text prompts. Through this approach, we obtained rich traffic context information from the LLM. By integrating this information into the motion prediction model, we demonstrate that such context can enhance the accuracy of motion predictions. Furthermore, considering the cost associated with LLMs, we propose a cost-effective deployment strategy: enhancing the accuracy of motion prediction tasks at scale with 0.7\% LLM-augmented datasets. Our research offers valuable insights into enhancing the understanding of traffic scenes of LLMs and the motion prediction performance of autonomous driving.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel model-based adaptive shared control to allow for the identification and design challenge for shared-control systems, in which humans and automation share control tasks. The main challenge is the adaptive behavior of the human in such shared control interactions. Consequently, merely identifying human behavior without considering automation is insufficient and often leads to inadequate automation design. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel solution involving online identification of the human and the adaptation of shared control using Linear-Quadratic differential games. The effectiveness of the proposed online adaptation is analyzed in simulations and compared with a non-adaptive shared control from the state of the art. Finally, the proposed approach is tested through human-in-the-loop experiments, highlighting its suitability for real-time applications.</description>

      <title>Compact 3D Gaussian Splatting For Dense Visual SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that 3D Gaussian-based SLAM enables high-quality reconstruction, accurate pose estimation, and real-time rendering of scenes. However, these approaches are built on a tremendous number of redundant 3D Gaussian ellipsoids, leading to high memory and storage costs, and slow training speed. To address the limitation, we propose a compact 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system that reduces the number and the parameter size of Gaussian ellipsoids. A sliding window-based masking strategy is first proposed to reduce the redundant ellipsoids. Then we observe that the covariance matrix (geometry) of most 3D Gaussian ellipsoids are extremely similar, which motivates a novel geometry codebook to compress 3D Gaussian geometric attributes, i.e., the parameters. Robust and accurate pose estimation is achieved by a global bundle adjustment method with reprojection loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves faster training and rendering speed while maintaining the state-of-the-art (SOTA) quality of the scene representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel system designed for 3D mapping and visual relocalization using 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our proposed method uses LiDAR and camera data to create accurate and visually plausible representations of the environment. By leveraging LiDAR data to initiate the training of the 3D Gaussian Splatting map, our system constructs maps that are both detailed and geometrically accurate. To mitigate excessive GPU memory usage and facilitate rapid spatial queries, we employ a combination of a 2D voxel map and a KD-tree. This preparation makes our method well-suited for visual localization tasks, enabling efficient identification of correspondences between the query image and the rendered image from the Gaussian Splatting map via normalized cross-correlation (NCC). Additionally, we refine the camera pose of the query image using feature-based matching and the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) technique. The effectiveness, adaptability, and precision of our system are demonstrated through extensive evaluation on the KITTI360 dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The assumption of a static environment is common in many geometric computer vision tasks like SLAM but limits their applicability in highly dynamic scenes. Since these tasks rely on identifying point correspondences between input images within the static part of the environment, we propose a graph neural network-based sparse feature matching network designed to perform robust matching under challenging conditions while excluding keypoints on moving objects. We employ a similar scheme of attentional aggregation over graph edges to enhance keypoint representations as state-of-the-art feature-matching networks but augment the graph with epipolar and temporal information and vastly reduce the number of graph edges. Furthermore, we introduce a self-supervised training scheme to extract pseudo labels for image pairs in dynamic environments from exclusively unprocessed visual-inertial data. A series of experiments show the superior performance of our network as it excludes keypoints on moving objects compared to state-of-the-art feature matching networks while still achieving similar results regarding conventional matching metrics. When integrated into a SLAM system, our network significantly improves performance, especially in highly dynamic scenes.</description>

Abstract: Predicting the future motion of surrounding agents is essential for autonomous vehicles (AVs) to operate safely in dynamic, human-robot-mixed environments. Context information, such as road maps and surrounding agents' states, provides crucial geometric and semantic information for motion behavior prediction. To this end, recent works explore two-stage prediction frameworks where coarse trajectories are first proposed, and then used to select critical context information for trajectory refinement. However, they either incur a large amount of computation or bring limited improvement, if not both. In this paper, we introduce a novel scenario-adaptive refinement strategy, named SmartRefine, to refine prediction with minimal additional computation. Specifically, SmartRefine can comprehensively adapt refinement configurations based on each scenario's properties, and smartly chooses the number of refinement iterations by introducing a quality score to measure the prediction quality and remaining refinement potential of each scenario. SmartRefine is designed as a generic and flexible approach that can be seamlessly integrated into most state-of-the-art motion prediction models. Experiments on Argoverse (1 &amp; 2) show that our method consistently improves the prediction accuracy of multiple state-of-the-art prediction models. Specifically, by adding SmartRefine to QCNet, we outperform all published ensemble-free works on the Argoverse 2 leaderboard (single agent track) at submission. Comprehensive studies are also conducted to ablate design choices and explore the mechanism behind multi-iteration refinement.

      <title>SSAP: A Shape-Sensitive Adversarial Patch for Comprehensive Disruption of Monocular Depth Estimation in Autonomous Navigation Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) has advanced significantly, primarily through the integration of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and more recently, Transformers. However, concerns about their susceptibility to adversarial attacks have emerged, especially in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving and robotic navigation. Existing approaches for assessing CNN-based depth prediction methods have fallen short in inducing comprehensive disruptions to the vision system, often limited to specific local areas. In this paper, we introduce SSAP (Shape-Sensitive Adversarial Patch), a novel approach designed to comprehensively disrupt monocular depth estimation (MDE) in autonomous navigation applications. Our patch is crafted to selectively undermine MDE in two distinct ways: by distorting estimated distances or by creating the illusion of an object disappearing from the system's perspective. Notably, our patch is shape-sensitive, meaning it considers the specific shape and scale of the target object, thereby extending its influence beyond immediate proximity. Furthermore, our patch is trained to effectively address different scales and distances from the camera. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach induces a mean depth estimation error surpassing 0.5, impacting up to 99% of the targeted region for CNN-based MDE models. Additionally, we investigate the vulnerability of Transformer-based MDE models to patch-based attacks, revealing that SSAP yields a significant error of 0.59 and exerts substantial influence over 99% of the target region on these models.</description>

      <title>3DGS-Calib: 3D Gaussian Splatting for Multimodal SpatioTemporal Calibration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable multimodal sensor fusion algorithms re- quire accurate spatiotemporal calibration. Recently, targetless calibration techniques based on implicit neural representations have proven to provide precise and robust results. Nevertheless, such methods are inherently slow to train given the high compu- tational overhead caused by the large number of sampled points required for volume rendering. With the recent introduction of 3D Gaussian Splatting as a faster alternative to implicit representation methods, we propose to leverage this new ren- dering approach to achieve faster multi-sensor calibration. We introduce 3DGS-Calib, a new calibration method that relies on the speed and rendering accuracy of 3D Gaussian Splatting to achieve multimodal spatiotemporal calibration that is accurate, robust, and with a substantial speed-up compared to methods relying on implicit neural representations. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposal with experimental results on sequences from KITTI-360, a widely used driving dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to predict the future trajectories of traffic participants is crucial for the safe and efficient operation of autonomous vehicles. In this paper, a diffusion-based generative model for multi-agent trajectory prediction is proposed. The model is capable of capturing the complex interactions between traffic participants and the environment, accurately learning the multimodal nature of the data. The effectiveness of the approach is assessed on large-scale datasets of real-world traffic scenarios, showing that our model outperforms several well-established methods in terms of prediction accuracy. By the incorporation of differential motion constraints on the model output, we illustrate that our model is capable of generating a diverse set of realistic future trajectories. Through the use of an interaction-aware guidance signal, we further demonstrate that the model can be adapted to predict the behavior of less cooperative agents, emphasizing its practical applicability under uncertain traffic conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose NEDS-SLAM, an Explicit Dense semantic SLAM system based on 3D Gaussian representation, that enables robust 3D semantic mapping, accurate camera tracking, and high-quality rendering in real-time. In the system, we propose a Spatially Consistent Feature Fusion model to reduce the effect of erroneous estimates from pre-trained segmentation head on semantic reconstruction, achieving robust 3D semantic Gaussian mapping. Additionally, we employ a lightweight encoder-decoder to compress the high-dimensional semantic features into a compact 3D Gaussian representation, mitigating the burden of excessive memory consumption. Furthermore, we leverage the advantage of 3D Gaussian splatting, which enables efficient and differentiable novel view rendering, and propose a Virtual Camera View Pruning method to eliminate outlier GS points, thereby effectively enhancing the quality of scene representations. Our NEDS-SLAM method demonstrates competitive performance over existing dense semantic SLAM methods in terms of mapping and tracking accuracy on Replica and ScanNet datasets, while also showing excellent capabilities in 3D dense semantic mapping.</description>

Abstract: Validating robotic systems in safety-critical appli-cations requires testing in many scenarios including rare edgecases that are unlikely to occur, requiring to complement real-world testing with testing in simulation. Generative models canbe used to augment real-world datasets with generated data toproduce edge case scenarios by sampling in a learned latentspace. Autoencoders can learn said latent representation for aspecific domain by learning to reconstruct the input data froma lower-dimensional intermediate representation. However, theresulting trajectories are not necessarily physically plausible, butinstead typically contain noise that is not present in the inputtrajectory. To resolve this issue, we propose the novel Physics-Informed Trajectory Autoencoder (PITA) architecture, whichincorporates a physical dynamics model into the loss functionof the autoencoder. This results in smooth trajectories that notonly reconstruct the input trajectory but also adhere to thephysical model. We evaluate PITA on a real-world dataset ofvehicle trajectories and compare its performance to a normalautoencoder and a state-of-the-art action-space autoencoder.</description>

      <title>OpenOcc: Open Vocabulary 3D Scene Reconstruction via Occupancy Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D reconstruction has been widely used in autonomous navigation fields of mobile robotics. However, the former research can only provide the basic geometry structure without the capability of open-world scene understanding, limiting advanced tasks like human interaction and visual navigation. Moreover, traditional 3D scene understanding approaches rely on expensive labeled 3D datasets to train a model for a single task with supervision. Thus, geometric reconstruction with zero-shot scene understanding i.e. Open vocabulary 3D Understanding and Reconstruction, is crucial for the future development of mobile robots. In this paper, we propose OpenOcc, a novel framework unifying the 3D scene reconstruction and open vocabulary understanding with neural radiance fields. We model the geometric structure of the scene with occupancy representation and distill the pre-trained open vocabulary model into a 3D language field via volume rendering for zero-shot inference. Furthermore, a novel semantic-aware confidence propagation (SCP) method has been proposed to relieve the issue of language field representation degeneracy caused by inconsistent measurements in distilled features. Experimental results show that our approach achieves competitive performance in 3D scene understanding tasks, especially for small and long-tail objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is challenging for autonomous control systems to perform complex tasks in the presence of latent risks. Motivated by this challenge, this paper proposes an integrated framework that involves Large Language Models (LLMs), stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and optimization-based control. In the first phrase, the proposed framework breaks down complex tasks into a sequence of smaller subtasks, whose specifications account for contextual information and latent risks. In the second phase, these subtasks and their parameters are refined through a dual process involving LLMs and SGD. LLMs are used to generate rough guesses and failure explanations, and SGD is used to fine-tune parameters. The proposed framework is tested using simulated case studies of robots and vehicles. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can mediate actions based on the context and latent risks and learn complex behaviors efficiently.</description>

Abstract: Active traffic management incorporating autonomous vehicles (AVs) promises a future with diminished congestion and enhanced traffic flow. However, developing algorithms for real-world application requires addressing the challenges posed by continuous traffic flow and partial observability. To bridge this gap and advance the field of active traffic management towards greater decentralization, we introduce a novel asymmetric actor-critic model aimed at learning decentralized cooperative driving policies for autonomous vehicles using single-agent reinforcement learning. Our approach employs attention neural networks with masking to handle the dynamic nature of real-world traffic flow and partial observability. Through extensive evaluations against baseline controllers across various traffic scenarios, our model shows great potential for improving traffic flow at diverse bottleneck locations within the road system. Additionally, we explore the challenge associated with the conservative driving behaviors of autonomous vehicles that adhere strictly to traffic regulations. The experiment results illustrate that our proposed cooperative policy can mitigate potential traffic slowdowns without compromising safety.</description>

Abstract: Robots often face situations where grasping a goal object is desirable but not feasible due to other present objects preventing the grasp action. We present a deep Reinforcement Learning approach to learn grasping and pushing policies for manipulating a goal object in highly cluttered environments to address this problem. In particular, a dual Reinforcement Learning model approach is proposed, which presents high resilience in handling complicated scenes, reaching an average of 98% task completion using primitive objects in a simulation environment. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we performed two extensive sets of experiments in packed objects and a pile of object scenarios with a total of 1000 test runs in simulation. Experimental results showed that the proposed method worked very well in both scenarios and outperformed the recent state-of-the-art approaches. Demo video, trained models, and source code for the results reproducibility purpose are publicly available. https://sites.google.com/view/pushandgrasp/home</description>

Abstract: The ability of robots to model their own dynamics is key to autonomous planning and learning, as well as for autonomous damage detection and recovery. Traditionally, dynamic models are pre-programmed or learned from external observations. Here, we demonstrate for the first time how a task-agnostic dynamic self-model can be learned using only a single first-person-view camera in a self-supervised manner, without any prior knowledge of robot morphology, kinematics, or task. Through experiments on a 12-DoF robot, we demonstrate the capabilities of the model in basic locomotion tasks using visual input. Notably, the robot can autonomously detect anomalies, such as damaged components, and adapt its behavior, showcasing resilience in dynamic environments. Furthermore, the model's generalizability was validated across robots with different configurations, emphasizing its potential as a universal tool for diverse robotic systems. The egocentric visual self-model proposed in our work paves the way for more autonomous, adaptable, and resilient robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Laboratory Automation Through Robot Skill Learning For Sample Scraping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.14875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of laboratory robotics for autonomous experiments offers an attractive route to alleviate scientists from tedious tasks while accelerating material discovery for topical issues such as climate change and pharmaceuticals. While some experimental workflows can already benefit from automation, sample preparation is still carried out manually due to the high level of motor function and dexterity required when dealing with different tools, chemicals, and glassware. A fundamental workflow in chemical fields is crystallisation, where one application is polymorph screening, i.e., obtaining a three dimensional molecular structure from a crystal. For this process, it is of utmost importance to recover as much of the sample as possible since synthesising molecules is both costly in time and money. To this aim, chemists scrape vials to retrieve sample contents prior to imaging plate transfer. Automating this process is challenging as it goes beyond robotic insertion tasks due to a fundamental requirement of having to execute fine-granular movements within a constrained environment (sample vial). Motivated by how human chemists carry out this process of scraping powder from vials, our work proposes a model-free reinforcement learning method for learning a scraping policy, leading to a fully autonomous sample scraping procedure. We first create a scenario-specific simulation environment with a Panda Franka Emika robot using a laboratory scraper that is inserted into a simulated vial, to demonstrate how a scraping policy can be learned successfully in simulation. We then train and evaluate our method on a real robotic manipulator in laboratory settings, and show that our method can autonomously scrape powder across various setups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13024v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Movement generation, and especially generalisation to unseen situations, plays an important role in robotics. Different types of movement generation methods exist such as spline based methods, dynamical system based methods, and methods based on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). Using a large, new dataset on human manipulations, in this paper we provide a highly detailed comparison of five fundamentally different and widely used movement encoding and generation frameworks: dynamic movement primitives (DMPs), time based Gaussian mixture regression (tbGMR), stable estimator of dynamical systems (SEDS), Probabilistic Movement Primitives (ProMP) and Optimal Control Primitives (OCP). We compare these frameworks with respect to their movement encoding efficiency, reconstruction accuracy, and movement generalisation capabilities. The new dataset consists of nine object manipulation actions performed by 12 humans: pick and place, put on top/take down, put inside/take out, hide/uncover, and push/pull with a total of 7,652 movement examples. Our analysis shows that for movement encoding and reconstruction DMPs and OCPs are the most efficient with respect to the number of parameters and reconstruction accuracy, if a sufficient number of kernels is used. In case of movement generalisation to new start- and end-point situations, DMPs, OCPs and task parameterized GMM (TP-GMM, movement generalisation framework based on tbGMR) lead to similar performance, which ProMPs only achieve when using many demonstrations for learning. All models outperform SEDS, which additionally proves to be difficult to fit. Furthermore we observe that TP-GMM and SEDS suffer from problems reaching the end-points of generalizations.These different quantitative results will help selecting the most appropriate models and designing trajectory representations in an improved task-dependent way in future robotic applications.</description>

      <title>A Convex Hull Cheapest Insertion Heuristic for Precedence Constrained Traveling Salesperson Problems or Sequential Ordering Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The convex hull cheapest insertion heuristic is a well-known method that efficiently generates good solutions to the Traveling Salesperson Problem. However, this heuristic has not been adapted to account for precedence constraints that restrict the order in which locations can be visited. Such constraints result in the precedence constrained traveling salesperson problem or the sequential ordering problem, which are commonly encountered in applications where items have to be picked up before they are delivered. In this paper, we present an adapted version of this heuristic that accounts for precedence constraints in the problem definition. This algorithm is compared with the widely used Nearest Neighbor heuristic on the TSPLIB benchmark data with added precedence constraints. It is seen that the proposed algorithm is particularly well suited to cases where delivery nodes are centrally positioned, with pickup nodes located in the periphery, outperforming the Nearest Neighbor algorithm in 97\% of the examined instances.</description>

Abstract: In agricultural environments, viewpoint planning can be a critical functionality for a robot with visual sensors to obtain informative observations of objects of interest (e.g., fruits) from complex structures of plant with random occlusions. Although recent studies on active vision have shown some potential for agricultural tasks, each model has been designed and validated on a unique environment that would not easily be replicated for benchmarking novel methods being developed later. In this paper, we introduce a dataset, so-called DAVIS-Ag, for promoting more extensive research on Domain-inspired Active VISion in Agriculture. To be specific, we leveraged our open-source "AgML" framework and 3D plant simulator of "Helios" to produce 502K RGB images from 30K densely sampled spatial locations in 632 synthetic orchards. Moreover, plant environments of strawberries, tomatoes, and grapes are considered at two different scales (i.e., Single-Plant and Multi-Plant). Useful labels are also provided for each image, including (1) bounding boxes and (2) instance segmentation masks for all identifiable fruits, and also (3) pointers to other images of the viewpoints that are reachable by an execution of action so as to simulate active viewpoint selections at each time step. Using DAVIS-Ag, we visualize motivating examples where fruit detection rates can dramatically change depending on the pose of the camera view primarily due to occlusions by other components, such as leaves. Furthermore, we present several baseline models with experiment results for benchmarking in the task of target visibility maximization. Transferability to real strawberry environments is also investigated to demonstrate the feasibility of using the dataset for prototyping real-world solutions. For future research, our dataset is made publicly available online: https://github.com/ctyeong/DAVIS-Ag.</description>

Abstract: Improving the generalization capabilities of general-purpose robotic manipulation agents in the real world has long been a significant challenge. Existing approaches often rely on collecting large-scale robotic data which is costly and time-consuming, such as the RT-1 dataset. However, due to insufficient diversity of data, these approaches typically suffer from limiting their capability in open-domain scenarios with new objects and diverse environments. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that effectively leverages language-reasoning segmentation mask generated by internet-scale foundation models, to condition robot manipulation tasks. By integrating the mask modality, which incorporates semantic, geometric, and temporal correlation priors derived from vision foundation models, into the end-to-end policy model, our approach can effectively and robustly perceive object pose and enable sample-efficient generalization learning, including new object instances, semantic categories, and unseen backgrounds. We first introduce a series of foundation models to ground natural language demands across multiple tasks. Secondly, we develop a two-stream 2D policy model based on imitation learning, which processes raw images and object masks to predict robot actions with a local-global perception manner. Extensive realworld experiments conducted on a Franka Emika robot arm demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed paradigm and policy architecture. Demos can be found in our submitted video, and more comprehensive ones can be found in link1 or link2.</description>

      <title>Learning Continuous Control with Geometric Regularity from Robot Intrinsic Symmetry</title>

Abstract: Geometric regularity, which leverages data symmetry, has been successfully incorporated into deep learning architectures such as CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers. While this concept has been widely applied in robotics to address the curse of dimensionality when learning from high-dimensional data, the inherent reflectional and rotational symmetry of robot structures has not been adequately explored. Drawing inspiration from cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, we introduce novel network structures for single-agent control learning that explicitly capture these symmetries. Moreover, we investigate the relationship between the geometric prior and the concept of Parameter Sharing in multi-agent reinforcement learning. Last but not the least, we implement the proposed framework in online and offline learning methods to demonstrate its ease of use. Through experiments conducted on various challenging continuous control tasks on simulators and real robots, we highlight the significant potential of the proposed geometric regularity in enhancing robot learning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Parallel Self-assembly for a Multi-USV System on Water Surface with Obstacles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parallel self-assembly is an efficient approach to accelerate the assembly process for modular robots. However, these approaches cannot accommodate complicated environments with obstacles, which restricts their applications. This paper considers the surrounding stationary obstacles and proposes a parallel self-assembly planning algorithm named SAPOA. With this algorithm, modular robots can avoid immovable obstacles when performing docking actions, which adapts the parallel self-assembly process to complex scenes. To validate the efficiency and scalability, we have designed 25 distinct grid maps with different obstacle configurations to simulate the algorithm. From the results compared to the existing parallel self-assembly algorithms, our algorithm shows a significantly higher success rate, which is more than 80%. For verification in real-world applications, a multi-agent hardware testbed system is developed. The algorithm is successfully deployed on four omnidirectional unmanned surface vehicles, CuBoats. The navigation strategy that translates the discrete planner, SAPOA, to the continuous controller on the CuBoats is presented. The algorithm's feasibility and flexibility were demonstrated through successful self-assembly experiments on 5 maps with varying obstacle configurations.</description>

      <title>Representing Robot Geometry as Distance Fields: Applications to Whole-body Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00533v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel approach to represent robot geometry as distance fields (RDF) that extends the principle of signed distance fields (SDFs) to articulated kinematic chains. Our method employs a combination of Bernstein polynomials to encode the signed distance for each robot link with high accuracy and efficiency while ensuring the mathematical continuity and differentiability of SDFs. We further leverage the kinematics chain of the robot to produce the SDF representation in joint space, allowing robust distance queries in arbitrary joint configurations. The proposed RDF representation is differentiable and smooth in both task and joint spaces, enabling its direct integration to optimization problems. Additionally, the 0-level set of the robot corresponds to the robot surface, which can be seamlessly integrated into whole-body manipulation tasks. We conduct various experiments in both simulations and with 7-axis Franka Emika robots, comparing against baseline methods, and demonstrating its effectiveness in collision avoidance and whole-body manipulation tasks.

      <title>Learning Fine Pinch-Grasp Skills using Tactile Sensing from A Few Real-world Demonstrations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imitation learning for robot dexterous manipulation, especially with a real robot setup, typically requires a large number of demonstrations. In this paper, we present a data-efficient learning from demonstration framework which exploits the use of rich tactile sensing data and achieves fine bimanual pinch grasping. Specifically, we employ a convolutional autoencoder network that can effectively extract and encode high-dimensional tactile information. Further, We develop a framework that achieves efficient multi-sensor fusion for imitation learning, allowing the robot to learn contact-aware sensorimotor skills from demonstrations. Our comparision study against the framework without using encoded tactile features highlighted the effectiveness of incorporating rich contact information, which enabled dexterous bimanual grasping with active contact searching. Extensive experiments demonstrated the robustness of the fine pinch grasp policy directly learned from few-shot demonstration, including grasping of the same object with different initial poses, generalizing to ten unseen new objects, robust and firm grasping against external pushes, as well as contact-aware and reactive re-grasping in case of dropping objects under very large perturbations. Furthermore, the saliency map analysis method is used to describe weight distribution across various modalities during pinch grasping, confirming the effectiveness of our framework at leveraging multimodal information.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the biomimicry gap in biohybrid robot-fish pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biohybrid systems in which robotic lures interact with animals have become compelling tools for probing and identifying the mechanisms underlying collective animal behavior. One key challenge lies in the transfer of social interaction models from simulations to reality, using robotics to validate the modeling hypotheses. This challenge arises in bridging what we term the "biomimicry gap", which is caused by imperfect robotic replicas, communication cues and physics constraints not incorporated in the simulations, that may elicit unrealistic behavioral responses in animals. In this work, we used a biomimetic lure of a rummy-nose tetra fish (Hemigrammus rhodostomus) and a neural network (NN) model for generating biomimetic social interactions. Through experiments with a biohybrid pair comprising a fish and the robotic lure, a pair of real fish, and simulations of pairs of fish, we demonstrate that our biohybrid system generates social interactions mirroring those of genuine fish pairs. Our analyses highlight that: 1) the lure and NN maintain minimal deviation in real-world interactions compared to simulations and fish-only experiments, 2) our NN controls the robot efficiently in real-time, and 3) a comprehensive validation is crucial to bridge the biomimicry gap, ensuring realistic biohybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Pointing the Way: Refining Radar-Lidar Localization Using Learned ICP Weights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep-learning-based approach to improve localizing radar measurements against lidar maps. Although the state of the art for localization is matching lidar data to lidar maps, radar has been considered as a promising alternative. This is largely due to radar being more resilient against adverse weather such as precipitation and heavy fog. To make use of existing high-quality lidar maps, while maintaining performance in adverse weather, it is of interest to match radar data to lidar maps. However, owing in part to the unique artefacts present in radar measurements, radar-lidar localization has struggled to achieve comparable performance to lidar-lidar systems, preventing it from being viable for autonomous driving. This work builds on an ICP-based radar-lidar localization system by including a learned preprocessing step that weights radar points based on high-level scan information. Combining a proven analytical approach with a learned weight reduces localization errors in radar-lidar ICP results run on real-world autonomous driving data by up to 54.94% in translation and 68.39% in rotation, while maintaining interpretability and robustness.</description>

Abstract: Mass casualty incidents (MCIs) pose a significant challenge to emergency medical services by overwhelming available resources and personnel. Effective victim assessment is the key to minimizing casualties during such a crisis. We introduce ARTEMIS, an AI-driven Robotic Triage Labeling and Emergency Medical Information System, to aid first responders in MCI events. It leverages speech processing, natural language processing, and deep learning to help with acuity classification. This is deployed on a quadruped that performs victim localization and preliminary injury severity assessment. First responders access victim information through a Graphical User Interface that is updated in real-time. To validate our proposed algorithmic triage protocol, we used the Unitree Go1 quadruped. The robot identifies humans, interacts with them, gets vitals and information, and assigns an acuity label. Simulations of an MCI in software and a controlled environment outdoors were conducted. The system achieved a triage-level classification precision of over 74% on average and 99% for the most critical victims, i.e. level 1 acuity, outperforming state-of-the-art deep learning-based triage labeling systems. In this paper, we showcase the potential of human-robot interaction in assisting medical personnel in MCI events.</description>

      <title>Learning Inertial Parameter Identification of Unknown Object with Humanoid Robot using Real-to-Sim Adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a fast learning-based inertial parameters estimation framework capable of understanding the dynamics of an unknown object to enable a humanoid (or manipulator) to more safely and accurately interact with its surrounding environments. Unlike most relevant literature, our framework doesn't require to use of a force/torque sensor, vision system, and a long-horizon trajectory. To achieve fast inertia parameter estimation, a time-series data-driven regression model is utilized rather than solving a constrained optimization problem. Due to the challenge of obtaining a large number of the ground truth of inertia parameters in the real world, we acquire a reliable dataset in a high-fidelity simulation that is developed using a real-to-sim adaptation. The adaptation method we introduced consists of two components: 1) \textit{Robot System Identification} and 2) \textit{Gaussian Processes}. We demonstrate our method with a 4-DOF single manipulator of a wheeled humanoid robot, SATYRR. Results show that our method can identify the inertial parameters of various unknown objects quickly while maintaining sufficient accuracy compared to other methods. Manipulation and locomotion experiments were also carried out to show the benefit of using the estimated inertia parameters from control perspective.</description>

      <title>Exposing the Unseen: Exposure Time Emulation for Offline Benchmarking of Vision Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual Odometry (VO) is one of the fundamental tasks in computer vision for robotics. However, its performance is deeply affected by High Dynamic Range (HDR) scenes, omnipresent outdoor. While new Automatic-Exposure (AE) approaches to mitigate this have appeared, their comparison in a reproducible manner is problematic. This stems from the fact that the behavior of AE depends on the environment, and it affects the image acquisition process. Consequently, AE has traditionally only been benchmarked in an online manner, making the experiments non-reproducible. To solve this, we propose a new methodology based on an emulator that can generate images at any exposure time. It leverages BorealHDR, a unique multi-exposure stereo dataset collected over 10 km, on 55 trajectories with challenging illumination conditions. Moreover, it includes lidar-inertial-based global maps with pose estimation for each image frame as well as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data, for comparison. We show that using these images acquired at different exposure times, we can emulate realistic images, keeping a Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) below 1.78 % compared to ground truth images. To demonstrate the practicality of our approach for offline benchmarking, we compared three state-of-the-art AE algorithms on key elements of Visual Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (VSLAM) pipeline, against four baselines. Consequently, reproducible evaluation of AE is now possible, speeding up the development of future approaches. Our code and dataset are available online at this link: https://github.com/norlab-ulaval/BorealHDR</description>

      <title>How Physics and Background Attributes Impact Video Transformers in Robotic Manipulation: A Case Study on Planar Pushing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02044v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As model and dataset sizes continue to scale in robot learning, the need to understand what is the specific factor in the dataset that affects model performance becomes increasingly urgent to ensure cost-effective data collection and model performance. In this work, we empirically investigate how physics attributes (color, friction coefficient, shape) and scene background characteristics, such as the complexity and dynamics of interactions with background objects, influence the performance of Video Transformers in predicting planar pushing trajectories. We aim to investigate three primary questions: How do physics attributes and background scene characteristics influence model performance? What kind of changes in attributes are most detrimental to model generalization? What proportion of fine-tuning data is required to adapt models to novel scenarios? To facilitate this research, we present CloudGripper-Push-1K, a large real-world vision-based robot pushing dataset comprising 1278 hours and 460,000 videos of planar pushing interactions with objects with different physics and background attributes. We also propose Video Occlusion Transformer (VOT), a generic modular video-transformer-based trajectory prediction framework which features 3 choices of 2D-spatial encoders as the subject of our case study. Dataset and codes will be available at https://cloudgripper.org.</description>

      <title>${\tt MORALS}$: Analysis of High-Dimensional Robot Controllers via Topological Tools in a Latent Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating the region of attraction (${\tt RoA}$) for a robot controller is essential for safe application and controller composition. Many existing methods require a closed-form expression that limit applicability to data-driven controllers. Methods that operate only over trajectory rollouts tend to be data-hungry. In prior work, we have demonstrated that topological tools based on ${\it Morse Graphs}$ (directed acyclic graphs that combinatorially represent the underlying nonlinear dynamics) offer data-efficient ${\tt RoA}$ estimation without needing an analytical model. They struggle, however, with high-dimensional systems as they operate over a state-space discretization. This paper presents ${\it Mo}$rse Graph-aided discovery of ${\it R}$egions of ${\it A}$ttraction in a learned ${\it L}$atent ${\it S}$pace (${\tt MORALS}$). The approach combines auto-encoding neural networks with Morse Graphs. ${\tt MORALS}$ shows promising predictive capabilities in estimating attractors and their ${\tt RoA}$s for data-driven controllers operating over high-dimensional systems, including a 67-dim humanoid robot and a 96-dim 3-fingered manipulator. It first projects the dynamics of the controlled system into a learned latent space. Then, it constructs a reduced form of Morse Graphs representing the bistability of the underlying dynamics, i.e., detecting when the controller results in a desired versus an undesired behavior. The evaluation on high-dimensional robotic datasets indicates data efficiency in ${\tt RoA}$ estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Addressing the challenge of organizing scattered items in domestic spaces is complicated by the diversity and subjective nature of tidiness. Just as the complexity of human language allows for multiple expressions of the same idea, household tidiness preferences and organizational patterns vary widely, so presetting object locations would limit the adaptability to new objects and environments. Inspired by advancements in natural language processing (NLP), this paper introduces a self-supervised learning framework that allows robots to understand and replicate the concept of tidiness from demonstrations of well-organized layouts, akin to using conversational datasets to train Large Language Models(LLM). We leverage a transformer neural network to predict the placement of subsequent objects. We demonstrate a ``knolling'' system with a robotic arm and an RGB camera to organize items of varying sizes and quantities on a table. Our method not only trains a generalizable concept of tidiness, enabling the model to provide diverse solutions and adapt to different numbers of objects, but it can also incorporate human preferences to generate customized tidy tables without explicit target positions for each object.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current state-of-the-art gradient-based optimisation frameworks are able to produce impressive dynamic manoeuvres such as linear and rotational jumps. However, these methods, which optimise over the full rigid-body dynamics of the robot, often require precise foothold locations apriori, while real-time performance is not guaranteed without elaborate regularisation and tuning of the cost function. In contrast, we investigate the advantages of a task-space optimisation framework, with special focus on acrobatic motions. Our proposed formulation exploits the system's high-order nonlinearities, such as the nonholonomy of the angular momentum, in order to produce feasible, high-acceleration manoeuvres. By leveraging the full-centroidal dynamics of the quadruped ANYmal C and directly optimising its footholds and contact forces, the framework is capable of producing efficient motion plans with low computational overhead. Finally, we deploy our proposed framework on the ANYmal C platform, and demonstrate its true capabilities through real-world experiments, with the successful execution of high-acceleration motions, such as linear and rotational jumps. Extensive analysis of these shows that the robot's dynamics can be exploited to surpass its hardware limitations of having a high mass and low-torque limits.</description>

Abstract: In multiple realistic settings, a robot is tasked with grasping an object without knowing its exact pose and relies on a probabilistic estimation of the pose to decide how to attempt the grasp. We support settings in which it is possible to provide the robot with an observation of the object before a grasp is attempted but this possibility is limited and there is a need to decide which sensing action would be most beneficial. We support this decision by offering a novel Value of Assistance (VOA) measure for assessing the expected effect a specific observation will have on the robot's ability to complete its task. We evaluate our suggested measure in simulated and real-world collaborative grasping settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce AO-Grasp, a grasp proposal method that generates 6 DoF grasps that enable robots to interact with articulated objects, such as opening and closing cabinets and appliances. AO-Grasp consists of two main contributions: the AO-Grasp Model and the AO-Grasp Dataset. Given a segmented partial point cloud of a single articulated object, the AO-Grasp Model predicts the best grasp points on the object with an Actionable Grasp Point Predictor. Then, it finds corresponding grasp orientations for each of these points, resulting in stable and actionable grasp proposals. We train the AO-Grasp Model on our new AO-Grasp Dataset, which contains 78K actionable parallel-jaw grasps on synthetic articulated objects. In simulation, AO-Grasp achieves a 45.0 % grasp success rate, whereas the highest performing baseline achieves a 35.0% success rate. Additionally, we evaluate AO-Grasp on 120 real-world scenes of objects with varied geometries, articulation axes, and joint states, where AO-Grasp produces successful grasps on 67.5% of scenes, while the baseline only produces successful grasps on 33.3% of scenes. To the best of our knowledge, AO-Grasp is the first method for generating 6 DoF grasps on articulated objects directly from partial point clouds without requiring part detection or hand-designed grasp heuristics.

      <title>SparseDFF: Sparse-View Feature Distillation for One-Shot Dexterous Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans demonstrate remarkable skill in transferring manipulation abilities across objects of varying shapes, poses, and appearances, a capability rooted in their understanding of semantic correspondences between different instances. To equip robots with a similar high-level comprehension, we present SparseDFF, a novel DFF for 3D scenes utilizing large 2D vision models to extract semantic features from sparse RGBD images, a domain where research is limited despite its relevance to many tasks with fixed-camera setups. SparseDFF generates view-consistent 3D DFFs, enabling efficient one-shot learning of dexterous manipulations by mapping image features to a 3D point cloud. Central to SparseDFF is a feature refinement network, optimized with a contrastive loss between views and a point-pruning mechanism for feature continuity. This facilitates the minimization of feature discrepancies w.r.t. end-effector parameters, bridging demonstrations and target manipulations. Validated in real-world scenarios with a dexterous hand, SparseDFF proves effective in manipulating both rigid and deformable objects, demonstrating significant generalization capabilities across object and scene variations.</description>

      <title>MAINS: A Magnetic Field Aided Inertial Navigation System for Indoor Positioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Magnetic field Aided Inertial Navigation System (MAINS) for indoor navigation is proposed in this paper. MAINS leverages an array of magnetometers to measure spatial variations in the magnetic field, which are then used to estimate the displacement and orientation changes of the system, thereby aiding the inertial navigation system (INS). Experiments show that MAINS significantly outperforms the stand-alone INS, demonstrating a remarkable two orders of magnitude reduction in position error. Furthermore, when compared to the state-of-the-art magnetic-field-aided navigation approach, the proposed method exhibits slightly improved horizontal position accuracy. On the other hand, it has noticeably larger vertical error on datasets with large magnetic field variations. However, one of the main advantages of MAINS compared to the state-of-the-art is that it enables flexible sensor configurations. The experimental results show that the position error after 2 minutes of navigation in most cases is less than 3 meters when using an array of 30 magnetometers. Thus, the proposed navigation solution has the potential to solve one of the key challenges faced with current magnetic-field simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) solutions: the very limited allowable length of the exploration phase during which unvisited areas are mapped.</description>

      <title>SoftMAC: Differentiable Soft Body Simulation with Forecast-based Contact Model and Two-way Coupling with Articulated Rigid Bodies and Clothes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differentiable physics simulation provides an avenue to tackle previously intractable challenges through gradient-based optimization, thereby greatly improving the efficiency of solving robotics-related problems. To apply differentiable simulation in diverse robotic manipulation scenarios, a key challenge is to integrate various materials in a unified framework. We present SoftMAC, a differentiable simulation framework that couples soft bodies with articulated rigid bodies and clothes. SoftMAC simulates soft bodies with the continuum-mechanics-based Material Point Method (MPM). We provide a novel forecast-based contact model for MPM, which effectively reduces penetration without introducing other artifacts like unnatural rebound. To couple MPM particles with deformable and non-volumetric clothes meshes, we also propose a penetration tracing algorithm that reconstructs the signed distance field in local area. Diverging from previous works, SoftMAC simulates the complete dynamics of each modality and incorporates them into a cohesive system with an explicit and differentiable coupling mechanism. The feature empowers SoftMAC to handle a broader spectrum of interactions, such as soft bodies serving as manipulators and engaging with underactuated systems. We conducted comprehensive experiments to validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed differentiable pipeline in downstream robotic manipulation applications. Supplementary materials and videos are available on our project website at https://sites.google.com/view/softmac.</description>

      <title>V-STRONG: Visual Self-Supervised Traversability Learning for Off-road Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable estimation of terrain traversability is critical for the successful deployment of autonomous systems in wild, outdoor environments. Given the lack of large-scale annotated datasets for off-road navigation, strictly-supervised learning approaches remain limited in their generalization ability. To this end, we introduce a novel, image-based self-supervised learning method for traversability prediction, leveraging a state-of-the-art vision foundation model for improved out-of-distribution performance. Our method employs contrastive representation learning using both human driving data and instance-based segmentation masks during training. We show that this simple, yet effective, technique drastically outperforms recent methods in predicting traversability for both on- and off-trail driving scenarios. We compare our method with recent baselines on both a common benchmark as well as our own datasets, covering a diverse range of outdoor environments and varied terrain types. We also demonstrate the compatibility of resulting costmap predictions with a model-predictive controller. Finally, we evaluate our approach on zero- and few-shot tasks, demonstrating unprecedented performance for generalization to new environments.

      <title>SOS-Match: Segmentation for Open-Set Robust Correspondence Search and Robot Localization in Unstructured Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present SOS-Match, a novel framework for detecting and matching objects in unstructured environments. Our system consists of 1) a front-end mapping pipeline using a zero-shot segmentation model to extract object masks from images and track them across frames and 2) a frame alignment pipeline that uses the geometric consistency of object relationships to efficiently localize across a variety of conditions. We evaluate SOS-Match on the Batvik seasonal dataset which includes drone flights collected over a coastal plot of southern Finland during different seasons and lighting conditions. Results show that our approach is more robust to changes in lighting and appearance than classical image feature-based approaches or global descriptor methods, and it provides more viewpoint invariance than learning-based feature detection and description approaches. SOS-Match localizes within a reference map up to 46x faster than other feature-based approaches and has a map size less than 0.5% the size of the most compact other maps. SOS-Match is a promising new approach for landmark detection and correspondence search in unstructured environments that is robust to changes in lighting and appearance and is more computationally efficient than other approaches, suggesting that the geometric arrangement of segments is a valuable localization cue in unstructured environments. We release our datasets at https://acl.mit.edu/SOS-Match/.</description>

      <title>Robustness Evaluation of Localization Techniques for Autonomous Racing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces SynPF, an MCL-based algorithm tailored for high-speed racing environments. Benchmarked against Cartographer, a state-of-the-art pose-graph SLAM algorithm, SynPF leverages synergies from previous particle-filtering methods and synthesizes them for the high-performance racing domain. Our extensive in-field evaluations reveal that while Cartographer excels under nominal conditions, it struggles when subjected to wheel-slip, a common phenomenon in a racing scenario due to varying grip levels and aggressive driving behaviour. Conversely, SynPF demonstrates robustness in these challenging conditions and a low-latency computation time of 1.25 ms on on-board computers without a GPU. Using the F1TENTH platform, a 1:10 scaled autonomous racing vehicle, this work not only highlights the vulnerabilities of existing algorithms in high-speed scenarios, tested up until 7.6 m/s, but also emphasizes the potential of SynPF as a viable alternative, especially in deteriorating odometry conditions.</description>

      <title>Preprocessing-based Kinodynamic Motion Planning Framework for Intercepting Projectiles using a Robot Manipulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are interested in studying sports with robots and starting with the problem of intercepting a projectile moving toward a robot manipulator equipped with a shield. To successfully perform this task, the robot needs to (i) detect the incoming projectile, (ii) predict the projectile's future motion, (iii) plan a minimum-time rapid trajectory that can evade obstacles and intercept the projectile, and (iv) execute the planned trajectory. These four steps must be performed under the manipulator's dynamic limits and extreme time constraints (&lt;350ms in our setting) to successfully intercept the projectile. In addition, we want these trajectories to be smooth to reduce the robot's joint torques and the impulse on the platform on which it is mounted. To this end, we propose a kinodynamic motion planning framework that preprocesses smooth trajectories offline to allow real-time collision-free executions online. We present an end-to-end pipeline along with our planning framework, including perception, prediction, and execution modules. We evaluate our framework experimentally in simulation and show that it has a higher blocking success rate than the baselines. Further, we deploy our pipeline on a robotic system comprising an industrial arm (ABB IRB-1600) and an onboard stereo camera (ZED 2i), which achieves a 78% success rate in projectile interceptions.</description>

      <title>PINSAT: Parallelized Interleaving of Graph Search and Trajectory Optimization for Kinodynamic Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trajectory optimization is a widely used technique in robot motion planning for letting the dynamics and constraints on the system shape and synthesize complex behaviors. Several previous works have shown its benefits in high-dimensional continuous state spaces and under differential constraints. However, long time horizons and planning around obstacles in non-convex spaces pose challenges in guaranteeing convergence or finding optimal solutions. As a result, discrete graph search planners and sampling-based planers are preferred when facing obstacle-cluttered environments. A recently developed algorithm called INSAT effectively combines graph search in the low-dimensional subspace and trajectory optimization in the full-dimensional space for global kinodynamic planning over long horizons. Although INSAT successfully reasoned about and solved complex planning problems, the numerous expensive calls to an optimizer resulted in large planning times, thereby limiting its practical use. Inspired by the recent work on edge-based parallel graph search, we present PINSAT, which introduces systematic parallelization in INSAT to achieve lower planning times and higher success rates, while maintaining significantly lower costs over relevant baselines. We demonstrate PINSAT by evaluating it on 6 DoF kinodynamic manipulation planning with obstacles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many complex robotic manipulation tasks can be decomposed as a sequence of pick and place actions. Training a robotic agent to learn this sequence over many different starting conditions typically requires many iterations or demonstrations, especially in 3D environments. In this work, we propose Fourier Transporter (FourTran) which leverages the two-fold SE(d)xSE(d) symmetry in the pick-place problem to achieve much higher sample efficiency. FourTran is an open-loop behavior cloning method trained using expert demonstrations to predict pick-place actions on new environments. FourTran is constrained to incorporate symmetries of the pick and place actions independently. Our method utilizes a fiber space Fourier transformation that allows for memory-efficient construction. We test our proposed network on the RLbench benchmark and achieve state-of-the-art results across various tasks.</description>

      <title>LeTO: Learning Constrained Visuomotor Policy with Differentiable Trajectory Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces LeTO, a method for learning constrained visuomotor policy via differentiable trajectory optimization. Our approach uniquely integrates a differentiable optimization layer into the neural network. By formulating the optimization layer as a trajectory optimization problem, we enable the model to end-to-end generate actions in a safe and controlled fashion without extra modules. Our method allows for the introduction of constraints information during the training process, thereby balancing the training objectives of satisfying constraints, smoothing the trajectories, and minimizing errors with demonstrations. This "gray box" method marries the optimization-based safety and interpretability with the powerful representational abilities of neural networks. We quantitatively evaluate LeTO in simulation and on the real robot. In simulation, LeTO achieves a success rate comparable to state-of-the-art imitation learning methods, but the generated trajectories are of less uncertainty, higher quality, and smoother. In real-world experiments, we deployed LeTO to handle constraints-critical tasks. The results show the effectiveness of LeTO comparing with state-of-the-art imitation learning approaches. We release our code at https://github.com/ZhengtongXu/LeTO.</description>

      <title>Targeted Parallelization of Conflict-Based Search for Multi-Robot Path Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-Robot Path Planning (MRPP) on graphs, equivalently known as Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), is a well-established NP-hard problem with critically important applications. As serial computation in (near)-optimally solving MRPP approaches the computation efficiency limit, parallelization offers a promising route to push the limit further, especially in handling hard or large MRPP instances. In this study, we initiated a \emph{targeted} parallelization effort to boost the performance of conflict-based search for MRPP. Specifically, when instances are relatively small but robots are densely packed with strong interactions, we apply a decentralized parallel algorithm that concurrently explores multiple branches that leads to markedly enhanced solution discovery. On the other hand, when instances are large with sparse robot-robot interactions, we prioritize node expansion and conflict resolution. Our innovative multi-threaded approach to parallelizing bounded-suboptimal conflict search-based algorithms demonstrates significant improvements over baseline serial methods in success rate or runtime. Our contribution further pushes the understanding of MRPP and charts a promising path for elevating solution quality and computational efficiency through parallel algorithmic strategies.</description>

Abstract: This paper describes the hardware design and flight demonstration of a small quadrotor with imaging sensors for urban mapping, hazard avoidance, and target tracking research. The vehicle is equipped with five cameras, including two pairs of fisheye stereo cameras that enable a nearly omnidirectional view and a two-axis gimbaled camera. An onboard NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano computer running the Robot Operating System software is used for data collection. An autonomous tracking behavior was implemented to coordinate the motion of the quadrotor and gimbaled camera to track a moving GPS coordinate. The data collection system was demonstrated through a flight test that tracked a moving GPS-tagged vehicle through a series of roads and parking lots. A map of the environment was reconstructed from the collected images using the Direct Sparse Odometry (DSO) algorithm. The performance of the quadrotor was also characterized by acoustic noise, communication range, battery voltage in hover, and maximum speed tests.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Swarm robotics has garnered significant attention due to its ability to accomplish elaborate and synchronized tasks. Existing methodologies for motion planning of swarm robotic systems mainly encounter difficulties in scalability and safety guarantee. To address these limitations, we propose a Risk-aware swarm mOtion planner using conditional ValuE at Risk (ROVER) that systematically navigates large-scale swarms through cluttered environments while ensuring safety. ROVER formulates a finite-time model predictive control (FTMPC) problem predicated upon the macroscopic state of the robot swarm represented by a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and integrates conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) to ensure collision avoidance. The key component of ROVER is imposing a CVaR constraint on the distribution of the Signed Distance Function between the swarm GMM and obstacles in the FTMPC to enforce collision avoidance. Utilizing the analytical expression of CVaR of a GMM derived in this work, we develop a computationally efficient solution to solve the non-linear constrained FTMPC through sequential linear programming. Simulations and comparisons with representative benchmark approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of ROVER in flexibility, scalability, and risk mitigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern robotic systems are required to operate in dense dynamic environments, requiring highly accurate real-time track identification and estimation. For 3D multi-object tracking, recent approaches process a single measurement frame recursively with greedy association and are prone to errors in ambiguous association decisions. Our method, Sliding Window Tracker (SWTrack), yields more accurate association and state estimation by batch processing many frames of sensor data while being capable of running online in real-time. The most probable track associations are identified by evaluating all possible track hypotheses across the temporal sliding window. A novel graph optimization approach is formulated to solve the multidimensional assignment problem with lifted graph edges introduced to account for missed detections and graph sparsity enforced to retain real-time efficiency. We evaluate our SWTrack implementation$^{2}$ on the NuScenes autonomous driving dataset to demonstrate improved tracking performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning-based methods have improved locomotion skills of quadruped robots through deep reinforcement learning. However, the sim-to-real gap and low sample efficiency still limit the skill transfer. To address this issue, we propose an efficient model-based learning framework that combines a world model with a policy network. We train a differentiable world model to predict future states and use it to directly supervise a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based policy network to imitate real animal behaviors. This significantly reduces the need for real interaction data and allows for rapid policy updates. We also develop a high-level network to track diverse commands and trajectories. Our simulated results show a tenfold sample efficiency increase compared to reinforcement learning methods such as PPO. In real-world testing, our policy achieves proficient command-following performance with only a two-minute data collection period and generalizes well to new speeds and paths.</description>

Abstract: We design a motion planning algorithm to coordinate the movements of two robots along a figure eight track, in such a way that no collisions occur. We use a topological approach to robot motion planning that relates instabilities in motion planning algorithms to topological features of configuration spaces. The topological complexity of a configuration space is an invariant that measures the complexity of motion planning algorithms. We show that the topological complexity of our problem is 3 and construct an explicit algorithm with three continuous instructions.</description>

Presently, there are no positioning systems available that are suited for real-world use in confined underwater environments, unconstrained by environmental lighting and water turbidity levels and have sufficient accuracy for long-term, reliable and repeatable navigation. This shortage presents a significant barrier to enhancing the capabilities of ROVs in such scenarios. This paper introduces an innovative positioning system for ROVs operating in confined, cluttered underwater settings, achieved through the collaboration of an omnidirectional surface vehicle and an ROV. A formulation is proposed and evaluated in the simulation against ground truth. The experimental results from the simulation form a proof of principle of the proposed system and also demonstrate its deployability. Unlike many previous approaches, the system does not rely on fixed infrastructure or tracking of features in the environment and can cover large enclosed areas without additional equipment.</description>

Abstract: The ability of resource-constrained biological systems such as fruitflies to perform complex and high-speed maneuvers in cluttered environments has been one of the prime sources of inspiration for developing vision-based autonomous systems. To emulate this capability, the perception pipeline of such systems must integrate information cues from tasks including optical flow and depth estimation, object detection and tracking, and segmentation, among others. However, the conventional approach of employing slow, synchronous inputs from standard frame-based cameras constrains these perception capabilities, particularly during high-speed maneuvers. Recently, event-based sensors have emerged as low latency and low energy alternatives to standard frame-based cameras for capturing high-speed motion, effectively speeding up perception and hence navigation. For coherence, all the perception tasks must be trained on the same input data. However, present-day datasets are curated mainly for a single or a handful of tasks and are limited in the rate of the provided ground truths. To address these limitations, we present Flying Event Dataset fOr Reactive behAviour (FEDORA) - a fully synthetic dataset for perception tasks, with raw data from frame-based cameras, event-based cameras, and Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), along with ground truths for depth, pose, and optical flow at a rate much higher than existing datasets.</description>

      <title>Powered Descent Guidance via First-Order Optimization with Expansive Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a first-order method for solving optimal powered descent guidance (PDG) problems, that directly handles the nonconvex constraints associated with the maximum and minimum thrust bounds with varying mass and the pointing angle constraints on thrust vectors. This issue has been conventionally circumvented via lossless convexification (LCvx), which lifts a nonconvex feasible set to a higher-dimensional convex set, and via linear approximation of another nonconvex feasible set defined by exponential functions. However, this approach sometimes results in an infeasible solution when the solution obtained from the higher-dimensional space is projected back to the original space, especially when the problem involves a nonoptimal time of flight. Additionally, the Taylor series approximation introduces an approximation error that grows with both flight time and deviation from the reference trajectory. In this paper, we introduce a first-order approach that makes use of orthogonal projections onto nonconvex sets, allowing expansive projection (ExProj). We show that 1) this approach produces a feasible solution with better performance even for the nonoptimal time of flight cases for which conventional techniques fail to generate achievable trajectories and 2) the proposed method compensates for the linearization error that arises from Taylor series approximation, thus generating a superior guidance solution with less fuel consumption. We provide numerical examples featuring quantitative assessments to elucidate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, particularly in terms of fuel consumption and flight time. Our analysis substantiates the assertion that the proposed approach affords enhanced flexibility in devising viable trajectories for a diverse array of planetary soft landing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Optimal Impact Angle Guidance via First-Order Optimization under Nonconvex Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most of the optimal guidance problems can be formulated as nonconvex optimization problems, which can be solved indirectly by relaxation, convexification, or linearization. Although these methods are guaranteed to converge to the global optimum of the modified problems, the obtained solution may not guarantee global optimality or even the feasibility of the original nonconvex problems. In this paper, we propose a computational optimal guidance approach that directly handles the nonconvex constraints encountered in formulating the guidance problems. The proposed computational guidance approach alternately solves the least squares problems and projects the solution onto nonconvex feasible sets, which rapidly converges to feasible suboptimal solutions or sometimes to the globally optimal solutions. The proposed algorithm is verified via a series of numerical simulations on impact angle guidance problems under state dependent maneuver vector constraints, and it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm provides superior guidance performance than conventional techniques.</description>

      <title>Memory-Consistent Neural Networks for Imitation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning considerably simplifies policy synthesis compared to alternative approaches by exploiting access to expert demonstrations. For such imitation policies, errors away from the training samples are particularly critical. Even rare slip-ups in the policy action outputs can compound quickly over time, since they lead to unfamiliar future states where the policy is still more likely to err, eventually causing task failures. We revisit simple supervised ``behavior cloning'' for conveniently training the policy from nothing more than pre-recorded demonstrations, but carefully design the model class to counter the compounding error phenomenon. Our ``memory-consistent neural network'' (MCNN) outputs are hard-constrained to stay within clearly specified permissible regions anchored to prototypical ``memory'' training samples. We provide a guaranteed upper bound for the sub-optimality gap induced by MCNN policies. Using MCNNs on 10 imitation learning tasks, with MLP, Transformer, and Diffusion backbones, spanning dexterous robotic manipulation and driving, proprioceptive inputs and visual inputs, and varying sizes and types of demonstration data, we find large and consistent gains in performance, validating that MCNNs are better-suited than vanilla deep neural networks for imitation learning applications.

      <title>Studying speed-accuracy trade-offs in best-of-n collective decision-making through heterogeneous mean-field modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13694</link>

Abstract: To succeed in their objectives, groups of individuals must be able to make quick and accurate collective decisions on the best option among a set of alternatives with different qualities. Group-living animals aim to do that all the time. Plants and fungi are thought to do so too. Swarms of autonomous robots can also be programmed to make best-of-n decisions for solving tasks collaboratively. Ultimately, humans critically need it and so many times they should be better at it. Thanks to their mathematical tractability, simple models like the voter model and the local majority rule model have proven useful to describe the dynamics of such collective decision-making processes. To reach a consensus, individuals change their opinion by interacting with neighbors in their social network. At least among animals and robots, options with a better quality are exchanged more often and therefore spread faster than lower-quality options, leading to the collective selection of the best option. With our work, we study the impact of individuals making errors in pooling others' opinions caused, for example, by the need to reduce the cognitive load. Our analysis is grounded on the introduction of a model that generalizes the two existing models (local majority rule and voter model), showing a speed-accuracy trade-off regulated by the cognitive effort of individuals. We also investigate the impact of the interaction network topology on the collective dynamics. To do so, we extend our model and, by using the heterogeneous mean-field approach, we show the presence of another speed-accuracy trade-off regulated by network connectivity. An interesting result is that reduced network connectivity corresponds to an increase in collective decision accuracy.</description>

      <title>Guided Data Augmentation for Offline Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning (RL), an RL agent learns to solve a task using only a fixed dataset of previously collected data. While offline RL has been successful in learning real-world robot control policies, it typically requires large amounts of expert-quality data to learn effective policies that generalize to out-of-distribution states. Unfortunately, such data is often difficult and expensive to acquire in real-world tasks. Several recent works have leveraged data augmentation (DA) to inexpensively generate additional data, but most DA works apply augmentations in a random fashion and ultimately produce highly suboptimal augmented experience. In this work, we propose Guided Data Augmentation (GuDA), a human-guided DA framework that generates expert-quality augmented data. The key insight behind GuDA is that while it may be difficult to demonstrate the sequence of actions required to produce expert data, a user can often easily characterize when an augmented trajectory segment represents progress toward task completion. Thus, a user can restrict the space of possible augmentations to automatically reject suboptimal augmented data. To extract a policy from GuDA, we use off-the-shelf offline reinforcement learning and behavior cloning algorithms. We evaluate GuDA on a physical robot soccer task as well as simulated D4RL navigation tasks, a simulated autonomous driving task, and a simulated soccer task. Empirically, GuDA enables learning given a small initial dataset of potentially suboptimal experience and outperforms a random DA strategy as well as a model-based DA strategy.</description>

      <title>Uni-O4: Unifying Online and Offline Deep Reinforcement Learning with Multi-Step On-Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03351v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combining offline and online reinforcement learning (RL) is crucial for efficient and safe learning. However, previous approaches treat offline and online learning as separate procedures, resulting in redundant designs and limited performance. We ask: Can we achieve straightforward yet effective offline and online learning without introducing extra conservatism or regularization? In this study, we propose Uni-o4, which utilizes an on-policy objective for both offline and online learning. Owning to the alignment of objectives in two phases, the RL agent can transfer between offline and online learning seamlessly. This property enhances the flexibility of the learning paradigm, allowing for arbitrary combinations of pretraining, fine-tuning, offline, and online learning. In the offline phase, specifically, Uni-o4 leverages diverse ensemble policies to address the mismatch issues between the estimated behavior policy and the offline dataset. Through a simple offline policy evaluation (OPE) approach, Uni-o4 can achieve multi-step policy improvement safely. We demonstrate that by employing the method above, the fusion of these two paradigms can yield superior offline initialization as well as stable and rapid online fine-tuning capabilities. Through real-world robot tasks, we highlight the benefits of this paradigm for rapid deployment in challenging, previously unseen real-world environments. Additionally, through comprehensive evaluations using numerous simulated benchmarks, we substantiate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both offline and offline-to-online fine-tuning learning.

      <title>CalibFormer: A Transformer-based Automatic LiDAR-Camera Calibration Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fusion of LiDARs and cameras has been increasingly adopted in autonomous driving for perception tasks. The performance of such fusion-based algorithms largely depends on the accuracy of sensor calibration, which is challenging due to the difficulty of identifying common features across different data modalities. Previously, many calibration methods involved specific targets and/or manual intervention, which has proven to be cumbersome and costly. Learning-based online calibration methods have been proposed, but their performance is barely satisfactory in most cases. These methods usually suffer from issues such as sparse feature maps, unreliable cross-modality association, inaccurate calibration parameter regression, etc. In this paper, to address these issues, we propose CalibFormer, an end-to-end network for automatic LiDAR-camera calibration. We aggregate multiple layers of camera and LiDAR image features to achieve high-resolution representations. A multi-head correlation module is utilized to identify correlations between features more accurately. Lastly, we employ transformer architectures to estimate accurate calibration parameters from the correlation information. Our method achieved a mean translation error of $0.8751 \mathrm{cm}$ and a mean rotation error of $0.0562 ^{\circ}$ on the KITTI dataset, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating strong robustness, accuracy, and generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Reward: Learning Rewards via Conditional Video Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning rewards from expert videos offers an affordable and effective solution to specify the intended behaviors for reinforcement learning tasks. In this work, we propose Diffusion Reward, a novel framework that learns rewards from expert videos via conditional video diffusion models for solving complex visual RL problems. Our key insight is that lower generative diversity is observed when conditioned on expert trajectories. Diffusion Reward is accordingly formalized by the negative of conditional entropy that encourages productive exploration of expert-like behaviors. We show the efficacy of our method over 10 robotic manipulation tasks from MetaWorld and Adroit with visual input and sparse reward. Moreover, Diffusion Reward could even solve unseen tasks successfully and effectively, largely surpassing baseline methods. Project page and code: https://diffusion-reward.github.io/.</description>

Abstract: Autonomous ocean-exploring vehicles have begun to take advantage of onboard sensor measurements of water properties such as salinity and temperature to locate oceanic features in real time. Such targeted sampling strategies enable more rapid study of ocean environments by actively steering towards areas of high scientific value. Inspired by the ability of aquatic animals to navigate via flow sensing, this work investigates hydrodynamic cues for accomplishing targeted sampling using a palm-sized robotic swimmer. As proof-of-concept analogy for tracking hydrothermal vent plumes in the ocean, the robot is tasked with locating the center of turbulent jet flows in a 13,000-liter water tank using data from onboard pressure sensors. To learn a navigation strategy, we first implemented Reinforcement Learning (RL) on a simulated version of the robot navigating in proximity to turbulent jets. After training, the RL algorithm discovered an effective strategy for locating the jets by following transverse velocity gradients sensed by pressure sensors located on opposite sides of the robot. When implemented on the physical robot, this gradient following strategy enabled the robot to successfully locate the turbulent plumes at more than twice the rate of random searching. Additionally, we found that navigation performance improved as the distance between the pressure sensors increased, which can inform the design of distributed flow sensors in ocean robots. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness and limits of flow-based navigation for autonomously locating hydrodynamic features of interest.</description>
