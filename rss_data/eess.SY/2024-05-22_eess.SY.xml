      <title>Design and Analysis of a Detuned Series-Series IPT System with Solenoid Coil Structure for Drone Charging Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new coil configuration that uses solenoid ferrites on the receiver side instead of planar ferrite coils that are employed in existing wireless charging systems.The solenoid ferrites are used in the drone legs to help mount the receiver on a moving truck while the two parts of the transmitter are placed on the truck.To validate this idea a detuned transmitter series-series (SS) compensated IPT prototype system has been investigated to charge the onboard battery of a drone.The proposed detuned design helps to limit the system output power and transmitter side current at even zero coupling condition and tolerates misalignment positions. Experimental results demonstrate that the system switching frequency is 245 kHz and the primary side resonates at 223.5 kHz, which is a detuned design The transmitting current is limited to 4.5 A at zero coupling condition with a low power loss of only 4.2 W at zero coupling condition. The target achievable power of the system is 50 W with a 10 mm air gap and horizontal and vertical misalignment in the range of [0, 50 mm].This system has been validated by experiments to charge an 11.1V battery at 48.2W with 88.2% efficiency.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal Attention-based Hidden Physics-informed Neural Network for Remaining Useful Life Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is essential in Prognostic Health Management (PHM) for industrial systems. Although deep learning approaches have achieved considerable success in predicting RUL, challenges such as low prediction accuracy and interpretability pose significant challenges, hindering their practical implementation. In this work, we introduce a Spatio-temporal Attention-based Hidden Physics-informed Neural Network (STA-HPINN) for RUL prediction, which can utilize the associated physics of the system degradation. The spatio-temporal attention mechanism can extract important features from the input data. With the self-attention mechanism on both the sensor dimension and time step dimension, the proposed model can effectively extract degradation information. The hidden physics-informed neural network is utilized to capture the physics mechanisms that govern the evolution of RUL. With the constraint of physics, the model can achieve higher accuracy and reasonable predictions. The approach is validated on a benchmark dataset, demonstrating exceptional performance when compared to cutting-edge methods, especially in the case of complex conditions.</description>

      <title>Reach and hold flexibility characterization and trade-off analysis for aggregations of thermostatically controlled loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) have the potential to be flexible and responsive loads to be used in demand response (DR) schemes. With increasing renewable penetration, DR is playing an increasingly important role in enhancing power grid reliability. The aggregate demand of a population of TCLs can be modulated by changing their temperature setpoint. When and/or what proportion of the population sees the setpoint change determines the change in aggregate demand. However, since the TCL population is finite, not all changes in aggregate demand can be maintained for arbitrarily long periods of time. In this paper, the dynamic behavior of a TCL fleet is modeled and used to characterize the set possible changes in aggregate demand that can be reached and the corresponding time for which the demand change can be held, for a given change in setpoint. This set is referred to, in this paper, as the reach and hold set of a TCL fleet. Furthermore, the effect of the setpoint change and ambient temperature on the reach and hold are analyzed. The characterized set is then validated through simulation using both the population TCL models and individual TCL micro-models.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Connected Vehicle Identification-Aware Mixed Traffic Freeway Cooperative Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative on-ramp merging control for connected automated vehicles (CAVs) has been extensively investigated. However, they did neglect the connected vehicle identification process, which is a must for CAV cooperations. In this paper, we introduced a connected vehicle identification system (VIS) into the on-ramp merging control process for the first time and proposed an evaluation framework to assess the impacts of VIS on on-ramp merging performance. First, the mixed-traffic cooperative merging problem was formulated. Then, a real-world merging trajectory dataset was processed to generate dangerous merging scenarios. Aiming at resolving the potential collision risks in mixed traffic where CAVs and traditional human-driven vehicles (THVs) coexist, we proposed on-ramp merging strategies for CAVs in different mixed traffic situations considering the connected vehicle identification process. The performances were evaluated via simulations. Results indicated that while safety was assured for all cases with CAVs, the cases with VIS had delayed initiation of cooperation, limiting the range of cooperative merging and leading to increased fuel consumption and acceleration variations.</description>

      <title>Efficient Economic Model Predictive Control of Water Treatment Process with Learning-based Koopman Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Used water treatment plays a pivotal role in advancing environmental sustainability. Economic model predictive control holds the promise of enhancing the overall operational performance of the water treatment facilities. In this study, we propose a data-driven economic predictive control approach within the Koopman modeling framework. First, we propose a deep learning-enabled input-output Koopman modeling approach, which predicts the overall economic operational cost of the wastewater treatment process based on input data and available output measurements that are directly linked to the operational costs. Subsequently, by leveraging this learned input-output Koopman model, a convex economic predictive control scheme is developed. The resulting predictive control problem can be efficiently solved by leveraging quadratic programming solvers, and complex non-convex optimization problems are bypassed. The proposed method is applied to a benchmark wastewater treatment process. The proposed method significantly improves the overall economic operational performance of the water treatment process. Additionally, the computational efficiency of the proposed method is significantly enhanced as compared to benchmark control solutions.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Coordinated AC/DC Control Strategy for Frequency Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With high penetrations of renewable energy and power electronics converters, less predictable operating conditions and strong uncertainties in under-frequency events pose challenges for emergency frequency control (EFC). On the other hand, the fast adjustability of converter-based sources presents opportunities to reduce economic losses from traditional load shedding for EFC. By integrating DC power emergency support, a data-driven coordinated AC/DC control strategy for frequency safety - Coordinated Emergency Frequency Control (CEFC) - has been designed. CEFC coordinates both the initiation and control amount of emergency DC power support (EDCPS) and traditional load shedding. Based on real-time power system response data, CEFC ensures system frequency safety at a minimum control cost under non-envisioned operating conditions and large power deficits. A sufficient condition where data-driven modeling errors do not affect the precision of the control strategy for power system frequency is rigorously provided. Simulation results demonstrate CEFC's adaptability, prediction accuracy, and control effectiveness.</description>

      <title>A Local Gaussian Process Regression Approach to Frequency Response Function Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency response function (FRF) estimation is a classical subject in system identification. In the past two decades, there have been remarkable advances in developing local methods for this subject, e.g., the local polynomial method, local rational method, and iterative local rational method. The recent concentrations for local methods are two issues: the model order selection and the identification of lightly damped systems. To address these two issues, we propose a new local method called local Gaussian process regression (LGPR). We show that the frequency response function locally is either analytic or resonant, and this prior knowledge can be embedded into a kernel-based regularized estimate through a dot-product kernel plus a resonance kernel induced by a second-order resonant system. The LGPR provides a new route to tackle the aforementioned issues. In the numerical simulations, the LGPR shows the best FRF estimation accuracy compared with the existing local methods, and moreover, the LGPR is more robust with respect to sample size and noise level.</description>

      <title>Spatial Mode Multiplexing for Fiber-Coupled IM/DD Optical Wireless Links with Misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical wireless communication (OWC) emerges as a pivotal solution for achieving terabit-level aggregate throughput in next-generation wireless networks. With the mature high-speed transceivers and advanced (de)multiplexing techniques designed for fiber optics, fiber-coupled OWC can be seamlessly integrated into existing ultra-high-speed networks such as data centres. In particular, OWC leveraging spatial mode multiplexing (SMM) and few-mode fiber (FMF) coupling can significantly increase capacity, though misalignment may reduce performance. This paper presents a thorough investigation into the SMM-enabled FMF coupling OWC systems affected by link misalignment, specifically focusing on systems with intensity modulation with direct detection (IM/DD) receivers. A theoretical analysis is conducted to assess the fiber coupling efficiency of the considered system in the presence of both pointing error and angle of arrival (AOA) fluctuations caused by random device vibrations. Our model elucidates the dependence of coupling efficiency to the order of the incident modes, highlighting the critical role of beam properties in system performance. To mitigate the intermodal crosstalk arising from link misalignment, we employ zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) to enhance the overall aggregated data rate. Through extensive numerical results, we identify optimal system configurations encompassing aperture design and mode selection, leading to a capacity boost exceeding 200%.</description>

      <title>Modeling for Non-exponential Production Systems Using Parts Flow Data: Model Parameter Estimation and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical modeling of production systems is the foundation of all model-based approaches for production system analysis, design, improvement, and control. To construct such a model for the stochastic process of the production system more efficiently, a new modeling approach has been proposed that reversely identifies the model parameters using system performance metrics (e.g., production rate, work-in-process, etc.) derived from the parts flow data. This paper extends this performance metrics-based modeling approach to non-exponential serial production lines. Since no analytical expressions of performance metrics are available for non-exponential systems, we use neural network surrogate models to calculate those performance metrics as functions in terms of the system parameters. Then, based on the surrogate models and given performance metrics, the machine parameters are estimated by solving a constrained optimization problem that minimizes the mean square error of the performance metrics resulting from the estimated parameters compared to the true ones. With the designed multi-start particle swarm optimization algorithm, we find that multiple non-unique combinations of machine parameters can lead to practically the same system performance metrics and a linear relationship of the reliability parameters from these obtained estimations is observed. Besides, model sensitivity analysis is implemented to verify the robustness of the different combinations of machine parameters even under the potential improvement scenarios.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Line Rating using Hyper-local Weather Predictions: A Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) systems are crucial for renewable energy integration in transmission networks. However, traditional methods relying on sensor data face challenges due to the impracticality of installing sensors on every pole or span. Additionally, sensor-based approaches may struggle predicting DLR in rapidly changing weather conditions. This paper proposes a novel approach, leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques alongside hyper-local weather forecast data. Unlike conventional methods, which solely rely on sensor data, this approach utilizes ML models trained to predict hyper-local weather parameters on a full network scale. Integrating topographical data enhances prediction accuracy by accounting for landscape features and obstacles around overhead lines. The paper introduces confidence intervals for DLR assessments to mitigate risks associated with uncertainties. A case study from Estonia demonstrates the practical implementation of the proposed methodology, highlighting its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. By addressing limitations of sensor-based approaches, this research contributes to the discourse of renewable energy integration in transmission systems, advancing efficiency and reliability in the power grid.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Impact of Choice on Deep Reinforcement Learning for Space Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For many space applications, traditional control methods are often used during operation. However, as the number of space assets continues to grow, autonomous operation can enable rapid development of control methods for different space related tasks. One method of developing autonomous control is Reinforcement Learning (RL), which has become increasingly popular after demonstrating promising performance and success across many complex tasks. While it is common for RL agents to learn bounded continuous control values, this may not be realistic or practical for many space tasks that traditionally prefer an on/off approach for control. This paper analyzes using discrete action spaces, where the agent must choose from a predefined list of actions. The experiments explore how the number of choices provided to the agents affects their measured performance during and after training. This analysis is conducted for an inspection task, where the agent must circumnavigate an object to inspect points on its surface, and a docking task, where the agent must move into proximity of another spacecraft and "dock" with a low relative speed. A common objective of both tasks, and most space tasks in general, is to minimize fuel usage, which motivates the agent to regularly choose an action that uses no fuel. Our results show that a limited number of discrete choices leads to optimal performance for the inspection task, while continuous control leads to optimal performance for the docking task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing is a form of machine learning that utilizes nonlinear dynamical systems to perform complex tasks in a cost-effective manner when compared to typical neural networks. Many recent advancements in reservoir computing, in particular quantum reservoir computing, make use of reservoirs that are inherently stochastic. However, the theoretical justification for using these systems has not yet been well established. In this paper, we investigate the universality of stochastic reservoir computers, in which we use a stochastic system for reservoir computing using the probabilities of each reservoir state as the readout instead of the states themselves. In stochastic reservoir computing, the number of distinct states of the entire reservoir computer can potentially scale exponentially with the size of the reservoir hardware, offering the advantage of compact device size. We prove that classes of stochastic echo state networks, and therefore the class of all stochastic reservoir computers, are universal approximating classes. We also investigate the performance of two practical examples of stochastic reservoir computers in classification and chaotic time series prediction. While shot noise is a limiting factor in the performance of stochastic reservoir computing, we show significantly improved performance compared to a deterministic reservoir computer with similar hardware in cases where the effects of noise are small.</description>

      <title>Flexible Active Safety Motion Control for Robotic Obstacle Avoidance: A CBF-Guided MPC Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A flexible active safety motion (FASM) control approach is proposed for the avoidance of dynamic obstacles and the reference tracking in robot manipulators. The distinctive feature of the proposed method lies in its utilization of control barrier functions (CBF) to design flexible CBF-guided safety criteria (CBFSC) with dynamically optimized decay rates, thereby offering flexibility and active safety for robot manipulators in dynamic environments. First, discrete-time CBFs are employed to formulate the novel flexible CBFSC with dynamic decay rates for robot manipulators. Following that, the model predictive control (MPC) philosophy is applied, integrating flexible CBFSC as safety constraints into the receding-horizon optimization problem. Significantly, the decay rates of the designed CBFSC are incorporated as decision variables in the optimization problem, facilitating the dynamic enhancement of flexibility during the obstacle avoidance process. In particular, a novel cost function that integrates a penalty term is designed to dynamically adjust the safety margins of the CBFSC. Finally, experiments are conducted in various scenarios using a Universal Robots 5 (UR5) manipulator to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Distribution Steering for Discrete-Time Uncertain Ensemble Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensemble systems appear frequently in many engineering applications and, as a result, they have become an important research topic in control theory. These systems are best characterized by the evolution of their underlying state distribution. Despite the work to date, few results exist dealing with the problem of directly modifying (i.e., "steering") the distribution of an ensemble system. In addition, in most of the existing results, the distribution of the states of an ensemble of discrete-time systems is assumed to be Gaussian. However, in case the system parameters are uncertain, it is not always realistic to assume that the distribution of the system follows a Gaussian distribution, thus complicating the solution of the overall problem. In this paper, we address the general distribution steering problem for first-order discrete-time ensemble systems, where the distributions of the system parameters and the states are arbitrary with finite first few moments. Both linear and nonlinear system dynamics are considered using the method of power moments to transform the original infinite-dimensional problem into a finite-dimensional one. We also propose a control law for the ensuing moment system, which allows us to obtain the power moments of the desired control inputs. Finally, we solve the inverse problem to obtain the feasible control inputs from their corresponding power moments. We provide numerical results to validate our theoretical developments. These include cases where the parameter distribution is uniform, Gaussian, non-Gaussian, and multi-modal, respectively.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Learning of Computational Resource Usage as Graph Structured Multimarginal Schr\"odinger Bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose to learn the time-varying stochastic computational resource usage of software as a graph structured Schr\"odinger bridge problem. In general, learning the computational resource usage from data is challenging because resources such as the number of CPU instructions and the number of last level cache requests are both time-varying and statistically correlated. Our proposed method enables learning the joint time-varying stochasticity in computational resource usage from the measured profile snapshots in a nonparametric manner. The method can be used to predict the most-likely time-varying distribution of computational resource availability at a desired time. We provide detailed algorithms for stochastic learning in both single and multi-core cases, discuss the convergence guarantees, computational complexities, and demonstrate their practical use in two case studies: a single-core nonlinear model predictive controller, and a synthetic multi-core software.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of continuous-time reinforcement learning in scenarios where the dynamics follow a stochastic differential equation. When the underlying dynamics remain unknown and we have access only to discrete-time information, how can we effectively conduct policy evaluation? We first highlight that the commonly used Bellman equation (BE) is not always a reliable approximation to the true value function. We then introduce a new bellman equation, PhiBE, which integrates the discrete-time information into a PDE formulation. The new bellman equation offers a more accurate approximation to the true value function, especially in scenarios where the underlying dynamics change slowly. Moreover, we extend PhiBE to higher orders, providing increasingly accurate approximations. We conduct the error analysis for both BE and PhiBE with explicit dependence on the discounted coefficient, the reward and the dynamics. Additionally, we present a model-free algorithm to solve PhiBE when only discrete-time trajectory data is available. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the theoretical guarantees we propose.</description>

      <title>EchoPT: A Pretrained Transformer Architecture that Predicts 2D In-Air Sonar Images for Mobile Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The predictive brain hypothesis suggests that perception can be interpreted as the process of minimizing the error between predicted perception tokens generated by an internal world model and actual sensory input tokens. When implementing working examples of this hypothesis in the context of in-air sonar, significant difficulties arise due to the sparse nature of the reflection model that governs ultrasonic sensing. Despite these challenges, creating consistent world models using sonar data is crucial for implementing predictive processing of ultrasound data in robotics. In an effort to enable robust robot behavior using ultrasound as the sole exteroceptive sensor modality, this paper introduces EchoPT, a pretrained transformer architecture designed to predict 2D sonar images from previous sensory data and robot ego-motion information. We detail the transformer architecture that drives EchoPT and compare the performance of our model to several state-of-the-art techniques. In addition to presenting and evaluating our EchoPT model, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this predictive perception approach in two robotic tasks.</description>

      <title>An Improved Robust Total Logistic Distance Metric algorithm for Generalized Gaussian Noise and Noisy Input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the known maximum total generalized correntropy (MTGC) and generalized maximum blakezisserman total correntropy (GMBZTC) algorithms can maintain good performance under the errors-in-variables (EIV) model disrupted by generalized Gaussian noise, their requirement for manual ad-justment of parameters is excessive, greatly increasing the practical difficulty of use. To solve this problem, the total arctangent based on logical distance metric (TACLDM) algo-rithm is proposed by utilizing the advantage of few parameters in logical distance metric (LDM) theory and the convergence behavior is improved by the arctangent function. Compared with other competing algorithms, the TACLDM algorithm not only has fewer parameters, but also has better robustness to generalized Gaussian noise and significantly reduces the steady-state error. Furthermore, the analysis of the algorithm in the generalized Gaussian noise environment is analyzed in detail in this paper. Finally, computer simulations demonstrate the outstanding performance of the TACLDM algorithm and the rigorous theoretical deduction in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Haar Cascade is a cost-effective and user-friendly machine learning-based algorithm for detecting objects in images and videos. Unlike Deep Learning algorithms, which typically require significant resources and expensive computing costs, it uses simple image processing techniques like edge detection and Haar features that are easy to comprehend and implement. By combining Haar Cascade with OpenCV2 on an embedded computer like the NVIDIA Jetson Nano, this system can accurately detect and match faces in a database for attendance tracking. This system aims to achieve several specific objectives that set it apart from existing solutions. It leverages Haar Cascade, enriched with carefully selected Haar features, such as Haar-like wavelets, and employs advanced edge detection techniques. These techniques enable precise face detection and matching in both images and videos, contributing to high accuracy and robust performance. By doing so, it minimizes manual intervention and reduces errors, thereby strengthening accountability. Additionally, the integration of OpenCV2 and the NVIDIA Jetson Nano optimizes processing efficiency, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments. This system caters to a diverse range of educational institutions, including schools, colleges, vocational training centers, and various workplace settings such as small businesses, offices, and factories. ... The system's affordability and efficiency democratize attendance management technology, making it accessible to a broader audience. Consequently, it has the potential to transform attendance tracking and management practices, ultimately leading to heightened productivity and accountability. In conclusion, this system represents a groundbreaking approach to attendance tracking and management...</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Time-Critical Wilderness Search And Rescue Using Drones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional search and rescue methods in wilderness areas can be time-consuming and have limited coverage. Drones offer a faster and more flexible solution, but optimizing their search paths is crucial. This paper explores the use of deep reinforcement learning to create efficient search missions for drones in wilderness environments. Our approach leverages a priori data about the search area and the missing person in the form of a probability distribution map. This allows the deep reinforcement learning agent to learn optimal flight paths that maximize the probability of finding the missing person quickly. Experimental results show that our method achieves a significant improvement in search times compared to traditional coverage planning and search planning algorithms. In one comparison, deep reinforcement learning is found to outperform other algorithms by over $160\%$, a difference that can mean life or death in real-world search operations. Additionally, unlike previous work, our approach incorporates a continuous action space enabled by cubature, allowing for more nuanced flight patterns.</description>

      <title>Extremum Seeking is Stable for Scalar Maps that are Strictly but Not Strongly Convex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a map that is strictly but not strongly convex, model-based gradient extremum seeking has an eigenvalue of zero at the extremum, i.e., it fails at exponential convergence. Interestingly, perturbation-based model-free extremum seeking has a negative Jacobian, in the average, meaning that its (practical) convergence is exponential, even though the map's Hessian is zero at the extremum. While these observations for the gradient algorithm are not trivial, we focus in this paper on an even more nontrivial study of the same phenomenon for Newton-based extremum seeking control (NESC).
  NESC is a second-order method which corrects for the unknown Hessian of the unknown map, not only in order to speed up parameter convergence, but also (1) to make the convergence rate user-assignable in spite of the unknown Hessian, and (2) to equalize the convergence rates in different directions for multivariable maps. Previous NESC work established stability only for maps whose Hessians are strictly positive definite everywhere, so the Hessian is invertible everywhere. For a scalar map, we establish the rather unexpected property that, even when the map behind is strictly convex but not strongly convex, i.e., when the Hessian may be zero, NESC guarantees practical asymptotic stability, semiglobally. While a model-based Newton-based algorithm would run into non-invertibility of the Hessian, the perturbation-based NESC, surprisingly, avoids this challenge by leveraging the fact that the average of the perturbation-based Hessian estimate is always positive, even though the actual Hessian may be zero.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning with Model Predictive Control for Highway Ramp Metering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the backdrop of an increasingly pressing need for effective urban and highway transportation systems, this work explores the synergy between model-based and learning-based strategies to enhance traffic flow management by use of an innovative approach to the problem of ramp metering control that embeds Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques within the Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework. The control problem is formulated as an RL task by crafting a suitable stage cost function that is representative of the traffic conditions, variability in the control action, and violations of the constraint on the maximum number of vehicles in queue. An MPC-based RL approach, which leverages the MPC optimal problem as a function approximation for the RL algorithm, is proposed to learn to efficiently control an on-ramp and satisfy its constraints despite uncertainties in the system model and variable demands. Simulations are performed on a benchmark small-scale highway network to compare the proposed methodology against other state-of-the-art control approaches. Results show that, starting from an MPC controller that has an imprecise model and is poorly tuned, the proposed methodology is able to effectively learn to improve the control policy such that congestion in the network is reduced and constraints are satisfied, yielding an improved performance that is superior to the other controllers.</description>

      <title>Demand response for residential building heating: Effective Monte Carlo Tree Search control based on physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03365v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To reduce global carbon emissions and limit climate change, controlling energy consumption in buildings is an important piece of the puzzle. Here, we specifically focus on using a demand response (DR) algorithm to limit the energy consumption of a residential building's heating system while respecting user's thermal comfort. In that domain, Reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been shown to be quite effective. One such RL method is Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which has achieved impressive success in playing board games (go, chess). A particular advantage of MCTS is that its decision tree structure naturally allows to integrate exogenous constraints (e.g., by trimming branches that violate them), while conventional RL solutions need more elaborate techniques (e.g., indirectly by adding penalties in the cost/reward function, or through a backup controller that corrects constraint-violating actions). The main aim of this paper is to study the adoption of MCTS for building control, since this (to the best of our knowledge) has remained largely unexplored. A specific property of MCTS is that it needs a simulator component that can predict subsequent system states, based on actions taken. A straightforward data-driven solution is to use black-box neural networks (NNs). We will however extend a Physics-informed Neural Network (PiNN) model to deliver multi-timestep predictions, and show the benefit it offers in terms of lower prediction errors ($-$32\% MAE) as well as better MCTS performance ($-$4\% energy cost, $+$7\% thermal comfort) compared to a black-box NN. A second contribution will be to extend a vanilla MCTS version to adopt the ideas applied in AlphaZero (i.e., using learned prior and value functions and an action selection heuristic) to obtain lower computational costs while maintaining control performance.</description>

      <title>Model predictive control of wakes for wind farm power tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a model predictive control scheme for wind farms is presented. Our approach considers wake dynamics including their influence on local wind conditions and allows to track a given power reference. In detail, a Gaussian wake model is used in combination with observation points that carry wind condition information. This allows to estimate the rotor effective wind speeds at downstream turbines based on which we deduce their power output. Through different approximation methods, the associated finite horizon nonlinear optimization problem is reformulated in a mixed-integer quadratically-constrained quadratic program fashion. By solving the reformulated problem online, optimal yaw angles and axial induction factors are found. Closed-loop simulations indicate good power tracking capabilities over a wide range of power setpoints while distributing wind turbine infeed evenly among all units. Additionally, the simulation results underline real time capabilities of our approach.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for depth and pitch control of underwater vehicles in near-surface wave conditions. By effectively managing tail, sail plane angles and hover tank operations utilizing a Linear Quadratic Regulator controller and L1 Adaptive Autopilot augmentation, the system ensures balanced control input distribution and significantly attenuates wave disturbances. This development in underwater vehicle control systems offers potential for improved functionality across a range of marine applications. The proposed framework is demonstrated to be robust in a variety of wave conditions, enabling more precise navigation and improved safety in operational scenarios. The effectiveness of this control strategy is validated through extensive simulations using the Joubert BB2 model.</description>

Abstract: Data-driven control benefits from rich datasets, but constructing such datasets becomes challenging when gathering data is limited. We consider an offline experiment design approach to gathering data where we design a control input to collect data that will most improve the performance of a feedback controller. We show how such a control-oriented approach can be used in a setting with linear dynamics and quadratic objective and, through design of a gradient estimator, solve the problem via stochastic gradient descent. We show our formulation numerically outperforms an A- and L-optimal experiment design approach as well as a robust dual control approach.</description>

Abstract: We illustrate the potential of neuromorphic control on the simple mechanical model of a pendulum, with both event-based actuation and sensing. The controller and the pendulum are regarded as event-based systems that occasionally interact to coordinate their respective rhythms. Control occurs through a proper timing of the interacting events. We illustrate the mixed nature of the control design: the design of a rhythmic automaton, able to generate the right sequence of events, and the design of a feedback regulator, able to tune the timing of events.</description>

Abstract: A stability chamber is a critical piece of equipment for any pharmaceutical facility to retain the manufactured product for testing the stability and quality of the products over a certain period of time by keeping the products in different sets of environmental conditions. In this paper, we proposed an IoT-enabled stability chamber for the pharmaceutical industry. We developed four stability chambers by using the existing utilities of a manufacturing facility. The state-of-the-art automatic PID controlling system of Siemens S7-1200 PLC was used to control each chamber. PC-based Siemens WinCC Runtime Advanced visualization platform was used to visualize the data of the chamber which is FDA 21 CFR Part 11 Compliant. Additionally, an Internet of Things-based (IoT-based) application was also developed to monitor the sensor's data remotely using any client application.</description>

      <title>Inner-approximate Reachability Computation via Zonotopic Boundary Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inner-approximate reachability analysis involves calculating subsets of reachable sets, known as inner-approximations. This analysis is crucial in the fields of dynamic systems analysis and control theory as it provides a reliable estimation of the set of states that a system can reach from given initial states at a specific time instant. In this paper, we study the inner-approximate reachability analysis problem based on the set-boundary reachability method for systems modelled by ordinary differential equations, in which the computed inner-approximations are represented with zonotopes. The set-boundary reachability method computes an inner-approximation by excluding states reached from the initial set's boundary. The effectiveness of this method is highly dependent on the efficient extraction of the exact boundary of the initial set. To address this, we propose methods leveraging boundary and tiling matrices that can efficiently extract and refine the exact boundary of the initial set represented by zonotopes. Additionally, we enhance the exclusion strategy by contracting the outer-approximations in a flexible way, which allows for the computation of less conservative inner-approximations. To evaluate the proposed method, we compare it with state-of-the-art methods against a series of benchmarks. The numerical results demonstrate that our method is not only efficient but also accurate in computing inner-approximations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with model predictive control (MPC) of discrete-time linear systems subject to bounded additive disturbance and mixed constraints on the state and input, whereas the true disturbance set is unknown. Unlike most existing work on robust MPC, we propose an algorithm incorporating online learning that builds on prior knowledge of the disturbance, i.e., a known but conservative disturbance set. We approximate the true disturbance set at each time step with a parameterised set, which is referred to as a quantified disturbance set, using disturbance realisations. A key novelty is that the parameterisation of these quantified disturbance sets enjoys desirable properties such that the quantified disturbance set and its corresponding rigid tube bounding disturbance propagation can be efficiently updated online. We provide statistical gaps between the true and quantified disturbance sets, based on which, probabilistic recursive feasibility of MPC optimisation problems is discussed. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and compare with conventional robust MPC algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks on learning-based multi-modal trajectory predictors have already been demonstrated. However, there are still open questions about the effects of perturbations on inputs other than state histories, and how these attacks impact downstream planning and control. In this paper, we conduct a sensitivity analysis on two trajectory prediction models, Trajectron++ and AgentFormer. The analysis reveals that between all inputs, almost all of the perturbation sensitivities for both models lie only within the most recent position and velocity states. We additionally demonstrate that, despite dominant sensitivity on state history perturbations, an undetectable image map perturbation made with the Fast Gradient Sign Method can induce large prediction error increases in both models, revealing that these trajectory predictors are, in fact, susceptible to image-based attacks. Using an optimization-based planner and example perturbations crafted from sensitivity results, we show how these attacks can cause a vehicle to come to a sudden stop from moderate driving speeds.</description>

Abstract: Spacecraft entering Mars require precise navigation algorithms capable of accurately estimating the vehicle's position and velocity in dynamic and uncertain atmospheric environments. Discrepancies between the true Martian atmospheric density and the onboard density model can significantly impair the performance of spacecraft entry navigation filters. This work introduces a new approach to online filtering for Martian entry using a neural network to estimate atmospheric density and employing a consider analysis to account for the uncertainty in the estimate. The network is trained on an exponential atmospheric density model, and its parameters are dynamically adapted in real time to account for any mismatch between the true and estimated densities. The adaptation of the network is formulated as a maximum likelihood problem by leveraging the measurement innovations of the filter to identify optimal network parameters. Within the context of the maximum likelihood approach, incorporating a neural network enables the use of stochastic optimizers known for their efficiency in the machine learning domain. Performance comparisons are conducted against two online adaptive approaches, covariance matching and state augmentation and correction, in various realistic Martian entry navigation scenarios. The results show superior estimation accuracy compared to other approaches, and precise alignment of the estimated density with a broad selection of realistic Martian atmospheres sampled from perturbed Mars-GRAM data.</description>

      <title>Agile But Safe: Learning Collision-Free High-Speed Legged Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Legged robots navigating cluttered environments must be jointly agile for efficient task execution and safe to avoid collisions with obstacles or humans. Existing studies either develop conservative controllers (&lt; 1.0 m/s) to ensure safety, or focus on agility without considering potentially fatal collisions. This paper introduces Agile But Safe (ABS), a learning-based control framework that enables agile and collision-free locomotion for quadrupedal robots. ABS involves an agile policy to execute agile motor skills amidst obstacles and a recovery policy to prevent failures, collaboratively achieving high-speed and collision-free navigation. The policy switch in ABS is governed by a learned control-theoretic reach-avoid value network, which also guides the recovery policy as an objective function, thereby safeguarding the robot in a closed loop. The training process involves the learning of the agile policy, the reach-avoid value network, the recovery policy, and an exteroception representation network, all in simulation. These trained modules can be directly deployed in the real world with onboard sensing and computation, leading to high-speed and collision-free navigation in confined indoor and outdoor spaces with both static and dynamic obstacles.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Attacks and Defenses in Automated Control Systems: A Comprehensive Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13502</link>

Abstract: Integrating machine learning into Automated Control Systems (ACS) enhances decision-making in industrial process management. One of the limitations to the widespread adoption of these technologies in industry is the vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial attacks. This study explores the threats in deploying deep learning models for fault diagnosis in ACS using the Tennessee Eastman Process dataset. By evaluating three neural networks with different architectures, we subject them to six types of adversarial attacks and explore five different defense methods. Our results highlight the strong vulnerability of models to adversarial samples and the varying effectiveness of defense strategies. We also propose a novel protection approach by combining multiple defense methods and demonstrate it's efficacy. This research contributes several insights into securing machine learning within ACS, ensuring robust fault diagnosis in industrial processes.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Safe Control of Neural Network Dynamic Models with Sound Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safe control of neural network dynamic models (NNDMs) is important to robotics and many applications. However, it remains challenging to compute an optimal safe control in real time for NNDM. To enable real-time computation, we propose to use a sound approximation of the NNDM in the control synthesis. In particular, we propose Bernstein over-approximated neural dynamics (BOND) based on the Bernstein polynomial over-approximation (BPO) of ReLU activation functions in NNDM. To mitigate the errors introduced by the approximation and to ensure persistent feasibility of the safe control problems, we synthesize a worst-case safety index using the most unsafe approximated state within the BPO relaxation of NNDM offline. For the online real-time optimization, we formulate the first-order Taylor approximation of the nonlinear worst-case safety constraint as an additional linear layer of NNDM with the l2 bounded bias term for the higher-order remainder. Comprehensive experiments with different neural dynamics and safety constraints show that with safety guaranteed, our NNDMs with sound approximation are 10-100 times faster than the safe control baseline that uses mixed integer programming (MIP), validating the effectiveness of the worst-case safety index and scalability of the proposed BOND in real-time large-scale settings. The code is available at https://github.com/intelligent-control-lab/BOND.</description>

      <title>A finite-sample generalization bound for stable LPV systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the main theoretical challenges in learning dynamical systems from data is providing upper bounds on the generalization error, that is, the difference between the expected prediction error and the empirical prediction error measured on some finite sample. In machine learning, a popular class of such bounds are the so-called Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) bounds. In this paper, we derive a PAC bound for stable continuous-time linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems. Our bound depends on the H2 norm of the chosen class of the LPV systems, but does not depend on the time interval for which the signals are considered.</description>
