      <title>Exploring the Potential of Hybrid Machine-Learning/Physics-Based Modeling for Atmospheric/Oceanic Prediction Beyond the Medium Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the potential of a hybrid modeling approach that combines machine learning (ML) with conventional physics-based modeling for weather prediction beyond the medium range. It extends the work of Arcomano et al. (2022), which tested the approach for short- and medium-range weather prediction, and the work of Arcomano et al. (2023), which investigated its potential for climate modeling. The hybrid model used for the forecast experiments of the paper is based on the low-resolution, simplified parameterization atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) SPEEDY. In addition to the hybridized prognostic variables of SPEEDY, the current version of the model has three purely ML-based prognostic variables. One of these is 6~h cumulative precipitation, another is the sea surface temperature, while the third is the heat content of the top 300 m deep layer of the ocean. The model has skill in predicting the El Ni\~no cycle and its global teleconnections with precipitation for 3-7 months depending on the season. The model captures equatorial variability of the precipitation associated with Kelvin and Rossby waves and MJO. Predictions of the precipitation in the equatorial region have skill for 15 days in the East Pacific and 11.5 days in the West Pacific. Though the model has low spatial resolution, for these tasks it has prediction skill comparable to what has been published for high-resolution, purely physics-based, conventional operational forecast models.</description>

      <title>Convex Optimization of Initial Perturbations toward Quantitative Weather Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a convex optimization approach to determine perturbations in the initial conditions of a weather phenomenon as control inputs for quantitative weather control. We first construct a sensitivity matrix of outputs, such as accumulated precipitation, to the initial conditions, such as temperature and humidity, through sensitivity analysis of a numerical weather prediction model. We then solve a convex optimization problem to find optimal perturbations in the initial conditions to realize the desired spatial distribution of the targeting outputs. We implement the proposed method in a benchmark of a warm bubble experiment and show that it realizes desired spatial distributions of accumulated precipitation, such as a reference distribution and the reduced maximum value.</description>

      <title>Recent global temperature surge amplified by record-low planetary albedo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2023, the global mean temperature soared to 1.48K above the pre-industrial level, surpassing the previous record by 0.17K. Previous best-guess estimates of known drivers including anthropogenic warming and the El Nino onset fall short by about 0.2K in explaining the temperature rise. Utilizing satellite and reanalysis data, we identify a record-low planetary albedo as the primary factor bridging this gap. The decline is caused largely by a reduced low-cloud cover in the northern mid-latitudes and tropics, in continuation of a multi-annual trend. Understanding how much of the low-cloud trend is due to internal variability, reduced aerosol concentrations, or a possibly emerging low-cloud feedback will be crucial for assessing the current and expected future warming.</description>

      <title>Summer Amplification of Wind Stilling and Land Warming Compounds Energy Risks in a Changing Climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wind energy is key for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and meeting increasing energy demand. Long-term changes in wind resources were extensively studied but notable gaps remain. Meanwhile, the temporal changes and compounding risks received little attention. Here we analyze large-ensemble climate simulations and show that anthropogenic warming can contribute to significant wind stilling, particularly in the warm season of the northern hemisphere midlatitudes. The stilling is related to the amplified warming of the midlatitude land and mid-to-upper troposphere. At representative US sites, the stilling will unlikely threaten the cost-competitiveness of onshore wind relative to fossil energy. However, its impact can exceed a large interest increase and make wind energy less cost-competitive than other clean energy. Moreover, the summertime stilling coincides with surging cooling demand in the midlatitudes and may bring challenges to energy security. The findings about wind stilling and its implications may help inform future energy investments.</description>

      <title>SWIFT: A Monotonic, Flux-Form Semi-Lagrangian Tracer Transport Scheme for Flow with Large Courant Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local conservation of mass and entropy are becoming increasingly desirable properties for modern numerical weather and climate models. This work presents a Flux-Form Semi-Lagrangian (FFSL) transport scheme, called SWIFT, that facilitates this conservation for tracer variables, whilst maintaining other vital properties such as preservation of a constant, monotonicity and positivity. Importantly, these properties all hold for large Courant numbers and multi-dimensional flow, making the scheme appropriate for use within a dynamical core which takes large time steps.
  The SWIFT scheme presented here can be seen as an evolution of the FFSL methods of Leonard et al and Lin and Rood. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional schemes consist of a splitting into a sequence of one-dimensional calculations. The new SWIFT splitting presented here allows monotonic and positivity properties from the one-dimensional calculations to be inherited by the multi-dimensional scheme. These one-dimensional calculations involve separating the mass flux into terms that correspond to integer and fractional parts of the Courant number. Key to achieving conservation is coupling the transport of tracers to the transport of the fluid density, through re-use of the discrete mass flux that was calculated from the fluid density in the transport of the tracers. This work also describes how these properties can still be attained when the tracer is vertically-staggered from the density in a Charney-Phillips grid.</description>

      <title>GA-SmaAt-GNet: Generative Adversarial Small Attention GNet for Extreme Precipitation Nowcasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, data-driven modeling approaches have gained significant attention across various meteorological applications, particularly in weather forecasting. However, these methods often face challenges in handling extreme weather conditions. In response, we present the GA-SmaAt-GNet model, a novel generative adversarial framework for extreme precipitation nowcasting. This model features a unique SmaAt-GNet generator, an extension of the successful SmaAt-UNet architecture, capable of integrating precipitation masks (binarized precipitation maps) to enhance predictive accuracy. Additionally, GA-SmaAt-GNet incorporates an attention-augmented discriminator inspired by the Pix2Pix architecture. This innovative framework paves the way for generative precipitation nowcasting using multiple data sources. We evaluate the performance of SmaAt-GNet and GA-SmaAt-GNet using real-life precipitation data from the Netherlands, revealing notable improvements in overall performance and for extreme precipitation events compared to other models. Specifically, our proposed architecture demonstrates its main performance gain in summer and autumn, when precipitation intensity is typically at its peak. Furthermore, we conduct uncertainty analysis on the GA-SmaAt-GNet model and the precipitation dataset, providing insights into its predictive capabilities. Finally, we employ Grad-CAM to offer visual explanations of our model's predictions, generating activation heatmaps that highlight areas of input activation throughout the network.</description>
