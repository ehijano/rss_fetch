      <title>Occlusion-robust Stylization for Drawing-based 3D Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D animation aims to generate a 3D animated video from an input image and a target 3D motion sequence. Recent advances in image-to-3D models enable the creation of animations directly from user-hand drawings. Distinguished from conventional 3D animation, drawing-based 3D animation is crucial to preserve artist's unique style properties, such as rough contours and distinct stroke patterns. However, recent methods still exhibit quality deterioration in style properties, especially under occlusions caused by overlapping body parts, leading to contour flickering and stroke blurring. This occurs due to a `stylization pose gap' between training and inference in stylization networks designed to preserve drawing styles in drawing-based 3D animation systems. The stylization pose gap denotes that input target poses used to train the stylization network are always in occlusion-free poses, while target poses encountered in an inference include diverse occlusions under dynamic motions. To this end, we propose Occlusion-robust Stylization Framework (OSF) for drawing-based 3D animation. We found that while employing object's edge can be effective input prior for guiding stylization, it becomes notably inaccurate when occlusions occur at inference. Thus, our proposed OSF provides occlusion-robust edge guidance for stylization network using optical flow, ensuring a consistent stylization even under occlusions. Furthermore, OSF operates in a single run instead of the previous two-stage method, achieving 2.4x faster inference and 2.1x less memory.</description>

      <title>CrossSet: Unveiling the Complex Interplay of Two Set-typed Dimensions in Multivariate Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interactive visual analysis of set-typed data, i.e., data with attributes that are of type set, is a rewarding area of research and applications. Valuable prior work has contributed solutions that enable the study of such data with individual set-typed dimensions. In this paper, we present CrossSet, a novel method for the joint study of two set-typed dimensions and their interplay. Based on a task analysis, we describe a new, multi-scale approach to the interactive visual exploration and analysis of such data. Two set-typed data dimensions are jointly visualized using a hierarchical matrix layout, enabling the analysis of the interactions between two set-typed attributes at several levels, in addition to the analysis of individual such dimensions. CrossSet is anchored at a compact, large-scale overview that is complemented by drill-down opportunities to study the relations between and within the set-typed dimensions, enabling an interactive visual multi-scale exploration and analysis of bivariate set-typed data. Such an interactive approach makes it possible to study single set-typed dimensions in detail, to gain an overview of the interaction and association between two such dimensions, to refine one of the dimensions to gain additional details at several levels, and to drill down to the specific interactions of individual set-elements from the set-typed dimensions. To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CrossSet, we have evaluated the new method in the context of several application scenarios.</description>

      <title>Sel3DCraft: Interactive Visual Prompts for User-Friendly Text-to-3D Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-3D (T23D) generation has transformed digital content creation, yet remains bottlenecked by blind trial-and-error prompting processes that yield unpredictable results. While visual prompt engineering has advanced in text-to-image domains, its application to 3D generation presents unique challenges requiring multi-view consistency evaluation and spatial understanding. We present Sel3DCraft, a visual prompt engineering system for T23D that transforms unstructured exploration into a guided visual process. Our approach introduces three key innovations: a dual-branch structure combining retrieval and generation for diverse candidate exploration; a multi-view hybrid scoring approach that leverages MLLMs with innovative high-level metrics to assess 3D models with human-expert consistency; and a prompt-driven visual analytics suite that enables intuitive defect identification and refinement. Extensive testing and user studies demonstrate that Sel3DCraft surpasses other T23D systems in supporting creativity for designers.</description>

      <title>SpA2V: Harnessing Spatial Auditory Cues for Audio-driven Spatially-aware Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-driven video generation aims to synthesize realistic videos that align with input audio recordings, akin to the human ability to visualize scenes from auditory input. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on exploring semantic information, such as the classes of sounding sources present in the audio, limiting their ability to generate videos with accurate content and spatial composition. In contrast, we humans can not only naturally identify the semantic categories of sounding sources but also determine their deeply encoded spatial attributes, including locations and movement directions. This useful information can be elucidated by considering specific spatial indicators derived from the inherent physical properties of sound, such as loudness or frequency. As prior methods largely ignore this factor, we present SpA2V, the first framework explicitly exploits these spatial auditory cues from audios to generate videos with high semantic and spatial correspondence. SpA2V decomposes the generation process into two stages: 1) Audio-guided Video Planning: We meticulously adapt a state-of-the-art MLLM for a novel task of harnessing spatial and semantic cues from input audio to construct Video Scene Layouts (VSLs). This serves as an intermediate representation to bridge the gap between the audio and video modalities. 2) Layout-grounded Video Generation: We develop an efficient and effective approach to seamlessly integrate VSLs as conditional guidance into pre-trained diffusion models, enabling VSL-grounded video generation in a training-free manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpA2V excels in generating realistic videos with semantic and spatial alignment to the input audios.</description>

      <title>AAA-Gaussians: Anti-Aliased and Artifact-Free 3D Gaussian Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized 3D reconstruction, it still faces challenges such as aliasing, projection artifacts, and view inconsistencies, primarily due to the simplification of treating splats as 2D entities. We argue that incorporating full 3D evaluation of Gaussians throughout the 3DGS pipeline can effectively address these issues while preserving rasterization efficiency. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive 3D smoothing filter to mitigate aliasing and present a stable view-space bounding method that eliminates popping artifacts when Gaussians extend beyond the view frustum. Furthermore, we promote tile-based culling to 3D with screen-space planes, accelerating rendering and reducing sorting costs for hierarchical rasterization. Our method achieves state-of-the-art quality on in-distribution evaluation sets and significantly outperforms other approaches for out-of-distribution views. Our qualitative evaluations further demonstrate the effective removal of aliasing, distortions, and popping artifacts, ensuring real-time, artifact-free rendering.</description>

      <title>FaceLift: Learning Generalizable Single Image 3D Face Reconstruction from Synthetic Heads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present FaceLift, a novel feed-forward approach for generalizable high-quality 360-degree 3D head reconstruction from a single image. Our pipeline first employs a multi-view latent diffusion model to generate consistent side and back views from a single facial input, which then feeds into a transformer-based reconstructor that produces a comprehensive 3D Gaussian splats representation. Previous methods for monocular 3D face reconstruction often lack full view coverage or view consistency due to insufficient multi-view supervision. We address this by creating a high-quality synthetic head dataset that enables consistent supervision across viewpoints. To bridge the domain gap between synthetic training data and real-world images, we propose a simple yet effective technique that ensures the view generation process maintains fidelity to the input by learning to reconstruct the input image alongside the view generation. Despite being trained exclusively on synthetic data, our method demonstrates remarkable generalization to real-world images. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we show that FaceLift outperforms state-of-the-art 3D face reconstruction methods on identity preservation, detail recovery, and rendering quality.</description>

      <title>Breaking the mould of Social Mixed Reality -- State-of-the-Art and Glossary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article explores a critical gap in Mixed Reality (MR) technology: while advances have been made, MR still struggles to authentically replicate human embodiment and socio-motor interaction. For MR to enable truly meaningful social experiences, it needs to incorporate multi-modal data streams and multi-agent interaction capabilities. To address this challenge, we present a comprehensive glossary covering key topics such as Virtual Characters and Autonomisation, Responsible AI, Ethics by Design, and the Scientific Challenges of Social MR within Neuroscience, Embodiment, and Technology. Our aim is to drive the transformative evolution of MR technologies that prioritize human-centric innovation, fostering richer digital connections. We advocate for MR systems that enhance social interaction and collaboration between humans and virtual autonomous agents, ensuring inclusivity, ethical design and psychological safety in the process.</description>
