      <title>Global Description of Flutter Dynamics via Koopman Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel parametrization approach for aeroelastic systems utilizing Koopman theory, specifically leveraging the Koopman Bilinear Form (KBF) model. To address the limitations of linear parametric dependence in the KBF model, we introduce the Extended KBF (EKBF) model, which enables a global linear representation of aeroelastic dynamics while capturing stronger nonlinear dependence on, e.g., the flutter parameter. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through two case studies: a 2D academic example and a panel flutter problem. Results show that EKBF effectively interpolates and extrapolates principal eigenvalues, capturing flutter mechanisms, and accurately predicting the flutter boundary even when the data is corrupted by noise. Furthermore, parameterized isostable and isochron identified by EKBF provides valuable insights into the nonlinear flutter system.</description>

      <title>A fast and automated approach for urban CFD simulations: integration with meteorological predictions and its application to drone flights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In past years, several studies have proposed new methods and applications for urban wind simulations. In this article, we present a fast and automatic methodology for reconstructing airflows within urban environments using LiDAR and cadastral data coupled with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Our approach integrates meteorological predictions with computational techniques to simulate the complex interactions between wind currents, buildings, vegetation, water zones and terrain morphology within urban environments. Accurate boundary conditions based on meteorological predictions are introduced into a coupled methodology that directly creates the terrain shape inside the simulation environment, simplifying the geometry creation process, which is one of the most prevalent problems in CFD urban simulations. The simulation results are confronted against ground-truth real data obtained from a meteorological station, showing strong agreement with the outcomes generated by the proposed CFD model, with a concordance correlation coefficient up to $\rho_c = 0.985$ for the wind direction and $\rho_c = 0.853$ for the wind speed. The results from these simulations are then used for validating a wind tunnel approach that mimics the interaction between a moving drone and the extracted wind currents, demonstrating a great improvement in computation times when compared to the most straightforward approach that consists in embedding the drone within the full urban landscape. This research contributes to the advancement of urban CFD modeling, and it has significant implications for various applications, providing valuable insights for urban development.</description>

      <title>Towards scalable surrogate models based on Neural Fields for large scale aerodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel surrogate modeling framework for aerodynamic applications based on Neural Fields. The proposed approach, MARIO (Modulated Aerodynamic Resolution Invariant Operator), addresses non parametric geometric variability through an efficient shape encoding mechanism and exploits the discretization-invariant nature of Neural Fields. It enables training on significantly downsampled meshes, while maintaining consistent accuracy during full-resolution inference. These properties allow for efficient modeling of diverse flow conditions, while reducing computational cost and memory requirements compared to traditional CFD solvers and existing surrogate methods. The framework is validated on two complementary datasets that reflect industrial constraints. First, the AirfRANS dataset consists in a two-dimensional airfoil benchmark with non-parametric shape variations. Performance evaluation of MARIO on this case demonstrates an order of magnitude improvement in prediction accuracy over existing methods across velocity, pressure, and turbulent viscosity fields, while accurately capturing boundary layer phenomena and aerodynamic coefficients. Second, the NASA Common Research Model features three-dimensional pressure distributions on a full aircraft surface mesh, with parametric control surface deflections. This configuration confirms MARIO's accuracy and scalability. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods demonstrates that Neural Field surrogates can provide rapid and accurate aerodynamic predictions under the computational and data limitations characteristic of industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Scale-by-scale kinetic energy flux calculations in simulations of rotating convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15463v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence is an out-of-equilibrium flow state that is characterised by nonzero net fluxes of kinetic energy between different scales of the flow. These fluxes play a crucial role in the formation of characteristic flow structures in many turbulent flows encountered in nature. However, measuring these energy fluxes in practical settings can be challenging as soon as one moves away from unrestricted turbulence in an idealised periodic box. Here, we focus on rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, being the canonical model system to study geophysical and astrophysical flows. Owing to the effect of rotation, this flow can yield a split cascade, where part of the energy is transported to smaller scales (direct cascade), while another fraction is transported to larger scales (inverse cascade). We compare two different techniques for measuring these energy fluxes throughout the domain: one based on a spatial filtering approach and an adapted Fourier-based method. We show how one can use these methods to measure the energy flux adequately in the anisotropic, aperiodic domains encountered in rotating convection, even in domains with spatial confinement. Our measurements reveal that in the studied regime, the bulk flow is dominated by the direct cascade, while significant inverse cascading action is observed most strongly near the top and bottom plates, due to the vortex merging of Ekman plumes into larger flow structures.</description>

      <title>Laminar boundary layer separation over a fully porous bump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates laminar boundary layer separation over a fully porous Gaussian bump using pore-resolved direct numerical simulations. The bump is formed by randomly packed spheres. Compared to a solid bump, the porous surface significantly alters the flow by enabling cross-bump mass flux. Near-wall fluid is drawn into the bump by favorable pressure gradients on the windward side and exits near the crest and leeward side due to adverse pressure gradients. This pore flow weakens the reverse flow and reduces mean shear in the separated region, delaying reattachment and extending the separation zone. The findings highlight the role of porous structures in modulating boundary layer separation.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically Admissible Diffuse Interface Model for Nanoscale Transport of Dense Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate interfacial fluid dynamics and heat transfer at nanoscales using an improved diffuse interface approach for liquid-vapor interfaces in non-equilibrium. Conventional Navier-Stokes-Korteweg (NSK) formulations often fail to accurately capture transport phenomena across extremely thin interfaces due to underestimation of interface resistances. In this work, we improve the NSK model by adding a production term in the momentum equation based on higher-order corrections. To enhance interface resistances, viscosity and thermal conductivity are made dependent on the density gradient, increasing resistance only within the interface region. The gradient-based coefficients are determined by fitting to solutions of the Enskog-Vlasov equation for Couette flow (see Struchtrup and Frezzotti, 2022). Applying these fitted equations to pure heat conduction and planar evaporation problems shows that the model accurately captures interfacial transport, making it a useful tool for studying nanoscale evaporation, thermal management, and droplet dynamics on solid surfaces.</description>

      <title>SENSE -- Sensor-Enhanced Neural Shear Stress Estimation for Quantitative Oilfilm Visualizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wall shear stress quantification is fundamental in fluid dynamics but remains challenging in wind-tunnel experiments. Sensor-based methods offer high accuracy but lack spatial resolution for capturing complex three-dimensional effects. Conversely, oil-film visualization is a simple method to obtain high-resolution surface flow topology by processing a sequence of images using optical flow (OF) techniques. However, leveraging this approach for quantitative analysis suffers from noise and systematic biases. This study introduces SENSE (Sensor-Enhanced Neural Shear Stress Estimation), a data-driven approach that leverages a neural network to enhance OF-based shear stress estimation through the integration of sparse, high-fidelity sensor measurements via a multi-objective loss function. SENSE processes oil-film image sequences directly, inherently mitigating temporal noise without explicit averaging. The method is validated in a turbulent separated flow on a one-sided diffuser. Results demonstrate SENSE's robustness to sequence length and spatial resolution compared to classical optical flow algorithms. Crucially, incorporating sparse sensor data significantly improves quantitative accuracy, achieving over 30% reduction in root-mean-squared error on validation sensors with only 8 strategically distributed sensors. The sensor data provides a global regularization effect, improving estimates far from sensor locations. SENSE offers a promising approach to elevate oil-film visualization to a reliable quantitative measurement technique by combining image sequences and sparse sensor data.</description>

      <title>Propulsion of a flexible foil in a wavy flow: resonance, antiresonance, and destructive self-interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Swimming and flying animals demonstrate remarkable adaptations to diverse flow conditions in their environments. In this study, we aim to advance the fundamental understanding of the interaction between flexible bodies and heterogeneous flow conditions. We develop a linear inviscid model of an elastically mounted foil that passively pitches in response to a prescribed heaving motion and an incoming flow that consists of a traveling wave disturbance superposed on a uniform flow. In addition to the well-known resonant response, the wavy flow induces an antiresonant response for non-dimensional phase velocities near unity due to the emergence of non-circulatory forces that oppose circulatory forces. We also find that the wavy flow destructively interferes with itself, effectively rendering the foil a low-pass filter. The net result is that the waviness of the flow always improves thrust and efficiency when the wavy flow is of a different frequency than the prescribed heaving motion. Such a simple statement cannot be made when the wavy flow and heaving motion have the same frequency. Depending on the wavenumber and relative phase, the two may work in concert or in opposition, but they do open the possibility of simultaneous propulsion and net energy extraction from the flow, which is impossible in a uniform flow.</description>

      <title>Lie Group Theory of Multipole Moments and Shape of Stationary Rotating Fluid Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous framework for determining the equilibrium configurations of uniformly rotating, self-gravitating fluid bodies. This work addresses the classical challenge of modeling rotational deformation in celestial objects such as stars and planets. By integrating foundational theory with modern mathematical tools, we develop a unified formalism that enhances the precision and generality of shape modeling in astrophysical contexts. Our method applies Lie group theory to vector flows and solves functional equations using the Neumann series. We extend Clairaut's classical linear perturbation theory into the nonlinear regime via Lie exponential mapping, yielding a system of nonlinear functional equations for gravitational potential and fluid density. These are analytically tractable using shift operators and Neumann series summation, enabling explicit characterization of density and gravitational perturbations. This leads to an exact nonlinear differential equation for the shape function, describing equilibrium deformation without assuming slow rotation. We validate the framework through exact solutions, including the Maclaurin spheroid, Jacobi ellipsoid, and unit-index polytrope. We also introduce spectral decomposition techniques for analyzing radial harmonics and gravitational perturbations. Using Wigner's formalism for angular momentum addition, we compute higher-order nonlinear corrections efficiently. The framework includes boundary conditions for Legendre harmonics, supporting the derivation of nonlinear Love numbers and gravitational multipole moments. This work offers a comprehensive, non-perturbative approach to modeling rotational and tidal deformations in astrophysical and planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Simulation of the high Mach number motion for bubble collapse in a compressible Euler fluid using Basilisk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine an extreme case of experimentally realizable sonoluminescence, where spherical cavities have an initial radius that is $10$ to $20$ times their ambient radius and change their radius by a factor of over $100$ during the collapse. Among the many physical processes at play, we focus on fluid compressibility, modeled using the Tait-Murnaghan equation of state for a homentropic Euler fluid. To capture such extreme motion, with Mach numbers relative to ambient sound speed greater than one during the final stages of implosion, requires methods beyond the classic approaches of Rayleigh and Gilmore. In this direction, we applied an all-Mach solver developed in the Basilisk framework, actively used to model bubble dynamics. To capture high Mach number motion and resolve dynamics in the sonoluminescence regime, we employed the well-established uniform bubble approximation for the ideal gas inside the bubble. Within this approximation, the all-Mach solver achieved numerically converging results describing the evolution of the bubble wall $R(t)$. Although compressibility slows down the collapse, these bubbles reach velocities exceeding the ambient speed of sound of the surrounding fluid. Our method works for various fluids and is applied to liquid lithium as well as water. Our results reproduce the equation-of-state-dependent asymptotic power-law region predicted by analytic calculations for water and liquid lithium in the case of an empty cavity. When the cavity is filled with an ideal gas, the transition to Mach number greater than one in liquid lithium occurs later in the collapse than for water, making liquid lithium a possible candidate for achieving greater concentration of energy density. Furthermore, an outgoing shock wave, which can diagnose cavitation in opaque fluids such as liquid lithium, is captured without implementing an ad hoc construction algorithm.</description>

      <title>Harnessing natural and mechanical airflows for surface-based atmospheric pollutant removal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11803v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Removal strategies for atmospheric pollutants are increasingly being considered to mitigate global warming and improve public health. However, surface-based removal techniques, such as sorption, catalysis and filtration, are often limited by pollutant transport and removal rate constraints. We evaluate the atmospheric pollutant transport to surfaces and assess the potential of surface-based removal technologies for applications in airflow through cities, HVAC systems and over vehicles. If these removal technologies are applied to their surfaces, cities, solar farms, HVAC systems and filters can achieve atmospheric pollutant removal rates that exceed 1 GtCO$_2$e annually (20-year GWP). Cities have the highest atmospheric pollutant removal potential, with estimates averaging 30 GtCO$_2$, 0.06 GtCH$_4$, 0.0001 GtPM$_{2.5}$, 0.007 GtNO$_\text{x}$ annually. HVAC filters can achieve atmospheric pollutant removal costs as low as \$300 per tCO$_2$e removed when sorption or catalyst technologies are incorporated into their fibre sheets, outperforming the \$2000 per tCO$_2$e removal cost when these technologies are applied to city surfaces. This estimate is based on the literature values for these technologies' costs per square meter. However, our calculations indicate that optimising catalyst properties and surface coverage could lower the cost estimates to below \$100 per tCO$_2$e across these applications. These findings demonstrate that integrating surface-based pollutant removal technologies into infrastructure may offer a scalable pathway to advance climate and health objectives.</description>

      <title>Incipient motion of a single particle on a regular substrate in an oscillatory flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate and model the initiation of motion of a single particle on a structured substrate within an oscillatory boundary layer flow, following a mechanistic approach. By deterministically relating forces and torques acting on the particle to the instantaneous ambient flow, the effects of flow unsteadiness are captured, revealing rich particle dynamics. Laboratory experiments in an oscillatory flow tunnel characterise the initiation and early stages of motion, with particle imaging velocimetry measurements yielding the flow conditions at the motion threshold. The experiments validate and complement results from particle-resolved direct numerical simulations, combining an immersed boundary method with a discrete element method that incorporates a static friction contact model. Within the parameter range just above the motion threshold, the mobile particle rolls without sliding over the substrate, indicating that motion initiation is governed by an unbalanced torque rather than a force. Both experimental and numerical results show excellent agreement with an analytical torque balance including hydrodynamic torque derived from the theoretical Stokes velocity profile, and contributions of lift, added mass, and externally imposed pressure gradient. In addition to static and rolling particle states, we identify a wiggling regime where the particle moves but does not leave its original pocket. Our deterministic approach enables prediction of the phase within the oscillation cycle at which the particle starts moving, without relying on empirical threshold estimates, and can be extended to a wide range of flow and substrate conditions, as long as turbulence is absent and interactions with other mobile particles are negligible.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic description of flake orientation suspended in rotating wave flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In fluid dynamics experiments, flake-based flow visualization is a common technique to capture flow structures through the rays reflected from flat tracers suspended in the fluid. However, the correspondence between light intensity patterns in visualization images and the underlying physical properties of the flow can only be elucidated when the flow is known {\it a priori}. To reframe this limitation, just as the introduction of spin variable transformed quantum mechanics, we introduced the orientation variable into fluid dynamics and derived the time-dependent equation of the tracer orientation probability density field from an Eulerian perspective. As a first example in which a dimensionless parameter distinguishes the dependency on the initial condition, we illustrated an analytical solution of the orientation probability in a rotating wave flow. With the inclusion of the diffusion term in the governing equation, the probability converged to the flow-determined state with spatially varying anisotropy, eliminating dependency on initial conditions. As a second example, we solved the orientation probability field in the axisymmetric state in spherical Couette flow, to demonstrate independence from initial conditions consistent with experimental observations. An asymmetric pattern in experimental images, unexplained by the dynamics of the tracer orientation, was reproduced from the unique solution of the proposed equations.</description>

      <title>Anomalous interference drives oscillatory dynamics in wave-dressed active particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent surge of discoveries has sparked significant interest in active systems where a particle moves autonomously in resonance with its self-generated wave field, leading to notable wave-mediated effects including new propulsion mechanisms, spontaneous oscillatory dynamics, and quantum-like phenomena. Drawing from an archetypical model of wave-dressed active particles, we unveil a wave-mediated non-local force driving their dynamics, arising from the particle's path memory and an unconventional form of wave interference near jerking points, locations where the particle's velocity changes rapidly. In contrast to the typical case of constructive interference at points of stationary phase, waves excited by the particle near jerking points avoid cancellation through rapid changes in frequency. Through an asymptotic analysis, we derive the wave force from jerking points, revealing it as an elusive but crucial remnant of the particle's past motion that underlies a range of phenomena previously regarded as disparate -- including in-line speed oscillations, wave-like statistics in potential wells, and non-specular reflections -- and places them within a unified mechanistic framework resulting from generic wave superposition principles.</description>
