      <title>Topological bands in metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In crystalline systems with a superstructure, the electron dispersion can form a nontrivial covering of the Brillouin zone. It is proved that the number of sheets in this covering and its monodromy are topological invariants under ambient isotopy. As a concrete manifestation of this nontrivial topology, we analyze three-sublattice models for 120$^\circ$-ordered helimagnets in one, two, and three dimensions. The two-dimensional system exhibits unconventional $f$-wave magnetism and a specific topological metal state characterized by a spin-textured, one-sheeted Fermi surface. The observable transport signatures of the topological metal and its potential experimental realization are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Extra force in charged resonant capacitors: a new macroscopic effect of vacuum fluctuations ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on measurements of the mechanical vibrations of the fundamental mode of resonant capacitive transducers, consisting of parallel plates at different gaps (10 - 26 $\mu$m). Resonant frequency data were taken vs the electric field at constant charge, at various temperatures and different configurations. All measurements exhibited unexpectedly large tuning, caused by an additional, unpredicted attractive force. Such force has a divergent behaviour characterized by a critical electrical field and start to diverge long before the critical point. Many known physical mechanisms have been considered to explain this force, but all of them had to be discarded. Thus, we turn to non-conventional physical mechanisms and suggest that vacuum fluctuations inside the gap could be a possible cause of this anomalous force.</description>

      <title>Localized fermions on the triangular lattice with Ising-like interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The model of localized fermions on the triangular lattice is analyzed in means of the Monte Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble. The Hamiltonian of the system has a form of the extended Hubbard model (at the atomic limit) with nearest-neighbor Ising-like magnetic $J$ interactions and onsite Coulomb $U$ interactions. The model is investigated for both signs of $J$, arbitrary $U$ interaction and arbitrary chemical potential $\mu$ (or, equivalently, arbitrary particle concentration $n$). Based on the specific heat capacity and sublattice magnetization analyses, the phase diagrams of the model are determined. For ferromagnetic case ($J&lt;0$), the transition from the ordered phase (which is a standard ferromagnet and can be stable up to $k_{B}T/|J| \approx 0.61$) is found to be second-order (for sufficiently large temperatures $k_{B}T/|J| \gtrsim 0.2$) or first-order (for $-1&lt;U/|J|&lt;-0.65$ at the half-filling, i.e., $n=1$). In the case of $J&gt;0$, the ordered phase occurs in a range of $-1/2&lt;U/|J|&lt;0$ (for $n=1$), while for larger $U$ the state with short-range order is also found (also for $n \neq 1$). The ordered phase is characterized by an antiferromagnetic arrangement of magnetic moments in two sublattices forming the hexagonal lattice. The transition from this ordered phase, which is found also for $\mu \neq 0$ ($n \neq 1$) and $U/|J|&gt;-1/2$ is always second-order for any model parameters. The ordered phase for $J&gt;0$ can be stable up to $k_{B}T/|J| \approx 0.06$.</description>

      <title>Particle-Hole Asymmetry and Pinball Liquid in a Triangular-Lattice Extended Hubbard Model within Mean-Field Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, triangular lattice models have received a lot of attention since they can describe a number of strongly-correlated materials that exhibit superconductivity and various magnetic and charge orders. In this research we present an extensive analysis of the charge-ordering phenomenon of the triangular-lattice extended Hubbard model with repulsive onsite and nearest-neighbor interaction, arbitrary charge concentration, and $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ supercell (3-sublattice assumption). The model is solved in the ground state with the mean-field approximation which allowed to identify $8$ charge-ordered phases and a large variety of phase transitions. An exotic pinball-liquid phase was found and described. Moreover, strong particle-hole asymmetry of the phase diagram is found to play an important role for triangular lattices. The detailed analysis of band structures, unavailable for more advanced methods, such as dynamical mean-field theory, allowed us to interpret the found triangular-lattice phases and provided a great insight into the mechanisms behind the phase transitions that can also be met when correlation effects are taken into account. The complexity of the mean-field phase diagram showed the importance and usefulness of the results for the further research with correlation effects included. Together with atomic-limit approximation it can serve them as both a starting point, and a tool to interpret results.</description>

      <title>Microwave-activated high-fidelity three-qubit gate scheme for fixed-frequency superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalable superconducting quantum processors require balancing critical constraints in coherence, control complexity, and spectral crowding. Fixed-frequency architectures suppress flux noise and simplify control via all-microwave operations but remain limited by residual ZZ crosstalk. Here we propose a microwave-activated three-qubit gate protocol for fixed-frequency transmon qubits in the large-detuning regime ($|\Delta| \gg g$), leveraging the third-order nonlinear interaction to coherently exchange $\ket{001} \leftrightarrow \ket{110}$ states. By incorporating a phase-compensated optimization protocol, numerical simulations demonstrate a high average gate fidelity exceeding $99.9\%$. Systematic error analysis identifies static long-range ZZ coupling as the dominant error source in multi-qubit systems, which can be suppressed via operations in the large-detuning regime ($\sim 1$ GHz). The protocol maintains process fidelities exceeding $98\%$ under decoherence, while demonstrating intrinsic robustness to fabrication-induced parameter variations and compatibility with existing all-microwave two-qubit gate architectures. This hardware-efficient strategy advances scalable quantum computing systems by improving coherence properties, reducing spectral congestion, and expanding the experimental toolkit for error-resilient quantum operations in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.</description>
