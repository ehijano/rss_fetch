      <title>Binding energy of $^{3}_{\Lambda}\rm{H}$ and $^{4}_{\Lambda}\rm{H}$ via image analyses of nuclear emulsions using deep-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subatomic systems are pivotal for understanding fundamental baryonic interactions, as they provide direct access to quark-level degrees of freedom. In particular, introducing a strange quark adds "strangeness" as a new dimension, offering a powerful tool for exploring nuclear forces. The hypertriton, the lightest three-body hypernuclear system, provides an ideal testing ground for investigating baryonic interactions and quark behavior involving up, down, and strange quarks. However, experimental measurements of its lifetime and binding energy, key indicators of baryonic interactions, show significant deviations in results obtained from energetic collisions of heavy-ion beams. Identifying alternative pathways for precisely measuring the hypertriton's binding energy and lifetime is thus crucial for advancing experimental and theoretical nuclear physics. Here, we present an experimental study on the binding energies of $^3_{\Lambda}\mathrm{H}$ (hypertriton) and $^4_{\Lambda}\mathrm{H}$, performed through the analysis of photographic nuclear emulsions using modern techniques. By incorporating deep-learning methods, we uncovered systematic uncertainties in conventional nuclear emulsion analyses and established a refined calibration protocol for determining binding energies accurately. Our results are independent of those obtained from heavy-ion collision experiments, offering a complementary measurement and opening new avenues for investigating few-body hypernuclei interactions.</description>

      <title>Single-atom-at-a-time adsorption studies of $^{211}$Bi and its precursor $^{211}$Pb on SiO$_{2}$ surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In preparation of gas-phase chemical experiments with moscovium (Mc, element 115), we studied the chemical behavior of the short-lived bismuth radioisotope $^{211}$Bi in helium, argon, and oxygen atmosphere. Internal chromatograms were recorded as a function of various parameters including carrier gas type and flow rate, thus characterizing the novel miniCOMPACT detector array. This aids to optimize the conditions for experiments with superheavy elements. The bismuth progeny of $^{219}$Rn deposited on the SiO$_{2}$ surface of the miniCOMPACT via diffusion-controlled deposition. Bismuth showed the expected high reactivity towards the SiO$_{2}$ surface of the miniCOMPACT. Experiments in argon and oxygen atmosphere showed no measurable differences in the deposition distribution of the activity. The intermediate 36-min $^{211}$Pb is a member of the $^{227}$Ac decay chain, feeding the studied bismuth isotope, was taken into account. To extract thermodynamical data from the results, namely the lower limit of the value of the adsorption enthalpy of Bi on SiO$_{2}$, we performed Monte Carlo simulations, adapted to account for the precursor effect, and compared the experimental results to their output. Simulations were also performed for bismuths heavier homologue, moscovium, using a theoretically predicted value for the adsorption enthalpy of this element on SiO$_{2}$. These suggest moscovium to adsorb in the first part of the miniCOMPACT detection array, in line with recent observations.</description>

      <title>Towards the determination of CP-odd pion-nucleon couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nucleon matrix elements (NMEs) associated with quark chromo-magnetic dipole moments (cMDMs) play a crucial role in determining the CP-odd pion-nucleon couplings induced by quark chromo-electric dipole moments. In recent years, it has been argued that the NMEs of cMDMs can be related to the third moment of the nucleon's higher-twist (specifically, twist-three) parton distribution function (PDF) $e(x)$, which can, in principle, be measured through dihadron production in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering processes. By applying the spin-flavor expansion to the cMDM operators in the large-$N_c$ limit, where $N_c$ is the number of quark colors, we show that the NMEs receive contributions not only from the twist-three PDF $e(x)$ but also from an additional, previously neglected nucleon form factor. Incorporating constraints from the spin-flavor expansion, recent experimental data on $e(x)$, as well as model calculations of $e(x)$, we estimate the NMEs of the cMDM operators. Our analysis indicates that the NMEs are dominated by the nucleon form factors, and the cMDM contributions to pion-nucleon couplings can be comparable to those from the quark sigma terms.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Spin-Density Matrix Elements in $\phi(1020)\to K_S^0K_L^0$ Photoproduction with a Linearly Polarized Photon Beam at $E_\gamma=8.2-8.8$ GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure the spin-density matrix elements (SDMEs) for the photoproduction of $\phi(1020)$ off of the proton in its decay to $K_S^0K_L^0$, using 105 pb$^{-1}$ of data collected with a linearly polarized photon beam using the GlueX experiment. The SDMEs are measured in nine bins of the squared four-momentum transfer $t$ in the range $-t=0.15-1.0$ GeV$^2$, providing the first measurement of their $t$-dependence for photon beam energies $E_\gamma = 8.2-8.8$ GeV. We confirm the dominance of Pomeron exchange in this region, and put constraints on the contribution of other Regge exchanges. We also find that helicity amplitudes where the helicity of the photon and the $\phi(1020)$ differ by two units are negligible.</description>

      <title>Proton cumulants from hydrodynamics in light of new STAR data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New measurements of proton number cumulants from the Beam Energy Scan Phase II (BES-II) program at RHIC by the STAR Collaboration provide unprecedented precision and insights into the properties of strongly interacting matter. This report discusses the measurements in the context of predictions from hydrodynamics, emphasizing the enhanced sensitivity of factorial cumulants and their implications for the search for the QCD critical point. The experimental data shows enhancement of second-order factorial cumulants and suppression of third-order factorial cumulants relative to the non-critical baseline at $7.7 &lt; \sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} \lesssim 10$ GeV. We discuss implications of this observation for the possible location of the critical point in the QCD phase diagram and opportunities for future measurements of acceptance dependence of factorial cumulants.</description>

      <title>A simple schematic model for a cross section deficit in $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C fusion reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A cross section deficit phenomenon has been observed in $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C fusion reactions at astrophysical energies, at which fusion cross sections are suppressed in the off-resonance regions as compared to fusion cross sections for the $^{12}$C+$^{13}$C system. I here construct a simple schematic model which simulates this phenomenon. The model consists of a random matrix Hamiltonian based on the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE), which is coupled to an entrance channel Hamiltonian in the discrete basis representation. I show that the transmission coefficients are almost unity when both the level density and the decay widths of the GOE configurations are large, realizing the strong absorption regime. On the other hand, when these parameters are small, the transmission coefficients are significantly structured as a function of energy. In that situation, the transmission coefficients at resonance energies reach unity in this model, that is consistent with the experimental finding of the cross section deficit.</description>

      <title>First image-guided treatment of a mouse tumor with radioactive ion beams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14898v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radioactive ion beams (RIB) are a key focus of current research in nuclear physics. Already long ago it was proposed that they could have applications in cancer therapy. In fact, while charged particle therapy is potentially the most effective radiotherapy technique available, it is highly susceptible to uncertainties in the beam range. RIB are well-suited for image-guided particle therapy, as isotopes that undergo \b{eta}+-decay can be precisely visualized using positron emission tomography (PET), enabling accurate real-time monitoring of the beam range. We successfully treated a mouse osteosarcoma using a radioactive 11C-ion beam. The tumor was located in the neck, in close proximity to the spinal cord, increasing the risk of radiation-induced myelopathy from even slight variations in the beam range caused by anatomical changes or incorrect calibration of the planning CT. We managed to completely control the tumor with the highest dose while minimizing toxicity. Low-grade neurological side effects were correlated to the positron activity measured in the spine. The biological washout of the activity from the tumor volume was dependent on the dose, indicating a potential component of vascular damage at high doses. This experiment marks the first instance of tumor treatment using RIB and paves the way for future clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit correlation and spatial distributions for spin-0 hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin-orbit correlation in spin-0 hadrons can be investigated through the kinetic energy-momentum tensor form factor $\tilde F^q(t)$. We observe that the latter is also related to a torque about the radial direction, which we interpret as a chiral stress. If we neglect the quark mass contribution, then $\tilde F^q(t)$ is simply proportional to the electromagnetic form factor for spin-0 hadrons, and the spin-orbit correlation is equal to minus half of the valence quark number. Given the extensive studies on the electromagnetic form factor for spin-0 hadrons such as pions, kaons, and the $\alpha$ particle, we present the spatial distributions of chiral stress and kinetic spin-orbit correlation based on current parametrizations of the pion electromagnetic form factor.</description>

Abstract: Astrophysical observations of the cosmos allow us to probe extreme physics and answer foundational questions on our universe. Modern astronomy is increasingly operating under a holistic approach, probing the same question with multiple diagnostics including how sources vary over time, how they appear across the electromagnetic spectrum, and through their other signatures, including gravitational waves, neutrinos, cosmic rays, and dust on Earth. Astrophysical observations are now reaching the point where approximate physics models are insufficient. Key sources of interest are explosive transients, whose understanding requires multidisciplinary studies at the intersection of astrophysics, gravity, nuclear science, plasma physics, fluid dynamics and turbulence, computation, particle physics, atomic, molecular, and optical science, condensed matter and materials science, radiation transport, and high energy density physics. This white paper provides an overview of the major scientific advances that lay at the intersection of physics and astronomy and are best probed through time-domain and multimessenger astrophysics, an exploration of how multidisciplinary science can be fostered, and introductory descriptions of the relevant scientific disciplines and key astrophysical sources of interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this document drafted by the Neutrino Scattering Theory Experiment Collaboration (NuSTEC), we provide input on the synergies between theoretical and experimental efforts that can provide critical input to the prediction accuracy needed for the forthcoming high-precision neutrino measurements. These efforts involve a wide range of energies and interaction processes, as well as target nuclei and interaction probes. The challenges discussed will be overcome only through the active support of integrated collaboration across strong and electroweak physics from both the nuclear and high energy physics communities.</description>
