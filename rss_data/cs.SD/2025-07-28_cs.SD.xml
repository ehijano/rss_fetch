      <title>SCORE-SET: A dataset of GuitarPro files for Music Phrase Generation and Sequence Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A curated dataset of Guitar Pro tablature files (.gp5 format), tailored for tasks involving guitar music generation, sequence modeling, and performance-aware learning is provided. The dataset is derived from MIDI notes in MAESTRO and GiantMIDI which have been adapted into rhythm guitar tracks. These tracks are further processed to include a variety of expression settings typical of guitar performance, such as bends, slides, vibrato, and palm muting, to better reflect the nuances of real-world guitar playing.</description>

      <title>HH-Codec: High Compression High-fidelity Discrete Neural Codec for Spoken Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete speech tokenization is a fundamental component in speech codecs. However, in large-scale speech-to-speech systems, the complexity of parallel streams from multiple quantizers and the computational cost of high-time-dimensional codecs pose significant challenges. In this paper, we introduce HH-Codec, a neural codec that achieves extreme compression at 24 tokens per second for 24 kHz audio while relying on single-quantizer inference. Our approach involves a carefully designed Vector Quantization space for Spoken Language Modeling, optimizing compression efficiency while minimizing information loss. Building on this, we propose an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture (Audio-VQ-Mel-Audio) that leverages dual supervision and progressive training to enhance reconstruction stability and fidelity. HH-Codec achieves state-of-the-art performance in speech reconstruction with an ultra-low bandwidth of 0.3 kbps. We further evaluate its effectiveness in codebook utilization and generative model adaptation, with extensive ablations validating the necessity of each module. HH-Codec is available at https://github.com/opendilab/HH-Codec.</description>

      <title>MLLM-based Speech Recognition: When and How is Multimodality Beneficial?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new possibilities for unified modeling of speech, text, images, and other modalities. Building on our prior work, this paper examines the conditions and model architectures under which multiple input modalities can improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) accuracy in noisy environments. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, we find that (1) harnessing more modalities usually improves ASR accuracy, as each modality provides complementary information, but the improvement depends on the amount of auditory noise. (2) Synchronized modalities (e.g., lip movements) are more useful at high noise levels whereas unsynchronized modalities (e.g., image context) are most helpful at moderate noise levels. (3) Higher-quality visual representations consistently improve ASR accuracy, highlighting the importance of developing more powerful visual encoders. (4) Mamba exhibits similar trends regarding the benefits of multimodality as do Transformers. (5) The input order of modalities as well as their weights in the loss function can significantly impact accuracy. These findings both offer practical insights and help to deepen our understanding of multi-modal speech recognition under challenging conditions.</description>

      <title>From Continuous to Discrete: Cross-Domain Collaborative General Speech Enhancement via Hierarchical Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces OmniGSE, a novel general speech enhancement (GSE) framework designed to mitigate the diverse distortions that speech signals encounter in real-world scenarios. These distortions include background noise, reverberation, bandwidth limitations, signal clipping, and network packet loss. Existing methods typically focus on optimizing for a single type of distortion, often struggling to effectively handle the simultaneous presence of multiple distortions in complex scenarios. OmniGSE bridges this gap by integrating the strengths of discriminative and generative approaches through a two-stage architecture that enables cross-domain collaborative optimization. In the first stage, continuous features are enhanced using a lightweight channel-split NAC-RoFormer. In the second stage, discrete tokens are generated to reconstruct high-quality speech through language models. Specifically, we designed a hierarchical language model structure consisting of a RootLM and multiple BranchLMs. The RootLM models general acoustic features across codebook layers, while the BranchLMs explicitly capture the progressive relationships between different codebook levels. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniGSE surpasses existing models across multiple benchmarks, particularly excelling in scenarios involving compound distortions. These findings underscore the framework's potential for robust and versatile speech enhancement in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Latent Granular Resynthesis using Neural Audio Codecs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel technique for creative audio resynthesis that operates by reworking the concept of granular synthesis at the latent vector level. Our approach creates a "granular codebook" by encoding a source audio corpus into latent vector segments, then matches each latent grain of a target audio signal to its closest counterpart in the codebook. The resulting hybrid sequence is decoded to produce audio that preserves the target's temporal structure while adopting the source's timbral characteristics. This technique requires no model training, works with diverse audio materials, and naturally avoids the discontinuities typical of traditional concatenative synthesis through the codec's implicit interpolation during decoding. We include supplementary material at https://github.com/naotokui/latentgranular/ , as well as a proof-of-concept implementation to allow users to experiment with their own sounds at https://huggingface.co/spaces/naotokui/latentgranular .</description>

      <title>Face2VoiceSync: Lightweight Face-Voice Consistency for Text-Driven Talking Face Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies in speech-driven talking face generation achieve promising results, but their reliance on fixed-driven speech limits further applications (e.g., face-voice mismatch). Thus, we extend the task to a more challenging setting: given a face image and text to speak, generating both talking face animation and its corresponding speeches. Accordingly, we propose a novel framework, Face2VoiceSync, with several novel contributions: 1) Voice-Face Alignment, ensuring generated voices match facial appearance; 2) Diversity \&amp; Manipulation, enabling generated voice control over paralinguistic features space; 3) Efficient Training, using a lightweight VAE to bridge visual and audio large-pretrained models, with significantly fewer trainable parameters than existing methods; 4) New Evaluation Metric, fairly assessing the diversity and identity consistency. Experiments show Face2VoiceSync achieves both visual and audio state-of-the-art performances on a single 40GB GPU.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present our studies and experiments carried out for the task 1 of the Challenge and Workshop on Multilingual Conversational Speech Language Model (MLC-SLM), which focuses on advancing multilingual conversational speech recognition through the development of speech language models architectures. Given the increasing relevance of real-world conversational data for building robust Spoken Dialogue Systems, we explore three approaches to multilingual ASR. First, we conduct an evaluation of the official baseline to better understand its strengths and limitations, by training two projectors (linear and qformer) with different foundation models. Second we leverage the SLAM-ASR framework to train a custom multilingual linear projector. Finally we investigate the role of contrastive learning and the extended conversational context in enhancing the robustness of recognition.</description>

      <title>KuiSCIMA v2.0: Improved Baselines, Calibration, and Cross-Notation Generalization for Historical Chinese Music Notations in Jiang Kui's Baishidaoren Gequ</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical Music Recognition (OMR) for historical Chinese musical notations, such as suzipu and l\"ul\"upu, presents unique challenges due to high class imbalance and limited training data. This paper introduces significant advancements in OMR for Jiang Kui's influential collection Baishidaoren Gequ from 1202. In this work, we develop and evaluate a character recognition model for scarce imbalanced data. We improve upon previous baselines by reducing the Character Error Rate (CER) from 10.4% to 7.1% for suzipu, despite working with 77 highly imbalanced classes, and achieve a remarkable CER of 0.9% for l\"ul\"upu. Our models outperform human transcribers, with an average human CER of 15.9% and a best-case CER of 7.6%. We employ temperature scaling to achieve a well-calibrated model with an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) below 0.0162. Using a leave-one-edition-out cross-validation approach, we ensure robust performance across five historical editions. Additionally, we extend the KuiSCIMA dataset to include all 109 pieces from Baishidaoren Gequ, encompassing suzipu, l\"ul\"upu, and jianzipu notations. Our findings advance the digitization and accessibility of historical Chinese music, promoting cultural diversity in OMR and expanding its applicability to underrepresented music traditions.</description>

      <title>CatchPhrase: EXPrompt-Guided Encoder Adaptation for Audio-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose CatchPhrase, a novel audio-to-image generation framework designed to mitigate semantic misalignment between audio inputs and generated images. While recent advances in multi-modal encoders have enabled progress in cross-modal generation, ambiguity stemming from homographs and auditory illusions continues to hinder accurate alignment. To address this issue, CatchPhrase generates enriched cross-modal semantic prompts (EXPrompt Mining) from weak class labels by leveraging large language models (LLMs) and audio captioning models (ACMs). To address both class-level and instance-level misalignment, we apply multi-modal filtering and retrieval to select the most semantically aligned prompt for each audio sample (EXPrompt Selector). A lightweight mapping network is then trained to adapt pre-trained text-to-image generation models to audio input. Extensive experiments on multiple audio classification datasets demonstrate that CatchPhrase improves audio-to-image alignment and consistently enhances generation quality by mitigating semantic misalignment.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Personality Dimensions Across Situations Using Conversational Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prior research indicates that users prefer assistive technologies whose personalities align with their own. This has sparked interest in automatic personality perception (APP), which aims to predict an individual's perceived personality traits. Previous studies in APP have treated personalities as static traits, independent of context. However, perceived personalities can vary by context and situation as shown in psychological research. In this study, we investigate the relationship between conversational speech and perceived personality for participants engaged in two work situations (a neutral interview and a stressful client interaction). Our key findings are: 1) perceived personalities differ significantly across interactions, 2) loudness, sound level, and spectral flux features are indicative of perceived extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness in neutral interactions, while neuroticism correlates with these features in stressful contexts, 3) handcrafted acoustic features and non-verbal features outperform speaker embeddings in inference of perceived personality, and 4) stressful interactions are more predictive of neuroticism, aligning with existing psychological research.</description>

      <title>Should Top-Down Clustering Affect Boundaries in Unsupervised Word Discovery?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19204v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of segmenting unlabeled speech into word-like units and clustering these to create a lexicon. Prior work can be categorized into two frameworks. Bottom-up methods first determine boundaries and then cluster the fixed segmented words into a lexicon. In contrast, top-down methods incorporate information from the clustered words to inform boundary selection. However, it is unclear whether top-down information is necessary to improve segmentation. To explore this, we look at two similar approaches that differ in whether top-down clustering informs boundary selection. Our simple bottom-up strategy predicts word boundaries using the dissimilarity between adjacent self-supervised features, then clusters the resulting segments to construct a lexicon. Our top-down system is an updated version of the ES-KMeans dynamic programming method that iteratively uses K-means to update its boundaries. On the five-language ZeroSpeech benchmarks, both approaches achieve comparable state-of-the-art results, with the bottom-up system being nearly five times faster. Through detailed analyses, we show that the top-down influence of ES-KMeans can be beneficial (depending on factors like the candidate boundaries), but in many cases the simple bottom-up method performs just as well. For both methods, we show that the clustering step is a limiting factor. Therefore, we recommend that future work focus on improved clustering techniques and learning more discriminative word-like representations.

      <title>SpeechIQ: Speech Intelligence Quotient Across Cognitive Levels in Voice Understanding Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Speech-based Intelligence Quotient (SIQ) as a new form of human cognition-inspired evaluation pipeline for voice understanding large language models, LLM Voice, designed to assess their voice understanding ability. Moving beyond popular voice understanding metrics such as word error rate (WER), SIQ examines LLM Voice across three cognitive levels motivated by Bloom's Taxonomy: (1) Remembering (i.e., WER for verbatim accuracy); (2) Understanding (i.e., similarity of LLM's interpretations); and (3) Application (i.e., QA accuracy for simulating downstream tasks). We demonstrate that SIQ not only quantifies voice understanding abilities but also provides unified comparisons between cascaded methods (e.g., ASR LLM) and end-to-end models, identifies annotation errors in existing benchmarks, and detects hallucinations in LLM Voice. Our framework represents a first-of-its-kind intelligence examination that bridges cognitive principles with voice-oriented benchmarks, while exposing overlooked challenges in multi-modal training.</description>

      <title>Binaural Target Speaker Extraction using HRTFs and a Complex-Valued Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to imitate the human ability to selectively attend to a single speaker, even in the presence of multiple simultaneous talkers. We propose a novel approach for binaural target speaker extraction that leverages the listener's Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF) to isolate the desired speaker. Notably, our method does not rely on speaker embeddings, making it speaker-independent and enabling strong generalization across multiple speech datasets in different languages.
  We employ a fully complex-valued neural network that operates directly on the complex-valued Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) of the mixed audio signals. This deviates from conventional approaches that use spectrograms or treat the real and imaginary components of the STFT as separate real-valued inputs.
  We first evaluate the method in an anechoic, noise-free scenario, where it demonstrates excellent extraction performance while effectively preserving the binaural cues of the target signal. We then test a modified variant under mild reverberation conditions. This version remains robust in reverberant environments, maintaining speech clarity, preserving source directionality, and simultaneously reducing reverberation.</description>

      <title>Integrating IP Broadcasting with Audio Tags: Workflow and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15423v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The broadcasting industry has adopted IP technologies, revolutionising both live and pre-recorded content production, from news gathering to live music events. IP broadcasting allows for the transport of audio and video signals in an easily configurable way, aligning with modern networking techniques. This shift towards an IP workflow allows for much greater flexibility, not only in routing signals but with the integration of tools using standard web development techniques. One possible tool could include the use of live audio tagging, which has a number of uses in the production of content. These could include adding sound effects to automated closed captioning or identifying unwanted sound events within a scene. In this paper, we describe the process of containerising an audio tagging model into a microservice, a small segregated code module that can be integrated into a multitude of different network setups. The goal is to develop a modular, accessible, and flexible tool capable of seamless deployment into broadcasting workflows of all sizes, from small productions to large corporations. Challenges surrounding latency of the selected audio tagging model and its effect on the usefulness of the end product are discussed.</description>

Abstract: Recent developments in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) have demonstrated significant potential for Speaker Verification (SV), but closing the performance gap with supervised systems remains an ongoing challenge. SSL frameworks rely on anchor-positive pairs, constructed from segments of the same audio utterance. Hence, positives have channel characteristics similar to those of their corresponding anchors, even with extensive data-augmentation. Therefore, this positive sampling strategy is a fundamental limitation as it encodes too much information regarding the recording source in the learned representations. This article introduces Self-Supervised Positive Sampling (SSPS), a bootstrapped technique for sampling appropriate and diverse positives in SSL frameworks for SV. SSPS samples positives close to their anchor in the representation space, assuming that these pseudo-positives belong to the same speaker identity but correspond to different recording conditions. This method consistently demonstrates improvements in SV performance on VoxCeleb benchmarks when applied to major SSL frameworks, including SimCLR, SwAV, VICReg, and DINO. Using SSPS, SimCLR and DINO achieve 2.57% and 2.53% EER on VoxCeleb1-O, respectively. SimCLR yields a 58% relative reduction in EER, getting comparable performance to DINO with a simpler training framework. Furthermore, SSPS lowers intra-class variance and reduces channel information in speaker representations while exhibiting greater robustness without data-augmentation.</description>

      <title>SALM-Duplex: Efficient and Direct Duplex Modeling for Speech-to-Speech Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15670v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spoken dialogue is an intuitive form of human-computer interaction, yet current speech language models often remain constrained to turn-based exchanges, lacking real-time adaptability such as user barge-in. We propose a novel duplex speech to speech (S2S) architecture featuring continuous user inputs and codec agent outputs with channel fusion that directly models simultaneous user and agent streams. Using a pretrained streaming encoder for user input enables the first duplex S2S model without requiring speech pretrain. Separate architectures for agent and user modeling facilitate codec fine-tuning for better agent voices and halve the bitrate (0.6 kbps) compared to previous works. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms previous duplex models in reasoning, turn-taking, and barge-in abilities. The model requires significantly less speech data, as speech pretrain is skipped, which markedly simplifies the process of building a duplex S2S model from any LLMs. Finally, it is the first openly available duplex S2S model with training and inference code to foster reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Acoustically Precise Hesitation Tagging Is Essential for End-to-End Verbatim Transcription Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Verbatim transcription for automatic speaking assessment demands accurate capture of disfluencies, crucial for downstream tasks like error analysis and feedback. However, many ASR systems discard or generalize hesitations, losing important acoustic details. We fine-tune Whisper models on the Speak &amp; Improve 2025 corpus using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), without recourse to external audio training data. We compare three annotation schemes: removing hesitations (Pure), generic tags (Rich), and acoustically precise fillers inferred by Gemini 2.0 Flash from existing audio-transcript pairs (Extra). Our challenge system achieved 6.47% WER (Pure) and 5.81% WER (Extra). Post-challenge experiments reveal that fine-tuning Whisper Large V3 Turbo with the "Extra" scheme yielded a 5.5% WER, an 11.3% relative improvement over the "Pure" scheme (6.2% WER). This demonstrates that explicit, realistic filled-pause labeling significantly enhances ASR accuracy for verbatim L2 speech transcription.</description>

      <title>GOAT-SLM: A Spoken Language Model with Paralinguistic and Speaker Characteristic Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have significantly improved the ability of AI systems to engage in natural spoken interactions. However, most existing models treat speech merely as a vehicle for linguistic content, often overlooking the rich paralinguistic and speaker characteristic cues embedded in human speech, such as dialect, age, emotion, and non-speech vocalizations. In this work, we introduce GOAT-SLM, a novel spoken language model with paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness, designed to extend spoken language modeling beyond text semantics. GOAT-SLM adopts a dual-modality head architecture that decouples linguistic modeling from acoustic realization, enabling robust language understanding while supporting expressive and adaptive speech generation. To enhance model efficiency and versatility, we propose a modular, staged training strategy that progressively aligns linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic information using large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on TELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM achieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks, and outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal variation, and age-sensitive interactions. This work highlights the importance of modeling beyond linguistic content and advances the development of more natural, adaptive, and socially aware spoken language systems.</description>
