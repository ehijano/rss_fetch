      <title>Resupplying planetary debris to old white dwarfs with supernova blast waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One challenge with explaining how high levels of planetary debris can enrich, or "pollute", old ($\sim$3 Gyr) and very old ($\sim$10 Gyr) white dwarfs is that debris reservoirs deplete on shorter timescales, akin to the solar system's already eviscerated Main Belt and Kuiper Belt. Here, I explore how these extrasolar reservoirs can be resupplied through supernovae that propel distant ($\gtrsim 10^4$ au) dust, sand and pebbles, and potentially boulders and comets, into the inner ($\lesssim 10^2$ au) planetary system. I analytically constrain the geometry of these blast waves, and derive expressions for the probability of apt blast configurations occurring. I then derive the minimum kick magnitudes needed to generate stable, leaky and broken post-blast orbits, and prove that within this formalism, at most 23 per cent of true anomalies along an eccentric orbit could allow for resupplied planetary debris to experience repeated pericentre passages. By linking these kick magnitudes with debris sizes and relating these quantities to the local neighbourhood supernova rate, I conclude that the probabilities for ejection or resupply per supernova blast are $\approx$100 per cent for micron-sized dust and millimetre-sized pebbles and sand, and $\approx$0 per cent for asteroids larger than $\sim$10 km. In between these extremes, I expect metre-sized boulders to be resupplied at least once to very old white dwarfs over their cooling ages. The efficacy of this debris delivery mechanism is dependent on the time-varying sources and sinks in an exo-Oort cloud and how its parent white dwarf has, throughout its cooling age, traversed the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Approach to Quantifying Uncertainty in Meteoroid Physical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meteoroid bulk density is a critical value required for assessing impact risks to spacecraft, informing shielding and mission design. Direct bulk density measurements for sub-millimeter to millimeter-sized meteoroids are difficult, often relying on forward modeling without robust uncertainty estimates. Methods based solely on select observables can overlook noise-induced biases and non-linear relations between physical parameters. This study aims to automate the inversion of meteoroid physical parameters from optical meteor data, focusing on bulk density and its associated uncertainties. We compare an observables-based selection method (PCA) with an RMSD-based approach used to select among millions of ablation model runs using full light and deceleration curves as constraints. After validating both approaches on six synthetic test cases, we apply them to two Perseid meteors recorded by high sensitivity Electron-Multiplied CCD (EMCCD) cameras and high precision mirror-tracked meteors detected by the Canadian Automated Meteor Observatory (CAMO). Our results show that relying only on observables, as in the PCA approach can converge to wrong solutions and can yield unphysical solutions. In contrast, the RMSD-based method offers more reliable density constraints, particularly for bright and strongly decelerating meteor. Small relative measurement precision in brightness and lag relative to the full range of observed lag and luminosity is the key to tight solution. We provide the first objectively derived uncertainty bounds for the physical properties of meteoroids. Our approach solves the solution degeneracy problem inherent in forward modelling of meteors. This strategy can be generalized to other showers, paving the way for improved meteoroid models and enhanced spacecraft safety.</description>

      <title>Astrometric Accelerations of Provisional Targets for the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will be the first space telescope capable of directly imaging Earth-like planets in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars to probe their atmospheres for signs of life. Now in its early stages of design, a list of the 164 most promising targets for HWO has been released to the community to carry out precursor science. Massive companions in these systems--stars, brown dwarfs, or giant planets--could preclude the existence of Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone by impacting their long-term dynamical stability. Here, we use astrometry from Hipparcos and Gaia EDR3 to identify stars in the HWO preliminary target list that exhibit astrometric accelerations and determine joint constraints on the expected mass and separation of these companions. We find that 54 HWO targets have significant astrometric accelerations, 37 of which are accounted for by known giant planets and stellar companions. Follow-up efforts are required to clarify the specific nature of the suspected companions around the remaining 17 accelerating stars. Stars without significant accelerations are used to rule out large regions of companion mass and separation down to planetary masses. We find that with Hipparcos and Gaia EDR3 we are $\sim$85$\%$ sensitive to 2 $M_\mathrm{Jup}$ planets between 4 and 10 AU. Future Gaia releases will provide sensitivity to sub-Jovian mass planets on Solar System scales for provisional HWO targets. Finally, using analytical estimates of dynamical stability, we find that 13 HWO targets have known stellar or planetary companions that are likely to disrupt habitable-zone planets.</description>

      <title>Detecting Land with Reflected Light Spectroscopy to Rule Out Waterworld O2 Biosignature False Positives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for life outside our solar system is at the forefront of modern astronomy, and telescopes such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) are being designed to identify biosignatures. Molecular oxygen, O2, is considered a promising indication of life, yet substantial abiotic O2 may accumulate from H2O photolysis and hydrogen escape on a lifeless, fully (100%) ocean-covered terrestrial planet when surface O2 sinks are suppressed. This so-called waterworld false positive scenario could be ruled out with land detection because exposed land precludes extremely deep oceans (~50 Earth oceans) given topographic limits set by the crushing strength of rocks. Land detection is possible because plausible geologic surfaces exhibit increasing reflectance with wavelength in the visible, whereas liquid water and ice/snow have flat or decreasing reflectance, respectively. Here, we present reflected light retrievals to demonstrate that HWO could detect land on an exo-Earth in the disk-averaged spectrum. Given a signal-to-noise ratio of 20 spectrum, Earth-like land fractions can be confidently detected with 0.3-1.1 um spectral coverage (resolution R~140 in the visible, R~7 in the UV, with Earth-like atmosphere and clouds). We emphasize the need for UV spectroscopy down to at least 0.3 um to break an O3-land degeneracy. We find that the SNR and resolution requirements in the visible/UV imply that a larger aperture (~8 m) will be necessary to ensure the observing times required for land detection are feasible for most HWO terrestrial habitable zone targets. These results strongly inform the HWO minimum requirements to corroborate possible oxygen biosignatures.</description>

      <title>A high stellar multiplicity rate amongst TESS planet candidates in the Neptunian desert using Gaia DR3 astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to discover whether the stellar multiplicity rate may provide information on the origin of recently discovered planets in the Neptunian Desert. Using Gaia DR3 astrometry, we search for common proper motion companions to 1779 known exoplanet hosts and 2927 exoplanet candidate hosts from the TESS mission, both within 650 pc. We find overall stellar multiplicity rates of $16.6\pm0.9\%$ and $19.8\pm0.6\%$ for confirmed and candidate exoplanets, respectively. We find stellar multiplicity rates of $16.7\pm5.8\%$ and $27.5\pm2.6\%$ for confirmed and candidate exoplanets in the Neptunian Desert, respectively. Hot Jupiter host stars were found to have rates of $25.8\pm2.1\%$ and $22.9\pm1.3\%$. For the sample of candidate exoplanets, we find higher stellar multiplicity rates for stars hosting both Hot Jupiters and Neptunian Desert planets compared to control samples of similar stars not known to host planets. For the sample of confirmed exoplanets an increased multiplicity rate is seen for Hot Jupiter hosts, but cannot be significantly determined for Neptunian Desert planet hosts due to small sample sizes. If the candidates from TESS are indeed planets, the increased multiplicity rate observed could indicate that the Neptunian Desert and Hot Jupiter populations share similar formation mechanisms and environmental conditions. Alternatively, the TESS candidate high multiplicity rate could imply a prevalence of false positives related to binary and triple stars in this parameter space.</description>

      <title>Advanced System Engineering Approaches to Emerging Challenges in Planetary and Deep-Space Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents innovative solutions to critical challenges in planetary and deep-space exploration electronics. We synthesize findings across diverse mission profiles, highlighting advances in: (1) MARTIAN positioning systems with dual-frequency transmission to achieve $\pm$1m horizontal accuracy; (2) artificial reef platforms for Titan's hydrocarbon seas utilizing specialized sensor arrays and multi-stage communication chains; (3) precision orbital rendezvous techniques demonstrating novel thermal protection solutions; (4) miniaturized CubeSat architectures for asteroid exploration with optimized power-to-mass ratios; and (5) next-generation power management systems for MARS rovers addressing dust accumulation challenges. These innovations represent promising directions for future space exploration technologies, particularly in environments where traditional Earth-based electronic solutions prove inadequate. The interdisciplinary nature of these developments highlights the critical intersection of aerospace engineering, electrical engineering, and planetary science in advancing human exploration capabilities beyond Earth orbit.</description>

      <title>Apache Point Observatory follow-up of ACcelerating Candidate ExopLanet host Stars (APO ACCELS): Ages for 166 Accelerating Stars in the Northern Hemisphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directly imaged substellar companions with well-constrained ages and masses serve as vital empirical benchmarks for planet formation and evolution models. Potential benchmark companions can be identified from astrometric accelerations of their host stars. We use Gaia DR3 and Hipparcos astrometry to identify 166 northern hemisphere stars with astrometric accelerations consistent with a substellar companion between 0.5'' and 1''. For this accelerating sample we identify young stars using APO/ARCES spectra and TESS light curves. From spectroscopic screening of the sample, we measure ages for 24 stars with detectable amounts of lithium, place lower age limits on 135 stars with lithium non-detections, and measure ages from R'HK for 34 stars. 129 stars have TESS light curves from which we measure ages for 20 stars with rotation rates &lt; 15 days, and we identify 3 eclipsing binaries. We present median ages and confidence intervals of age posteriors for the entire sample and discuss how the overall age distribution of our sample compares to a uniform star formation rate in the solar neighborhood. We identify 47 stars with median ages &lt; 2 Gyr, 31 stars with median ages &lt; 1 Gyr, and 14 stars with median ages &lt; 0.5 Gyr, making them high-priority targets for direct imaging follow-up.</description>

      <title>Energetic ($&lt; 2$ MeV) Ion Environment of the Magnetosphere as measured by ASPEX-STEPS on board Aditya-L1 during its earth-bound phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During its earth-bound phase of the Aditya-L1 spacecraft of India, the Supra-Thermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer (STEPS) of the Aditya Solar wind Particle EXperiment (ASPEX) was operated whenever the orbit was above 52000 km during 11-19 September 2023. This phase of operation provided measurements of energetic ions (with energies 0.1-2 MeV) in the magnetosphere, magnetosheath, and interplanetary medium. Three interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICME) hit the magnetosphere during this period. This provided opportunity to examine the relative roles of external (ICME) and internal (substorm) drivers in controlling the energetic ion environment in the terrestrial magnetosphere by detailed spectral analysis of energetic ion fluxes measured by two units of ASPEX-STEPS. We identify three distinctly different conditions of the north-south component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF $B_z = 0$, $&gt; 0$, and $&lt; 0$) and use the derived spectral indices to understand the role of external and internal drivers. By combining these with the simultaneous eneregtic ion flux variations from the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) around the Sun-Earth first Lagrangian (L1) point and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) in the Earth's magnetosphere, we show that the polarity of IMF $B_z$ influences the energetic ion spectra in the magnetosphere by modulating the interplay of the external and internal drivers. Further, we observe directional anisotropy of energetic ions and much harder spectra associated with one ICME compared to another one, although both led to geomagnetic storms having nearly equal intensities.</description>

      <title>On the Efficacy of Ocean Formation with a Primordial Hydrogen Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been suggested that Earth's present water budget formed from oxidation reactions between its initial hydrogen-rich primordial atmosphere and its magma ocean. Here we examine this hypothesis by building a comprehensive atmosphere-magma ocean model. We find that water formation is unlikely for two reasons. First, any water formed from oxidation reactions in the magma ocean would quickly outgass because of the water-poor atmosphere above. Second, the top boundary layer of the magma ocean becomes stable against convection because the oxidation reactions produce metallic iron, which sinks to the core of a growing Earth. This iron loss makes the top boundary layer significantly more buoyant than the rest of the magma, thus becoming stable against mixing. Our results suggest that hydrogen dissolution is unlikely to play a major role in the formation of Earth's oceans.</description>

      <title>The Orbit of WASP-4 b is in Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: WASP-4 b is a hot Jupiter exhibiting a decreasing orbital period, prompting investigations into potential mechanisms driving its evolution. We analyzed 173 transit light curves, including 37 new observations, and derived mid-transit timings with EXOFAST, forming the most extensive TTV dataset for this system. Adding 58 literature timings and removing unreliable data, we constructed a TTV diagram with 216 points. Our analysis considered linear, quadratic, and apsidal motion models, with the quadratic model proving to be significantly superior in all model comparison statistics. We found no significant periodic signals in the data. The quadratic model allows us to infer a tidal quality factor of Q' ~ 80,000 from the orbital decay rate if this is due to stellar tides. Theoretical considerations indicate that such efficient dissipation is possible due to internal gravity waves in the radiative core of WASP-4, but only in our models with a more evolved host star, possibly near the end of its main-sequence lifetime, and with a larger radius than the observed one. Our main-sequence models produce only about a third of the required dissipation (Q' ~ 200,000 - 500,000). Therefore, the observed orbital decay can only be explained by a slightly larger or more evolved host, resembling the case for WASP-12. Our findings highlight the need for further stellar modeling and improvement in our current understanding of tidal dissipation mechanisms driving orbital decay in close-in exoplanetary systems.</description>
