      <title>Conventional superconductivity in single-crystalline BiPt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary Bi-Pd/Pt systems have attracted a lot of interest because of their topologically non-trivial nature along with superconductivity. We report the structural and superconducting properties of high-quality single-crystalline BiPt using a comprehensive range of experimental techniques, including X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, muon spin rotation/relaxation ({\mu}SR), magnetization, resistivity, and heat capacity. Our findings establish that BiPt is a weak type-II superconductor with a transition temperature (Tc) of 1.2 K which exhibits pronounced anisotropic superconducting characteristics attributed to its hexagonal crystal structure. Magnetization and electronic transport studies reveal that BiPt lies within the dirty limit, while {\mu}SR and heat capacity data indicate conventional s-wave superconductivity that maintains time-reversal symmetry. This work provides valuable insights into the pairing symmetry and superconducting mechanism of topologically trivial BiPt, a sound comparison system for other Bi-based topologically nontrivial superconductors.</description>

      <title>Preserving the Josephson Coupling of Twisted Cuprate Junctions via Tailored Silicon Nitride Circuits Boards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlled fabrication of twisted van der Waals heterostructures is essential to unlock the full potential of moire materials. However, achieving reproducibility remains a major challenge, particularly for air-sensitive materials such as $Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\delta}$ (BSCCO), where it is crucial to preserve the intrinsic and delicate superconducting properties of the interface throughout the entire fabrication process. Here, we present a dry, inert and cryogenic assembly method that combines silicon nitride nanomembranes (NMBs) with pre-patterned electrodes and the cryogenic stacking technique (CST) to fabricate high-quality twisted BSCCO Josephson junctions (JJs). This protocol prevents thermal and chemical degradation during both interface formation and electrical contact integration. We also find that asymmetric membrane designs, such as a double cantilever, effectively suppress vibration-induced disorder due to wire bonding, resulting in sharp and hysteretic current-voltage characteristics. The junctions exhibit a twist-angle-dependent Josephson coupling with magnitudes comparable to the highest-performing devices reported to date, but achieved through a straightforward and versatile contact method, offering a scalable and adaptable platform for future applications. These findings highlight the importance of both interface and contact engineering in addressing reproducibility in superconducting van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition with enhanced phase stiffness in $d$-wave strongly coupled two-dimensional superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reveal the key role of the $d$-wave symmetry of the superconducting gap in strongly coupled two-dimensional superconductors in determining the properties of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, associated with a sizable enhancement of the phase stiffness compared to nodeless-gap superconductors. The enhanced stiffness originates from extended regions of vanishing gap around the nodal lines of the Brillouin zone (BZ). Our study, based on mean-field and BKT theory, presents a comparative analysis of $s$-wave and $d$-wave scenarios, highlighting the features of the latter that boost the stiffness and the BKT transition temperature (T$_{BKT}$). The comparison focuses on two quantities: the mean-field critical temperature and the maximum superconducting gap related to the pairing strengths. We present a phase diagram showing the scaling of T$_{BKT}$ with respect to the mean-field critical temperature across the BCS-BEC crossover and the evolution of the pseudogap. We also present a zero-temperature phase-stiffness intensity map over the Brillouin zone, displaying a two-component structure consisting of low- and high-stiffness regions whose extent depends on microscopic parameters. These results identify the nodal gap structure of strongly coupled two-dimensional superconductors as a key mechanism enabling enhanced stiffness and elevated T$_{BKT}$ compared to their $s$-wave counterparts.</description>

      <title>Effect of a magnetic field up to 9 T on the temperature dependence of the pseudogap in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work analyzes the effect of a magnetic field $B$ directed along the $c$ axis ($B \parallel c$) up to 9~T on the resistivity $\rho(T)$, fluctuation conductivity (FLC) $\sigma'(T)$ and pseudogap $\Delta^*(T)$ in thin films of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ with a critical temperature of the superconducting transition $T_c = 88.8$~K. In contrast to previous work, where the magnetic field was directed along the $ab$ plane ($B \parallel ab$), the influence of the field on the sample is stronger due to the contribution of both spin--orbit and Zeeman effects. It was found that the BEC--BCS transition temperature, $T_{\mathrm{pair}}$, which corresponds to the maximum of the $\Delta^*(T)$ dependence, shifts to the region of lower temperatures with increasing $B$, and the maximum value of $\Delta^*(T_{\mathrm{pair}})$ decreases in fields $B &gt; 5$~T. It was found that with increasing field, the low-temperature maximum near $T_0$ is smeared and disappears at $B &gt; 1$~T. In addition, above the Ginzburg temperature $T_G$, for $B &gt; 1$~T, a minimum appears on $\Delta^*(T)$ at $T_{\min}$, which becomes very pronounced with a subsequent increase in $B$. As a result, the overall value of $\Delta^*(T_G)$ decreases noticeably, most likely due to the pair-breaking effect. At the same time, $\Delta T_{\mathrm{fl}}$ and $\xi_c(0)$ increase sharply by approximately 3 times with increasing $B$ above 1~T. Our results confirm the possibility of the formation of a vortex state in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ by a magnetic field and its evolution with increasing $B$.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Twist Angles in Cuprate Heterostructures with Anisotropic Raman Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificially engineered twisted van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have unlocked new pathways for exploring emergent quantum phenomena and strongly correlated electronic states. Many of these phenomena are highly sensitive to the twist angle, which can be deliberately tuned to tailor the interlayer interactions. This makes the twist angle a critical tunable parameter, emphasizing the need for precise control and accurate characterization during device fabrication. In particular, twisted cuprate heterostructures based on Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x have demonstrated angle-dependent superconducting properties, positioning the twist angle as a key tunable parameter. However, the twisted interface is highly unstable under ambient conditions and vulnerable to damage from conventional characterization tools such as electron microscopy or scanning probe techniques. In this work, we introduce a fully non-invasive, polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy approach for determining twist angles in artificially stacked BSCCO heterostructures. By analyzing twist-dependent anisotropic vibrational Raman modes, particularly utilizing the out-of-plane A1g vibrational mode of Bi/Sr at 116 cm-1, we identify clear optical fingerprints of the rotational misalignment between cuprate layers. Our high-resolution confocal Raman setup, equipped with polarization control and RayShield filtering down to 10 cm-1, allows for reliable and reproducible measurements without compromising the material's structural integrity.</description>

      <title>A low-energy effective Hamiltonian for Landau quasiparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new renormalisation scheme to construct the Landau quasiparticles of Fermi fluids. The scheme relies on an energy cutoff $\Lambda$ which removes the quasi-resonant couplings, enabling the dressing of the particles into quasiparticles via a unitary transformation. The dynamics of the quasiparticles is then restricted to low-energy transitions and is fully determined by an effective Hamiltonian which unifies the Landau interaction function $f$ and the collision amplitude in a single amplitude $\mathcal{A}$ regularized by $\Lambda$. Our effective theory captures all the low-energy physics of Fermi fluids that support Landau quasiparticles, from the equation of state to the transport properties, both in the normal and in the superfluid phase. We apply it to an atomic Fermi gas with contact interaction to compute the speed of zero sound in function of the scattering length $a$. We also recover the Gork'ov-Melik Barkhudarov correction to the superfluid gap and critical temperature as a direct consequence of the dressing of particles into Landau quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Improvement of the Simmons model for tunnel junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Simmons model is a well-known and widely used model for the elastic tunneling current of a metallic tunnel junction, and fitting it to electrical measurements can be used to estimate thicknesses and heights of the tunnel barriers. We present here an improvement of the Simmons model, deriving new more accurate analytical formulas for the tunneling current density and conductance at finite voltage and temperature. We demonstrate that our conductance-voltage formulas are much closer to the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation than the Simmons model and its commonly used simplified parabolic approximation. In addition, we demonstrate the practical use of our model, by fitting it to experimental tunnel junction conductance-voltage data and showing a sizeable difference from the Simmons model.</description>

      <title>Pervasive spin-triplet superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields typically suppress superconductivity once the Zeeman energy exceeds the pairing gap, unless mechanisms such as unconventional pairing, strong spin-orbit coupling, or intrinsic magnetism intervene. Several graphene platforms realize such mitigating routes, exhibiting superconductivity resilient to magnetic fields. Here we report superconductivity in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene that is both induced and stabilized by in-plane magnetic field ($B_{\parallel}$), with critical fields far beyond the Pauli paramagnetic limit. The superconductivity spans a wide gate range and emerges from a sharp zero-field resistive ridge that tracks approximately constant conduction band filling. The presence of zero-field superconductivity and the evolution of the critical temperature with $B_{\parallel}$ are highly gate sensitive. We also observe a weak superconducting diode effect in several distinct regimes within the superconducting phase, including nearby to an integer quantum anomalous Hall state generated by a boron nitride moir\'e superlattice, indicating a potential coexistence of valley imbalance and superconductivity. These results establish several intriguing new properties of spin-triplet, field-induced superconductivity in a thick rhombohedral graphene stack.</description>

      <title>Observation of Quantum-Criticality-Class Crossover at the LaAlO$_3$/KTaO$_3$ (111) Interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two-dimensional (2D) limit, the quantum fluctuation is significantly enhanced which could induce a quantum phase transition. Investigating the quantum criticality is an effective approach to elucidate the underlying physics of 2D superconductivity. Here we report the observation of different universality classes of quantum criticality at the superconducting LaAlO$_3$/KTaO$_3$ (111) interface, i.e. the normal quantum Griffiths singularity (QGS) and the anomalous QGS. The switch of the quantum criticality class is observed from the normal QGS in a low $T_c$ sample with weaker spin-orbit coupling (SOC) to the anomalous QGS in a high $T_c$ sample with stronger SOC. Moreover, owing to the remarkable SOC strength, the high $T_c$ sample exhibits an unprecedentedly enhanced quantum fluctuation at an unusually elevated temperature approaching the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition temperature $T_{BKT}$. This work provides comprehensive recognition of the different quantum criticality classes in the same superconducting LaAlO$_3$/KTaO$_3$ (111) system, which deepens the understanding of the superconducting mechanism of interfacial superconductors.</description>

      <title>Theory of intervalley-coherent AFM order and topological superconductivity in tWSe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent observation of superconductivity in the vicinity of Fermi surface reconstructed insulating or metallic states has established twisted bilayers of WSe\textsubscript{2} as an exciting platform to study the interplay of strong electron-electron interactions, broken symmetries and topology. In this work, we use a first-principles, material-specific theoretical treatment that is unbiased with respect to electronic instabilities to study the emergence of electronic ordering in twisted WSe\textsubscript{2} driven by gate-screened Coulomb interactions. We construct exponentially localized moir\'e Wannier orbitals that faithfully capture the bandstructure and topology of the system, project the gate-screened Coulomb interaction onto them and use unbiased functional renormalization group techniques to resolve the momentum and orbital structure of the leading instabilities and the relevant energy scales. We find an interplay between intervalley-coherent antiferromagnetic (IVC-AFM) order and chiral, mixed-parity $d/p$-wave superconductivity for carrier concentrations near a displacement field and twist-angle-tunable van-Hove singularity. Our microscopic approach establishes incommensurate IVC-AFM spin fluctuations as the dominant electronic mechanism driving the formation of superconductivity in $\theta = 5.08^{\circ}$ twisted WSe\textsubscript{2} and explains key aspects of recent experiments including the asymmetric density dependence of the spin ordering with respect to the van-Hove line, the single and double-peak structure of the DOS in the ordered (hole-doped) IVC-AFM phase, the emergence of superconductivity as the density is varied across the van-Hove line and the evolution of the displacement field-density phase diagram with twist angles between $3.7^{\circ} \dots 5^{\circ}$.</description>

      <title>Upper bound on $T_c$ in a strongly coupled electron-boson superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02894v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Migdal-Eliashberg theory of boson-mediated superconductivity contains a $\sqrt{\lambda}$ divergence in the critical temperature $T_c$ for strong electron-boson coupling $\lambda$. In the conventional Migdal-Eliashberg theory, the strong-coupling regime can be accessed only in the limit that $\lambda_E = \lambda \, \omega_D/\varepsilon_F\ll1$, where $\omega_D$ is the Debye frequency and $\varepsilon_F$ is the Fermi energy. Here we go beyond this restriction in the context of the two-dimensional Yukawa-SYK (Y-SYK) model, which is solvable for arbitrary values of $\lambda_E$. We find that $T_c\approx 0.18 \,\omega_D \sqrt{\lambda}$ for large $\lambda$, provided $\lambda_E$ remains small, and crosses over to a universal value of $T_c \approx 0.04\, \varepsilon_F$ for large $\lambda_E$. The saturation of $T_c$ is due to a self-consistent account of the boson dynamics for large $\lambda_E$ and remains valid provided the vertex corrections are negligible. Depending on the value of $\lambda$, this self-consistent approach leads to pairing that describes multiple classes of quantum critical electronic systems. These results demonstrate how the $\sqrt{\lambda}$ growth of $T_c$ in Migdal-Eliashberg theory saturates to a universal value independent of $\lambda$ and $\omega_D$, providing an upper bound on the critical temperature at strong electron-boson coupling.</description>

      <title>Scalable Effective Models for Superconducting Nanostructures: Applications to Double, Triple, and Quadruple Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a versatile and scalable framework for constructing effective models of superconducting (SC) nanostructures described by the generalized SC Anderson impurity model with multiple quantum dots and leads. Our Chain Expansion (ChE) method maps each SC lead onto a finite tight-binding chain with parameters obtained from \emph{Pad\'e} approximants of the tunneling self-energy. We provide an explicit algorithm for the general case as well as simple analytical expressions for the chain parameters in the wide-band and infinite-chain limits. This mapping preserves low-energy physics while enabling efficient simulations: short chains are tractable using exact diagonalization, and longer ones are handled with density matrix renormalization group methods. The approach remains reliable and computationally efficient across diverse geometries, both in and out of equilibrium. We use ChE to map the ground-state phase diagrams of double, triple, and quadruple quantum dots coupled to a single SC lead. While half-filled symmetric systems show similar overall diagrams, the particular phases differ substantially with the dot number. Here, large parameter regions are entirely missed by the widely used zero-bandwidth approximation but are captured by ChE. Away from half-filling, additional dots markedly increase diagram complexity, producing a rich variety of stable phases. These results demonstrate ChE as a fast, accurate, and systematically improvable tool for exploring complex SC nanostructures.</description>
