      <title>Is the low-energy tail of shock-accelerated protons responsible for over-ionized plasma in supernova remnants?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over-ionized, recombining plasma is an emerging class of X-ray bright supernova remnants (SNRs). This unique thermal state where the ionization temperature ($T_{\rm z}$) is significantly higher than the electron temperature ($T_{\rm e}$) is not expected from the standard evolution model assuming a point explosion in a uniform interstellar medium, requiring a new scenario for the dynamical and thermal evolution. A recently proposed idea attributes the over-ionization state to additional ionization contribution from the low-energy tail of shock-accelerated protons. However, this new scenario has been left untested, especially from the atomic physics point of view. We report calculation results of the proton impact ionization rates of heavy-element ions in ejecta of SNRs. We conservatively estimate the requirement for accelerated protons, and find that their relative number density to thermal electrons needs to be higher than $5~(T_{\rm e}/{\rm 1~keV})\%$ in order to explain the observed over-ionization degree at $T_{\rm z}/T_{\rm e} \ge 2$ for K-shell emission. We conclude that the proton ionization scenario is not feasible because such a high abundance of accelerated protons is prohibited by the injection fraction from thermal to non-thermal energies, which is expected to be $\sim 1\%$ at largest.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15 yr Data Set: Chromatic Gaussian Process Noise Models for Six Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are designed to detect low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs). GWs induce achromatic signals in PTA data, meaning that the timing delays do not depend on radio-frequency. However, pulse arrival times are also affected by radio-frequency dependent "chromatic" noise from sources such as dispersion measure (DM) and scattering delay variations. Furthermore, the characterization of GW signals may be influenced by the choice of chromatic noise model for each pulsar. To better understand this effect, we assess if and how different chromatic noise models affect achromatic noise properties in each pulsar. The models we compare include existing DM models used by NANOGrav and noise models used for the European PTA Data Release 2 (EPTA DR2). We perform this comparison using a subsample of six pulsars from the NANOGrav 15 yr data set, selecting the same six pulsars as from the EPTA DR2 six-pulsar dataset. We find that the choice of chromatic noise model noticeably affects the achromatic noise properties of several pulsars. This is most dramatic for PSR J1713+0747, where the amplitude of its achromatic red noise lowers from $\log_{10}A_{\text{RN}} = -14.1^{+0.1}_{-0.1}$ to $-14.7^{+0.3}_{-0.5}$, and the spectral index broadens from $\gamma_{\text{RN}} = 2.6^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ to $\gamma_{\text{RN}} = 3.5^{+1.2}_{-0.9}$. We also compare each pulsar's noise properties with those inferred from the EPTA DR2, using the same models. From the discrepancies, we identify potential areas where the noise models could be improved. These results highlight the potential for custom chromatic noise models to improve PTA sensitivity to GWs.</description>

      <title>Residual eccentricity as a systematic uncertainty on the formation channels of binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resolving the formation channel(s) of merging binary black holes is a key goal in gravitational-wave astronomy. The orbital eccentricity is believed to be a precious tracer of the underlying formation pathway, but is largely dissipated during the usually long inspiral between black-hole formation and merger. Most gravitational-wave sources are thus expected to enter the sensitivity windows of current detectors on configurations that are compatible with quasi-circular orbits. In this paper, we investigate the impact of "negligible" residual eccentricity -- lower than currently detectable by LIGO/Virgo -- on our ability to infer the formation history of binary black holes, focusing in particular on their spin orientations. We trace the evolution of both observed and synthetic gravitational-wave events backward in time, while resampling their residual eccentricities to values that are below the detectability threshold. Eccentricities in-band as low as $\sim 10^{-4}$ can lead to significant biases when reconstructing the spin directions, especially in the case of loud, highly precessing systems. Residual eccentricity thus act like a systematic uncertainty for our astrophysical inference. As a mitigation strategy, one can marginalize the posterior distribution over the residual eccentricity using astrophysical predictions.</description>

      <title>First detection of X-ray pulsations and spectrum of the high Galactic latitude pulsar PSR J0837-2454 and direct Urca cooling implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PSR J0837-2454 is a young 629 ms radio pulsar whose uncertain distance has important implications. A large distance would place the pulsar far out of the Galactic plane and suggest it is the result of a runaway star, while a short distance would mean the pulsar is extraordinarily cold. Here we present further radio observations and the first deep X-ray observation of PSR J0837-2454. Data from the Parkes Murriyang telescope show flux variations over short and long timescales and also yield an updated timing model, while the position and proper motion (and, less strongly, parallax) of the pulsar are constrained by a number of low-significance detections with the Very Long Baseline Array. XMM-Newton data enable detection of X-ray pulsations for the first time from this pulsar and yield a spectrum that is thermal and blackbody-like, with a cool blackbody temperature ~70 eV or atmosphere temperature ~50 eV, as well as a small hotspot. The spectrum also indicates the pulsar is at a small distance of &lt;~1 kpc, which is compatible with the marginal VLBA parallax constraint that favours a distance of &gt;~330 pc. The low implied X-ray luminosity (~3x10^31 erg s^-1 at 0.9 kpc) suggests PSR J0837-2454 has a mass high enough that fast neutrino emission from direct Urca reactions operates in this young star and points to a nuclear equation of state that allows for direct Urca reactions at the highest densities present in neutron star cores.</description>

      <title>1991T-like Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of the luminous 1991T-like supernovae is of great importance to supernova cosmology as they are likely to have been more common in the early universe. In this paper we explore the observational properties of 1991T-like supernovae to study their relationship to other luminous, slow-declining Type~Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). From the spectroscopic and photometric criteria defined in Phillips et al. (1992), we identify 17 1991T-like supernovae from the literature. Combining these objects with ten 1991T-like supernovae from the Carnegie Supernova Project-II, the spectra, light curves, and colors of these events, along with their host galaxy properties, are examined in detail. We conclude that 1991T-like supernovae are closely related in essentially all of their UV, optical, and near-infrared properties -- as well as their host galaxy parameters -- to the slow-declining subset of Branch core-normal supernovae and to the intermediate 1999aa-like events, forming a continuum of luminous SNe Ia. The overriding difference between these three subgroups appears to be the extent to which $^{56}$Ni mixes into the ejecta, producing the pre-maximum spectra dominated by Fe III absorption, the broader UV light curves, and the higher luminosities that characterize the 1991T-like events. Nevertheless, the association of 1991T-like SNe with the rare Type Ia CSM supernovae would seem to run counter to this hypothesis, in which case 1991T-like events may form a separate subclass of SNe Ia, possibly arising from single-degenerate progenitor systems.</description>

      <title>Particle acceleration and magnetic field amplification by relativistic shocks in inhomogeneous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle acceleration and magnetic field amplification in relativistic shocks propagating in inhomogeneous media are investigated by three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations and test-particle simulations. The MHD simulations show that the interaction between the relativistic shock and dense clumps amplifies the downstream magnetic field to the value expected from observations of the gamma-ray burst. The test-particle simulations in the electromagnetic field given by the MHD simulation show that particles are accelerated by the downstream turbulence and the relativistic shock. We provide the injection energy to the shock acceleration in this system. If the amplitude of upstream density fluctuations is sufficiently large, low-energy particles are initially accelerated to the injection energy by the downstream turbulence and then rapidly accelerated to higher energies by the relativistic shock. Therefore, the density fluctuation significantly affects particle acceleration in the relativistic shock.</description>

      <title>Spectral fittings of warm coronal radiation with high seed photon temperature: apparent low-temperature and flat soft excess in AGNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A warm corona has been widely proposed to explain the soft X-ray excess (SE) above the 2--10 keV power law extrapolation in AGNs. In actual spectral fittings, the warm coronal seed photon temperature ($T_{\rm s}$) is usually assumed to be far away from the soft X-ray, but $kT_{\rm s}$ can reach close to 0.1 keV in standard accretion disc model. In this study, we used Monte Carlo simulations to obtain radiation spectra from a slab-like warm corona and fitted the spectra using the spherical-geometry-based routine \textsc{thcomp} or a thermal component. Our findings reveal that high $T_{\rm s}$ can influence the fitting results. A moderately high $kT_{\rm s}$ (around 0.03 keV) can result in an apparent low-temperature and flat SE, while an extremely high $kT_{\rm s}$ (around 0.07 keV) can even produce an unobserved blackbody-like SE. Our conclusions indicate that, for spectral fittings of the warm coronal radiation (SE in AGNs), $kT_{\rm s}$ should be treated as a free parameter with an upper limit, and an accurate coronal geometry is necessary when $kT_{\rm s}&gt;0.01$ keV.</description>

      <title>A study of gamma-ray emission from OJ 287 using Fermi-LAT from 2015-2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for gamma-ray emission from OJ287 in the energy range from 0.1-300 GeV during 2015-2023, in coincidence with an extensive observing campaign to monitor the optical flux variability and polarization, as discussed in arXiv:2311.02372. We present results for eight segments in the aforementioned period, with each segment corresponding to an observing season. We find non-zero gamma-ray emission for all the eight segments. The photon and energy flux observed during this period is $\sim 5.2 \times 10^{-8} \rm{ph~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$ and $2.75 \times 10^{-5} \rm{MeV~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$, respectively, while the SED can be fitted with a power law with a slope of $2.12 \pm 0.02$. The observed luminosity is between $10^{45}-10^{46}$ ergs/sec.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray line emission from the Local Bubble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep-sea archives that include intermediate-lived radioactive $^{60}\mathrm{Fe}$ particles suggest the occurrence of several recent supernovae inside the present-day volume of the Local Bubble during the last $\sim 10$ Myr. The isotope $^{60}\mathrm{Fe}$ is mainly produced in massive stars and ejected in supernova explosions, which should always result in a sizeable yield of $^{26}\mathrm{Al}$ from the same objects. $^{60}\mathrm{Fe}$ and $^{26}\mathrm{Al}$ decay with lifetimes of 3.82 and 1.05 Myr, and emit $\gamma$-rays at 1332 and 1809 keV, respectively. These $\gamma$-rays have been measured as diffuse glow of the Milky Way, and would also be expected from inside the Local Bubble as foreground emission. Based on two scenarios, one employing a geometrical model and the other state-of-the-art hydrodynamics simulations, we estimate the expected fluxes of the 1332 and 1809 keV $\gamma$-ray lines, as well as the resulting 511 keV line from positron annihilation due to the $^{26}\mathrm{Al}$ $\beta^+$-decay. We find fluxes in the range of $10^{-6}$-$10^{-5}\,\mathrm{ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$ for all three lines with isotropic contributions of 10-50%. We show that these fluxes are within reach for the upcoming COSI-SMEX $\gamma$-ray telescope over its nominal satellite mission duration of 2 yr. Given the Local Bubble models considered, we conclude that in the case of 10-20 Myr-old superbubbles, the distributions of $^{60}\mathrm{Fe}$ and $^{26}\mathrm{Al}$ are not co-spatial - an assumption usually made in $\gamma$-ray data analyses. In fact, this should be taken into account however when analysing individual nearby targets for their $^{60}\mathrm{Fe}$ to $^{26}\mathrm{Al}$ flux ratio as this gauges the stellar evolution models and the age of the superbubbles. A flux ratio measured for the Local Bubble could further constrain models of $^{60}\mathrm{Fe}$ deposition on Earth and its moon.</description>

      <title>Influence of plasma instabilities on the propagation of electromagnetic cascades from distant blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation of very-high-energy gamma-rays (VHEGRs) in the extragalactic space offers the opportunity to study astrophysical phenomena not reproducible in laboratories. In particular, the deviation from predictions of the observed photon flux from distant sources at the GeV energy scale still represents an open problem. Commonly, this deviation is interpreted as the result of the deflection out of the line of sight of the source of the cascade-produced charged leptons by weak magnetic fields present in the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, plasma instabilities could have an effect on the energy- and momentum-distribution of the secondary electrons and positrons, modifying the development of electromagnetic cascades. In this work, we study the influence of plasma instabilities on the energy spectrum of electromagnetic cascades through a parametric study, performed with the Monte Carlo code CRPropa. We parameterize plasma instabilities with an energy loss length normalisation $\lambda_0$ and a power law index $\alpha$ of its electron/positron energy dependence. We simulate photon spectra at Earth for different blazar scenarios and find that plasma instabilities can reproduce the suppression in the GeV-photon flux of real astrophysical sources, such as 1ES 0229+200, when the energy loss length of electrons/positrons at 1.0 TeV is $\lambda_0 \simeq 100\,\text{kpc}$ and $\alpha\simeq0$. The energy fraction lost by the secondary electron pairs due to the instability is estimated to be about $1\%$ over the typical interaction length of Inverse Compton scattering for these parameter values.</description>

      <title>Searching For Gamma-ray Emission from Stellar Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flares from magnetically active dwarf stars should produce relativistic particles capable of creating gamma-rays. So far, the only isolated main sequence star besides the Sun to have been detected in gamma-rays is TVLM 513-46546. Detecting gamma-ray flares from more dwarf stars can improve our understanding of their magnetospheric properties, and could also indicate a diminished likelihood of their planets' habitability. In this work, we stack data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope during a large number of events identified from optical and X-ray flare surveys. We report an upper limit of gamma-ray emission from the population of flare stars. Stacking results towards control positions are consistent with a non-detection. We compare these results to observed Solar gamma-ray flares and against a model of emission from neutral pion decay. The upper limit is consistent with Solar flares when scaled to the flare energies and distances of the target stars. As with Solar flares, the neutral pion decay mechanism for gamma-ray production is also consistent with these results.</description>

      <title>The spin, inclination, and magnetic field evolution of magnetar population in Vacuum and Plasma-filled Magnetospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetars are potential energy sources or central engines for numerous transient phenomena in the universe. How newborn magnetars evolve in different environments remains an open question. Based on both observed and candidate magnetars, it is found that the periods of all magnetars or candidates appear as a bimodal distribution, and are defined as the ``long-P'' and ``short-P'' magnetar sub-classes, respectively. We find that for the ``short-P'' sub-class of magnetars, the $\dot{P}$ values also appear as a bimodal distribution, and therefore can be classified as ``high-$\dot{P}$ short-P'' and ``low-$\dot{P}$ short-P'' magnetar sub-classes. In this paper, we use Monte Carlo simulations to generate synthetic magnetar populations and investigate the evolution of the ``high-$\dot{P}$ short-P'' and ``low-$\dot{P}$ short-P'' magnetar sub-classes by considering both the magnetar spin and inclination, as well as the decay of their magnetic field within their evolution in both vacuum and plasma-filled magnetospheres. We find that the magnetar evolution is dependent on both spin and magnetic field, but seems to be insensitive to inclination evolution and magnetospheric environment for the ``high-$\dot{P}$ short-P'' sub-class. In comparison for the case of ``high-$\dot{P}$ short-P'', the magnetar evolution is dependent on spin, magnetic field, and inclination evolution, as well as the magnetospheric environment. The best evolution model should be the case of inclination evolution in vacuum with a small value of $\overline{\mathrm{FOM}}$. The differences in the best-fit parameters also suggest that the ``high-$\dot{P}$ short-P'' and ``low-$\dot{P}$ short-P'' magnetar sub-classes may be tracking with different evolution channels.</description>

      <title>Multiple Emission Regions in Jets of Low Luminosity Active Galactic Nucleus in NGC 4278</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Large High Altitude Airshower Array (LHAASO) has detected very high energy gamma rays from the LINER galaxy NGC 4278, which has a low luminosity active galactic nucleus, and symmetric mildly relativistic S-shaped twin jets detected by radio observations. Few low-luminosity active galactic nuclei are detected in gamma rays due to their faintness. Earlier, several radio-emitting components were detected in the jets of NGC 4278. We model their radio emission with synchrotron emission of ultra-relativistic electrons to estimate the strength of the magnetic field inside these components within a time-dependent framework after including the ages of the different components. We show that the synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission by these components cannot explain the Swift X-ray data detected from NGC 4278 and the LHAASO gamma-ray data associated with NGC 4278. We suggest that a separate component in one of the jets is responsible for the high energy emission whose age, size, magnetic field and the spectrum of the ultra-relativistic electrons inside it have been estimated after fitting the multi-wavelength data of NGC 4278 with the sum of the spectral energy distributions from the radio components and the high energy component.</description>

      <title>Spin-down of a pulsar with a yielding crust</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light of the discovery of the long-period radio pulsar PSR J0901-4046, it is interesting to revisit a question about how the magnetized neutron star slows down its rotation. In the case of a weak or liquid outer crust, the mechanism of spin-down becomes unclear because the braking stress cannot then be transmitted from the surface to the main bulk of the star. We show that even if the outer crust does not withstand the surface electromagnetic forces creating the braking torque, the stellar spin-down does not stop, and the matter rearranges so that the necessary electromagnetic forces form in more deep and rigid layers capable of withstanding these forces. The spin-down rate remains the same and corresponds to the transformation of the rotational energy of the neutron star into the energy of the generated relativistic electron-positron plasma. The solid iron surface of ultrastrongly magnetized PSR J0901-4046 appears not to be yielding and withstands the braking stress without breaking.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference of radio millisecond pulsars in globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are abundant in globular clusters (GCs), which offer favorable environments for their creation. While the advent of recent, powerful facilities led to a rapid increase in MSP discoveries in GCs through pulsation searches, detection biases persist. In this work, we investigate the ability of current and future detections in GCs to constrain the parameters of the MSP population in GCs through a careful study of their luminosity function. Parameters of interest are the number of MSPs hosted by a GC, as well as the mean and the width of their luminosity function, which are typically affected by large uncertainties. While, as we show, likelihood-based studies can lead to ill-behaved posterior on the size of the MSP population, we introduce a novel, likelihood-free analysis, based on Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation, which consistently produces well-behaved posteriors. We focus on the GC Terzan 5, which currently counts 48 detected MSPs. We find that about 158 MSPs should be hosted in this GC, but the uncertainty on this number remains large. We explore the performance of our new method on simulated Terzan 5-like datasets mimicking possible future observational outcomes. We find that significant improvement on the posteriors can be obtained by adding a reliable measurement of the diffuse radio emission of the GC to the analysis or by improving the detection threshold of current radio pulsation surveys by at least a factor two.</description>

      <title>Supernova Rates and Luminosity Functions from ASAS-SN I: 2014--2017 Type Ia SNe and Their Subtypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the volumetric rates and luminosity functions (LFs) of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the $V$-band All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) catalogues spanning discovery dates from UTC 2014-01-26 to UTC 2017-12-29. Our standard sample consists of 404 SNe Ia with $m_{V,\mathrm{peak}}&lt;17$ mag and Galactic latitude $|b|&gt;15^{\circ}$. Our results are both statistically more precise and systematically more robust than previous studies due to the large sample size and high spectroscopic completeness. We make completeness corrections based on both the apparent and absolute magnitudes by simulating the detection of SNe Ia in ASAS-SN light curves. We find a total volumetric rate for all subtypes of $R_{\mathrm{tot}}=2.28^{+0.20}_{-0.20}\,\times 10^{4}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,h^{3}_{70}$ for $M_{V,\mathrm{peak}}&lt;-16.5$ mag ($R_{\mathrm{tot}}=1.91^{+0.12}_{-0.12}\,\times 10^{4}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,h^{3}_{70}$ for $M_{V,\mathrm{peak}}&lt;-17.5$ mag) at the median redshift of our sample, $z_{\mathrm{med}}=0.024$. This is in agreement ($1\sigma$) with the local volumetric rates found by previous studies. We also compile luminosity functions (LFs) for the entire sample as well as for subtypes of SNe Ia for the first time. The major subtypes with more than one SN include Ia-91bg, Ia-91T, Ia-CSM, and Ia-03fg with total rates of $R_{\mathrm{Ia-91bg}}=1.4^{+0.5}_{-0.5} \times 10^{3}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,h^{3}_{70}$, $R_{\mathrm{Ia-91T}}=8.5^{+1.6}_{-1.7} \times 10^{2}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,h^{3}_{70}$, $R_{\mathrm{Ia-CSM}}=10^{+7}_{-7}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,h^{3}_{70}$, and $R_{\mathrm{Ia-03fg}}=30^{+20}_{-20}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,h^{3}_{70}$, respectively. We estimate a mean host extinction of $E(V-r)\approx 0.2$ mag based on the shift between our $V$-band and the ZTF $r$-band LFs.</description>

      <title>Proposing a Physical Mechanism to Explain Various Observed Sources of QPOs by Simulating the Dynamics of Accretion Disks around the Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism to explain the low-frequency QPOs observed in X-ray binary systems and AGNs. To achieve this, we perturbed stable accretion disks around Kerr and EGB black holes at different angular velocities, revealing characteristics of shock waves and oscillations on the disk. By applying this perturbation to scenarios with varying alpha values for EGB black holes and different spin parameters for Kerr black holes, we numerically observed changes in the disk dynamic structure and its oscillations. Through various numerical models, we found that the formation of one- and two-armed spiral shock waves on the disk serves as a mechanism for generating QPOs. We compared the QPOs obtained from numerical calculations with the low-frequency QPOs observed in $X$-ray binary systems and AGN sources, finding high consistency with observations. We observed that the shock mechanism, leading to QPOs, explains the X-ray binaries and AGNs studied in this article. Our numerical findings indicate that QPOs are more strongly dependent on the EGB constant than on the black hole spin parameter. However, we highlighted that the primary impact on oscillations and QPOs is driven by the perturbation angular velocity. The results from the models showed that the perturbation asymptotic speed at V_{\infty}=0.2 independently generates QPO frequencies, regardless of the black hole spin parameter and the EGB coupling constant. Therefore, for the moderate value of V_{\infty}, a two-armed spiral shock wave formed around the black hole is suggested as a decisive mechanism in explaining low-frequency QPOs.</description>

      <title>A gamma ray study of Galactic PeVatron candidates LHAASO J1825-1236 and LHAASO J1839-0545</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies by LHAASO have shown the presence of high-luminosity PeVatrons in our Galaxy. We examine two notable sources, each consisting of two pulsars, detected by LHAASO. We study gamma and cosmic-ray emissions from the surroundings of these pulsars. We used the Gammapy software to perform gamma-ray measurements from these sources in anticipation of future analyses to be carried out with the CTA observatory, which is now under development. Furthermore, the particle propagation throughout the Galaxy was simulated using the GALPROP software, accounting for emission from energy losses due to spin-down. As a result, we present the particle spectra generated during this propagation phase along with the corresponding gamma-ray emission. The findings suggest that CTA may have the capability to detect these sources and show that the data can be explained by gamma rays coming from a leptonic model.</description>

      <title>AT2021lwx: Another Neutrino-Coincident Tidal Disruption Event with a Strong Dust Echo?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the possible association of an astrophysical neutrino (IC220405B) with the recently reported, extremely energetic tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate AT2021lwx (ZTF20abrbeie, aka ``Scary Barbie'') at redshift $z=0.995$. Although the TDE is about $2.6^\circ$ off the direction of the reconstructed neutrino event (outside the 90% confidence level localization region), the TDE candidate shares some important characteristics with so far reported neutrino-TDE associations: a strong infrared dust echo, high bolometric luminosity, a neutrino time delay with respect to the peak mass accretion rate of the order of hundred days, and a high observed X-ray luminosity. We interpret this new association using an isotropic emission model, where neutrinos are produced by the collision of accelerated protons with infrared photons. After accounting for the high redshift of AT2021lwx (by interpreting the data in the SMBH frame), we find that the expected neutrino fluences and neutrino time delays are qualitatively comparable to the other TDEs. Since data are only available up to 300 days post-peak in the SMBH frame, significant uncertainties exist in the dust echo interpretation, and therefore in the predicted number of neutrinos detected, $\mathcal N_{\nu}\simeq3.0\times10^{-3}-0.012$. We recommend further follow-up on this object for an extended period and suggest refining the reconstruction of the neutrino arrival direction in this particular case.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Equation-of-State Constraints on the Color-Superconducting Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that astrophysical constraints on the dense-matter equation of state place an upper bound on the color-superconducting gap in dense matter above the transition from nuclear matter to quark matter. Pairing effects in the color-flavor locked (CFL) quark matter phase increase the pressure at high density, and if this effect is sufficiently large then the requirements of causality and mechanical stability make it impossible to reach such a pressure in a way that is consistent with what is known at lower densities. The intermediate-density equation of state is inferred by considering extensions of chiral effective field theory (CEFT) to neutron star densities, and conditioning these using current astrophysical observations of neutron star radius, maximum mass, and tidal deformability (PSR J0348+0432, PSR J1624-2230, PSR J0740+6620, GW170817). At baryon number chemical potential $\mu = 2.6~\text{GeV}$ we find a 95% upper limit on the CFL pairing gap $\Delta$ of $457~\text{MeV}$ using overly conservative assumptions and $216~\text{MeV}$ with more reasonable assumptions. This constraint may be strengthened by future astrophysical measurements as well as by future advances in high density QCD calculations.</description>

      <title>The Galactic center excess at the highest energies: morphology and photon-count statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of the GeV gamma-ray Galactic center excess (GCE) in the data of Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) is still to be unveiled. We present a new analysis of the inner Galaxy Fermi-LAT data at energies above 10 GeV, based on an innovative method which combines the skyFACT adaptive template fitting with and the 1pPDF pixel-count statistics. We find a strong evidence for the GCE also at high energies, $\sigma &gt; 5$ regardless of the GCE spatial template. Remarkably, our fits prefer the bulge morphological model over the dark matter one at high significance, and show no evidence for an additional dark matter template on top of the bulge component. Through the 1pPDF analysis, we find that the model best describing the gamma-ray data requires a smooth, diffuse GCE following a bulge morphology, together with sub-threshold point sources. The 1pPDF fit reconstructs a consistent population of faint point sources down at least to $10^{-12}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Between $10^{-12}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and $10^{-11}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ the 1pPDF measures a number of point sources significantly higher than the ones in the Fermi 4FGL catalog. The robustness of our results brings further support to the attempt of explaining, at least partially, the high-energy tail of the GCE in terms of a population of point sources, likely corresponding to millisecond pulsars.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal emission from mildly relativistic dynamical ejecta of neutron star mergers: spectrum and sky image</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary neutron star mergers are expected to produce fast dynamical ejecta, with mildly relativistic velocities extending to $\beta=v/c&gt;0.6$. In a preceding paper, we derived an analytic description of the time-dependent radio to X-ray synchrotron flux produced by collisionless shocks driven by such fast ejecta into the interstellar medium, for spherical ejecta with broken power-law mass (or energy) distributions, $M(&gt;\gamma\beta)\propto(\gamma\beta)^{-s}$ with $s=s_\text{KN}$ at $\gamma\beta&lt;\gamma_0\beta_0$ and $s=s_\text{ft}$ at $\gamma\beta&gt;\gamma_0\beta_0$ (where $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor). Here, we extend our analysis and provide analytic expressions for the self-absorption frequency, the cooling frequency, and the observed angular size of the emitting region (which appears as a ring in the sky). For parameter values characteristic of merger calculation results -- a "shallow" mass distribution, $1&lt;s_\text{KN}&lt;3$, for the bulk of the ejecta (at $\gamma\beta\approx0.2$), and a steep, $s_\text{ft}&gt;5$, "fast tail" mass distribution -- the analytic results reproduce well (to tens of percent accuracy) the results of detailed numeric calculations, a significant improvement over earlier order-of-magnitude estimates (based on extrapolations of results valid for $\gamma\beta\ll1$).</description>

      <title>A Study of the Spectral properties of Gamma-Ray Bursts with the Precursors and Main bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is no consensus yet on whether the precursor and the main burst of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have the same origin, and their jet composition is still unclear. In order to further investigate this issue, we systematically search 21 Fermi GRBs with both precursor and main burst for spectral analysis. We first perform Bayesian time-resolved spectral analysis and find that almost all the precursors and the main bursts (94.4$\%$) exhibit thermal components, and the vast majority of them have low-energy spectral index ($\alpha$) (72.2$\%$) that exceed the limit of synchrotron radiation. We then analyse the evolution and correlation of the spectral parameters and find that approximately half of the $\alpha$ (50$\%$) of the precursors and the main bursts evolve in a similar pattern, while peak energy ($E_{p}$) (55.6$\%$) behave similarly, and their evolution is mainly characterized by flux tracking; for the $\alpha-F$ (the flux) relation, more than half of the precursors and the main bursts (61.1$\%$) exhibit roughly similar patterns; the $E_{p}-F$ relation in both the precursor and main burst (100$\%$) exhibits a positive correlation of at least moderate strength. Next, we constrain the outflow properties of the precursors and the main bursts and find that most of them exhibit typical properties of photosphere radiation. Finally, we compare the time-integrated spectra of the precursors and the main bursts and find that nearly all of them are located in similar regions of the Amati relation and follow the Yonetoku relation. Therefore, we conclude that main bursts are continuations of precursors and they may share a common physical origin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.02661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of exceptionally light QCD axions on the stellar configuration of white dwarfs. At finite baryon density, the non-derivative coupling of the axion to nucleons displaces the axion from its in-vacuum minimum which implies a reduction of the nucleon mass. This dramatically alters the composition of stellar remnants. In particular, the modifications of the mass-radius relationship of white dwarfs allow us to probe large regions of unexplored parameter space without requiring that axions are dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we look into binaries undergoing gravitational radiation during a hyperbolic passage. Such hyperbolic events can be a credible source of gravitational waves in future detectors. We systematically calculate fluxes of gravitational radiation from such events in the presence of dark matter with different profiles, also considering the effects of dynamical friction. We provide an estimate for the braking index and show how it evolves due to the presence of the dark matter medium. We also investigate the binary dynamics through the changes in the orbital parameters by treating the potential due to dark matter spike and the dynamical friction effects as a perturbation term. An insight into the effects of such a medium on the binaries from the corresponding osculating elements opens up avenues to study binary dynamics for such events.</description>

      <title>Sustained super-Eddington accretion in high-redshift quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of $z \gtrsim 6$ quasars provide information on the early evolution of the most massive black holes (MBHs) and galaxies. Current observations, able to trace both gas and stellar properties, reveal a population of MBHs that is significantly more massive than expected from the local MBH-stellar mass relation. The population lies on, but mostly above, the relation observed in the nearby Universe. This suggests that these objects grew very rapidly. To explain their presence when the Universe was less than 1~Gyr old and to assess the physical conditions for their rapid growth, we explored whether episodes of accretion above the Eddington limit can occur across cosmic epochs. By employing state-of-the-art high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of a $z\sim 7$ quasar, where different accretion regimes are included consistently, together with their associated radiative and kinetic feedback, we show that super-Eddington phases can be sustained for relatively long timescales (tens of millions of years). This allows the MBH to rapidly grow by up to three orders of magnitude, depending on the strength of the kinetic feedback. We also show by means of a semianalytic calculation that the MBH spin remains moderate and does not take on extremely high values during the super-Eddington phases. This results in a lower feedback efficiency, which may allow the rapid growth required to explain over-massive high-redshift MBHs.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we develop a numerical method to generate images on an observer's screen, formed by radiation from hotspots on any timelike orbits outside a black hole. This method uses the calculation of fractional numbers, enabling us not only to produce the overall image but also to distinguish between primary, secondary, and higher-order images. Building upon this, we compute the images of hotspots from eight potential types of geodesic timelike orbits outside a Kerr black hole, summarizing the properties of both the overall and individual order images. Furthermore, we calculate the centroid motion and lightcurve. Notably, we observe flare phenomena across all orbit types and classify these flares into three categories based on the Doppler and gravitational redshift effects.</description>

      <title>Calibrating gravitational-wave search algorithms with conformal prediction</title>

Abstract: In astronomy, we frequently face the decision problem: does this data contain a signal? Typically, a statistical approach is used, which requires a threshold. The choice of threshold presents a common challenge in settings where signals and noise must be delineated, but their distributions overlap. Gravitational-wave astronomy, which has gone from the first discovery to catalogues of hundreds of events in less than a decade, presents a fascinating case study. For signals from colliding compact objects, the field has evolved from a frequentist to a Bayesian methodology. However, the issue of choosing a threshold and validating noise contamination in a catalogue persists. Confusion and debate often arise due to the misapplication of statistical concepts, the complicated nature of the detection statistics, and the inclusion of astrophysical background models. We introduce Conformal Prediction (CP), a framework developed in Machine Learning to provide distribution-free uncertainty quantification to point predictors. We show that CP can be viewed as an extension of the traditional statistical frameworks whereby thresholds are calibrated such that the uncertainty intervals are statistically rigorous and the error rate can be validated. Moreover, we discuss how CP offers a framework to optimally build a meta-pipeline combining the outputs from multiple independent searches. We introduce CP with a toy cosmic-ray detector, which captures the salient features of most astrophysical search problems and allows us to demonstrate the features of CP in a simple context. We then apply the approach to a recent gravitational-wave Mock Data Challenge using multiple search algorithms for compact binary coalescence signals in interferometric gravitational-wave data. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on the future potential of the method for gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Leptogenesis with sub-GeV Axion Like Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A derivative coupling of an axion like particle (ALP) with a B-L current may lead to the baryon asymmetry of the universe via spontaneous leptogenesis provided a lepton number breaking interaction prevails in thermal equilibrium. Conventionally, such scenario works only for heavy ALPs and high reheating temperature due to the fact that the same lepton number breaking contribution is tied up with neutrino mass generation also. In this work, we propose inert Higgs doublet assisted lepton number violating operator to relieve such tension so as to generate lepton asymmetry (of freeze-in/out type) with a much lower reheating temperature that can accommodate light (sub-GeV) ALPs sensitive to current and future ALP searches.</description>

      <title>On the single versus the repetitive Penrose process in a Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extracting the rotational energy from a Kerr black hole (BH) is one of the crucial topics in relativistic astrophysics. Here, we give special attention to the Penrose ballistic process based on the fission of a massive particle $\mu_0$ into two particles $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$, occurring in the ergosphere of a Kerr BH. Bardeen et al. indicated that for the process to occur, some additional "{\it hydrodynamical forces or superstrong radiation reactions}" were needed. Wald and Chandrasekhar further expanded this idea. This animosity convinced T. Piran and collaborators to move from a simple three-body system characterizing the original Penrose process to a many-body system. This many-body approach was further largely expanded by others, some questionable in their validity. Here, we return to the simplest original Penrose process and show that the solution of the equations of motion, imposing the turning point condition on their trajectories, leads to the rotational energy extraction from the BH expected by Penrose. The efficiency of energy extraction by a single process is quantified for three different single decay processes occurring respectively at $r=1.2 M$, $r=1.5 M$, and $r=1.9 M$. An interesting repetitive model has been proposed by Misner, Thorne \&amp; Wheeler \citep[][hereafter MTW73]{Misner:1973prb}. Indeed, it would appear that a repetitive sequence of $246$ decays of the above injection process at $r=1.2 M$ and the corresponding ones at $r=1.5 M$ and $r=1.9 M$ could extract $100\%$ of the rotational energy of the BH, so violating energy conservation. The accompanying paper, accounting for the existence of the BH irreducible mass, introduces a non-linear approach that avoids violating energy conservation and leads to a new energy extraction process.</description>
