      <title>Computational limits to the legibility of the imaged human brain</title>

Abstract: Our knowledge of the organisation of the human brain at the population-level is yet to translate into power to predict functional differences at the individual-level, limiting clinical applications, and casting doubt on the generalisability of inferred mechanisms. It remains unknown whether the difficulty arises from the absence of individuating biological patterns within the brain, or from limited power to access them with the models and compute at our disposal. Here we comprehensively investigate the resolvability of such patterns with data and compute at unprecedented scale. Across 23 810 unique participants from UK Biobank, we systematically evaluate the predictability of 25 individual biological characteristics, from all available combinations of structural and functional neuroimaging data. Over 4526 GPU hours of computation, we train, optimize, and evaluate out-of-sample 700 individual predictive models, including fully-connected feed-forward neural networks of demographic, psychological, serological, chronic disease, and functional connectivity characteristics, and both uni- and multi-modal 3D convolutional neural network models of macro- and micro-structural brain imaging. We find a marked discrepancy between the high predictability of sex (balanced accuracy 99.7%), age (mean absolute error 2.048 years, R2 0.859), and weight (mean absolute error 2.609Kg, R2 0.625), for which we set new state-of-the-art performance, and the surprisingly low predictability of other characteristics. Neither structural nor functional imaging predicted psychology better than the coincidence of chronic disease (p&lt;0.05). Serology predicted chronic disease (p&lt;0.05) and was best predicted by it (p&lt;0.001), followed by structural neuroimaging (p&lt;0.05). Our findings suggest either more informative imaging or more powerful models are needed to decipher individual level characteristics from the human brain.</description>

      <title>A simple EEG-based decision tool for neonatal therapeutic hypothermia in hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy</title>

Abstract: Indication of therapeutic hypothermia needs an accurate identification of brain injury in the early neonatal period. Here, we aim to provide a simple hypothermia decision-making tool for the term neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) based on features of conventional electroencephalogram (EEG) taken less than 6 hours from birth. EEG recordings from one hundred full-term babies with HIE were included in the study. Each EEG recording was graded by pediatric neurologists for HIE severity. Amplitude of each EEG segment was analyzed in the slow frequency bands. Temporal fluctuations of spectral power in delta (0.5 - 4 Hz) frequency band was used to characterize each HIE grade. For each grade of abnormality, we estimated level and duration (number of consecutive segments above a given level) probability densities for power of delta oscillations. These 2D representation of EEG dynamics can identify mild HIE group from those of requiring hypothermia. Our discrimination system yielded an accuracy, recall, positive predictive value (precision), negative predictive value, false alarm ratio and F1-score of 98%, 99%, 99%, 0.94%, 0.06 and 99%, respectively. These results provided an accurate discrimination of mild versus moderate or severe HIE, and only one mild case was erroneously detected as relevant for hypothermia. Quantized probability densities of slow spectral features (delta power) from early conventional EEG (withing 6 hours of birth) revealed significant differences in slow spectral dynamics between infants with mild HIE grades and those relevant for hypothermia.</description>

      <title>Positioning is All You Need</title>

Abstract: One can drive safely with a GPS without memorizing a world map (not to mention the dark regions that humans have never explored). Such a locality-based attention mechanism has a profound implication on our understanding of how the brain works. This paper refines the existing embodied cognition framework by turning the locality from a constraint to an advantage. Analogous to GPS-based navigation, positioning represents a computationally more efficient solution to flexible behaviors than reconstruction. This simple intuition implies that {\em positioning is all you need} to understand cognitive functions generated by hippocampal-neocortical systems. That is, the neocortex generates thousands of local maps whose indexing is maintained by the hippocampus. Geometrically, we present a simple manifold positioning framework to explain the principle of localized embodied cognition. The positioning operation implemented by the attention mechanism can be interpreted as a nonlinear projection linking the discovery of local subspace structure by the neocortex (a sensorimotor machine interacting with the world locally) for the navigation task in mind without discovering global manifold topology.</description>
