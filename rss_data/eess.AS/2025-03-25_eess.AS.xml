      <title>A State-of-the-Art Review on Acoustic Preservation of Historical Worship Spaces through Auralization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Historical Worship Spaces (HWS) are significant architectural landmarks which hold both cultural and spiritual value. The acoustic properties of these spaces play a crucial role in historical and contemporary religious liturgies, rituals, and ceremonies, as well as in the performance of sacred music. However, the original acoustic characteristics of these spaces are often at risk due to repurposing, renovations, natural disasters, or deterioration over time. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the current state of research on the acquisition, analysis, and synthesis of acoustics, with a focus on HWS. An example case study of the Nassau chapel in Brussels, Belgium, is presented to demonstrate the application of these techniques for the preservation and auralization of historical worship space acoustics. The paper concludes with a discussion of the challenges and opportunities in the field, and outlines future research directions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an unsupervised variational acoustic clustering model for clustering audio data in the time-frequency domain. The model leverages variational inference, extended to an autoencoder framework, with a Gaussian mixture model as a prior for the latent space. Specifically designed for audio applications, we introduce a convolutional-recurrent variational autoencoder optimized for efficient time-frequency processing. Our experimental results considering a spoken digits dataset demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy and clustering performance compared to traditional methods, showcasing the model's enhanced ability to capture complex audio patterns.</description>

      <title>Target Speaker Selection for Neural Network Beamforming in Multi-Speaker Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a speaker selection mechanism (SSM) for the training of an end-to-end beamforming neural network, based on recent findings that a listener usually looks to the target speaker with a certain undershot angle. The mechanism allows the neural network model to learn toward which speaker to focus, during training, in a multi-speaker scenario, based on the position of listener and speakers. However, only audio information is necessary during inference. We perform acoustic simulations demonstrating the feasibility and performance when the SSM is employed in training. The results show significant increase in speech intelligibility, quality, and distortion metrics when compared to the minimum variance distortionless filter and the same neural network model trained without SSM. The success of the proposed method is a significant step forward toward the solution of the cocktail party problem.</description>

      <title>Joint Spectrogram Separation and TDOA Estimation using Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Separating sources is a common challenge in applications such as speech enhancement and telecommunications, where distinguishing between overlapping sounds helps reduce interference and improve signal quality. Additionally, in multichannel systems, correct calibration and synchronization are essential to separate and locate source signals accurately. This work introduces a method for blind source separation and estimation of the Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) of signals in the time-frequency domain. Our proposed method effectively separates signal mixtures into their original source spectrograms while simultaneously estimating the relative delays between receivers, using Optimal Transport (OT) theory. By exploiting the structure of the OT problem, we combine the separation and delay estimation processes into a unified framework, optimizing the system through a block coordinate descent algorithm. We analyze the performance of the OT-based estimator under various noise conditions and compare it with conventional TDOA and source separation methods. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach can achieve a significant level of accuracy across diverse noise scenarios for physical speech signals in both TDOA and source separation tasks.</description>

      <title>Audio-Enhanced Vision-Language Modeling with Latent Space Broadening for High Quality Data Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based multimodal models are widely used in industrial-scale recommendation, search, and advertising systems for content understanding and relevance ranking. Enhancing labeled training data quality and cross-modal fusion significantly improves model performance, influencing key metrics such as quality view rates and ad revenue. High-quality annotations are crucial for advancing content modeling, yet traditional statistical-based active learning (AL) methods face limitations: they struggle to detect overconfident misclassifications and are less effective in distinguishing semantically similar items in deep neural networks. Additionally, audio information plays an increasing role, especially in short-video platforms, yet most pre-trained multimodal architectures primarily focus on text and images. While training from scratch across all three modalities is possible, it sacrifices the benefits of leveraging existing pre-trained visual-language (VL) and audio models. To address these challenges, we propose kNN-based Latent Space Broadening (LSB) to enhance AL efficiency and Vision-Language Modeling with Audio Enhancement (VLMAE), a mid-fusion approach integrating audio into VL models. This system deployed in production systems, leading to significant business gains.</description>

      <title>Mixed-gradients Distributed Filtered Reference Least Mean Square Algorithm -- A Robust Distributed Multichannel Active Noise Control Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed multichannel active noise control (DMCANC), which utilizes multiple individual processors to achieve a global noise reduction performance comparable to conventional centralized multichannel active noise control (MCANC), has become increasingly attractive due to its high computational efficiency. However, the majority of current DMCANC algorithms disregard the impact of crosstalk across nodes and impose the assumption of an ideal network devoid of communication limitations, which is an unrealistic assumption. Therefore, this work presents a robust DMCANC algorithm that employs the compensating filter to mitigate the impact of crosstalk. The proposed solution enhances the DMCANC system's flexibility and security by utilizing local gradients instead of local control filters to convey enhanced information, resulting in a mixed-gradients distributed filtered reference least mean square (MGDFxLMS) algorithm. The performance investigation demonstrates that the proposed approach performs well with the centralized method. Furthermore, to address the issue of communication delay in the distributed network, a practical strategy that auto-shrinks the step size value in response to the delayed samples is implemented to improve the system's resilience. The numerical simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed auto-shrink step size MGDFxLMS (ASSS-MGDFxLMS) algorithm across various communication delays, highlighting its practical value.</description>

      <title>Elevating Robust Multi-Talker ASR by Decoupling Speaker Separation and Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the tremendous success of automatic speech recognition (ASR) with the introduction of deep learning, its performance is still unsatisfactory in many real-world multi-talker scenarios. Speaker separation excels in separating individual talkers but, as a frontend, it introduces processing artifacts that degrade the ASR backend trained on clean speech. As a result, mainstream robust ASR systems train the backend on noisy speech to avoid processing artifacts. In this work, we propose to decouple the training of the speaker separation frontend and the ASR backend, with the latter trained on clean speech only. Our decoupled system achieves 5.1% word error rates (WER) on the Libri2Mix dev/test sets, significantly outperforming other multi-talker ASR baselines. Its effectiveness is also demonstrated with the state-of-the-art 7.60%/5.74% WERs on 1-ch and 6-ch SMS-WSJ. Furthermore, on recorded LibriCSS, we achieve the speaker-attributed WER of 2.92%. These state-of-the-art results suggest that decoupling speaker separation and recognition is an effective approach to elevate robust multi-talker ASR.</description>

      <title>Music Similarity Representation Learning Focusing on Individual Instruments with Source Separation and Human Preference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes music similarity representation learning (MSRL) based on individual instrument sounds (InMSRL) utilizing music source separation (MSS) and human preference without requiring clean instrument sounds during inference. We propose three methods that effectively improve performance. First, we introduce end-to-end fine-tuning (E2E-FT) for the Cascade approach that sequentially performs MSS and music similarity feature extraction. E2E-FT allows the model to minimize the adverse effects of a separation error on the feature extraction. Second, we propose multi-task learning for the Direct approach that directly extracts disentangled music similarity features using a single music similarity feature extractor. Multi-task learning, which is based on the disentangled music similarity feature extraction and MSS based on reconstruction with disentangled music similarity features, further enhances instrument feature disentanglement. Third, we employ perception-aware fine-tuning (PAFT). PAFT utilizes human preference, allowing the model to perform InMSRL aligned with human perceptual similarity. We conduct experimental evaluations and demonstrate that 1) E2E-FT for Cascade significantly improves InMSRL performance, 2) the multi-task learning for Direct is also helpful to improve disentanglement performance in the feature extraction, 3) PAFT significantly enhances the perceptual InMSRL performance, and 4) Cascade with E2E-FT and PAFT outperforms Direct with the multi-task learning and PAFT.</description>

      <title>Wireless Hearables With Programmable Speech AI Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conventional wisdom has been that designing ultra-compact, battery-constrained wireless hearables with on-device speech AI models is challenging due to the high computational demands of streaming deep learning models. Speech AI models require continuous, real-time audio processing, imposing strict computational and I/O constraints. We present NeuralAids, a fully on-device speech AI system for wireless hearables, enabling real-time speech enhancement and denoising on compact, battery-constrained devices. Our system bridges the gap between state-of-the-art deep learning for speech enhancement and low-power AI hardware by making three key technical contributions: 1) a wireless hearable platform integrating a speech AI accelerator for efficient on-device streaming inference, 2) an optimized dual-path neural network designed for low-latency, high-quality speech enhancement, and 3) a hardware-software co-design that uses mixed-precision quantization and quantization-aware training to achieve real-time performance under strict power constraints. Our system processes 6 ms audio chunks in real-time, achieving an inference time of 5.54 ms while consuming 71.6 mW. In real-world evaluations, including a user study with 28 participants, our system outperforms prior on-device models in speech quality and noise suppression, paving the way for next-generation intelligent wireless hearables that can enhance hearing entirely on-device.</description>

      <title>Seeing Speech and Sound: Distinguishing and Locating Audios in Visual Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified model capable of simultaneously grounding both spoken language and non-speech sounds within a visual scene, addressing key limitations in current audio-visual grounding models. Existing approaches are typically limited to handling either speech or non-speech sounds independently, or at best, together but sequentially without mixing. This limitation prevents them from capturing the complexity of real-world audio sources that are often mixed. Our approach introduces a 'mix-and-separate' framework with audio-visual alignment objectives that jointly learn correspondence and disentanglement using mixed audio. Through these objectives, our model learns to produce distinct embeddings for each audio type, enabling effective disentanglement and grounding across mixed audio sources. Additionally, we created a new dataset to evaluate simultaneous grounding of mixed audio sources, demonstrating that our model outperforms prior methods. Our approach also achieves comparable or better performance in standard segmentation and cross-modal retrieval tasks, highlighting the benefits of our mix-and-separate approach.</description>

      <title>A Reliable and Efficient Detection Pipeline for Rodent Ultrasonic Vocalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) is crucial for understanding rodents' affective states and social behaviors, but the manual analysis is time-consuming and prone to errors. Automated USV detection systems have been developed to address these challenges. Yet, these systems often rely on machine learning and fail to generalize effectively to new datasets. To tackle these shortcomings, we introduce ContourUSV, an efficient automated system for detecting USVs from audio recordings. Our pipeline includes spectrogram generation, cleaning, pre-processing, contour detection, post-processing, and evaluation against manual annotations. To ensure robustness and reliability, we compared ContourUSV with three state-of-the-art systems using an existing open-access USV dataset (USVSEG) and a second dataset we are releasing publicly along with this paper. On average, across the two datasets, ContourUSV outperformed the other three systems with a 1.51x improvement in precision, 1.17x in recall, 1.80x in F1 score, and 1.49x in specificity while achieving an average speedup of 117.07x.</description>

      <title>SuperM2M: Supervised and Mixture-to-Mixture Co-Learning for Speech Enhancement and Noise-Robust ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10271v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current dominant approach for neural speech enhancement is based on supervised learning by using simulated training data. The trained models, however, often exhibit limited generalizability to real-recorded data. To address this, this paper investigates training enhancement models directly on real target-domain data. We propose to adapt mixture-to-mixture (M2M) training, originally designed for speaker separation, for speech enhancement, by modeling multi-source noise signals as a single, combined source. In addition, we propose a co-learning algorithm that improves M2M with the help of supervised algorithms. When paired close-talk and far-field mixtures are available for training, M2M realizes speech enhancement by training a deep neural network (DNN) to produce speech and noise estimates in a way such that they can be linearly filtered to reconstruct the close-talk and far-field mixtures. This way, the DNN can be trained directly on real mixtures, and can leverage close-talk and far-field mixtures as a weak supervision to enhance far-field mixtures. To improve M2M, we combine it with supervised approaches to co-train the DNN, where mini-batches of real close-talk and far-field mixture pairs and mini-batches of simulated mixture and clean speech pairs are alternately fed to the DNN, and the loss functions are respectively (a) the mixture reconstruction loss on the real close-talk and far-field mixtures and (b) the regular enhancement loss on the simulated clean speech and noise. We find that, this way, the DNN can learn from real and simulated data to achieve better generalization to real data. We name this algorithm SuperM2M (supervised and mixture-to-mixture co-learning). Evaluation results on the CHiME-4 dataset show its effectiveness and potential.</description>

      <title>Speech Emotion Recognition with ASR Transcripts: A Comprehensive Study on Word Error Rate and Fusion Techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text data is commonly utilized as a primary input to enhance Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) performance and reliability. However, the reliance on human-transcribed text in most studies impedes the development of practical SER systems, creating a gap between in-lab research and real-world scenarios where Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) serves as the text source. Hence, this study benchmarks SER performance using ASR transcripts with varying Word Error Rates (WERs) from eleven models on three well-known corpora: IEMOCAP, CMU-MOSI, and MSP-Podcast. Our evaluation includes both text-only and bimodal SER with six fusion techniques, aiming for a comprehensive analysis that uncovers novel findings and challenges faced by current SER research. Additionally, we propose a unified ASR error-robust framework integrating ASR error correction and modality-gated fusion, achieving lower WER and higher SER results compared to the best-performing ASR transcript. These findings provide insights into SER with ASR assistance, especially for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>k2SSL: A Faster and Better Framework for Self-Supervised Speech Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved great success in speech-related tasks. While Transformer and Conformer architectures have dominated SSL backbones, encoders like Zipformer, which excel in automatic speech recognition (ASR), remain unexplored in SSL. Concurrently, inefficiencies in data processing within existing SSL training frameworks, such as fairseq, pose challenges in managing the growing volumes of training data. To address these issues, we propose k2SSL, an open-source framework that offers faster, more memory-efficient, and better-performing self-supervised speech representation learning, focusing on downstream ASR tasks. The optimized HuBERT and proposed Zipformer-based SSL systems exhibit substantial reductions in both training time and memory usage during SSL training. Experiments on LibriSpeech demonstrate that Zipformer Base significantly outperforms HuBERT and WavLM, achieving up to a 34.8% relative WER reduction compared to HuBERT Base after fine-tuning, along with a 3.5x pre-training speedup in GPU hours. When scaled to 60k hours of LibriLight data, Zipformer Large exhibits remarkable efficiency, matching HuBERT Large's performance while requiring only 5/8 pre-training steps.</description>

      <title>STA-V2A: Video-to-Audio Generation with Semantic and Temporal Alignment</title>

Abstract: Visual and auditory perception are two crucial ways humans experience the world. Text-to-video generation has made remarkable progress over the past year, but the absence of harmonious audio in generated video limits its broader applications. In this paper, we propose Semantic and Temporal Aligned Video-to-Audio (STA-V2A), an approach that enhances audio generation from videos by extracting both local temporal and global semantic video features and combining these refined video features with text as cross-modal guidance. To address the issue of information redundancy in videos, we propose an onset prediction pretext task for local temporal feature extraction and an attentive pooling module for global semantic feature extraction. To supplement the insufficient semantic information in videos, we propose a Latent Diffusion Model with Text-to-Audio priors initialization and cross-modal guidance. We also introduce Audio-Audio Align, a new metric to assess audio-temporal alignment. Subjective and objective metrics demonstrate that our method surpasses existing Video-to-Audio models in generating audio with better quality, semantic consistency, and temporal alignment. The ablation experiment validated the effectiveness of each module. Audio samples are available at https://y-ren16.github.io/STAV2A.</description>

      <title>Where are we in audio deepfake detection? A systematic analysis over generative and detection models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04324v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Voice-Conversion (VC) using generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology have made it possible to generate high-quality and realistic human-like audio. This poses growing challenges in distinguishing AI-synthesized speech from the genuine human voice and could raise concerns about misuse for impersonation, fraud, spreading misinformation, and scams. However, existing detection methods for AI-synthesized audio have not kept pace and often fail to generalize across diverse datasets. In this paper, we introduce SONAR, a synthetic AI-Audio Detection Framework and Benchmark, aiming to provide a comprehensive evaluation for distinguishing cutting-edge AI-synthesized auditory content. SONAR includes a novel evaluation dataset sourced from 9 diverse audio synthesis platforms, including leading TTS providers and state-of-the-art TTS models. It is the first framework to uniformly benchmark AI-audio detection across both traditional and foundation model-based detection systems. Through extensive experiments, (1) we reveal the limitations of existing detection methods and demonstrate that foundation models exhibit stronger generalization capabilities, likely due to their model size and the scale and quality of pretraining data. (2) Speech foundation models demonstrate robust cross-lingual generalization capabilities, maintaining strong performance across diverse languages despite being fine-tuned solely on English speech data. This finding also suggests that the primary challenges in audio deepfake detection are more closely tied to the realism and quality of synthetic audio rather than language-specific characteristics. (3) We explore the effectiveness and efficiency of few-shot fine-tuning in improving generalization, highlighting its potential for tailored applications, such as personalized detection systems for specific entities or individuals.</description>

      <title>CLASP: Contrastive Language-Speech Pretraining for Multilingual Multimodal Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces CLASP (Contrastive Language-Speech Pretraining), a multilingual, multimodal representation tailored for audio-text information retrieval. CLASP leverages the synergy between spoken content and textual data. During training, we utilize our newly introduced speech-text dataset, which encompasses 15 diverse categories ranging from fiction to religion. CLASP's audio component integrates audio spectrograms with a pre-trained self-supervised speech model, while its language encoding counterpart employs a sentence encoder pre-trained on over 100 languages. This unified lightweight model bridges the gap between various modalities and languages, enhancing its effectiveness in handling and retrieving multilingual and multimodal data. Our evaluations across multiple languages demonstrate that CLASP establishes new benchmarks in HITS@1, MRR, and meanR metrics, outperforming traditional ASR-based retrieval methods that rely on transcribing speech into text for subsequent text retrieval, especially in specific scenarios.</description>

      <title>MusicEval: A Generative Music Dataset with Expert Ratings for Automatic Text-to-Music Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The technology for generating music from textual descriptions has seen rapid advancements. However, evaluating text-to-music (TTM) systems remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the difficulty of balancing performance and cost with existing objective and subjective evaluation methods. In this paper, we propose an automatic assessment task for TTM models to align with human perception. To address the TTM evaluation challenges posed by the professional requirements of music evaluation and the complexity of the relationship between text and music, we collect MusicEval, the first generative music assessment dataset. This dataset contains 2,748 music clips generated by 31 advanced and widely used models in response to 384 text prompts, along with 13,740 ratings from 14 music experts. Furthermore, we design a CLAP-based assessment model built on this dataset, and our experimental results validate the feasibility of the proposed task, providing a valuable reference for future development in TTM evaluation. The dataset is available at https://www.aishelltech.com/AISHELL_7A.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Allophony in Self-Supervised Speech Models for Atypical Pronunciation Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Allophony refers to the variation in the phonetic realization of a phoneme based on its phonetic environment. Modeling allophones is crucial for atypical pronunciation assessment, which involves distinguishing atypical from typical pronunciations. However, recent phoneme classifier-based approaches often simplify this by treating various realizations as a single phoneme, bypassing the complexity of modeling allophonic variation. Motivated by the acoustic modeling capabilities of frozen self-supervised speech model (S3M) features, we propose MixGoP, a novel approach that leverages Gaussian mixture models to model phoneme distributions with multiple subclusters. Our experiments show that MixGoP achieves state-of-the-art performance across four out of five datasets, including dysarthric and non-native speech. Our analysis further suggests that S3M features capture allophonic variation more effectively than MFCCs and Mel spectrograms, highlighting the benefits of integrating MixGoP with S3M features.</description>

      <title>Bimodal Connection Attention Fusion for Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal emotion recognition is challenging due to the difficulty of extracting features that capture subtle emotional differences. Understanding multi-modal interactions and connections is key to building effective bimodal speech emotion recognition systems. In this work, we propose Bimodal Connection Attention Fusion (BCAF) method, which includes three main modules: the interactive connection network, the bimodal attention network, and the correlative attention network. The interactive connection network uses an encoder-decoder architecture to model modality connections between audio and text while leveraging modality-specific features. The bimodal attention network enhances semantic complementation and exploits intra- and inter-modal interactions. The correlative attention network reduces cross-modal noise and captures correlations between audio and text. Experiments on the MELD and IEMOCAP datasets demonstrate that the proposed BCAF method outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous bimodal attention fusion for speech emotion recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal emotion recognition in conversations is a challenging problem due to the complex and complementary interactions between different modalities. Audio and textual cues are particularly important for understanding emotions from a human perspective. Most existing studies focus on exploring interactions between audio and text modalities at the same representation level. However, a critical issue is often overlooked: the heterogeneous modality gap between low-level audio representations and high-level text representations. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework called Heterogeneous Bimodal Attention Fusion (HBAF) for multi-level multi-modal interaction in conversational emotion recognition. The proposed method comprises three key modules: the uni-modal representation module, the multi-modal fusion module, and the inter-modal contrastive learning module. The uni-modal representation module incorporates contextual content into low-level audio representations to bridge the heterogeneous multi-modal gap, enabling more effective fusion. The multi-modal fusion module uses dynamic bimodal attention and a dynamic gating mechanism to filter incorrect cross-modal relationships and fully exploit both intra-modal and inter-modal interactions. Finally, the inter-modal contrastive learning module captures complex absolute and relative interactions between audio and text modalities. Experiments on the MELD and IEMOCAP datasets demonstrate that the proposed HBAF method outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines.</description>
