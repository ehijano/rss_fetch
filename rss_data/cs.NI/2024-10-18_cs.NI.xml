      <title>Design of an Efficient Fan-Shaped Clustered Trust-Based Routing Model with QoS &amp; Security-Aware Side-Chaining for IoV Deployments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) deployments has necessitated the creation of efficient and secure routing models to manage the massive data traffic generated by interconnected devices &amp; vehicles. For IoV deployments, we propose a novel fan-shaped trust-based routing model with Quality of Service (QoS) and security-aware side-chaining. Our method employs temporal levels of delay, throughput, Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), and energy consumption to determine optimal routing paths, thereby ensuring efficient data transmissions. We employ the Bacterial Foraging Optimizer (BFO) algorithm to manage side-chains within the network, which dynamically adjusts side-chain configurations to optimize system performance. The technique of fan-shaped clustering is used to group nodes into efficient clusters, allowing for more efficient communication and resource utilization sets. Extensive experimentation and performance analysis are utilized to evaluate the proposed model. Existing blockchain-based security models have been significantly improved by our findings. Our model achieves a remarkable 9.5% reduction in delay, a 10.5% improvement in throughput, a 2.9% improvement in PDR, and a 4.5% reduction in energy consumption compared to alternative approaches. In addition, we evaluate the model's resistance to Sybil, Masquerading, and Flooding attacks, which are prevalent security threats for IoV deployments. Even under these attack scenarios, our model provides consistently higher QoS levels compared to existing solutions, ensuring uninterrupted and reliable data transmissions. In IoV deployments, the proposed routing model and side-chaining management approach have numerous applications and use-cases like Smart cities, industrial automation, healthcare systems, transportation networks, and environmental monitoring.</description>

      <title>ORANSlice: An Open-Source 5G Network Slicing Platform for O-RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network slicing allows Telecom Operators (TOs) to support service provisioning with diverse Service Level Agreements (SLAs). The combination of network slicing and Open Radio Access Network (RAN) enables TOs to provide more customized network services and higher commercial benefits. However, in the current Open RAN community, an open-source end-to-end slicing solution for 5G is still missing. To bridge this gap, we developed ORANSlice, an open-source network slicing-enabled Open RAN system integrated with popular open-source RAN frameworks. ORANSlice features programmable, 3GPP-compliant RAN slicing and scheduling functionalities. It supports RAN slicing control and optimization via xApps on the near-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) thanks to an extension of the E2 interface between RIC and RAN, and service models for slicing. We deploy and test ORANSlice on different O-RAN testbeds and demonstrate its capabilities on different use cases, including slice prioritization and minimum radio resource guarantee.</description>

      <title>Latency-Aware Inter-domain Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite efforts from cloud and content providers to lower latency to acceptable levels for current and future services (e.g., augmented reality or cloud gaming), there are still opportunities for improvement. A major reason that traffic engineering efforts are challenged to lower latency is that the Internet's inter-domain routing protocol, the Border Gateway Protocol, is oblivious to any performance metric, and circuitous routing is still pervasive.
  In this work, we propose two implementation modifications that networks can leverage to make BGP latency-aware and reduce excessive latency inflation. These proposals, latency-proportional AS prepending and local preference neutralization, show promise towards providing a method for propagating abstract latency information with a reasonable increase in routing overhead.</description>

      <title>Data Driven Environmental Awareness Using Wireless Signals for Efficient Spectrum Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust classification of the operational environment of wireless devices is becoming increasingly important for wireless network optimization, particularly in a shared spectrum environment. Distinguishing between indoor and outdoor devices can enhance reliability and improve coexistence with existing, outdoor, incumbents. For instance, the unlicensed but shared 6 GHz band (5.925 - 7.125 GHz) enables sharing by imposing lower transmit power for indoor unlicensed devices and a spectrum coordination requirement for outdoor devices. Further, indoor devices are prohibited from using battery power, external antennas, and weatherization to prevent outdoor operations. As these rules may be circumvented, we propose a robust indoor/outdoor classification method by leveraging the fact that the radio-frequency environment faced by a device are quite different indoors and outdoors. We first collect signal strength data from all cellular and Wi-Fi bands that can be received by a smartphone in various environments (indoor interior, indoor near windows, and outdoors), along with GPS accuracy, and then evaluate three machine learning (ML) methods: deep neural network (DNN), decision tree, and random forest to perform classification into these three categories. Our results indicate that the DNN model performs the best, particularly in minimizing the most important classification error, that of classifying outdoor devices as indoor interior devices.</description>

      <title>Wireless Large Object Transmission Under Safety Constraints (LOTUS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future autonomous mobile systems will greatly benefit from cooperation and real-time sensor data exchange using V2X communication. In such applications, wireless communication has to cope with stringent real-time and safety constraints, a huge challenge given the inherently lossy wireless communication with highly dynamic channel and error conditions. To meet the safety and real-time goals, the use of state-of-the-art (5G and 802.11) V2X technologies focuses on reliable exchange of small data objects, as in URLLC. In contrast, reliable low-latency exchange of large data, such as camera frames, has received little attention, despite its predicted benefits in safe perception and cooperation. The LOTUS project, outlined in this paper, exploits the specific properties of large application data objects to develop novel, application-aware mechanisms for low-latency reliable large data exchange on top of existing and future V2X technologies. Evaluation with statistical analysis, simulation, and physical prototypes demonstrates the feasibility of low-latency large data object exchange at unprecedented levels of reliability.</description>

      <title>Towards Satellite Non-IID Imagery: A Spectral Clustering-Assisted Federated Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites are capable of gathering abundant Earth observation data (EOD) to enable different Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, to accomplish an effective EOD processing mechanism, it is imperative to investigate: 1) the challenge of processing the observed data without transmitting those large-size data to the ground because the connection between the satellites and the ground stations is intermittent, and 2) the challenge of processing the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) satellite data. In this paper, to cope with those challenges, we propose an orbit-based spectral clustering-assisted clustered federated self-knowledge distillation (OSC-FSKD) approach for each orbit of an LEO satellite constellation, which retains the advantage of FL that the observed data does not need to be sent to the ground. Specifically, we introduce normalized Laplacian-based spectral clustering (NLSC) into federated learning (FL) to create clustered FL in each round to address the challenge resulting from non-IID data. Particularly, NLSC is adopted to dynamically group clients into several clusters based on cosine similarities calculated by model updates. In addition, self-knowledge distillation is utilized to construct each local client, where the most recent updated local model is used to guide current local model training. Experiments demonstrate that the observation accuracy obtained by the proposed method is separately 1.01x, 2.15x, 1.10x, and 1.03x higher than that of pFedSD, FedProx, FedAU, and FedALA approaches using the SAT4 dataset. The proposed method also shows superiority when using other datasets.</description>

      <title>An Exposition of Pathfinding Strategies Within Lightning Network Clients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lightning Network is a peer-to-peer network designed to address Bitcoin's scalability challenges, facilitating rapid, cost-effective, and instantaneous transactions through bidirectional, blockchain-backed payment channels among network peers. Due to a source-based routing of payments, different pathfinding strategies are used in practice, trading off different objectives for each other such as payment reliability and routing fees. This paper explores differences within pathfinding strategies used by prominent Lightning Network node implementations, which include different underlying cost functions and different constraints, as well as different greedy algorithms of shortest path-type. Surprisingly, we observe that the pathfinding problems that most LN node implementations attempt to solve are NP-complete, and cannot be guaranteed to be optimally solved by the variants of Dijkstra's algorithm currently deployed in production. Through comparative analysis and simulations, we evaluate efficacy of different pathfinding strategies across metrics such as success rate, fees, path length, and timelock. Our experiments indicate that the strategies used by LND tend to be advantageous in terms of payment reliability, Eclair tends to result in paths with low fees, and that LDK exhibits average reliability with larger fee levels for smaller payment amounts; furthermore, CLN stands out for its minimal timelock paths. Additionally, we investigate the impact of Lightning node connectivity levels on routing efficiency. The findings of our analysis provide insights towards future improvements of pathfinding strategies and algorithms used within the Lightning Network.</description>

      <title>Efficient Function Placement in Virtual Networks: An Online Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a model for the virtual function placement problem and several novel algorithms using ideas based on multi-armed bandits. We prove that these algorithms learn the optimal placement policy rapidly, and their regret grows at a rate at most $O( N M \sqrt{T\ln T} )$ while respecting the feasibility constraints with high probability. We show through numerical experiments that those algorithms both have good practical performance and modest computational complexity. Using the proposed acceleration technique, they can be used to learn in large networks where computational power is limited. Our experiments are fully reproducible, and the code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Learning-based Two-tiered Online Optimization of Region-wide Datacenter Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online optimization of resource management for large-scale data centers and infrastructures to meet dynamic capacity reservation demands and various practical constraints (e.g., feasibility and robustness) is a very challenging problem. Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) approaches suffer from recognized limitations in such a dynamic environment, while learning-based approaches may face with prohibitively large state/action spaces. To this end, this paper presents a novel two-tiered online optimization to enable a learning-based Resource Allowance System (RAS). To solve optimal server-to-reservation assignment in RAS in an online fashion, the proposed solution leverages a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to make high-level decisions, e.g., how much resource to select from the Main Switch Boards (MSBs), and then a low-level Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solver to generate the local server-to-reservation mapping, conditioned on the RL decisions. We take into account fault tolerance, server movement minimization, and network affinity requirements and apply the proposed solution to large-scale RAS problems. To provide interpretability, we further train a decision tree model to explain the learned policies and to prune unreasonable corner cases at the low-level MILP solver, resulting in further performance improvement. Extensive evaluations show that our two-tiered solution outperforms baselines such as pure MIP solver by over $15\%$ while delivering $100\times$ speedup in computation.</description>

      <title>Wireless Resource Optimization in Hybrid Semantic/Bit Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04162v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, semantic communication (SemCom) has shown great potential in significant resource savings and efficient information exchanges, thus naturally introducing a novel and practical cellular network paradigm where two modes of SemCom and conventional bit communication (BitCom) coexist. Nevertheless, the involved wireless resource management becomes rather complicated and challenging, given the unique background knowledge matching and time-consuming semantic coding requirements in SemCom. To this end, this paper jointly investigates user association (UA), mode selection (MS), and bandwidth allocation (BA) problems in a hybrid semantic/bit communication network (HSB-Net). Concretely, we first identify a unified performance metric of message throughput for both SemCom and BitCom links. Next, we specially develop a knowledge matching-aware two-stage tandem packet queuing model and theoretically derive the average packet loss ratio and queuing latency. Combined with practical constraints, we then formulate a joint optimization problem for UA, MS, and BA to maximize the overall message throughput of HSB-Net. Afterward, we propose an optimal resource management strategy by utilizing a Lagrange primal-dual transformation method and a preference list-based heuristic algorithm with polynomial-time complexity. Numerical results not only demonstrate the accuracy of our analytical queuing model, but also validate the performance superiority of our proposed strategy compared with different benchmarks.</description>

      <title>R-ACP: Real-Time Adaptive Collaborative Perception Leveraging Robust Task-Oriented Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collaborative perception enhances sensing in multi-robot and vehicular networks by fusing information from multiple agents, improving perception accuracy and sensing range. However, mobility and non-rigid sensor mounts introduce extrinsic calibration errors, necessitating online calibration, further complicated by limited overlap in sensing regions. Moreover, maintaining fresh information is crucial for timely and accurate sensing. To address calibration errors and ensure timely and accurate perception, we propose a robust task-oriented communication (R-TOCOM) strategy to optimize online self-calibration and efficient feature sharing for Real-time Adaptive Cllaborative Perception (R-ACP). Specifically, we first formulate an Age of Perceived Targets (AoPT) minimization problem to capture data timeliness of multi-view streaming. Then, in the calibration phase, we introduce a channel-aware self-calibration technique based on re-identification (Re-ID), which adaptively compresses key features according to channel capacities, effectively addressing calibration issues via spatial and temporal cross-camera correlations. Moreover, in the streaming phase, we tackle the trade-off between bandwidth and inference accuracy by leveraging an Information Bottleneck (IB)-based encoding method to adjust video compression rates based on task relevance, thereby reducing communication overhead and latency. Finally, we design a priority-aware network to filter corrupted features to mitigate performance degradation from packet corruption. Extensive studies demonstrate that our framework outperforms five baselines, improving multiple object detection accuracy (MODA) by 25.49% and reducing communication costs by 51.36% under severely poor channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Red is Sus: Automated Identification of Low-Quality Service Availability Claims in the US National Broadband Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The FCC's National Broadband Map aspires to provide an unprecedented view into broadband availability in the US. However, this map, which also determines eligibility for public grant funding, relies on self-reported data from service providers that in turn have incentives to strategically misrepresent their coverage. In this paper, we develop an approach for automatically identifying these low-quality service claims in the National Broadband Map. To do this, we develop a novel dataset of broadband availability consisting of 750k observations from more than 900 US ISPs, derived from a combination of regulatory data and crowdsourced speed tests. Using this dataset, we develop a model to classify the accuracy of service provider regulatory filings and achieve AUCs over 0.98 for unseen examples. Our approach provides an effective technique to enable policymakers, civil society, and the public to identify portions of the National Broadband Map that are likely to have integrity challenges.</description>
