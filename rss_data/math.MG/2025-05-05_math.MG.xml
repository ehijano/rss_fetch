      <title>On the sharpness of Wasserstein contraction along heat flows, and a rigidity of Euclidean spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if a smooth metric measure space with non-negative weighted Ricci curvature admits two distinct points such that the $2$-Wasserstein distance is preserved along the associated heat flows i.e.
  \begin{equation}
  W_2(p_t(x,\cdot),p_t(y,\cdot))=d(x,y)
  \end{equation} for some $x,y$ and $t&gt;0$, then the space splits off a line. In particular, Euclidean spaces are the only spaces where the above sharpness condition holds for all pairs of points.
  Moreover, we show for positive $K$ that, the equality for the analogous $K$-contraction estimate for Wasserstein distances cannot be attained for all smooth metric measure spaces with Ricci curvature bounded below by $K$.</description>

      <title>New Sphere Packings from the Antipode Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we construct non-lattice sphere packings in dimensions $19$, $20$, $21$, $23$, $44$, $45$, and $47$, demonstrating record densities that surpass all previously documented results in these dimensions. The construction involves applying the antipode method to suboptimal cross-sections of $\Lambda_{24}$ and $P_{48p}$ respectively in those dimensions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The master theorem, introduced independently by Richter-Gebert and by Fomin and the first author, provides a method for proving incidence theorems of projective geometry using triangular tilings of surfaces. We investigate which incidence theorems over C and R can or cannot be proved via the master theorem. For this, we formalize the notion of a tiling proof. We introduce a hierarchy of classes of theorems based on the underlying topological spaces. A key tool is considering the same theorems over finite fields.</description>

      <title>Geometric Banach property (T) for metric spaces via Banach representations of Roe algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a notion of geometric Banach property (T) for metric spaces, which jointly generalizes Banach property (T) for groups and geometric property (T) for metric spaces. Our framework is achieved by Banach representations of Roe algebras of metric spaces. We show that geometric Banach property (T) is a coarse geometric invariant and establish several equivalent characterizations of this property, including a characterization via Kazhdan projections in Roe algebras. Further, we investigate foundational properties of geometric Banach property (T), including: the geometric Banach property (T) of sequences of finite Cayley graphs to the Banach property (T) of their limit groups (this partially extends the classical correspondence between residually finite groups and their box spaces), and the connection between the coarse fixed point property and geometric Banach property (T). Additionally, we provide a geometric characterization of V. Lafforgue's strong Banach property (T) for residually finite groups in terms of geometric Banach property (T) of its box spaces.</description>

      <title>Optimal boundary regularity of harmonic maps from $RCD(K,N)$-space to $CAT(0)$-space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the boundary regularity of harmonic maps on non-smooth domains. We first establish a version of the Gauss-Green formula on a bounded domain in $RCD(K, N)$ metric measure space, and then, we apply it to obtain the optimal boundary regularity of harmonic maps from $RCD(K, N)$ metric measure spaces into $CAT(0)$ metric spaces.</description>

      <title>Uniformization of metric surfaces: A survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this survey we present the most recent developments in the uniformization of metric surfaces, i.e., metric spaces homeomorphic to two-dimensional topological manifolds. We start from the classical conformal uniformization theorem of Koebe and Poincar\'e. Then we discuss the Bonk-Kleiner theorem on the quasisymmetric uniformization of metric spheres, which marks the beginning of the study of the uniformization problem on fractal surfaces. The next result presented is Rajala's theorem on the quasiconformal uniformization of metric spheres. We conclude with the final result in this series of works, due to Romney and the author, on the weakly quasiconformal uniformization of arbitrary metric surfaces of locally finite area under no further assumption.</description>

      <title>A note on the diameter of small sub-Riemannian balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observe that the diameter of small (in a locally uniform sense) balls in $C^{1,1}$ sub-Riemannian manifolds equals twice the radius. We also prove that, when the regularity of the structure is further lowered to $C^0$, the diameter is arbitrarily close to twice the radius. Both results hold independently of the bracket-generating condition.</description>

      <title>Stability of optimal transport maps on Riemannian manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove quantitative bounds on the stability of optimal transport maps and Kantorovich potentials from a fixed source measure $\rho$ under variations of the target measure $\mu$, when the cost function is the squared Riemannian distance on a Riemannian manifold. Previous works were restricted to subsets of Euclidean spaces, or made specific assumptions either on the manifold, or on the regularity of the transport maps. Our proof techniques combine entropy-regularized optimal transport with spectral and integral-geometric techniques. As some of the arguments do not rely on the Riemannian structure, our work also paves the way towards understanding stability of optimal transport in more general geometric spaces.</description>

      <title>Lifting couplings in Wasserstein spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.06591v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper makes mathematically precise the idea that conditional probabilities are analogous to path liftings in geometry.
  The idea of lifting is modelled in terms of the category-theoretic concept of a lens, which can be interpreted as a consistent choice of arrow liftings. The category we study is the one of probability measures over a given standard Borel space, with morphisms given by the couplings, or transport plans.
  The geometrical picture is even more apparent once we equip the arrows of the category with weights, which one can interpret as "lengths" or "costs", forming a so-called weighted category, which unifies several concepts of category theory and metric geometry.
  Indeed, we show that the weighted version of a lens is tightly connected to the notion of submetry in geometry.
  Every weighted category gives rise to a pseudo-quasimetric space via optimization over the arrows. In particular, Wasserstein spaces can be obtained from the weighted categories of probability measures and their couplings, with the weight of a coupling given by its cost.
  In this case, conditionals allow one to form weighted lenses, which one can interpret as "lifting transport plans, while preserving their cost".</description>

      <title>Geometric Bounds for Persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we offer a new perspective on persistent homology by integrating key concepts from metric geometry. For a given compact subset $\mathcal{X}$ of a Banach space $\mathbf{Y}$, we analyze the topological features arising in the family $\mathcal{N}_\bullet(\mathcal{X} \subset \mathbf{Y})$ of nested neighborhoods of $\mathcal{X}$ in $\mathbf{Y}$ and provide several geometric bounds on their persistence (lifespans).
  We begin by examining the lifespans of these homology classes in terms of their filling radii in $\mathbf{Y}$, establishing connections between these lifespans and fundamental invariants in metric geometry, such as the Urysohn width. We then derive bounds on these lifespans by considering the $\ell^\infty$-principal components of $\mathcal{X}$, also known as Kolmogorov widths.
  Additionally, we introduce and investigate the concept of extinction time of a metric space $\mathcal{X}$: the critical threshold beyond which no homological features persist in any degree. We propose methods for estimating the \v{C}ech and Vietoris-Rips extinction times of $\mathcal{X}$ by relating $\mathcal{X}$ to its convex hull and to its tight span, respectively.</description>

      <title>Curvature-Dimension for Autonomous Lagrangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08001v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a curvature-dimension condition for autonomous Lagrangians on weighted manifolds, which depends on the Euler-Lagrange dynamics on a single energy level. By generalizing Klartag's needle decomposition technique to the Lagrangian setting, we prove that this curvature-dimension condition is equivalent to displacement convexity of entropy along cost-minimizing interpolations in an $L^1$ sense, and that it implies various consequences of lower Ricci curvature bounds, as in the metric setting. As examples we consider classical and isotropic Lagrangians on Riemannian manifolds. In particular, we generalize the horocyclic Brunn-Minkowski inequality to complex hyperbolic space of arbitrary dimension, and present a new Brunn-Minkowski inequality for contact magnetic geodesics on odd-dimensional spheres.</description>

      <title>$p$-Poincar\'e inequalities and cutoff Sobolev inequalities on metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $p\in(1,+\infty)$, we introduce the cutoff Sobolev inequality on general metric measure spaces, and prove that there exists a metric measure space endowed with a $p$-energy that satisfies the chain condition, the volume regular condition with respect to a doubling scaling function $\Phi$, and that both the Poincar\'e inequality and the the cutoff Sobolev inequality with respect to a doubling scaling function $\Psi$ hold if and only if $$\frac{1}{C}\left(\frac{R}{r}\right)^p\le\frac{\Psi(R)}{\Psi(r)}\le C\left(\frac{R}{r}\right)^{p-1}\frac{\Phi(R)}{\Phi(r)}\text{ for any }r\le R.$$ In particular, given any pair of doubling functions $\Phi$ and $\Psi$ satisfying the above inequality, we construct a metric measure space endowed with a $p$-energy on which all the above conditions are satisfied. As a direct corollary, we prove that there exists a metric measure space which is $d_h$-Ahlfors regular and has $p$-walk dimension $\beta_p$ if and only if $$p\le\beta_p\le d_h+(p-1).$$ Our proof builds on the Laakso-type space theory, which was recently developed by Murugan (arXiv:2410.15611).</description>
