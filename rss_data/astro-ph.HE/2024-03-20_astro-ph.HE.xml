      <title>Discoveries and Timing of Pulsars in M62</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using MeerKAT, we have discovered three new millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in the bulge globular cluster M62: M62H, M62I, and M62J. All three are in binary systems, which means all ten known pulsars in the cluster are in binaries. M62H has a planetary-mass companion with a median mass $M_{\rm c,med} \sim 3$ M$_{\rm J}$ and a mean density of $\rho \sim 11$ g cm$^{-3}$. M62I has an orbital period of 0.51 days and a $M_{\rm c,med} \sim 0.15$ M$_{\odot}$. Neither of these low-mass systems exhibit eclipses. M62J has only been detected in the two UHF band (816 MHz) observations with a flux density $S_{816} = 0.08$ mJy. The non-detection in the L-band (1284 MHz) indicates it has a relatively steep spectrum ($\beta &lt; -3.1$). We also present 23-yr-long timing solutions obtained using data from the Parkes "Murriyang", Effelsberg and MeerKAT telescopes for the six previously known pulsars. For all these pulsars, we measured the second spin-period derivatives and the rate of change of orbital period caused by the gravitational field of the cluster, and their proper motions. From these measurements, we conclude that the pulsars' maximum accelerations are consistent with the maximum cluster acceleration assuming a core-collapsed mass distribution. Studies of the eclipses of the redback M62B and the black widow M62E at four and two different frequency bands, respectively, reveal a frequency dependence with longer and asymmetric eclipses at lower frequencies. The presence of only binary MSPs in this cluster challenges models which suggest that the MSP population of core-collapsed clusters should be dominated by isolated MSPs.</description>

      <title>Broadband X-ray/UV/optical time-resolved spectroscopy of NGC 5548: The origin of the UV/optical variability in active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been subject to long X-rays/UV/optical monitoring campaigns. These campaigns reveal a strong correlation between the various UV and optical bands, with time lags increasing with wavelength. In a series of papers, we demonstrated that a scenario in which a central X-ray source illuminates the accretion disc explains the observed correlations. However, some of the monitored AGN show low/moderate X-rays-UV correlations, which could challenge this scenario. In this paper, we study the broadband X-ray/UV/optical spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of NGC 5548, one of the most intensively monitored AGN. We aim to test if the X-ray illumination model explains the broadband spectral behaviour of the source, despite the moderate X-ray-UV/optical correlation. We model the broadband time-averaged SED, from the STORM monitoring campaign of the source, using the KYNSED model which assumes an X-ray illuminated disc. We assume that the accretion process powers the X-ray corona. We also model 15 time-resolved SEDs from the same campaign to check whether this scenario can account for the observed spectral variability. The proposed model describes well the time-averaged and the time-resolved SEDs of NGC 5548. In this scenario, the corona height, the X-ray photon index, and the power transferred to the corona all vary. This explains the variability behaviour at different wavelengths. The best-fit model is obtained for a non-rotating black hole accreting at a constant rate of 5% its Eddington limit. Since each of the variable parameters affects the observed flux in a particular way, the combined variability of all parameters explains the moderate X-ray-UV/optical correlation. The X-ray illuminated disc model provides a complete description of the behaviour of NGC 5548, explaining its broadband SEDs, time-lag spectrum, and its power spectral distribution.</description>

      <title>Measurement of anisotropies in Supernova Remnant observations and their interpretation using numerical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova remnants (SNRs) exhibit varying degrees of anisotropy, which have been extensively modeled using numerical methods. We implement a technique to measure anisotropies in SNRs by calculating power spectra from their high-resolution images. To test this technique, we develop 3D hydrodynamical models of supernova remnants and generate synthetic x-ray images from them. Power spectra extracted from both the 3D models and the synthetic images exhibit the same dominant angular scale, which separates large scale features from small scale features due to hydrodynamic instabilities. The angular power spectrum at small length scales during relatively early times is too steep to be consistent with Kolmogorov turbulence, but it transitions to Kolmogorov turbulence at late times. As an example of how this technique can be applied to observations, we extract a power spectrum from a \textit{Chandra} observation of Tycho's SNR and compare with our models. Our predicted power spectrum picks out the angular scale of Tycho's fleece-like structures and also agrees with the small-scale power seen in Tycho. We use this to extract an estimate for the density of the circumstellar gas ($n \sim 0.28/\mathrm{cm^3}$), consistent with previous measurements of this density by other means. The power spectrum also provides an estimate of the density profile of the outermost ejecta. Moreover, we observe additional power at large scales which may provide important clues about the explosion mechanism itself.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous NICER and NuSTAR observations of the Ultraluminous source NGC 4190 ULX-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an X-ray analysis of three different XMM-Newton observations together with simultaneous NICER and NuSTAR observations of the ultraluminous X-ray source NGC 4190 ULX-1. Our goal is to constrain the structure of the accretion disk and the geometrical properties of the source. We performed a temporal and spectral analyses in the 0.4--30 keV energy range where the source is significantly detected in dedicated XMM-Newton, NICER and NuSTAR observations. The temporal analysis shows no flaring activity in the light curves. No pulsation is detected throughout. The source exhibits a typical ULX spectrum, which can be fitted with two thermal blackbody components plus a Comptonization tail at high energies. The luminosity-temperature relation of each thermal spectral component is consistent with the $L \propto T^{2}$ relation expected from an advection-dominated supercritical disk. We interpret these results as a super-Eddington accreting black hole seen almost face-on. A dense wind ejected from the disk obscures the central source, and a hot electron plasma is evacuated through the funnel formed above the hole. Geometric beaming is responsible for the ULX soft emission, whereas the hard tail is the result of Comptonization of soft photons by the electrons ejected through the funnel.</description>

      <title>Search for GeV gamma-ray emission from the possible TeV-bright red dwarfs with Fermi-LAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Red dwarfs have been suggested to be among the possible astrophysical species accelerating particles and emitting TeV $\gamma$-rays. As an effort to search for the GeV $\gamma$-ray counterparts of the suggested TeV emission from eight red dwarfs, we analyse the 0.2--500 GeV $\gamma$-ray emission of the regions covering them exploiting the $\sim$13.6 yr Pass 8 data of the Fermi Large Area Telescope. A GeV $\gamma$-ray emission excess with significance of 3.8$\sigma$ is detected in the direction of the red dwarf V962 Tau. This emission contains V962 Tau in 1$\sigma$ error radius and is independent of the catalog source. However, the stellar flare scenario can hardly explain the total energy and lightcurve derived from the $\gamma$-ray emission in view of the spectral analysis. We also analyse the lightcurves in the positions of the eight red dwarfs and no time bin with significance $&gt;$5$\sigma$ is found. Therefore, no significant emission from the red dwarfs could be concluded to be detected by Fermi-LAT.</description>

      <title>Spectrum and extension of the inverse-Compton emission of the Crab Nebula from a combined Fermi-LAT and H.E.S.S. analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Crab Nebula is a unique laboratory for studying the acceleration of electrons and positrons through their non-thermal radiation. Observations of very-high-energy $\gamma$ rays from the Crab Nebula have provided important constraints for modelling its broadband emission. We present the first fully self-consistent analysis of the Crab Nebula's $\gamma$-ray emission between 1 GeV and $\sim$100 TeV, that is over five orders of magnitude in energy. Using the open-source software package Gammapy, we combine 11.4 yr of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope and 80 h of High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) data at the event level and provide a measurement of the spatial extension of the nebula and its energy spectrum. We find evidence for a shrinking of the nebula with increasing $\gamma$-ray energy. Furthermore, we fit several phenomenological models to the measured data, finding that none of them can fully describe the spatial extension and the spectral energy distribution at the same time. Especially the extension measured at TeV energies appears too large when compared to the X-ray emission. Our measurements probe the structure of the magnetic field between the pulsar wind termination shock and the dust torus, and we conclude that the magnetic field strength decreases with increasing distance from the pulsar. We complement our study with a careful assessment of systematic uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Observation of spectral lines in the exceptional GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the brightest gamma-ray burst ever observed, GRB 221009A provided a precious opportunity to explore spectral line features. In this paper, we performed a comprehensive spectroscopy analysis of GRB 221009A jointly with GECAM-C and Fermi/GBM data to search for emission and absorption lines. For the first time we investigated the line feature throughout this GRB including the most bright part where many instruments suffered problems, and identified prominent emission lines in multiple time intervals. The central energy of the Gaussian emission line evolves from about 37 MeV to 6 MeV, with a nearly constant ratio (about 10\%) between the line width and central energy. Particularly, we find that both the central energy and the energy flux of the emission line evolve with time as a power law decay with power law index of -1 and -2 respectively. We suggest that the observed emission lines most likely originate from the blue-shifted electron positron pair annihilation 511 keV line. We find that a standard high latitude emission scenario cannot fully interpret the observation, thus we propose that the emission line comes from some dense clumps with electron positron pairs traveling together with the jet. In this scenario, we can use the emission line to directly, for the first time, measure the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet ($\Gamma$) and reveal its time evolution (i.e. $\Gamma \sim t^{-1}$) during the prompt emission. Interestingly, we find that the flux of the annihilation line in the co-moving frame keeps constant. These discoveries of the spectral line features shed new and important lights on the physics of GRB and relativistic jet.</description>

      <title>Evolution and distribution of superbubbles in simulated Milky Way-like galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar feedback plays a crucial role in regulating baryon cycles of a galactic ecosystem, and may manifest itself in the formation of superbubbles in the interstellar medium. In this work, we used a set of high-resolution simulations to systematically study the properties and evolution of superbubbles in galactic environments. The simulations were based on the SMUGGLE galaxy formation framework using the hydrodynamical moving-mesh code Arepo, reaching a spatial resolution of $\sim 4 \, \rm pc$ and mass resolution of $\sim 10^3 \, \rm M_{\odot}$. We identified superbubbles and tracked their time evolution using the parent stellar associations within the bubbles. The X-ray luminosity-size distribution of superbubbles in the fiducial run is largely consistent with the observations of nearby galaxies. The size of superbubbles shows a double-peaked distribution, with the peaks attributed to early feedback (radiative and stellar wind feedback) and supernova feedback. The early feedback tends to suppress the subsequent supernova feedback, and it is strongly influenced by star formation efficiency, which regulates the environmental density. Our results show that the volume filling factor of hot gas ($T &gt; 10^{5.5} ~\mathrm{K}$) is about $12 \%$ averaged over a region of 4 kpc in height and 20 kpc in radius centered on the disk of the galaxy. Overall, the properties of superbubbles are sensitive to the choice of subgrid galaxy formation models and can, therefore, be used to constrain these models.</description>

Abstract: Stellar multiplicity is among the oldest and richest problems in astrophysics. Binary stars are a cornerstone of stellar mass and radius measurements that underpin modern stellar evolutionary models. Binaries are the progenitors of many of the most interesting and exotic astrophysical phenomena, ranging from type Ia supernovae to gamma ray bursts, hypervelocity stars, and most detectable stellar black holes. They are also ubiquitous, accounting for about half of all stars in the Universe. In the era of gravitational waves, wide-field surveys, and open-source stellar models, binaries are coming back stronger than a nineties trend. Much of the progress in the last decade has been enabled by the Gaia mission, which provides high-precision astrometry for more than a billion stars in the Milky Way. The Gaia data probe a wider range of binary separations and mass ratios than most previous surveys, enabling both an improved binary population census and discovery of rare objects. I summarize recent results in the study of binary stars brought about by Gaia, focusing in particular on developments related to wide ($a \gtrsim 100$ au) binaries, evidence of binarity from astrometric noise and proper motion anomaly, astrometric and radial velocity orbits from Gaia DR3, and binaries containing non-accreting compact objects. Limitations of the Gaia data, the importance of ground-based follow-up, and anticipated improvements with Gaia DR4 are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Induced Supernovae Cooling: New Contribution from Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact stellar objects like supernovae and neutron stars are believed to cool by emitting axions predominantly via axion bremsstrahlung ($NN \to NNa$), pion conversion ($\pi^- p^+ \to N a$) and photo-production ($\gamma N \to N a$). In this $\textit{letter}$, we study a previously overlooked contribution to the photo-production channel, originating from the $\textit{unavoidable}$ anomaly-induced Wess-Zumino-Witten term $\propto \epsilon^{\mu \nu \alpha \beta}\, F_{\mu \nu}\, \partial_\alpha a \, \omega_\beta$. As a result, supernovae can cool up to three times faster than what was previously thought, translating into stronger bounds on the axion decay constant. Furthermore, the spectrum of axions emitted in the process is $\textit unique$ as it is significantly harder than those originating from bremsstrahlung. As a consequence, we find that these axions are more likely to show up in near future water Cherenkov detectors as compared to traditional ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A dense neutrino gas exhibiting angular crossings in the electron lepton number is unstable and develops fast flavor conversions. Instead of assuming an unstable configuration from the onset, we imagine that the system is externally driven toward instability. We use the simplest model of two neutrino beams initially of different flavor that either suddenly appear or one or both slowly build up. Flavor conversions commence well before the putative unstable state is fully attained, and the final outcome depends on how the system is driven. Our results suggest that in an astrophysical setting, one should focus less on flavor instabilities in the neutrino radiation field and more on the external dynamics that leads to the formation of the unstable state.</description>

Abstract: The Amaterasu cosmic ray particle appears to have come from the direction of the local cosmic void. We take this as evidence that it is a magnetic monopole rather than a proton or nucleus. This in turn strongly suggests physics at high energy is described by a quiver gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Investigation of non-equilibrium ionization plasma during a giant flare of UX Arietis triggered with MAXI and observed with NICER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We detected a giant X-ray flare from the RS-CVn type binary star UX Ari using MAXI on 2020 August 17 and started a series of NICER observations 89 minutes later. For a week, the entire duration of the flare was covered with 32 snapshot observations including the rising phase. The X-ray luminosity reached 2$\times$10$^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and the entire energy release was $\sim 10^{38}$ erg in the 0.5--8.0~keV band. X-ray spectra characterized by continuum emission with lines of Fe XXV He$\alpha$ and Fe XXVI Ly$\alpha$ were obtained. We found that the temperature peaks before that of the flux, which suggests that the period of plasma formation in the magnetic flare loop was captured. Using the continuum information (temperature, flux, and their delay time), we estimated the flare loop size to be $\sim 3 \times 10^{11}$ cm and the peak electron density to be $\sim 4\times10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$. Furthermore, using the line ratio of Fe XXV and Fe XXVI, we investigated any potential indications of deviation from collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE). The X-ray spectra were consistent with CIE plasma throughout the flare, but the possibility of an ionizing plasma away from CIE was not rejected in the flux rising phase.</description>

      <title>Slowly decaying ringdown of a rapidly spinning black hole II: Inferring the masses and spins of supermassive black holes with LISA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic observations reveal that almost all galaxies have supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at their centers, but their properties, especially their spins, are not fully understood. Some of the authors have recently shown [Oshita and Tsuna (2023)] that rapid spins of $&gt;0.9$, inferred for masses around $10^7\ M_\odot$ from observations of local SMBHs and cosmological simulations, source {\it long-lived} ringdowns that enhance the precision of black hole spectroscopy to test gravity in the near-extreme Kerr spacetime. In this work, we estimate the statistical errors in the SMBH mass-spin inference in anticipation of the LISA's detection of extreme mass-ratio mergers. We show that for rapidly spinning SMBHs, more precise mass and spin measurements are expected due to the excitations of higher angular modes. For a near-extremal SMBH of mass $10^7M_\odot$ merging with a smaller BH with mass ratio $10^{-3}$ at a luminosity distance of $\lesssim 10\:\mathrm{Gpc}$ (redshift $z \lesssim 1.37$), the measurement errors in the mass and spin of the SMBH would be $\sim 1\:\mathrm{\%}$ and $\sim 10^{-1}\:\mathrm{\%}$ respectively.</description>

      <title>H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ a Galactic Low Energy Cosmic Rays tracer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Investigating the diagnostic power of H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ Charge-Exchange (CE) emission as Low-Energy Galactic Cosmic Rays(LECRs) tracer in diffuse regions. Aims. In this work, we define and test a spectroscopic indicator of CE reactions between LECRs protons and neutral hydrogen atoms of the diffuse medium. This indicator can be used for mapping LECRs density in diffuse clouds and can lead to the identification of new LECRs sources as we expect density variations caused by the distance between an observed cloud and the nearest site of particle acceleration. We also lay the foundations for the definition of a photometric indicator to be used in the next full-sky photometric surveys such as the Vera Rubin 10-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Methods. Based on literature cross-sections, we calculate H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ line profile ratio in the case of CE and compare it with the recombination ratio. We then test our results on the Balmer-dominated filaments of the SNR RCW 86 and we explore how the spectroscopic constraints can turn into a photometric indicator based on colour indices. Results. We find that, in shocked environments, CE between LECRS and neutral hydrogen become the dominant process for Balmer lines emission. The hydrogen spectroscopic emission is expected to be modified, with respect to the recombination Balmer decrement,to result in double the H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ with respect to a similar but quiescent region. The test on the known Balmer-dominated filaments of the SNR RCW 86 confirm the efficiency of our spectroscopic indicator. Therefore we explore possible conversions of the spectroscopic indicator into colour indices combinations. This is the first step toward the definition and test of a photometric indicator for tracing LECRs to be applied in the LSST pipelines to photometrically identify new LECRs accelerators in the whole Galaxy.</description>

      <title>General properties of the electric Penrose process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Penrose process with the charged particles in the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m background. Let parent particle 0 decay to particles 1 and 2. With the assumption that all three particles move in the same plane, the exact formulas for characteristics of particles 1 and 2 in terms of those of particle 0 are derived. We concentrate on scenarios in which particle 1 and 2 are ejected along the trajectory of particle 0. It is shown that such scenarios correspond to the extrema of energies $E_{1}$ or $E_{2}$ of daughter particles with respect to the angular momentum $L_{1}$ or $L_{2}$ of one of them. We derive bounds on the values of angular momenta $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$. We give classification of these scenarios and discuss their properties including decay in the near-horizon region. The results are reformulated in terms of velocities of daughter particles in the center of mass frame. The approach is applicable also to collisional Penrose process, in which a combination of particles 1 and 2 is considered as one effective particle. If the mass of particle 0 $m_{0}\rightarrow \infty $, the situation corresponds to the Ba\~{n}ados-Silk-West effect, the results agree with the ones known in literature before. In addition, we consider special cases when decay occurs in the turning point for one or all three particles.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the abundance pattern and charge-exchange emission in the M82 centre</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interstellar medium (ISM) in starburst galaxies contains plenty of chemical elements synthesised by core-collapse supernova explosions. By measuring the abundances of these metals, we can study the chemical enrichment within galaxies and the transportation of metals into circumgalactic environments through powerful outflows. We perform the spectral analysis of the X-ray emissions from the M82 core using the Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) onboard XMM-Newton to accurately estimate the metal abundances in the ISM. We analyse over 300 ks of RGS data observed with fourteen position angles, covering an 80 arcsec cross-dispersion width. We employ multi-temperature thermal plasma components in collisional ionisation equilibrium (CIE) to reproduce the observed spectra, each exhibiting different spatial broadenings. The O vii band CCD image shows a broader distribution compared to those for O viii and Fe-L bands. The O viii line profiles have a prominent double-peaked structure, corresponding to the northward and southward outflows. The O vii triplet feature exhibits marginal peaks, and a single CIE component, convolved with the O vii band image, approximately reproduces the spectral shape. Combining a CIE model with a charge-exchange emission model also successfully reproduces the O vii line profiles. However, the ratio of these two components varies significantly with the observed position angles, which is physically implausible. Spectral fitting of the broadband spectra suggests a multi-temperature phase in the ISM, approximated by three components at 0.1, 0.4, and 0.7 keV. Notably, the 0.1 keV component exhibits a broader distribution than the 0.4 and 0.7 keV plasmas. The derived abundance pattern shows super-solar N/O, solar Ne/O and Mg/O, and half-solar Fe/O ratios. These results indicate the chemical enrichments by core-collapse supernovae in starburst galaxies.</description>

      <title>The physics of Core-Collapse Supernovae: explosion mechanism and explosive nucleosynthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in multi-dimensional simulations of core-collapse supernovae have considerably improved our understanding of this complex phenomenon. In addition to that, one-dimensional (1D) studies have been employed to study the explosion mechanism and its causal connection to the pre-collapse structure of the star, as well as to explore the vast parameter space of supernovae. Nonetheless, many uncertainties still affect the late stages of the evolution of massive stars, their collapse, and the subsequent shock propagation. In this review, we will briefly summarize the state-of-the-art of both 1D and 3D simulations and how they can be employed to study the evolution of massive stars, supernova explosions, and shock propagation, focusing on the uncertainties that affect each of these phases. Finally, we will illustrate the typical nucleosynthesis products that emerge from the explosion.</description>

      <title>Eccentric black hole mergers via three-body interactions in young, globular, and nuclear star clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eccentric mergers are a signature of the dynamical formation channel of binary black holes (BBHs) in dense stellar environments and hierarchical triple systems. Here, we investigate the formation of eccentric mergers via binary-single interactions by means of $2.5\times10^{5}$ direct $\textit{N}$-body simulations. Our simulations include post-Newtonian terms up to the 2.5th order and model the typical environment of young (YSCs), globular (GCs), and nuclear star clusters (NSCs). Around $0.6\%$ ($1\%$) of our mergers in NSCs (GCs) have an eccentricity ${&gt;0.1}$ when the emitted gravitational wave frequency is 10 Hz in the source frame, while in YSCs this fraction rises to $1.6\%$. Approximately $\sim63\%$ of these mergers are produced by chaotic, resonant interactions where temporary binaries are continuously formed and destroyed, while $\sim31\%$ arise from an almost direct collision of two black holes (BHs). Lastly, $\sim 6\%$ of these eccentric mergers occur in temporary hierarchical triples. We find that binaries undergoing a flyby generally develop smaller tilt angles with respect to exchanges. This result challenges the idea that perfectly isotropic spin orientations are produced by dynamics. The environment dramatically affects BH retention: $0\%$, $3.1\%$, and $19.9\%$ of all the remnant BHs remain in YSCs, GCs, and NSCs, respectively. The fraction of massive BHs also depends on the host cluster properties, with pair-instability ($60\leq\,$M$_{\rm BH}$/M$_{\odot}\leq$100) and intermediate-mass (M$_{\rm BH}\geq$100$\,$M$_{\odot}$) BHs accounting for approximately $\sim44\%$ and $1.6\%$ of the mergers in YSCs, $\sim33\%$ and $0.7\%$ in GCs, and $\sim28\%$ and $0.4\%$ in NSCs, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04680v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong evidence for the Helling-Downs correlation curves have been reported by multiple pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations in middle 2023. In this work, we investigate the graviton mass bounds by analyzing the observational data of the overlap ruduction functions from the NANOGrav 15-year data release and CPTA first data release. The results from our data analysis display the state-of-the-art upper limits on the graviton mass at 90\% confidence level, namely, $m_{g}\lesssim8.6\times10^{-24}\mathrm{eV}$ from NANOGrav and $m_{g}\lesssim3.8\times10^{-23}\mathrm{eV}$ from CPTA. We also study the cosmic-variance limit on the graviton mass bounds, i.e., $\sigma_{m_{g}}^{\mathrm{CV}}=4.8\times10^{-24}\mathrm{eV}\times f/(10~\mathrm{year})^{-1}$, with $f$ being a typical frequency band of PTA observations. This is equivalent to the cosmic-variance limit on the speed of gravitational waves, i.e., $\sigma_{v_{g}}^{\mathrm{CV}}=0.07c$, with $c$ being the speed of light. Moreover, we discuss potential implications of these results for scenarios of ultralight tensor dark matter.</description>

      <title>Generation of photoionized plasmas in the laboratory of relevance to accretion-powered x-ray sources using keV line radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe laboratory experiments to generate X-ray photoionized plasmas of relevance to accretion-powered X-ray sources such as neutron star binaries and quasars, with significant improvements over previous work. A key quantity is referenced, namely the photoionization parameter. This is normally meaningful in an astrophysical steady-state context, but is also commonly used in the literature as a figure of merit for laboratory experiments that are, of necessity, time-dependent. We demonstrate emission-weighted values of {\xi} &gt; 50 ergcm/s using laser-plasma X-ray sources, with higher results at the centre of the plasma which are in the regime of interest for several astrophysical scenarios. Comparisons of laboratory experiments with astrophysical codes are always limited, principally by the many orders of magnitude differences in time and spatial scales, but also other plasma parameters. However useful checks on performance can often be made for a limited range of parameters. For example, we show that our use of a keV line source, rather than the quasi-blackbody radiation fields normally employed in such experiments, has allowed the generation of the ratio of inner-shell to outer-shell photoionization expected from a blackbody source with ~keV spectral temperature. We compare calculations from our in-house plasma modelling code with those from Cloudy and find moderately good agreement for the time evolution of both electron temperature and average ionisation. However, a comparison of code predictions for a K-beta argon X-ray spectrum with experimental data reveals that our Cloudy simulation overestimates the intensities of more highly ionised argon species. This is not totally surprising as the Cloudy model was generated for a single set of plasma conditions, while the experimental data are spatially integrated.</description>

      <title>Bright Supernova Precursors by Outbursts from Massive Stars with Compact Object Companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fraction of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) with signs of interaction with a dense circumstellar matter are preceded by bright precursor emission. While the precursors are likely caused by a mass ejection before core-collapse, their mechanism to power energetic bursts, sometimes reaching $10^{48}$--$10^{49}\ {\rm erg}$ that are larger than the binding energies of red supergiant envelopes, is still under debate. Remarkably, such a huge energy-deposition should result in an almost complete envelope ejection and hence a strong sign of interaction, but the observed SNe with precursors show in fact typical properties among the interacting SNe. More generally, the observed luminosity of $10^{40-42}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$ is shown to be challenging for a single SN progenitor. To resolve these tensions, we propose a scenario where the progenitor is in a binary system with a compact object (CO), and an outburst from the star leads to a super-Eddington accretion onto the CO. We show that for sufficiently short separations, outbursts with moderate initial kinetic energies of $10^{46}$--$10^{47}$ erg can be energized by the accreting CO so that their radiative output can be consistent with the observed precursors. We discuss the implications of our model in relation to CO binaries detectable with Gaia and gravitational wave detectors.</description>

Abstract: NGC 1566 is known for exhibiting recurrent outbursts, which are accompanied by changes in spectral type. The most recent transient event occurred from 2017 to 2019 and was reported to be accompanied by a change in Seyfert classification from Seyfert 1.8 to Seyfert 1.2. We analyze data from an optical spectroscopic variability campaign of NGC 1566 taken with the 9.2m SALT between July 2018 and October 2019 and supplement our data set with optical to near-infrared spectroscopic archival data taken by VLT/MUSE in September 2015 and October 2017. We observe the emergence and fading of a strong power-law-like blue continuum as well as strong variations in the Balmer, HeI, HeII lines and the coronal lines [FeVII], [FeX] and [FeXI]. Moreover, we detect broad double-peaked emission line profiles of OI 8446 and the CaII 8498,8542,8662 triplet. This is the first time that genuine double-peaked OI 8446 and CaII 8498,8542,8662 emission in AGN is reported in the literature. All broad lines show a clear redward asymmetry with respect to their central wavelength and we find indications for a significant blueward drift of the total line profiles during the transient event. We show that the double-peaked emission line profiles are well approximated by emission from a low-inclination, relativistic eccentric accretion disk, and that single-peaked profiles can be obtained by broadening due to scale-height dependent turbulence. Small-scale features in the OI and CaII lines suggest the presence of inhomogeneities in the broad-line region. We conclude that the broad-line region in NGC 1566 is dominated by the kinematics of a relativistic eccentric accretion disk. The broad-line region can be modeled to be vertically stratified with respect to scale-height turbulence. The observed blueward drift might be attributed to a low-optical-depth wind launched during the transient event.</description>

      <title>Cyclotron line evolution revealed with pulse-to-pulse analysis in the 2020 outburst of 1A 0535+262</title>

Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the X-ray luminosity (Lx) dependence of the cyclotron absorption line energy (Ecyc) for the X-ray binary pulsar 1A 0535+262 during its 2020 giant outburst based on pulse-to-pulse analysis. By applying this technique to high cadence observations of Insight-HXMT, we reveal the most comprehensive Ecyc-Lx correlation across a broad luminosity range of ~(0.03-1.3)*10^38 erg/s. Apart from the positive and negative correlations between cyclotron line energy and luminosity at Lx~(1-3)*10^37 erg/s and ~(7-13)*10^37 erg/s, which are expected from the typical subcritical and supercritical accretion regimes, respectively, a plateau in the correlation is also detected at ~(3-7)*10^37 erg/s^-1. Moreover, at the lowest luminosity level (Lx&lt;10^37 erg/s), the positive Ecyc-Lx correlation seems to be broken, and the pulse profile also occurs a significant transition. These discoveries provide the first complete view on the correlation between luminosity and the centriod energy of the cyclotron line, and therefore are relevant for understanding how accretion onto magnetized neutron stars depends on luminosity.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter (H)eats Young Planets</title>

Abstract: We study the effect of dark matter annihilation on the formation of Jovian planets. We show that dark matter heat injections can slow or halt Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction, preventing the accretion of hydrogen and helium onto the solid core. The existence of Jupiter in our solar system can therefore be used to infer constraints on dark matter with relatively strong interaction cross sections. In the case of spin-dependent dark matter, we derive novel constraints beyond the reach of current direct detection experiments. We highlight the possibility of a positive detection using future observations by JWST, which could reveal strongly varying planet morpholoiges close to our Galactic Center.</description>

      <title>Stimulated decay of collapsing axion stars and fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radiation mechanism of fast radio bursts (FRBs) has been extensively studied but still remains elusive. In the search for dark matter candidates, the QCD axion and axionlike particles (ALPs) have emerged as prominent possibilities. These elusive particles can aggregate into dense structures called axion stars through Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). Such axion stars could constitute a significant portion of the mysterious dark matter in the universe. When these axion stars grow beyond a critical mass, usually through processes like accretion or merging, they undergo a self-driven collapse. Traditionally, for spherically symmetric axion clumps, the interaction between axions and photons does not lead to parametric resonance, especially when the QCD axion-photon coupling is at standard levels. Nevertheless, our study indicates that even QCD axion stars with typical coupling values can trigger stimulated decay during their collapse, rather than producing relativistic axions through self-interactions. This process results in short radio bursts, with durations of around 0.1 seconds, and can be potentially observed using radio telescopes like FAST or SKA. Furthermore, we find that collapsing axion stars for ALPs with specific parameters may emit radio bursts lasting just milliseconds with a peak luminosity of $1.60\times10^{42}\rm{erg/s}$, matching the characteristics of the observed non-repeating FRBs.</description>

      <title>From Cavitation to Astrophysics: Explicit Solution of the Spherical Collapse Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential equations of the form $\ddot R=-kR^\gamma$, with a positive constant $k$ and real parameter $\gamma$, are fundamental in describing phenomena such as the spherical gravitational collapse ($\gamma=-2$), the implosion of cavitation bubbles ($\gamma=-4$) and the orbital decay in binary black holes ($\gamma=-7$). While explicit elemental solutions exist for select integer values of $\gamma$, more comprehensive solutions encompassing larger subsets of $\gamma$ have been independently developed in hydrostatics (see Lane-Emden equation) and hydrodynamics (see Rayleigh-Plesset equation). I here present a universal explicit solution for all real $\gamma$, invoking the beta distribution. Although standard numerical ODE solvers can readily evaluate more general second order differential equations, this explicit solution reveals a hidden connection between collapse motions and probability theory that enables further analytical manipulations, it conceptually unifies distinct fields, and it offers insights into symmetry properties, thereby enhancing our understanding of these pervasive differential equations.</description>

      <title>A Short Intense Dynamo at the Onset of Crystallization in White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03639v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of large magnetic fields ($\gtrsim 10^6~\mathrm{G}$) in isolated white dwarfs is not clear. One possible explanation is that crystallization of the star's core drives compositional convection, which when combined with the star's rotation, can drive a dynamo. However, whether convection is efficient enough to explain the large intensity of the observed magnetic fields is still under debate. Recent work has shown that convection in cooling white dwarfs spans two regimes: efficient convection at the onset of crystallization, and thermohaline convection during most of the star's cooling history. Here, we calculate the properties of crystallization-driven convection for cooling models of several white dwarfs of different masses. We combine mixing-length theory with scalings from magneto-rotational convection to estimate the typical magnitude of the convective velocity and induced magnetic field for both scenarios. In the thermohaline regime, we find velocities $\sim 10^{-6}$--$10^{-5}~\mathrm{cm~s^{-1}}$, with fields restricted to $\lesssim~100~\mathrm{G}$. However, when convection is efficient, the flow velocity can reach magnitudes of $\sim 10^2$--$10^3~\mathrm{cm~s^{-1}}$, with fields of $\sim 10^6$--$10^8~\mathrm{G}$, independent of the star's rotation rate. Thus, dynamos driven at the onset of crystallization could explain the large intensity magnetic fields measured for single white dwarfs.</description>
