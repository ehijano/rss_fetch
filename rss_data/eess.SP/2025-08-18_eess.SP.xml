      <title>Distributed Integrated Sensing, Localization, and Communications over LEO Satellite Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations are rapidly becoming essential enablers of next-generation wireless systems, offering global broadband access, high-precision localization, and reliable sensing beyond terrestrial coverage. However, the inherent limitations of individual LEO satellites, including restricted power, limited antenna aperture, and constrained onboard processing, hinder their ability to meet the growing demands of 6G applications. To address these challenges, this article introduces the concept of distributed integrated sensing, localization, and communication (DISLAC) over LEO constellations, inspired by distributed multiple input multiple output architectures. By enabling inter-satellite cooperation through inter-satellite links, DISLAC can substantially improve throughput, positioning accuracy, and sensing robustness. We present illustrative case studies that quantify these benefits and analyze key system-level considerations, including synchronization, antenna reconfigurability, and ISL design. The article concludes by outlining open research directions to advance the practical deployment of DISLAC in future non-terrestrial networks.</description>

      <title>Multi-Satellite Cooperative MIMO Transmission: Statistical CSI-Aware RSMA Precoding Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate inter-satellite cooperative transmission in a multiple low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication system to enhance spectral efficiency. Specifically, we design multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) precoding at LEO satellites for cooperative rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). Given the difficulty of acquiring instantaneous channel state information (iCSI) due to long delays and Doppler effects, we formulate an ergodic max-min fairness rate (MMFR) maximization problem based on statistical CSI (sCSI). To address the challenge of ergodic rate evaluation, we approximate the problem using closed-form upper bounds and develop a weighted minimum mean squared error-based algorithm to obtain a stationary point. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed sCSI-based RSMA scheme approaches iCSI-based performance and significantly outperforms conventional space-division multiple access.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Variable-Width Beam Coverage and Codebook Design for XL-RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To mitigate the issue of limited base station coverage caused by severe high-frequency electromagnetic wave attenuation, Extremely Large Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (XL-RIS) has garnered significant attention due to its high beam gain. However, XL-RIS exhibits a narrower beam width compared to traditional RIS, which increases the complexity of beam alignment and broadcast. To address this problem, we propose a variable-width beam generation algorithm under the near-field assumption and apply it to the near-field codebook design for XL-RIS. Our algorithm can achieve beam coverage for arbitrarily shaped codeword regions and generate a joint codebook for the multi-XL-RIS system. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme enables user equipment (UE) to achieve higher spectral efficiency and lower communication outage probability within the codeword region compared to existing works. Furthermore, our scheme exhibits better robustness to codeword region location and area variations.</description>

      <title>KAN-HAR: A Human activity recognition based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a critical role in numerous applications, including healthcare monitoring, fitness tracking, and smart environments. Traditional deep learning (DL) approaches, while effective, often require extensive parameter tuning and may lack interpretability. In this work, we investigate the use of a single three-axis accelerometer and the Kolmogorov--Arnold Network (KAN) for HAR tasks, leveraging its ability to model complex nonlinear relationships with improved interpretability and parameter efficiency. The MotionSense dataset, containing smartphone-based motion sensor signals across various physical activities, is employed to evaluate the proposed approach. Our methodology involves preprocessing and normalization of accelerometer and gyroscope data, followed by KAN-based feature learning and classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the KAN achieves competitive or superior classification performance compared to conventional deep neural networks, while maintaining a significantly reduced parameter count. This highlights the potential of KAN architectures as an efficient and interpretable alternative for real-world HAR systems. The open-source implementation of the proposed framework is available at the Project's GitHub Repository.</description>

      <title>Enabling low-power massive MIMO with ternary ADCs for AIoT sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of networked devices and the surging demand for ubiquitous intelligence have given rise to the artificial intelligence of things (AIoT). However, the utilization of high-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and numerous radio frequency chains significantly raises power consumption. This paper explores a cost-effective solution using ternary ADCs (T-ADCs) in massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems for low-power AIoT and specifically addresses channel sensing challenges. The channel is first estimated through a pilot-aided scheme and refined using a joint-pilot-and-data (JPD) approach. To assess the performance limits of this two-threshold ADC system, the analysis includes its hardware-ideal counterpart, the parallel one-bit ADCs (PO-ADCs) and a realistic scenario where noise variance is unknown at the receiver is considered. Analytical findings indicate that the JPD scheme effectively mitigates performance degradation in channel estimation due to coarse quantization effects under mild conditions, without necessitating additional pilot overhead. For deterministic and random channels, we propose modified expectation maximization (EM) and variational inference EM estimators, respectively. Extensive simulations validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimators in terms of mean square error and symbol error rate, which showcases the feasibility of implementing T-ADCs and the associated JPD scheme for greener AIoT smart sensing.</description>

      <title>Temporally-Similar Structure-Aware Spatiotemporal Fusion of Satellite Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel spatiotemporal (ST) fusion framework for satellite images, named Temporally-Similar Structure-Aware ST fusion (TSSTF). ST fusion is a promising approach to address the trade-off between the spatial and temporal resolution of satellite images. In real-world scenarios, observed satellite images are severely degraded by noise due to measurement equipment and environmental conditions. Consequently, some recent studies have focused on enhancing the robustness of ST fusion methods against noise. However, existing noise-robust ST fusion approaches often fail to capture fine spatial structure, leading to oversmoothing and artifacts. To address this issue, TSSTF introduces two key mechanisms: Temporally-Guided Total Variation (TGTV) and Temporally-Guided Edge Constraint (TGEC). TGTV is a novel regularization function that promotes spatial piecewise smoothness while preserving structural details, guided by a reference high spatial resolution image acquired on a nearby date. TGEC enforces consistency in edge locations between two temporally adjacent images, while allowing for spectral variations. We formulate the ST fusion task as a constrained optimization problem incorporating TGTV and TGEC, and develop an efficient algorithm based on a preconditioned primal-dual splitting method. Experimental results demonstrate that TSSTF performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods under noise-free conditions and outperforms them under noisy conditions. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive set of recommended parameter values that consistently yield high performance across diverse target regions and noise conditions, aiming to enhance reproducibility and practical utility.</description>

      <title>Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Enabled Sensing: Cramer-Rao Bound Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has emerged as a more flexible solution to engineer the wireless propagation channels, thanks to its non-diagonal reflecting matrix. Although the gain of the BD-RIS over the conventional RIS in communication has been revealed in many works, its gain in 6G sensing is still unknown. This motivates us to study the BD-RIS assisted sensing in this letter. Specifically, we derive the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the angle-of-arrival (AOA) from the target to the BD-RIS under the constraint that the BD-RIS scattering matrix is unitary. To minimize the CRB, we develop an optimization scheme based on an adaptive Riemannian steepest ascent algorithm that can satisfy the non-convex unitary constraint. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed BD-RIS-assisted target localization method achieves superior sensing performance.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Rate-CRB Performance for Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Enabled ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter considers a beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where the BD-RIS can help a multi-antenna base station (BS) serve multiple user equipments (UEs) and localize a target simultaneously. We formulate an optimization problem that designs the BS beamforming matrix and the BD-RIS scattering matrix to maximize UEs' sum rate subject to a localization Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) constraint and an additional unitary matrix constraint for the scattering matrix. Because unitary matrices form a manifold, our problem belongs to constrained manifold optimization. This letter proposes a log-barrier based Riemannian steepest ascent method to solve this problem effectively. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of our algorithm and the performance gain of the BD-RIS aided ISAC systems over the conventional RIS aided ISAC systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (MQAM) is a commonly used channel modulation technology in wireless communication systems. To achieve dedicated channel modulation for semantic communication (SemCom), we propose an Important-Bit-Prefixed MQAM (IBP-MQAM) scheme and derive its approximate expression of important symbol error rate (ISER) and unimportant symbol error rate (USER). By extracting and quantifying text semantics using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), we verify that IBP-MQAM achieves improved performance over MQAM in SemCom scenarios and further analyze the effects of key system parameters.</description>

      <title>Importance-Aware Robust Semantic Transmission for LEO Satellite-Ground Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite-ground semantic communication is anticipated to serve a critical role in the forthcoming 6G era. Nonetheless, task-oriented data transmission in such systems remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the dynamic nature of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) fluctuations and the stringent bandwidth limitations inherent to low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite channels. In response to these constraints, we propose an importance-aware robust semantic transmission (IRST) framework, specifically designed for scenarios characterized by bandwidth scarcity and channel variability. The IRST scheme begins by applying a segmentation model enhancement algorithm to improve the granularity and accuracy of semantic segmentation. Subsequently, a task-driven semantic selection method is employed to prioritize the transmission of semantically vital content based on real-time channel state information. Furthermore, the framework incorporates a stack-based, SNR-aware channel codec capable of executing adaptive channel coding in alignment with SNR variations. Comparative evaluations across diverse operating conditions demonstrate the superior performance and resilience of the IRST model relative to existing benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Efficient Artifacts Removal for Adaptive Deep Brain Stimulation and a Temporal Event Localization Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) leverages symptom-related biomarkers to deliver personalized neuromodulation therapy, with the potential to improve treatment efficacy and reduce power consumption compared to conventional DBS. However, stimulation-induced signal contamination remains a major technical barrier to advancing its clinical application. Existing artifact removal strategies, both front-end and back-end, face trade-offs between artifact suppression and algorithmic flexibility. Among back-end algorithms, Shrinkage and Manifold-based Artifact Removal using Template Adaptation (SMARTA) has shown promising performance in mitigating stimulus artifacts with minimal distortion to local field potentials (LFPs), but its high computational demand and inability to handle transient direct current (DC) artifacts limit its use in real-time applications. To address this, we developed SMARTA+, a computationally efficient extension of SMARTA capable of suppressing both stimulus and transient DC artifacts while supporting flexible algorithmic design. We evaluated SMARTA+ using semi-real aDBS data and real data from Parkinson's disease patients. Compared to SMARTA and other established methods, SMARTA+ achieved comparable or superior artifact removal while significantly reducing computation time. It preserved spectral and temporal structures, ranging from beta band to high-frequency oscillations, and demonstrated robustness across diverse stimulation protocols. Temporal event localization analysis further showed improved accuracy in detecting beta bursts. These findings support SMARTA+ as a promising tool for advancing real-time, closed-loop aDBS systems.</description>

      <title>Reducing AoI and Improving Throughput for NOMA-assisted SGF Systems: A Hierarchical Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) assisted semi-grant-free (SGF) framework is proposed to enable channel access for grant-free users (GFUs) by using residual resources from grant-based users. Under this framework, the problem of joint beamforming design and transmission scheduling is formulated to improve the system throughput and reduce the age-of-information of GFUs. The aforementioned problem is transferred into a Markov Decision Process to model the changing environment with the transmission/ waiting/ retransmission of GFUs. In an effort to solve the pertinent problem, firstly, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based transmission scheduling approach is proposed for determining the optimal transmission probability based on the available transmission slots and transmission status of GFUs. Secondly, a hierarchical learning algorithm is proposed to analyze the channel state information of GBUs and the transmission status of GFUs, and to train an upper-level policy based on this analysis for beamforming to achieve efficient grant-based transmission, while a lower-level policy adapts to maximize the utilization of transmission slots allocated by the upper-level agent. The two policies interact to improve channel access and avoid collisions. Numerical results reveal that 1) The DRL based transmission scheduling outperforms existing adaptive and state-dependent baselines in AoI reduction, where an average three-time-slots-earlier-transmission can be obtained compared to the state-dependent choice, and five time slots earlier can be achieved when comparing to the adaptive choice; 2) The hierarchical learning algorithm is able to achieve approximately a 31.82% gain while maintaining the average AoI of GFUs within 1.5 time slots. 3) The effectiveness of the hierarchical learning scheme in NOMA-assisted SGF system is validated across scenarios with GFUs counts from 1-5 times of GBUs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid crystal (LC) technology has emerged as a promising solution for large reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) at millimeter wave (mmWave) bands, offering advantages such as low power consumption, scalability, and continuously tunable phase shifts. For LC-RIS based on the delay-line architecture, i.e., with dedicated phase shifters, there exists a trade-off between the maximum achievable phase-shift range and the corresponding insertion loss, which has not been studied for LC-RIS-assisted wireless systems yet. In this paper, we investigate this trade-off where a base station (BS) and an RIS are configured to minimize the transmit power while satisfying a given quality of service (QoS) for a number of users. Simulation results reveal a fundamental trade-off between the total transmit power and the achievable data rate as a function of the LC phase-shift range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improper sitting posture during prolonged computer use has become a significant public health concern. Traditional posture monitoring solutions face substantial barriers, including privacy concerns with camera-based systems and user discomfort with wearable sensors. This paper presents UWB-PostureGuard, a privacy-preserving ultra-wideband (UWB) sensing system that advances mobile technologies for preventive health management through continuous, contactless monitoring of ergonomic sitting posture. Our system leverages commercial UWB devices, utilizing comprehensive feature engineering to extract multiple ergonomic sitting posture features. We develop PoseGBDT to effectively capture temporal dependencies in posture patterns, addressing limitations of traditional frame-wise classification approaches. Extensive real-world evaluation across 10 participants and 19 distinct postures demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving 99.11% accuracy while maintaining robustness against environmental variables such as clothing thickness, additional devices, and furniture configurations. Our system provides a scalable, privacy-preserving mobile health solution on existing platforms for proactive ergonomic management, improving quality of life at low costs.</description>

      <title>The Role of Entanglement in Quantum Reservoir Computing with Coupled Kerr Nonlinear Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) uses quantum dynamics to efficiently process temporal data. In this work, we investigate a QRC framework based on two coupled Kerr nonlinear oscillators, a system well-suited for time-series prediction tasks due to its complex nonlinear interactions and potentially high-dimensional state space. We explore how its performance in time-series prediction depends on key physical parameters: input drive strength, Kerr nonlinearity, and oscillator coupling, and analyze the role of entanglement in improving the reservoir's computational performance, focusing on its effect on predicting non-trivial time series. Using logarithmic negativity to quantify entanglement and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) to evaluate predictive accuracy, our results suggest that entanglement provides a computational advantage on average-up to a threshold in the input frequency-that persists under some levels of dissipation and dephasing. In particular, we find that higher dissipation rates can enhance performance. While the entanglement advantage manifests as improvements in both average and worst-case performance, it does not lead to improvements in the best-case error. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of quantum reservoirs for high performance, efficient quantum machine learning and time-series forecasting.</description>

      <title>Repetitive TMS-based Identification of Methamphetamine-Dependent Individuals Using EEG Spectra</title>

Abstract: The impact of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on methamphetamine (METH) users' craving levels is often assessed using questionnaires. This study explores the feasibility of using neural signals to obtain more objective results. EEG signals recorded from 20 METH-addicted participants Before and After rTMS (MBT and MAT) and from 20 healthy participants (HC) are analyzed. In each EEG paradigm, participants are shown 15 METH-related and 15 neutral pictures randomly, and the relative band power (RBP) of each EEG sub-band frequency is derived. The average RBP across all 31 channels, as well as individual brain regions, is analyzed. Statistically, MAT's alpha, beta, and gamma RBPs are more like those of HC compared to MBT, as indicated by the power topographies. Utilizing a random forest (RF), the gamma RBP is identified as the optimal frequency band for distinguishing between MBT and HC with a 90% accuracy. The performance of classifying MAT versus HC is lower than that of MBT versus HC, suggesting that the efficacy of rTMS can be validated using RF with gamma RBP. Furthermore, the gamma RBP recorded by the TP10 and CP2 channels dominates the classification task of MBT versus HC when receiving METH-related image cues. The gamma RBP during exposure to METH-related cues can serve as a biomarker for distinguishing between MBT and HC and for evaluating the effectiveness of rTMS. Therefore, real-time monitoring of gamma RBP variations holds promise as a parameter for implementing a customized closed-loop neuromodulation system for treating METH addiction.</description>

      <title>Direct data-driven interpolation and approximation of linear parameter-varying system trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating missing values in trajectories of linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems. We solve this interpolation problem for the class of shifted-affine LPV systems. Conditions for the existence and uniqueness of solutions are given and a direct data-driven algorithm for its computation is presented, i.e., the data-generating system is not given by a parametric model but is implicitly specified by data. We illustrate the applicability of the proposed solution on illustrative examples of a mass-spring-damper system with exogenous and endogenous parameter variation.</description>

      <title>High Resolution Millimeter Wave Imaging Based on FMCW Radar Systems at W-Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18244v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a unique $\text {2D}$ high resolution, compact, low-cost, lightweight, and highly accurate millimeter wave imagery system capable of operating in all weather conditions. We describe millimeter wave imaging process in detail and present several novel signal processing methods with their applications. To create the array, we utilize the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) concept. The imagery system presented in this paper, can strongly compete with Lidar systems as the resolution limit is at the same level. Furthermore, in contrast to the Lidar systems, our imagery system can operate in heavy rain and dense fog and produce high quality images.
  Finally, we utilize our wide-band custom-made Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar, which operates at W-band with $\text {33 GHz}$ bandwidth, for data collection and present the results.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communications for Secure UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel near-field integrated sensing and communications framework for secure unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks with high time efficiency is proposed. A ground base station (GBS) with large aperture size communicates with one communication UAV (C-UAV) under the existence of one eavesdropping UAV (E-UAV), where the artificial noise (AN) is employed for both jamming and sensing purpose. Given that the E-UAV's motion model is unknown at the GBS, we first propose a near-field localization and trajectory tracking scheme. Specifically, exploiting the variant Doppler shift observations over the spatial domain in the near field, the E-UAV's three-dimensional (3D) velocities are estimated from echo signals. To provide the timely correction of location prediction errors, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) is adopted to fuse the predicted states and the measured ones. Subsequently, based on the real-time predicated location of the E-UAV, we further propose a joint GBS beamforming and C-UAV trajectory design scheme for maximizing the instantaneous secrecy rate, while guaranteeing the sensing accuracy constraint. To solve the resultant non-convex problem, an alternating optimization approach is developed, where the near-field GBS beamforming and the C-UAV trajectory design subproblems are iteratively solved by exploiting the successive convex approximation method. Finally, our numerical results unveil that: 1) the E-UAV's 3D velocities and location can be accurately estimated in real time with our proposed framework by exploiting the near-field spherical wave propagation; and 2) the proposed framework achieves superior secrecy rate compared to benchmark schemes and closely approaches the performance when the E-UAV trajectory is perfectly known.</description>

      <title>When Vision-Language Model (VLM) Meets Beam Prediction: A Multimodal Contrastive Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the real propagation environment becomes in creasingly complex and dynamic, millimeter wave beam prediction faces huge challenges. However, the powerful cross modal representation capability of vision-language model (VLM) provides a promising approach. The traditional methods that rely on real-time channel state information (CSI) are computationally expensive and often fail to maintain accuracy in such environments. In this paper, we present a VLM-driven contrastive learning based multimodal beam prediction framework that integrates multimodal data via modality-specific encoders. To enforce cross-modal consistency, we adopt a contrastive pretraining strategy to align image and LiDAR features in the latent space. We use location information as text prompts and connect it to the text encoder to introduce language modality, which further improves cross-modal consistency. Experiments on the DeepSense-6G dataset show that our VLM backbone provides additional semantic grounding. Compared with existing methods, the overall distance-based accuracy score (DBA-Score) of 0.9016, corresponding to 1.46% average improvement.</description>

      <title>Spectral Efficiency-Aware Codebook Design for Task-Oriented Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital task-oriented semantic communication (ToSC) aims to transmit only task-relevant information, significantly reducing communication overhead. Existing ToSC methods typically rely on learned codebooks to encode semantic features and map them to constellation symbols. However, these codebooks are often sparsely activated, resulting in low spectral efficiency and underutilization of channel capacity. This highlights a key challenge: how to design a codebook that not only supports task-specific inference but also approaches the theoretical limits of channel capacity. To address this challenge, we construct a spectral efficiency-aware codebook design framework that explicitly incorporates the codebook activation probability into the optimization process. Beyond maximizing task performance, we introduce the Wasserstein (WS) distance as a regularization metric to minimize the gap between the learned activation distribution and the optimal channel input distribution. Furthermore, we reinterpret WS theory from a generative perspective to align with the semantic nature of ToSC. Combining the above two aspects, we propose a WS-based adaptive hybrid distribution scheme, termed WS-DC, which learns compact, task-driven and channel-aware latent representations. Experimental results demonstrate that WS-DC not only outperforms existing approaches in inference accuracy but also significantly improves codebook efficiency, offering a promising direction toward capacity-approaching semantic communication systems.</description>

      <title>MultiAiTutor: Child-Friendly Educational Multilingual Speech Generation Tutor with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative speech models have demonstrated significant potential in personalizing teacher-student interactions, offering valuable real-world applications for language learning in children's education. However, achieving high-quality, child-friendly speech generation remains challenging, particularly for low-resource languages across diverse languages and cultural contexts. In this paper, we propose MultiAiTutor, an educational multilingual generative AI tutor with child-friendly designs, leveraging LLM architecture for speech generation tailored for educational purposes. We propose to integrate age-appropriate multilingual speech generation using LLM architectures, facilitating young children's language learning through culturally relevant image-description tasks in three low-resource languages: Singaporean-accent Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil. Experimental results from both objective metrics and subjective evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MultiAiTutor compared to baseline methods.</description>
