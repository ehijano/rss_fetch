      <title>Bayesian Optimization and Convolutional Neural Networks for Zernike-Based Wavefront Correction in High Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High harmonic generation (HHG) is a nonlinear process that enables table-top generation of tunable, high-energy, coherent, ultrashort radiation pulses in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) to soft X-ray range. These pulses find applications in photoemission spectroscopy in condensed matter physics, pump-probe spectroscopy for high-energy-density plasmas, and attosecond science. However, optical aberrations in the high-power laser systems required for HHG degrade beam quality and reduce efficiency. We present a machine learning approach to optimize aberration correction using a spatial light modulator. We implemented and compared Bayesian optimization and convolutional neural network (CNN) methods to predict optimal Zernike polynomial coefficients for wavefront correction. Our CNN achieved promising results with 80.39% accuracy on test data, demonstrating the potential for automated aberration correction in HHG systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum open system description of a hybrid plasmonic cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified quantum open system framework for lossy plasmonic cavities in which coherent dynamics, relaxation, dephasing, and irreversible absorption are treated on equal footing. The Dyson equation for the cavity photon propagator in the random-phase approximation yields a complex self-energy S that accounts for both the renormalization and the damping of hybrid plasmon-photon modes (polaritons, in a quasi-particle description). Tracing out the electronic and photonic environments leads to a Liouvillian for the upper (UP) and lower (LP) polaritonic branches, incorporating leakage through the imaginary part of the self-energy, internal UP-LP scattering rates, and dephasing. Time evolution equations for polariton populations, interbranch coherence, and driven amplitudes in closed form also provide analytic expressions for their steady-state values, the quench rate of UP-LP oscillations and polaritonic lineshapes, valid in the limit of low polaritonic density, but covering light-matter ultrastrong coupling. The theory establishes a self-consistent description of dissipative polariton dynamics in plasmonic and nanophotonic cavities, directly applicable to response spectra, time-domain measurements, and dissipation engineering.</description>

      <title>Finding the Maximal Contrast of Two Elliptical Gaussian Mode Beams with Aligned Ellipticities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interferometric contrast is a key factor limiting the sensitivity of precision optical measurements, including the laser interferometers used in gravitational-wave detection. While standard formulas describe the interference of circular Gaussian beams, many real systems use beams with elliptical cross sections, where differing waists and radii of curvature can reduce fringe visibility. This paper derives an analytic expression for the maximum contrast achievable between two aligned elliptical Gaussian beams, written entirely in terms of their geometric and power parameters. We then test the formula using a free-space Michelson interferometer in which all beam parameters are independently measured through beam profiling and nonlinear fitting. In our experiment, the predicted maximum contrast was 0.968 while the experimentally optimized value was 0.950. The small discrepancy is consistent with expected imperfections such as beam rotation, mode mismatch, and non-Gaussian aberrations. This work provides a practical tool for modeling and optimizing elliptical-beam interferometers.</description>

      <title>FieldSeer I: Physics-Guided World Models for Long-Horizon Electromagnetic Dynamics under Partial Observability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce FieldSeer I, a geometry-aware world model that forecasts electromagnetic field dynamics from partial observations in 2-D TE waveguides. The model assimilates a short prefix of observed fields, conditions on a scalar source action and structure/material map, and generates closed-loop rollouts in the physical domain. Training in a symmetric-log domain ensures numerical stability. Evaluated on a reproducible FDTD benchmark (200 unique simulations, structure-wise split), FieldSeer I achieves higher suffix fidelity than GRU and deterministic baselines across three practical settings: (i) software-in-the-loop filtering (64x64, P=80-&gt;Q=80), (ii) offline single-file rollouts (80x140, P=240-&gt;Q=40), and (iii) offline multi-structure rollouts (80x140, P=180-&gt;Q=100). Crucially, it enables edit-after-prefix geometry modifications without re-assimilation. Results demonstrate that geometry-conditioned world models provide a practical path toward interactive digital twins for photonic design.</description>

      <title>Spectrally-selective dynamic radiative thermoregulation via phase engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maintaining comfortable temperatures for buildings, humans, and devices consumes a substantial portion of global energy, underscoring the urgent need for energy-efficient thermoregulation technologies. Dynamic radiative thermal emitters that can switch between passive cooling and heating modes offer a promising solution, but most existing devices exhibit broadband optical responses, resulting in unwanted parasitic heat exchange and limited performance. Here, we introduce an elegant strategy that uses a dielectric cap to transform broadband metal-insulator transition (MIT) materials into spectrally selective dynamic emitters. This design creates a highly tunable Fabry-Perot cavity, enabling a tailored thermal emission spectrum by engineering the reflected-wave phase profile. Our Fresnel-formalism-based phasor diagram analysis reveals two key routes for realizing high spectral selectivity: a high-index dielectric cap and a low-loss metallic MIT state, which are further validated by Bayesian optimization. Following this principle, we demonstrated a wide-angle spectrally-selective thermoregulator operating in the atmospheric transparency window (8-13 um), where the thermal emittance can be electrically tuned from about 0.2 to 0.9 through reversible copper electrodeposition on a germanium cavity. Furthermore, this strategy can be extended to multispectral electrochromic windows, enabling switching between solar heating and spectrally-selective radiative cooling. Our work establishes a versatile and generalizable paradigm for spectral engineering of dynamic thermal emitters, opening opportunities in energy-efficient buildings, wearable thermal comfort, spacecraft thermoregulation, and multispectral camouflage.</description>

      <title>Hertz-Integral-Linewidth Lasers based on Portable Solid-state Microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical reference resonators serve as a cornerstone in various scientific fields. In recent years, there has been an increasing demand for compact ultrastable reference resonators capable of operating in ambient environments, enabling applications beyond the laboratory, such as navigation, portable optical clocks, and remote sensing. Here, we present a compact ultrastable whispering-gallery-mode \ce{MgF2} reference resonator with a high loaded quality factor of $2.24\times 10^9$. The device is packaged in a compact form of 50$\times$77$\times$90 mm and supports stable optical coupling with polarization-maintaining fiber, which enables robust operation under ambient conditions. Laser stabilization using this resonator yields a phase noise of -105 dBc/Hz at a 10 kHz offset frequency, an integral linewidth of 4 Hz, and a fractional frequency stability of $2.5\times 10^{-14}$ at a 10 ms averaging time. With the high performance and rapid manufacturability, our work offers a promising solution for ultrastable optical frequency references beyond laboratory settings.</description>

      <title>How to measure laser chirp rate at single-emitter excitation energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple and direct method for measuring laser chirp rate, i.e., group delay dispersion (GDD) of ultrashort laser pulses at power levels compatible with single-quantum-emitter excitation. Traditional pulse characterization techniques rely on nonlinear optical processes that require high peak powers, making them unsuitable for the attojoule-to-femtojoule regime relevant to quantum photonics. Our approach utilizes a wavelength-to-time mapping method in which the arrival times of spectrally filtered components of a broadband pulse are recorded using a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector and correlated via a high-resolution time-tagging system. The resulting linear relationship between wavelength and arrival time directly yields the dispersion parameter and, subsequently, the GDD. Beyond single-emitter excitation, this technique can be applied in areas such as single-photon spectroscopy, ultralow-power optical communications, and time-domain quantum control, where linear and non-destructive dispersion characterization is essential.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-based all-optical diffractive convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The escalating energy demands and parallel-processing bottlenecks of electronic neural networks underscore the need for alternative computing paradigms. Optical neural networks, capitalizing on the inherent parallelism and speed of light propagation, present a compelling solution. Nevertheless, physically realizing convolutional neural network (CNN) components all-optically remains a significant challenge. To this end, we propose a metasurface-based all-optical diffractive convolutional neural network (MAODCNN) for computer vision tasks. This architecture synergistically integrates metasurface-based optical convolutional layers, which perform parallel convolution on the optical field, with cascaded diffractive neural networks acting as all-optical decoders. This co-design facilitates layer-wise feature extraction and optimization directly within the optical domain. Numerical simulations confirm that the fusion of convolutional and diffractive layers markedly enhances classification accuracy, a performance that scales with the number of diffractive layers. The MAODCNN framework establishes a viable foundation for practical all-optical CNNs, paving the way for high-efficiency, low-power optical computing in advanced pattern recognition.</description>

      <title>Electron-to-photon noise transfer in mid-infrared semiconductor lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise characteristics of state-of-the art light sources are crucial parameters in understanding their limitations towards quantum applications. This work describes a method to study the electrical noise transfer of current driver sources to the intensity noise of mid-infrared emission by commercial quantum and interband cascade lasers (QCLs and ICLs, respectively). A current driver with sub-shot electrical noise in a specific frequency range (up to 10 dB below the shot noise level) was developed for this purpose. This enables testing the performance of mid-infrared lasers when driven via such a quiet pump source. By using this novel current driver, we identify the fundamental noise of a QCL and an ICL, that is the laser intensity noise resulting solely from the internal dynamics of the laser under test. The proposed methodology allows us to retrieve the noise transfer function from current to light, showing that the main limitations in observing the quantum properties of the emitted photons come from laser excess noise and poor matching between laser and detection system in terms of bandwidth and optical power. From the analysis of the measured parameters, we highlight current technological limitations and suggest which key features should be optimized in mid-infrared systems for matching the performance required by quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Double-flat-top half-vortices and self-bound solitary wave billiards in cubic-quintic media with intermodal attraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a bimodal light field envelope propagating in a bulk medium characterized by competing cubic and quintic nonlinearities. The subfields are coupled by a cross-phase modulation term and experience effective attraction. We find dynamically stable stationary states which have two distinct flat-top regions with different intensities. These solutions represent half-vortices, where the first and second components are essentially different and, in particular, carry different topological charges: zero for one component and nonzero for the other. The typical propagation of an unstable half-vortex leads to the splitting of the central vortex core into several fragments which quasielastically interact with the boundary of the flat-top region. This behavior is interpreted as a self-bound solitary wave billiard, where the emerging fragments are the billiard balls and the flat-top region is the dynamically deforming table.</description>

      <title>Unified analysis of spatially-coupled absorption and saturation dynamics in multi-pass pumped thin-disk lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework that unifies pump absorption, gain saturation, thermo-optic distortion, and cavity diffraction into a self-consistent model of multi-pass pumped solid-state lasers. By deriving a theoretical formulation of the nonlinear coupling of the superimposed pump energy and effective absorption, we prove an unique steady-state solution exists. Applied to the multi-pass Yb:YAG thin-disk module, the framework is quantitatively validated with experiments, reproducing a well matched absorption tendency, errors in output power, beam diameter and M^2 within 3.0%, 1.7%, and 0.05 respectively. This approach provides predictive guidelines for pump-power scaling and pass-number optimization in high-power lasers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present exact analogies between the tautochrone problem of mechanics and the squeezed states of quantum optics, to optical lattices. Both phenomena emerge in the same physical system, that of waveguide arrays with non-uniform couplings. Extension to two dimensions yields Lissajous-type trajectories and multidirectional tautochrone focusing. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of Kerr nonlinearity and show that it determines the diffraction behavior, namely coherent-state-like or squeezed propagation. These quantum inspired classical lattices highlight the role of the coupling coefficients to beam engineering and light control in complex media.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an alternative receiver architecture for deep-space optical communication, in which a single large aperture is replaced by an array of smaller ones with outputs combined coherently, employing phase stabilization based on photon counting events. We show that it allows to increase the signal to noise ratio, thus potentially attaining higher information transmission rates in the regime of large noise, typical for daytime communication. We analyze its practical performance by simulating pulse position modulation-based communication from the recently launched Psyche mission. Under nighttime conditions the achieved performance is comparable to that offered by a single large aperture, whereas in daytime conditions the single photon coherent beam combination architecture provides an advantage in the information transmission rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indium antimonide (InSb) is a fundamental material for infrared radiation detectors based on interband transitions. Its narrow bandgap enables detection of infrared radiation within the $3-5 \mu m$ atmospheric window, while its high quantum efficiency ensures excellent sensitivity in InSb-based detectors. We propose a plasmonic structure that significantly enhances infrared absorption in an ultrathin InSb film. The resonant characteristics of this plasmonic enhancement effect could serve as a foundation for developing highly sensitive multi-color detectors.</description>

      <title>Hypothesis-Based Particle Detection for Accurate Nanoparticle Counting and Digital Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital assays represent a shift from traditional diagnostics and enable the precise detection of low-abundance analytes, critical for early disease diagnosis and personalized medicine, through discrete counting of biomolecular reporters. Within this paradigm, we present a particle counting algorithm for nanoparticle based imaging assays, formulated as a multiple-hypothesis statistical test under an explicit image-formation model and evaluated using a penalized likelihood rule. In contrast to thresholding or machine learning methods, this approach requires no training data or empirical parameter tuning, and its outputs remain interpretable through direct links to imaging physics and statistical decision theory.
  Through numerical simulations we demonstrate robust count accuracy across weak signals, variable backgrounds, magnification changes and moderate PSF mismatch. Particle resolvability tests further reveal characteristic error modes, including under-counting at very small separations and localized over-counting near the resolution limit. Practically, we also confirm the algorithm's utility, through application to experimental dark-field images comprising a nanoparticle-based assay for detection of DNA biomarkers derived from SARS-CoV-2. Statistically significant differences in particle count distributions are observed between control and positive samples. Full count statistics obtained further exhibit consistent over-dispersion, and provide insight into non-specific and target-induced particle aggregation. These results establish our method as a reliable framework for nanoparticle-based detection assays in digital molecular diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Electrically Tunable Heliconical Smectic Superstructure in Polar Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The groundbreaking discovery of the ferroelectric nematic (NF) phase has attracted broad interest owing to its pronounced polarization properties and high fluidity. Building on this, the emergent spontaneous chiral order in achiral molecular systems, such as the heliconical ferroelectric nematic phase (NTBF) and the polar heliconical smectic C phase (SmC_P^H), has been discovered, revealing a new form in hierarchical polar order: hierarchical symmetry breaking. Here we report a newly designed achiral molecule that exhibits a hierarchical polar phase sequence: ferroelectric smectic A-NTBF-helielectric conical-SmC_P^H phases. We confirm that the SmC_P^H phase can form a stable macroscopic orientation under an electric field, without any alignment layer. Remarkably, we unlock the unprecedented functionality of the SmC_P^H phase: ultralow-voltage and low-frequency-driven modulation of the helical pitch and its associated enhanced second-harmonic generation. These results demonstrate emergent functionality of polar fluids arising from hierarchical symmetry breaking and offering a new paradigm for polar soft-matter photonics.</description>

      <title>Plasmascopy of ultrafast hot charges in solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate an electric field-resolved approach for probing ultrafast dynamics of photoinjected charges in solids. Direct access to the electric field of few-cycle pulses enables us to measure a broadband response of a medium with associated plasma frequency. We prepare an ensemble of photoinjected hot charge carriers with energies sufficient to trigger impact ionization and establish a framework to measure its dynamics. Our study reveals the first time-resolved observation of the short-lived ultrafast impact ionization in germanium counteracted by trapping of mobile charges at later times. This approach provides a promising route for studying ultrafast many-body physics in photoexcited solids, with predictions from advanced theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Squeezing Classical Antiferromagnets into Quantum Spin Liquids via Global Cavity Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavity quantum electrodynamics with atomic ensembles is typically associated with collective spin phenomena, such as superradiance and spin squeezing, in which the atoms evolve collectively as a macroscopic spin ($S\sim N/2$) on the Bloch sphere. Surprisingly, we show that the tendency toward a collective spin description need not imply collective spin phenomena; rather, it can be exploited to generate new forms of strongly correlated quantum matter. The key idea is to use uniform cavity-mediated interactions to energetically project the system into the total-spin singlet sector ($S=0$) - a highly entangled subspace where the physics is governed entirely by cavity fluctuations. Focusing on Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a single-mode cavity, we show that global cavity fluctuations can effectively squeeze classical antiferromagnets into quantum spin liquids, characterized by non-local entanglement, fractionalized excitations, and emergent gauge fields. This work suggests that cavity QED can be a surprising resource for inducing strongly correlated phenomena, which could be explored in the new generation of hybrid tweezer-cavity platforms.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network with Frequency-Aware Learning for Optical Aberration Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical aberrations significantly degrade image quality in microscopy, particularly when imaging deeper into samples. These aberrations arise from distortions in the optical wavefront and can be mathematically represented using Zernike polynomials. Existing methods often address only mild aberrations on limited sample types and modalities, typically treating the problem as a black-box mapping without leveraging the underlying optical physics of wavefront distortions. We propose ZRNet, a physics-informed framework that jointly performs Zernike coefficient prediction and optical image Restoration. We contribute a Zernike Graph module that explicitly models physical relationships between Zernike polynomials based on their azimuthal degrees-ensuring that learned corrections align with fundamental optical principles. To further enforce physical consistency between image restoration and Zernike prediction, we introduce a Frequency-Aware Alignment (FAA) loss, which better aligns Zernike coefficient prediction and image features in the Fourier domain. Extensive experiments on CytoImageNet demonstrates that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both image restoration and Zernike coefficient prediction across diverse microscopy modalities and biological samples with complex, large-amplitude aberrations.

      <title>Temperature-Dependent Evolution of Coherence, Entropy, and Photon Statistics in Photoluminescence</title>

Abstract: Photoluminescence (PL) is a fundamental light-matter interaction in which absorbed photons are re-emitted, playing a key role in science and engineering. It is commonly modeled by introducing a non-zero chemical potential into Planck's law to capture its deviation from thermal emission. In this work, we establish, for the first time to our knowledge, a fundamental relationship that expresses the chemical potential as a function of temperature, material properties, and excitation conditions, enabling a treatment of PL analogous to Planck's law with thermal radiation. This formulation allows for the analysis of temperature-dependent PL properties, including spectral emission, entropy, temporal coherence, and photon statistics, capturing the transition from narrowband pump-induced to broadband thermal emission. Notably, we identify a temperature range where the emission rate is quasi-conserved, associated with the previously reported blueshift. This is followed by a rapid transition to thermal behavior, reflected in both the chemical potential and entropy. Conversely, the coherence time and photon statistics evolve smoothly across the entire temperature range. Alongside its scientific contribution, this framework provides a foundation for designing temperature-tunable light sources, enabling control over coherence length and photon statistics.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary Total Angular Momentum Vectorial Holography Using Bi-Layer Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advanced holographic techniques are increasingly demanded for high-capacity and secure information processing. In this context, orbital angular momentum (OAM) stands out as a powerful resource for optical multiplexing, offering access to an unbounded set of orthogonal modes. To harness this potential, metasurfaces, with their considerable ability to control light, have emerged as key platforms for OAM-multiplexed holography. Nevertheless, conventional OAM holography suffers from limited polarization engineering capabilities due to the lack of chirality control in single-layer metasurfaces. Here, we introduce a bi-layer metasurface architecture that realizes total angular momentum (TAM) vectorial holography, where TAM represents the combination of spin angular momentum (SAM, equivalent to polarization) and OAM of light. In contrast to previous approaches, this scheme enables true polarization-OAM multiplexing, facilitating the independent generation of vectorial holographic images for each orthogonal TAM input state. This concept is validated numerically and experimentally, confirming the feasibility of TAM vectorial holography. The proposed scheme can be easily integrated with other recent holography generation approaches, such as vector beam multiplexing and bidirectional holography, thereby further expanding its multiplexing capability. This work establishes a versatile framework for advanced full-vectorial holography, showing how metasurfaces can unlock multiplexing strategies for emerging photonic systems.</description>
