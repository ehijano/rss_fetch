      <title>Large Language Models (LLMs): Deployment, Tokenomics and Sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly impacted human-computer interaction, epitomized by the release of GPT-4o, which introduced comprehensive multi-modality capabilities. In this paper, we first explored the deployment strategies, economic considerations, and sustainability challenges associated with the state-of-the-art LLMs. More specifically, we discussed the deployment debate between Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuning, highlighting their respective advantages and limitations. After that, we quantitatively analyzed the requirement of xPUs in training and inference. Additionally, for the tokenomics of LLM services, we examined the balance between performance and cost from the quality of experience (QoE)'s perspective of end users. Lastly, we envisioned the future hybrid architecture of LLM processing and its corresponding sustainability concerns, particularly in the environmental carbon footprint impact. Through these discussions, we provided a comprehensive overview of the operational and strategic considerations essential for the responsible development and deployment of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Carnatic Raga Identification System using Rigorous Time-Delay Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large scale machine learning-based Raga identification continues to be a nontrivial issue in the computational aspects behind Carnatic music. Each raga consists of many unique and intrinsic melodic patterns that can be used to easily identify them from others. These ragas can also then be used to cluster songs within the same raga, as well as identify songs in other closely related ragas. In this case, the input sound is analyzed using a combination of steps including using a Discrete Fourier transformation and using Triangular Filtering to create custom bins of possible notes, extracting features from the presence of particular notes or lack thereof. Using a combination of Neural Networks including 1D Convolutional Neural Networks conventionally known as Time-Delay Neural Networks) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), which are a form of Recurrent Neural Networks, the backbone of the classification strategy to build the model can be created. In addition, to help with variations in shruti, a long-time attention-based mechanism will be implemented to determine the relative changes in frequency rather than the absolute differences. This will provide a much more meaningful data point when training audio clips in different shrutis. To evaluate the accuracy of the classifier, a dataset of 676 recordings is used. The songs are distributed across the list of ragas. The goal of this program is to be able to effectively and efficiently label a much wider range of audio clips in more shrutis, ragas, and with more background noise.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-Based Tracking and 3D Reconstruction of Baseball Pitch Trajectories from Single-View 2D Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a neural network-based approach for tracking and reconstructing the trajectories of baseball pitches from 2D video footage to 3D coordinates. We utilize OpenCV's CSRT algorithm to accurately track the baseball and fixed reference points in 2D video frames. These tracked pixel coordinates are then used as input features for our neural network model, which comprises multiple fully connected layers to map the 2D coordinates to 3D space. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled trajectories using a mean squared error loss function and the Adam optimizer, optimizing the network to minimize prediction errors. Our experimental results demonstrate that this approach achieves high accuracy in reconstructing 3D trajectories from 2D inputs. This method shows great potential for applications in sports analysis, coaching, and enhancing the accuracy of trajectory predictions in various sports.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Multimodal Large Language Model from A Data-centric Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human beings perceive the world through diverse senses such as sight, smell, hearing, and touch. Similarly, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enhance the capabilities of traditional large language models by integrating and processing data from multiple modalities including text, vision, audio, video, and 3D environments. Data plays a pivotal role in the development and refinement of these models. In this survey, we comprehensively review the literature on MLLMs from a data-centric perspective. Specifically, we explore methods for preparing multimodal data during the pretraining and adaptation phases of MLLMs. Additionally, we analyze the evaluation methods for datasets and review benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs. Our survey also outlines potential future research directions. This work aims to provide researchers with a detailed understanding of the data-driven aspects of MLLMs, fostering further exploration and innovation in this field.</description>

      <title>Towards Multi-Task Multi-Modal Models: A Video Generative Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in language foundation models have primarily fueled the recent surge in artificial intelligence. In contrast, generative learning of non-textual modalities, especially videos, significantly trails behind language modeling. This thesis chronicles our endeavor to build multi-task models for generating videos and other modalities under diverse conditions, as well as for understanding and compression applications. Given the high dimensionality of visual data, we pursue concise and accurate latent representations. Our video-native spatial-temporal tokenizers preserve high fidelity. We unveil a novel approach to mapping bidirectionally between visual observation and interpretable lexical terms. Furthermore, our scalable visual token representation proves beneficial across generation, compression, and understanding tasks. This achievement marks the first instances of language models surpassing diffusion models in visual synthesis and a video tokenizer outperforming industry-standard codecs. Within these multi-modal latent spaces, we study the design of multi-task generative models. Our masked multi-task transformer excels at the quality, efficiency, and flexibility of video generation. We enable a frozen language model, trained solely on text, to generate visual content. Finally, we build a scalable generative multi-modal transformer trained from scratch, enabling the generation of videos containing high-fidelity motion with the corresponding audio given diverse conditions. Throughout the course, we have shown the effectiveness of integrating multiple tasks, crafting high-fidelity latent representation, and generating multiple modalities. This work suggests intriguing potential for future exploration in generating non-textual data and enabling real-time, interactive experiences across various media forms.</description>

      <title>Extreme Compression of Adaptive Neural Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) and Neural Fields are a novel paradigm for signal representation, from images and audio to 3D scenes and videos. The fundamental idea is to represent a signal as a continuous and differentiable neural network. This idea offers unprecedented benefits such as continuous resolution and memory efficiency, enabling new compression techniques. However, representing data as neural networks poses new challenges. For instance, given a 2D image as a neural network, how can we further compress such a neural image?. In this work, we present a novel analysis on compressing neural fields, with the focus on images. We also introduce Adaptive Neural Images (ANI), an efficient neural representation that enables adaptation to different inference or transmission requirements. Our proposed method allows to reduce the bits-per-pixel (bpp) of the neural image by 4x, without losing sensitive details or harming fidelity. We achieve this thanks to our successful implementation of 4-bit neural representations. Our work offers a new framework for developing compressed neural fields.</description>

      <title>Blind Data Adaptation to tackle Covariate Shift in Operational Steganalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of image manipulation for unethical purposes poses significant challenges in social networks. One particularly concerning method is Image Steganography, allowing individuals to hide illegal information in digital images without arousing suspicions. Such a technique pose severe security risks, making it crucial to develop effective steganalysis methods enabling to detect manipulated images for clandestine communications. Although significant advancements have been achieved with machine learning models, a critical issue remains: the disparity between the controlled datasets used to train steganalysis models against real-world datasets of forensic practitioners, undermining severely the practical effectiveness of standardized steganalysis models. In this paper, we address this issue focusing on a realistic scenario where practitioners lack crucial information about the limited target set of images under analysis, including details about their development process and even whereas it contains manipulated images or not. By leveraging geometric alignment and distribution matching of source and target residuals, we develop TADA (Target Alignment through Data Adaptation), a novel methodology enabling to emulate sources aligned with specific targets in steganalysis, which is also relevant for highly unbalanced targets. The emulator is represented by a light convolutional network trained to align distributions of image residuals. Experimental validation demonstrates the potential of our strategy over traditional methods fighting covariate shift in steganalysis.</description>

      <title>MIntRec 2.0: A Large-scale Benchmark Dataset for Multimodal Intent Recognition and Out-of-scope Detection in Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10943v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal intent recognition poses significant challenges, requiring the incorporation of non-verbal modalities from real-world contexts to enhance the comprehension of human intentions. Existing benchmark datasets are limited in scale and suffer from difficulties in handling out-of-scope samples that arise in multi-turn conversational interactions. We introduce MIntRec 2.0, a large-scale benchmark dataset for multimodal intent recognition in multi-party conversations. It contains 1,245 dialogues with 15,040 samples, each annotated within a new intent taxonomy of 30 fine-grained classes. Besides 9,304 in-scope samples, it also includes 5,736 out-of-scope samples appearing in multi-turn contexts, which naturally occur in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive information on the speakers in each utterance, enriching its utility for multi-party conversational research. We establish a general framework supporting the organization of single-turn and multi-turn dialogue data, modality feature extraction, multimodal fusion, as well as in-scope classification and out-of-scope detection. Evaluation benchmarks are built using classic multimodal fusion methods, ChatGPT, and human evaluators. While existing methods incorporating nonverbal information yield improvements, effectively leveraging context information and detecting out-of-scope samples remains a substantial challenge. Notably, large language models exhibit a significant performance gap compared to humans, highlighting the limitations of machine learning methods in the cognitive intent understanding task. We believe that MIntRec 2.0 will serve as a valuable resource, providing a pioneering foundation for research in human-machine conversational interactions, and significantly facilitating related applications. The full dataset and codes are available at https://github.com/thuiar/MIntRec2.0.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08698v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current Multimodal Knowledge Graph Construction (MKGC) models struggle with the real-world dynamism of continuously emerging entities and relations, often succumbing to catastrophic forgetting-loss of previously acquired knowledge. This study introduces benchmarks aimed at fostering the development of the continual MKGC domain. We further introduce MSPT framework, designed to surmount the shortcomings of existing MKGC approaches during multimedia data processing. MSPT harmonizes the retention of learned knowledge (stability) and the integration of new data (plasticity), outperforming current continual learning and multimodal methods. Our results confirm MSPT's superior performance in evolving knowledge environments, showcasing its capacity to navigate balance between stability and plasticity.</description>

      <title>Unified Hallucination Detection for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03190v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite significant strides in multimodal tasks, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are plagued by the critical issue of hallucination. The reliable detection of such hallucinations in MLLMs has, therefore, become a vital aspect of model evaluation and the safeguarding of practical application deployment. Prior research in this domain has been constrained by a narrow focus on singular tasks, an inadequate range of hallucination categories addressed, and a lack of detailed granularity. In response to these challenges, our work expands the investigative horizons of hallucination detection. We present a novel meta-evaluation benchmark, MHaluBench, meticulously crafted to facilitate the evaluation of advancements in hallucination detection methods. Additionally, we unveil a novel unified multimodal hallucination detection framework, UNIHD, which leverages a suite of auxiliary tools to validate the occurrence of hallucinations robustly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of UNIHD through meticulous evaluation and comprehensive analysis. We also provide strategic insights on the application of specific tools for addressing various categories of hallucinations.</description>

      <title>Detecting Multimodal Situations with Insufficient Context and Abstaining from Baseless Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11145v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of Vision-Language Understanding (VLU) benchmarks such as VQA v2, OKVQA, A-OKVQA, GQA, VCR, SWAG, and VisualCOMET, our analysis reveals a pervasive issue affecting their integrity: these benchmarks contain samples where answers rely on assumptions unsupported by the provided context. Training models on such data foster biased learning and hallucinations as models tend to make similar unwarranted assumptions. To address this issue, we collect contextual data for each sample whenever available and train a context selection module to facilitate evidence-based model predictions. Strong improvements across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Further, we develop a general-purpose Context-AwaRe Abstention (CARA) detector to identify samples lacking sufficient context and enhance model accuracy by abstaining from responding if the required context is absent. CARA exhibits generalization to new benchmarks it wasn't trained on, underscoring its utility for future VLU benchmarks in detecting or cleaning samples with inadequate context. Finally, we curate a Context Ambiguity and Sufficiency Evaluation (CASE) set to benchmark the performance of insufficient context detectors. Overall, our work represents a significant advancement in ensuring that vision-language models generate trustworthy and evidence-based outputs in complex real-world scenarios.</description>
