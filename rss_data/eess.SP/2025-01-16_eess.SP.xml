      <title>Automotive Elevation Mapping with Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radar is a low-cost and ubiquitous automotive sensor, but is limited by array resolution and sensitivity when performing direction of arrival analysis. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a class of techniques to improve azimuth resolution and sensitivity for radar. Interferometric SAR (InSAR) can be used to extract elevation from the variations in phase measurements in SAR images. Utilizing InSAR we show that a typical, low-resolution radar array mounted on a vehicle can be used to accurately localize detections in 3D space for both urban and agricultural environments. We generate point clouds in each environment by combining InSAR with a signal processing scheme tailored to automotive driving. This low-compute approach allows radar to be used as a primary sensor to map fine details in complex driving environments, and be used to make autonomous perception decisions.</description>

      <title>Low-Complex Waveform, Modulation and Coding Designs for 3GPP Ambient IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study on low-complexity waveform, modulation and coding (WMC) designs for the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Ambient Internet of Things (A-IoT). A-IoT is a low-cost, low-power IoT system inspired by Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and aims to leverage existing cellular network infrastructure for efficient RF tag management. The paper compares the physical layer (PHY) design challenges and requirements of RFID and A-IoT, particularly focusing on backscatter communications. An overview of the standardization for PHY designs in Release 19 A-IoT is provided, along with detailed schemes of the proposed low-complex WMC designs. The performance of device-to-reader link designs is validated through simulations, demonstrating 6 dB improvements of the proposed baseband waveform with coherent receivers compared to RFID line coding-based solutions with non-coherent receivers when channel coding is adopted.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces Aided Wireless Network: Deployment Architectures and Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have emerged as a transformative technology for wireless networks by improving coverage, capacity, and energy efficiency through intelligent manipulation of wireless propagation environments. This paper provides a comprehensive study on the deployment and coordination of IRSs for wireless networks. By addressing both single- and multi-reflection IRS architectures, we examine their deployment strategies across diverse scenarios, including point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and point-to-area setups. For the single-reflection case, we highlight the trade-offs between passive and active IRS architectures in terms of beamforming gain, coverage extension, and spatial multiplexing. For the multi-reflection case, we discuss practical strategies to optimize IRS deployment and element allocation, balancing cooperative beamforming gains and path loss. The paper further discusses practical challenges in IRS implementation, including environmental conditions, system compatibility, and hardware limitations. Numerical results and field tests validate the effectiveness of IRS-aided wireless networks and demonstrate their capacity and coverage improvements. Lastly, promising research directions, including movable IRSs, near-field deployments, and network-level optimization, are outlined to guide future investigations.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Review of Machine Learning Methods for Multimodal EEG Data in Clinical Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques have been widely applied to analyze electroencephalography (EEG) signals for disease diagnosis and brain-computer interfaces (BCI). The integration of multimodal data has been shown to enhance the accuracy of ML and DL models. Combining EEG with other modalities can improve clinical decision-making by addressing complex tasks in clinical populations. This systematic literature review explores the use of multimodal EEG data in ML and DL models for clinical applications. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, yielding 16 relevant studies after three rounds of filtering. These studies demonstrate the application of multimodal EEG data in addressing clinical challenges, including neuropsychiatric disorders, neurological conditions (e.g., seizure detection), neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorder), and sleep stage classification. Data fusion occurred at three levels: signal, feature, and decision levels. The most commonly used ML models were support vector machines (SVM) and decision trees. Notably, 11 out of the 16 studies reported improvements in model accuracy with multimodal EEG data. This review highlights the potential of multimodal EEG-based ML models in enhancing clinical diagnostics and problem-solving.</description>

      <title>Broadband measurements and analysis of human blocking in a 60 GHz indoor radio channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New millimeter-wave wireless communication systems can be strongly impacted by the blockage introduced by the human body. At 60 GHz, the coverage of these systems is relatively limited due to high propagation losses. Thus, beamforming allows to find a reflective path to replace the blocked one. In this work, the study focuses on the impact of a human blocker in a meeting room, to evaluate the blocking losses introduced by the human body at 60 GHz. The results obtained in terms of path loss and channel impulse response show that the attenuation by the human body is between 24 and 26 dB. Moreover, the results show that the use of beamforming allows to exploit the reflected paths to replace the direct link that can be blocked by the human body.</description>

      <title>Subject Disentanglement Neural Network for Speech Envelope Reconstruction from EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing speech envelopes from EEG signals is essential for exploring neural mechanisms underlying speech perception. Yet, EEG variability across subjects and physiological artifacts complicate accurate reconstruction. To address this problem, we introduce Subject Disentangling Neural Network (SDN-Net), which disentangles subject identity information from reconstructed speech envelopes to enhance cross-subject reconstruction accuracy. SDN-Net integrates three key components: MLA-Codec, MPN-MI, and CTA-MTDNN. The MLA-Codec, a fully convolutional neural network, decodes EEG signals into speech envelopes. The CTA-MTDNN module, a multi-scale time-delay neural network with channel and temporal attention, extracts subject identity features from EEG signals. Lastly, the MPN-MI module, a mutual information estimator with a multi-layer perceptron, supervises the removal of subject identity information from the reconstructed speech envelope. Experiments on the Auditory EEG Decoding Dataset demonstrate that SDN-Net achieves superior performance in inner- and cross-subject speech envelope reconstruction compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Method for Optimum Biomedical Wireless Power Transfer using Inductive Links in Area-Constrained Implants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of implantable bioelectronics, this work provides new insights into maximizing biomedical wireless power transfer (BWPT) via the systematic development of inductive links. This approach addresses the specific challenges of power transfer efficiency (PTE) optimization within the area constraints of bio-implants embedded in tissue. Key contributions include the derivation of an optimal self-inductance with S-parameter-based analyses leading to the co-design of planar spiral coils and L-section impedance matching networks. To validate the proposed design methodology, two coil prototypes -- one symmetric (type-1) and one asymmetric (type-2) -- were fabricated and tested for PTE in pork tissue. Targeting a 20 MHz design frequency, the type-1 coil demonstrated a state-of-the-art PTE of $\sim$ 4\% (channel length = 15 mm) with a return loss (RL) $&gt;$ 20 dB on both the input and output sides, within an area constraint of $&lt;$ 18 $ \times $ 18 mm$^{2}$. In contrast, the type-2 coil achieved a PTE of $\sim$ 2\% with an RL $&gt;$ 15 dB, for a smaller receiving coil area of $&lt;$ 5x5 mm$^{2}$ for the same tissue environment. To complement the coils, we demonstrate a 65 nm test chip with an integrated energy harvester, which includes \asif{a} 30-stage rectifier and low-dropout regulator (LDO), producing a stable $\sim$ 1V DC output within tissue medium, matching theoretical predictions and simulations. Furthermore, we provide a robust and comprehensive guideline for advancing efficient inductive links for various BWPT applications, with shared resources in GitHub available for utilization by the broader community.</description>

      <title>Near-Field ISAC: Synergy of Dual-Purpose Codebooks and Space-Time Adaptive Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a transformative paradigm, enabling situationally aware and perceptive next-generation wireless networks through the co-design of shared network resources. With the adoption of millimeter-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) frequency bands, ultra-massive MIMO (UM-MIMO) systems and holographic surfaces unlock the potential of near-field (NF) propagation, characterized by spherical wavefronts that facilitate beam manipulation in both angular and range domains. This paper presents a unified approach to near-field beam-training and sensing, introducing a dual-purpose codebook design that employs discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based codebooks for coarse estimation of sensing parameters and polar codebooks for parameter refinement. Leveraging these range and angle estimates, a customized low-complexity space-time adaptive processing (STAP) technique is proposed for NF-ISAC to detect slow-moving targets and efficiently mitigate clutter. The interplay between codebooks and NF-STAP framework offers three key advantages: reduced communication beam training overhead, improved estimation accuracy, and minimal STAP computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed framework can reduce STAP complexity by three orders of magnitude, validating efficacy, and highlighting the potential of the proposed approach to seamlessly integrate NF communication and sensing functionalities in future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>The first calibration model for bluetooth angle of arrival: Enhancing positioning accuracy in indoor environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) applications are increasingly reliant on indoor positioning systems to deliver precise and reliable navigation in GNSS-denied environments, including urban areas, smart warehouses, hospitals, and underground or multi-level parking systems. Bluetooth Angle of Arrival (AoA) positioning offers cost-effective solutions with the potential to provide users with sub-meter position accuracy, which is crucial for applications such as underground navigation, firefighters, and robotic navigation. Bluetooth AoA positioning uses angles to determine the position of Bluetooth tags; these angles, measured in the anchor coordinate system, need to be transferred to the user's coordinate system. This requires models or techniques to compute 3D rotation matrices between the anchor and user coordinate system. Until now, no model or technique has been developed to compute these rotation matrices. Therefore, the development of the AoA positioning model focuses on simulated scenarios. This paper introduces the first model, named the AoA calibration model, capable of estimating these rotation matrices, thereby facilitating the practical application of this technology. In addition, this paper tests the Bluetooth AoA calibration and positioning model on a real dataset and presents end-toend functional architectures for AoA positioning. The results demonstrate that the proposed calibration model can estimate the 3D transformation rotation angles with a standard deviation better than 2.5 degrees. The findings also reveal that AoA positioning can achieve sub-meter accuracy in both static and kinematic modes, with accuracy significantly influenced by the distance to the anchors and the geometry factor.</description>

      <title>A Multi-modal Intelligent Channel Model for 6G Multi-UAV-to-Multi-Vehicle Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel multi-modal intelligent channel model for sixth-generation (6G) multiple-unmanned aerial vehicle (multi-UAV)-to-multi-vehicle communications is proposed. To thoroughly explore the mapping relationship between the physical environment and the electromagnetic space in the complex multi-UAV-to-multi-vehicle scenario, two new parameters, i.e., terrestrial traffic density (TTD) and aerial traffic density (ATD), are developed and a new sensing-communication intelligent integrated dataset is constructed in suburban scenario under different TTD and ATD conditions. With the aid of sensing data, i.e., light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds, the parameters of static scatterers, terrestrial dynamic scatterers, and aerial dynamic scatterers in the electromagnetic space, e.g., number, distance, angle, and power, are quantified under different TTD and ATD conditions in the physical environment. In the proposed model, the channel non-stationarity and consistency on the time and space domains and the channel non-stationarity on the frequency domain are simultaneously mimicked. The channel statistical properties, such as time-space-frequency correlation function (TSF-CF), time stationary interval (TSI), and Doppler power spectral density (DPSD), are derived and simulated. Simulation results match ray-tracing (RT) results well, which verifies the accuracy of the proposed multi-UAV-to-multi-vehicle channel model.</description>

      <title>Spectral Eigenfunction Decomposition for Kernel Adaptive Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kernel adaptive filtering (KAF) integrates traditional linear algorithms with kernel methods to generate nonlinear solutions in the input space. The standard approach relies on the representer theorem and the kernel trick to perform pairwise evaluations of a kernel function in place of the inner product, which leads to scalability issues for large datasets due to its linear and superlinear growth with respect to the size of the training data. Explicit features have been proposed to tackle this problem, exploiting the properties of the Gaussian-type kernel functions. These approximation methods address the implicitness and infinite dimensional representation of conventional kernel methods. However, achieving an accurate finite approximation for the kernel evaluation requires a sufficiently large vector representation for the dot products. An increase in the input-space dimension leads to a combinatorial explosion in the dimensionality of the explicit space, i.e., it trades one dimensionality problem (implicit, infinite dimensional RKHS) for another (curse of dimensionality). This paper introduces a construction that simultaneously solves these two problems in a principled way, by providing an explicit Euclidean representation of the RKHS while reducing its dimensionality. We present SPEctral Eigenfunction Decomposition (SPEED) along with an efficient incremental approach for fast calculation of the dominant kernel eigenbasis, which enables us to track the kernel eigenspace dynamically for adaptive filtering. Simulation results on chaotic time series prediction demonstrate this novel construction outperforms existing explicit kernel features with greater efficiency.</description>

      <title>FARE: A Deep Learning-Based Framework for Radar-based Face Recognition and Out-of-distribution Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel pipeline for face recognition and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection using short-range FMCW radar. The proposed system utilizes Range-Doppler and micro Range-Doppler Images. The architecture features a primary path (PP) responsible for the classification of in-distribution (ID) faces, complemented by intermediate paths (IPs) dedicated to OOD detection. The network is trained in two stages: first, the PP is trained using triplet loss to optimize ID face classification. In the second stage, the PP is frozen, and the IPs-comprising simple linear autoencoder networks-are trained specifically for OOD detection. Using our dataset generated with a 60 GHz FMCW radar, our method achieves an ID classification accuracy of 99.30% and an OOD detection AUROC of 96.91%.</description>

      <title>Time series forecasting for multidimensional telemetry data using GAN and BiLSTM in a Digital Twin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The research related to digital twins has been increasing in recent years. Besides the mirroring of the physical word into the digital, there is the need of providing services related to the data collected and transferred to the virtual world. One of these services is the forecasting of physical part future behavior, that could lead to applications, like preventing harmful events or designing improvements to get better performance. One strategy used to predict any system operation it is the use of time series models like ARIMA or LSTM, and improvements were implemented using these algorithms. Recently, deep learning techniques based on generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been proposed to create time series and the use of LSTM has gained more relevance in time series forecasting, but both have limitations that restrict the forecasting results. Another issue found in the literature is the challenge of handling multivariate environments/applications in time series generation. Therefore, new methods need to be studied in order to fill these gaps and, consequently, provide better resources for creating useful digital twins. In this proposal, it is going to be studied the integration of a BiLSTM layer with a time series obtained by GAN in order to improve the forecasting of all the features provided by the dataset in terms of accuracy and, consequently, improving behaviour prediction.</description>

Abstract: Seasickness is a prevalent issue that adversely impacts both passenger experiences and the operational efficiency of maritime crews. While techniques that redirect attention have proven effective in alleviating motion sickness symptoms in terrestrial environments, applying similar strategies to manage seasickness poses unique challenges due to the prolonged and intense motion environment associated with maritime travel. In this study, we propose a mindfulness brain-computer interface (BCI), specifically designed to redirect attention with the aim of mitigating seasickness symptoms in real-world settings. Our system utilizes a single-channel headband to capture prefrontal EEG signals, which are then wirelessly transmitted to computing devices for the assessment of mindfulness states. The results are transferred into real-time feedback as mindfulness scores and audiovisual stimuli, facilitating a shift in attentional focus from physiological discomfort to mindfulness practices. A total of 43 individuals participated in a real-world maritime experiment consisted of three sessions: a real-feedback mindfulness session, a resting session, and a pseudofeedback mindfulness session. Notably, 81.39% of participants reported that the mindfulness BCI intervention was effective, and there was a significant reduction in the severity of seasickness, as measured by the Misery Scale (MISC). Furthermore, EEG analysis revealed a decrease in the theta/beta ratio, corresponding with the alleviation of seasickness symptoms. A decrease in overall EEG band power during the real-feedback mindfulness session suggests that the mindfulness BCI fosters a more tranquil and downregulated state of brain activity. Together, this study presents a novel nonpharmacological, portable, and effective approach for seasickness intervention, with the potential to enhance the cruising experience for both passengers and crews.</description>

      <title>Double reflections Assisted RIS Deployment and Energy-efficient Group Selection in mmWaves D2D Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer a viable way to improve the performance of multi-hop device-to-device (D2D) communication. However, due to the substantial propagation and penetration losses of the millimeter waves (mmWaves), a direct line of sight (LoS) link and close proximity of a device pair are required for a high data rate. Static obstacles like trees and buildings can easily impede the direct LoS connectivity between a device pair. Hence, RIS placement plays a crucial role in establishing an indirect LoS link between them. Therefore, in this work, we propose a set cover-based RIS deployment strategy for both single and double RIS-assisted D2D communication. In particular, we have demonstrated that permitting reflections via two consecutive RISs can greatly lower the RIS density in the environment, preventing resource waste and enabling the service of more obstructed device pairs. After the RIS deployment, for information transfer, we also propose an energy-efficient group selection criteria. Moreover, we prove that sometimes double reflections are more beneficial than single reflection, which is counter-intuitive. Numerical results show that our approach outperforms a random and a recent deployment strategy.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Multifractal Image Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multifractal analysis (MFA) provides a framework for the global characterization of image textures by describing the spatial fluctuations of their local regularity based on the multifractal spectrum. Several works have shown the interest of using MFA for the description of homogeneous textures in images. Nevertheless, natural images can be composed of several textures and, in turn, multifractal properties associated with those textures. This paper introduces a Bayesian multifractal segmentation method to model and segment multifractal textures by jointly estimating the multifractal parameters and labels on images. For this, a computationally and statistically efficient multifractal parameter estimation model for wavelet leaders is firstly developed, defining different multifractality parameters to different regions of an image. Then, a multiscale Potts Markov random field is introduced as a prior to model the inherent spatial and scale correlations between the labels of the wavelet leaders. A Gibbs sampling methodology is employed to draw samples from the posterior distribution of the parameters. Numerical experiments are conducted on synthetic multifractal images to evaluate the performance of the proposed segmentation approach. The proposed method achieves superior performance compared to traditional unsupervised segmentation techniques as well as modern deep learning-based approaches, showing its effectiveness for multifractal image segmentation.</description>

      <title>AI-RAN: Transforming RAN with AI-driven Computing Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radio access network (RAN) landscape is undergoing a transformative shift from traditional, communication-centric infrastructures towards converged compute-communication platforms. This article introduces AI-RAN which integrates both RAN and artificial intelligence (AI) workloads on the same infrastructure. By doing so, AI-RAN not only meets the performance demands of future networks but also improves asset utilization. We begin by examining how RANs have evolved beyond mobile broadband towards AI-RAN and articulating manifestations of AI-RAN into three forms: AI-for-RAN, AI-on-RAN, and AI-and-RAN. Next, we identify the key requirements and enablers for the convergence of communication and computing in AI-RAN. We then provide a reference architecture for advancing AI-RAN from concept to practice. To illustrate the practical potential of AI-RAN, we present a proof-of-concept that concurrently processes RAN and AI workloads utilizing NVIDIA Grace-Hopper GH200 servers. Finally, we conclude the article by outlining future work directions to guide further developments of AI-RAN.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Delay-Doppler Shift: A Simple Transmit Diversity Technique for Delay-Doppler Waveforms in Doubly Selective Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11179v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Delay-Doppler waveform design has been considered as a promising solution to achieve reliable communication under high-mobility channels for the space-air-ground-integrated networks (SAGIN). In this paper, we introduce the cyclic delay-Doppler shift (CDDS) technique for delay-Doppler waveforms to extract transmit diversity in doubly selective channels. Two simple CDDS schemes, named time-domain CDDS (TD-CDDS) and modulation-domain CDDS (MD-CDDS), are proposed in the setting of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). We demonstrate the applications of CDDS on two representative delay-Doppler waveforms, namely orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM), by deriving their corresponding CDDS matrices. Furthermore, we prove theoretically and experimentally that CDDS can provide OTFS and AFDM with full transmit diversity gain on most occasions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A low-power integer-N frequency synthesizer for flexible on-chip clock generation has been designed in 65 nm CMOS technology. The circuit can be programmed to generate two independent low-jitter clocks between 30 MHz and 3 GHz that are locked a 10-50 MHz reference input. The design uses a phase-locked loop (PLL) with a dual-tuned LC voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), programmable feedback divider, and dual output dividers. The total power consumption from 1.2 V and 0.8 V supplies is 4.0 mW. Experimental results confirm the functionality of the proposed synthesizer over a wide range of output frequencies.</description>

      <title>Resilient Distributed Optimization for Multi-Agent Cyberphysical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on the problem of distributed optimization in multi-agent cyberphysical systems, where a legitimate agent's iterates are influenced both by the values it receives from potentially malicious neighboring agents, and by its own self-serving target function. We develop a new algorithmic and analytical framework to achieve resilience for the class of problems where stochastic values of trust between agents exist and can be exploited. In this case, we show that convergence to the true global optimal point can be recovered, both in mean and almost surely, even in the presence of malicious agents. Furthermore, we provide expected convergence rate guarantees in the form of upper bounds on the expected squared distance to the optimal value. Finally, numerical results are presented that validate our analytical convergence guarantees even when the malicious agents compose the majority of agents in the network and where existing methods fail to converge to the optimal nominal points.</description>

      <title>Delay Sensitive Hierarchical Federated Learning with Stochastic Local Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The impact of local averaging on the performance of federated learning (FL) systems is studied in the presence of communication delay between the clients and the parameter server. To minimize the effect of delay, clients are assigned into different groups, each having its own local parameter server (LPS) that aggregates its clients' models. The groups' models are then aggregated at a global parameter server (GPS) that only communicates with the LPSs. Such setting is known as hierarchical FL (HFL). Unlike most works in the literature, the number of local and global communication rounds in our work is randomly determined by the (different) delays experienced by each group of clients. Specifically, the number of local averaging rounds is tied to a wall-clock time period coined the sync time $S$, after which the LPSs synchronize their models by sharing them with the GPS. Such sync time $S$ is then reapplied until a global wall-clock time is exhausted.
  First, an upper bound on the deviation between the updated model at each LPS with respect to that available at the GPS is derived. This is then used as a tool to derive the convergence analysis of our proposed delay-sensitive HFL algorithm, first at each LPS individually, and then at the GPS. Our theoretical convergence bound showcases the effects of the whole system's parameters, including the number of groups, the number of clients per group, and the value of $S$. Our results show that the value of $S$ should be carefully chosen, especially since it implicitly governs how the delay statistics affect the performance of HFL in situations where training time is restricted.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Holographic MIMO Based Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14129v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A holographic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-based integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) framework is proposed for both downlink and uplink scenarios. The spatial correlation is incorporated into the communication channel modeling, while a spherical wave-based model is used to characterize the sensing link. By considering both instantaneous and statistical channel state information, closed-form expressions are derived for sensing rates (SRs), communication rates (CRs), and outage probabilities under various ISAC designs. This enables an investigation into the theoretical performance limits of the proposed holographic MIMO-based ISAC (HISAC) framework. Further insights are gained by examining the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) slopes and diversity orders. Specifically: i) for the downlink case, a sensing-centric (S-C) design and a communications-centric (C-C) design are investigated using different beamforming strategies, and a Pareto optimal design is proposed to characterize the attainable SR-CR region; ii) for the uplink case, the S-C design and the C-C design differ in the interference cancellation order between the communication and sensing signals, with the rate region obtained through a time-sharing strategy. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate that HISAC systems outperform both conventional MIMO-based ISAC systems and holographic MIMO-based frequency-division sensing and communications systems, underscoring the superior performance of the HISAC framework.</description>

      <title>Approximation properties relative to continuous scale space for hybrid discretizations of Gaussian derivative operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05095v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of properties of two hybrid discretization methods for Gaussian derivatives, based on convolutions with either the normalized sampled Gaussian kernel or the integrated Gaussian kernel followed by central differences. The motivation for studying these discretization methods is that in situations when multiple spatial derivatives of different order are needed at the same scale level, they can be computed significantly more efficiently compared to more direct derivative approximations based on explicit convolutions with either sampled Gaussian kernels or integrated Gaussian kernels.
  While these computational benefits do also hold for the genuinely discrete approach for computing discrete analogues of Gaussian derivatives, based on convolution with the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel followed by central differences, the underlying mathematical primitives for the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel, in terms of modified Bessel functions of integer order, may not be available in certain frameworks for image processing, such as when performing deep learning based on scale-parameterized filters in terms of Gaussian derivatives, with learning of the scale levels.
  In this paper, we present a characterization of the properties of these hybrid discretization methods, in terms of quantitative performance measures concerning the amount of spatial smoothing that they imply, as well as the relative consistency of scale estimates obtained from scale-invariant feature detectors with automatic scale selection, with an emphasis on the behaviour for very small values of the scale parameter, which may differ significantly from corresponding results obtained from the fully continuous scale-space theory, as well as between different types of discretization methods.</description>

      <title>CrossFi: A Cross Domain Wi-Fi Sensing Framework Based on Siamese Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Wi-Fi sensing has garnered significant attention due to its numerous benefits, such as privacy protection, low cost, and penetration ability. Extensive research has been conducted in this field, focusing on areas such as gesture recognition, people identification, and fall detection. However, many data-driven methods encounter challenges related to domain shift, where the model fails to perform well in environments different from the training data. One major factor contributing to this issue is the limited availability of Wi-Fi sensing datasets, which makes models learn excessive irrelevant information and over-fit to the training set. Unfortunately, collecting large-scale Wi-Fi sensing datasets across diverse scenarios is a challenging task. To address this problem, we propose CrossFi, a siamese network-based approach that excels in both in-domain scenario and cross-domain scenario, including few-shot, zero-shot scenarios, and even works in few-shot new-class scenario where testing set contains new categories. The core component of CrossFi is a sample-similarity calculation network called CSi-Net, which improves the structure of the siamese network by using an attention mechanism to capture similarity information, instead of simply calculating the distance or cosine similarity. Based on it, we develop an extra Weight-Net that can generate a template for each class, so that our CrossFi can work in different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our CrossFi achieves state-of-the-art performance across various scenarios. In gesture recognition task, our CrossFi achieves an accuracy of 98.17% in in-domain scenario, 91.72% in one-shot cross-domain scenario, 64.81% in zero-shot cross-domain scenario, and 84.75% in one-shot new-class scenario. The code for our model is publicly available at https://github.com/RS2002/CrossFi.</description>

      <title>Sparse Low-Ranked Self-Attention Transformer for Remaining Useful Lifetime Prediction of Optical Fiber Amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14378v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical fiber amplifiers are key elements in present optical networks. Failures of these components result in high financial loss of income of the network operator as the communication traffic over an affected link is interrupted. Applying Remaining useful lifetime (RUL) prediction in the context of Predictive Maintenance (PdM) to optical fiber amplifiers to predict upcoming system failures at an early stage, so that network outages can be minimized through planning of targeted maintenance actions, ensures reliability and safety. Optical fiber amplifier are complex systems, that work under various operating conditions, which makes correct forecasting a difficult task. Increased monitoring capabilities of systems results in datasets that facilitate the application of data-driven RUL prediction methods. Deep learning models in particular have shown good performance, but generalization based on comparatively small datasets for RUL prediction is difficult. In this paper, we propose Sparse Low-ranked self-Attention Transformer (SLAT) as a novel RUL prediction method. SLAT is based on an encoder-decoder architecture, wherein two parallel working encoders extract features for sensors and time steps. By utilizing the self-attention mechanism, long-term dependencies can be learned from long sequences. The implementation of sparsity in the attention matrix and a low-rank parametrization reduce overfitting and increase generalization. Experimental application to optical fiber amplifiers exemplified on EDFA, as well as a reference dataset from turbofan engines, shows that SLAT outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based Unsupervised Audio-visual Speech Enhancement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new unsupervised audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE) approach that combines a diffusion-based audio-visual speech generative model with a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) noise model. First, the diffusion model is pre-trained on clean speech conditioned on corresponding video data to simulate the speech generative distribution. This pre-trained model is then paired with the NMF-based noise model to estimate clean speech iteratively. Specifically, a diffusion-based posterior sampling approach is implemented within the reverse diffusion process, where after each iteration, a speech estimate is obtained and used to update the noise parameters. Experimental results confirm that the proposed AVSE approach not only outperforms its audio-only counterpart but also generalizes better than a recent supervised-generative AVSE method. Additionally, the new inference algorithm offers a better balance between inference speed and performance compared to the previous diffusion-based method.

      <title>CSL-L2M: Controllable Song-Level Lyric-to-Melody Generation Based on Conditional Transformer with Fine-Grained Lyric and Musical Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lyric-to-melody generation is a highly challenging task in the field of AI music generation. Due to the difficulty of learning strict yet weak correlations between lyrics and melodies, previous methods have suffered from weak controllability, low-quality and poorly structured generation. To address these challenges, we propose CSL-L2M, a controllable song-level lyric-to-melody generation method based on an in-attention Transformer decoder with fine-grained lyric and musical controls, which is able to generate full-song melodies matched with the given lyrics and user-specified musical attributes. Specifically, we first introduce REMI-Aligned, a novel music representation that incorporates strict syllable- and sentence-level alignments between lyrics and melodies, facilitating precise alignment modeling. Subsequently, sentence-level semantic lyric embeddings independently extracted from a sentence-wise Transformer encoder are combined with word-level part-of-speech embeddings and syllable-level tone embeddings as fine-grained controls to enhance the controllability of lyrics over melody generation. Then we introduce human-labeled musical tags, sentence-level statistical musical attributes, and learned musical features extracted from a pre-trained VQ-VAE as coarse-grained, fine-grained and high-fidelity controls, respectively, to the generation process, thereby enabling user control over melody generation. Finally, an in-attention Transformer decoder technique is leveraged to exert fine-grained control over the full-song melody generation with the aforementioned lyric and musical conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed CSL-L2M outperforms the state-of-the-art models, generating melodies with higher quality, better controllability and enhanced structure.

      <title>AoI in Context-Aware Hybrid Radio-Optical IoT Networks</title>

Abstract: With the surge in IoT devices ranging from wearables to smart homes, prompt transmission is crucial. The Age of Information (AoI) emerges as a critical metric in this context, representing the freshness of the information transmitted across the network. This paper studies hybrid IoT networks that employ Optical Communication (OC) as a reinforcement medium to Radio Frequency (RF). We formulate a non-linear convex optimization that adopts a multi-objective optimization strategy to dynamically schedule the communication between devices and select their corresponding communication technology, aiming to balance the maximization of network throughput with the minimization of energy usage and the frequency of switching between technologies. To mitigate the impact of dominant sub-objectives and their scale disparity, the designed approach employs a regularization method that approximates adequate sub-objective scaling weights. Simulation results show that the OC supplementary integration alongside RF enhances the network's overall performances and significantly reduces the Mean AoI and Peak AoI, allowing the collection of the freshest possible data using the best available communication technology.</description>

      <title>A Tractable Approach for Queueing Analysis on Buffer-Aware Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-latency communication has recently attracted considerable attention owing to its potential of enabling delay-sensitive services in next-generation industrial cyber-physical systems. To achieve target average or maximum delay given random arrivals and time-varying channels, buffer-aware scheduling is expected to play a vital role. Evaluating and optimizing buffer-aware scheduling relies on its queueing analysis, while existing tools are not sufficiently tractable. Particularly, Markov chain and Monte-Carlo based approaches are computationally intensive, while large deviation theory (LDT) and extreme value theory (EVT) fail in providing satisfactory accuracy in the small-queue-length (SQL) regime. To tackle these challenges, a tractable yet accurate queueing analysis is presented by judiciously bridging Markovian analysis for the computationally manageable SQL regime and LDT/EVT for large-queue-length (LQL) regime where approximation error diminishes asymptotically. Specifically, we leverage censored Markov chain augmentation to approximate the original one in the SQL regime, while a piecewise approach is conceived to apply LDT/EVT across various queue-length intervals with different scheduling parameters. Furthermore, we derive closed-form bounds on approximation errors, validating the rigor and accuracy of our approach. As a case study, the approach is applied to analytically analyze a Lyapunov-drift-based cross-layer scheduling for wireless transmissions. Numerical results demonstrate its potential in balancing accuracy and complexity.</description>
