      <title>Deep thermalization under charge-conserving quantum dynamics</title>

Abstract: ``Deep thermalization'' describes the emergence of universal wavefunction distributions in quantum many-body dynamics, appearing on a local subsystem upon measurement of its environment. In this work, we study in detail the effect of continuous internal symmetries and associated conservation laws on deep thermalization. Concretely, we consider quantum spin systems with a $U(1)$ symmetry associated with the conservation of magnetization (or `charge'), and analyze how the choice of initial states (specifically, their degree of charge fluctuations) and the choice of measurement basis (specifically, whether or not it can reveal information about the local charge density) determine the ensuing universal wavefunction distributions. We find a rich set of possibilities. First we focus on the case of a random state of well-defined charge subjected to charge-revealing masurements, and rigorously prove that the projected ensemble approaches a direct sum of Haar ensembles in the charge sectors of the subsystem of interest. We then analytically derive the limiting wavefunction distributions for more general initial states and measurement bases, finding results that include the Haar ensemble, the ``Scrooge ensemble'' (a distortion of the Haar ensemble by a density matrix), and the ``generalized Scrooge ensemble'' (a stochastic mixture of multiple Scrooge ensembles). These represent nontrivial higher-moment generalizations of the Gibbs state, and notably can depend on the entire charge distribution of the initial state, not just its average. Our findings demonstrate a rich interplay between symmetries and the information extracted by measurements, which allows deep thermalization to exhibit a range of universal behaviors far beyond regular thermalization.</description>

      <title>Towards a Unified Benchmark and Framework for Deep Learning-Based Prediction of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Chemical Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of structure-spectrum relationships is essential for spectral interpretation, impacting structural elucidation and material design. Predicting spectra from molecular structures is challenging due to their complex relationships. Herein, we introduce NMRNet, a deep learning framework using the SE(3) Transformer for atomic environment modeling, following a pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. To support the evaluation of NMR chemical shift prediction models, we have established a comprehensive benchmark based on previous research and databases, covering diverse chemical systems. Applying NMRNet to these benchmark datasets, we achieve state-of-the-art performance in both liquid-state and solid-state NMR datasets, demonstrating its robustness and practical utility in real-world scenarios. This marks the first integration of solid and liquid state NMR within a unified model architecture, highlighting the need for domainspecific handling of different atomic environments. Our work sets a new standard for NMR prediction, advancing deep learning applications in analytical and structural chemistry.</description>

      <title>Autoregressive model path dependence near Ising criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive models are a class of generative model that probabilistically predict the next output of a sequence based on previous inputs. The autoregressive sequence is by definition one-dimensional (1D), which is natural for language tasks and hence an important component of modern architectures like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers. However, when language models are used to predict outputs on physical systems that are not intrinsically 1D, the question arises of which choice of autoregressive sequence -- if any -- is optimal. In this paper, we study the reconstruction of critical correlations in the two-dimensional (2D) Ising model, using RNNs and transformers trained on binary spin data obtained near the thermal phase transition. We compare the training performance for a number of different 1D autoregressive sequences imposed on finite-size 2D lattices. We find that paths with long 1D segments are more efficient at training the autoregressive models compared to space-filling curves that better preserve the 2D locality. Our results illustrate the potential importance in choosing the optimal autoregressive sequence ordering when training modern language models for tasks in physics.</description>

      <title>Topological inverse Anderson insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A different type of topological phase dubbed topological inverse Anderson insulators is proposed, which is characterized by the disorder-induced extended bulk states from the flat-band localization and topological edge states. Based on the topological invariant, the behaviors of the localization length of the zero-energy modes, and quantum transport, we identify its existence in several all-band-flat models with the disordered potentials or hopping including the $\pi$-flux Creutz ladder, the fully dimerized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain, and $\pi$-flux diamond chain. Unlike the topological Anderson insulator, where disorder induces localization and exponential suppression of transport, the disorder-assisted quantum ballistic coherent transport can appear in the topological inverse Anderson insulator. In addition, our proposal and results could be realized by the current experimental techniques.</description>

      <title>Critical analysis of multiple reentrant localization in an antiferromagnetic helix with transverse electric field: Hopping dimerization-free scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02778v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reentrant localization (RL), a recently prominent phenomenon, traditionally links to the interplay of staggered correlated disorder and hopping dimerization, as indicated by prior research. Contrary to this paradigm, our present study demonstrates that hopping dimerization is not a pivotal factor in realizing RL. Considering a helical magnetic system with antiferromagnetic ordering, we uncover spin-dependent RL at multiple energy regions, in the {\em absence} of hopping dimerization. This phenomenon persists even in the thermodynamic limit. The correlated disorder in the form of Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model is introduced by applying a transverse electric field to the helical system, circumventing the use of traditional substitutional disorder. We conduct a finite-size scaling analysis on the observed reentrant phases to identify critical points, determine associated critical exponents, and examine the scaling behavior linked to localization transitions. Additionally, we explore the parameter space to identify the conditions under which the reentrant phases occur. Described within a tight-binding framework, present work provides a novel outlook on RL, highlighting the crucial role of electric field, antiferromagnetic ordering, and the helicity of the geometry.</description>

      <title>Energy landscapes of combinatorial optimization in Ising machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-based Ising machines (IM) have been developed as dedicated processors for solving hard combinatorial optimization problems with higher speed and better energy efficiency. Generally, such systems employ local search heuristics to traverse energy landscapes in searching for optimal solutions. Here, we quantify and address some of the major challenges met by IMs by extending energy-landscape geometry visualization tools known as disconnectivity graphs. Using efficient sampling methods, we visually capture landscapes of problems having diverse structure and hardness manifesting as energetic and entropic barriers for IMs. We investigate energy barriers, local minima, and configuration space clustering effects caused by locality reduction methods when embedding combinatorial problems to the Ising hardware. To this end, we sample disconnectivity graphs of PUBO energy landscapes and their different QUBO mappings accounting for both local minima and saddle regions. We demonstrate that QUBO energy landscape properties lead to the subpar performance for quadratic IMs and suggest directions for their improvement.</description>
