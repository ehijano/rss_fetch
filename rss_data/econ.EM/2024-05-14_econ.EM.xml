      <title>Generalization Problems in Experiments Involving Multidimensional Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can the causal effects estimated in experiment be generalized to real-world scenarios? This question lies at the heart of social science studies. External validity primarily assesses whether experimental effects persist across different settings, implicitly presuming the experiment's ecological validity-that is, the consistency of experimental effects with their real-life counterparts. However, we argue that this presumed consistency may not always hold, especially in experiments involving multidimensional decision processes, such as conjoint experiments. We introduce a formal model to elucidate how attention and salience effects lead to three types of inconsistencies between experimental findings and real-world phenomena: amplified effect magnitude, effect sign reversal, and effect importance reversal. We derive testable hypotheses from each theoretical outcome and test these hypotheses using data from various existing conjoint experiments and our own experiments. Drawing on our theoretical framework, we propose several recommendations for experimental design aimed at enhancing the generalizability of survey experiment findings.</description>

      <title>Identifying Peer Effects in Networks with Unobserved Effort and Isolated Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peer influence on effort devoted to some activity is often studied using proxy variables when actual effort is unobserved. For instance, in education, academic effort is often proxied by GPA. We propose an alternative approach that circumvents this approximation. Our framework distinguishes unobserved shocks to GPA that do not affect effort from preference shocks that do affect effort levels. We show that peer effects estimates obtained using our approach can differ significantly from classical estimates (where effort is approximated) if the network includes isolated students. Applying our approach to data on high school students in the United States, we find that peer effect estimates relying on GPA as a proxy for effort are 40% lower than those obtained using our approach.</description>

      <title>On the Ollivier-Ricci curvature as fragility indicator of the stock markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, an indicator for stock market fragility and crash size in terms of the Ollivier-Ricci curvature has been proposed. We study analytical and empirical properties of such indicator, test its elasticity with respect to different parameters and provide heuristics for the parameters involved. We show when and how the indicator accurately describes a financial crisis. We also propose an alternate method for calculating the indicator using a specific sub-graph with special curvature properties.</description>

      <title>Kernel Three Pass Regression Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We forecast a single time series using a high-dimensional set of predictors. When these predictors share common underlying dynamics, an approximate latent factor model provides a powerful characterization of their co-movements Bai(2003). These latent factors succinctly summarize the data and can also be used for prediction, alleviating the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional prediction exercises, see Stock &amp; Watson (2002a). However, forecasting using these latent factors suffers from two potential drawbacks. First, not all pervasive factors among the set of predictors may be relevant, and using all of them can lead to inefficient forecasts. The second shortcoming is the assumption of linear dependence of predictors on the underlying factors. The first issue can be addressed by using some form of supervision, which leads to the omission of irrelevant information. One example is the three-pass regression filter proposed by Kelly &amp; Pruitt (2015). We extend their framework to cases where the form of dependence might be nonlinear by developing a new estimator, which we refer to as the Kernel Three-Pass Regression Filter (K3PRF). This alleviates the aforementioned second shortcoming. The estimator is computationally efficient and performs well empirically. The short-term performance matches or exceeds that of established models, while the long-term performance shows significant improvement.</description>

      <title>Robust Inference for High-Dimensional Panel Data Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a robust estimation and inferential method for high-dimensional panel data models. Specifically, (1) we investigate the case where the number of regressors can grow faster than the sample size, (2) we pay particular attention to non-Gaussian, serially and cross-sectionally correlated and heteroskedastic error processes, and (3) we develop an estimation method for high-dimensional long-run covariance matrix using a thresholded estimator.
  Methodologically and technically, we develop two Nagaev-types of concentration inequalities: one for a partial sum and the other for a quadratic form, subject to a set of easily verifiable conditions. Leveraging these two inequalities, we also derive a non-asymptotic bound for the LASSO estimator, achieve asymptotic normality via the node-wise LASSO regression, and establish a sharp convergence rate for the thresholded heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) estimator.
  Our study thus provides the relevant literature with a complete toolkit for conducting inference about the parameters of interest involved in a high-dimensional panel data framework. We also demonstrate the practical relevance of these theoretical results by investigating a high-dimensional panel data model with interactive fixed effects. Moreover, we conduct extensive numerical studies using simulated and real data examples.</description>

      <title>Uniform Inference for Subsampled Moment Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for constructing a confidence region for the solution to a conditional moment equation. The method is built around a class of algorithms for nonparametric regression based on subsampled kernels. This class includes random forest regression. We bound the error in the confidence region's nominal coverage probability, under the restriction that the conditional moment equation of interest satisfies a local orthogonality condition. The method is applicable to the construction of confidence regions for conditional average treatment effects in randomized experiments, among many other similar problems encountered in applied economics and causal inference. As a by-product, we obtain several new order-explicit results on the concentration and normal approximation of high-dimensional $U$-statistics.</description>

      <title>Unit Averaging for Heterogeneous Panels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.14205v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we introduce a unit averaging procedure to efficiently recover unit-specific parameters in a heterogeneous panel model. The procedure consists in estimating the parameter of a given unit using a weighted average of all the unit-specific parameter estimators in the panel. The weights of the average are determined by minimizing an MSE criterion we derive. We analyze the properties of the resulting minimum MSE unit averaging estimator in a local heterogeneity framework inspired by the literature on frequentist model averaging, and we derive the local asymptotic distribution of the estimator and the corresponding weights. The benefits of the procedure are showcased with an application to forecasting unemployment rates for a panel of German regions.</description>

      <title>Interpreting TSLS Estimators in Information Provision Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04793v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To estimate the causal effects of beliefs on actions, researchers often conduct information provision experiments. We consider the causal interpretation of two-stage least squares (TSLS) estimators in these experiments. In particular, we characterize common TSLS estimators as weighted averages of causal effects, and interpret these weights under general belief updating conditions that nest parametric models from the literature. Our framework accommodates TSLS estimators for both active and passive control designs. Notably, we find that some passive control estimators allow for negative weights, which compromises their causal interpretation. We give practical guidance on such issues, and illustrate our results in two empirical applications.</description>

      <title>Functional Spatial Autoregressive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel spatial autoregressive model in which the dependent variable is a function that may exhibit functional autocorrelation with the outcome functions of nearby units. This model can be characterized as a simultaneous integral equation system, which, in general, does not necessarily have a unique solution. For this issue, we provide a simple condition on the magnitude of the spatial interaction to ensure the uniqueness in data realization. For estimation, to account for the endogeneity caused by the spatial interaction, we propose a regularized two-stage least squares estimator based on a basis approximation for the functional parameter. The asymptotic properties of the estimator including the consistency and asymptotic normality are investigated under certain conditions. Additionally, we propose a simple Wald-type test for detecting the presence of spatial effects. As an empirical illustration, we apply the proposed model and method to analyze age distributions in Japanese cities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces marginal density functions of the general Bayesian Markov-Switching Vector Autoregressive (MS-VAR) process. In the case of the Bayesian MS-VAR process, we provide closed--form density functions and Monte-Carlo simulation algorithms, including the importance sampling method. The Monte-Carlo simulation method departs from the previous simulation methods because it removes the duplication in a regime vector.</description>

      <title>Post Reinforcement Learning Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08854v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider estimation and inference using data collected from reinforcement learning algorithms. These algorithms, characterized by their adaptive experimentation, interact with individual units over multiple stages, dynamically adjusting their strategies based on previous interactions. Our goal is to evaluate a counterfactual policy post-data collection and estimate structural parameters, like dynamic treatment effects, which can be used for credit assignment and determining the effect of earlier actions on final outcomes. Such parameters of interest can be framed as solutions to moment equations, but not minimizers of a population loss function, leading to Z-estimation approaches for static data. However, in the adaptive data collection environment of reinforcement learning, where algorithms deploy nonstationary behavior policies, standard estimators do not achieve asymptotic normality due to the fluctuating variance. We propose a weighted Z-estimation approach with carefully designed adaptive weights to stabilize the time-varying estimation variance. We identify proper weighting schemes to restore the consistency and asymptotic normality of the weighted Z-estimators for target parameters, which allows for hypothesis testing and constructing uniform confidence regions. Primary applications include dynamic treatment effect estimation and dynamic off-policy evaluation.</description>

      <title>A dual approach to nonparametric characterization for random utility models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a novel characterization for random utility models (RUM), which turns out to be a dual representation of the characterization by Kitamura and Stoye (2018, ECMA). For a given family of budgets and its "patch" representation \'a la Kitamura and Stoye, we construct a matrix $\Xi$ of which each row vector indicates the structure of possible revealed preference relations in each subfamily of budgets. Then, it is shown that a stochastic demand system on the patches of budget lines, say $\pi$, is consistent with a RUM, if and only if $\Xi\pi \geq \mathbb{1}$. In addition to providing a concise quantifier-free characterization, especially when $\pi$ is inconsistent with RUMs, the vector $\Xi\pi$ also contains information concerning (1) sub-families of budgets in which cyclical choices must occur with positive probabilities, and (2) the maximal possible weights on rational choice patterns in a population. The notion of Chv\'atal rank of polytopes and the duality theorem in linear programming play key roles to obtain these results.</description>

      <title>Liquidity Jump, Liquidity Diffusion, and Treatment on Wash Trading of Crypto Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07222v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that the liquidity of an asset includes two components: liquidity jump and liquidity diffusion. We show that liquidity diffusion has a higher correlation with crypto wash trading than liquidity jump and demonstrate that treatment on wash trading significantly reduces the level of liquidity diffusion, but only marginally reduces that of liquidity jump. We confirm that the autoregressive models are highly effective in modeling the liquidity-adjusted return with and without the treatment on wash trading. We argue that treatment on wash trading is unnecessary in modeling established crypto assets that trade in unregulated but mainstream exchanges.</description>
