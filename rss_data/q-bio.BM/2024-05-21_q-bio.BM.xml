      <title>Uni-Mol Docking V2: Towards Realistic and Accurate Binding Pose Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, machine learning (ML) methods have emerged as promising alternatives for molecular docking, offering the potential for high accuracy without incurring prohibitive computational costs. However, recent studies have indicated that these ML models may overfit to quantitative metrics while neglecting the physical constraints inherent in the problem. In this work, we present Uni-Mol Docking V2, which demonstrates a remarkable improvement in performance, accurately predicting the binding poses of 77+% of ligands in the PoseBusters benchmark with an RMSD value of less than 2.0 {\AA}, and 75+% passing all quality checks. This represents a significant increase from the 62% achieved by the previous Uni-Mol Docking model. Notably, our Uni-Mol Docking approach generates chemically accurate predictions, circumventing issues such as chirality inversions and steric clashes that have plagued previous ML models. Furthermore, we observe enhanced performance in terms of high-quality predictions (RMSD values of less than 1.0 {\AA} and 1.5 {\AA}) and physical soundness when Uni-Mol Docking is combined with more physics-based methods like Uni-Dock. Our results represent a significant advancement in the application of artificial intelligence for scientific research, adopting a holistic approach to ligand docking that is well-suited for industrial applications in virtual screening and drug design. The code, data and service for Uni-Mol Docking are publicly available for use and further development in https://github.com/dptech-corp/Uni-Mol.</description>

      <title>Competitive ligand binding kinetics to linear polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Different types of ligands compete in binding to polymers with different consequences for the physical and chemical properties of the resulting complex. Here, we derive a general kinetic model for the competitive binding kinetics of different types of ligands to a linear polymer, using the McGhee and von Hippel detailed binding site counting procedure. The derived model allows the description of the competitive binding process in terms of the size of the ligand, binding and release rates, and cooperativity parameters. We illustrate the implications of the general theory showing the equations for the competitive binding of two ligands. The size of the ligand, given by the number of monomers occluded, is shown to have a great impact in competitive binding. Ligands requiring a large available gap for binding are strongly inhibited by smaller ligands. Ligand size then has a leading role compared to binding affinity or cooperativity. For ligands that can bind in different modes (i.e., different number of monomers), this implies that they are more effective in covering or passivating the polymer in lower modes, if the different modes have similar binding energies.</description>

      <title>Guided Multi-objective Generative AI to Enhance Structure-based Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery. Yet, despite recent advances in machine learning, existing models cannot generate molecules that satisfy all desired physicochemical properties. Herein, we describe IDOLpro, a novel generative chemistry AI combining deep diffusion with multi-objective optimization for structure-based drug design. The latent variables of the diffusion model are guided by differentiable scoring functions to explore uncharted chemical space and generate novel ligands in silico, optimizing a plurality of target physicochemical properties. We demonstrate its effectiveness by generating ligands with optimized binding affinity and synthetic accessibility on two benchmark sets. IDOLpro produces ligands with binding affinities over 10% higher than the next best state-of-the-art on each test set. On a test set of experimental complexes, IDOLpro is the first to surpass the performance of experimentally observed ligands. IDOLpro can accommodate other scoring functions (e.g. ADME-Tox) to accelerate hit-finding, hit-to-lead, and lead optimization for drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Recent methods from statistical inference and machine learning to improve integrative modeling of macromolecular assemblies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17894v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrative modeling of macromolecular assemblies allows for structural characterization of large assemblies that are recalcitrant to direct experimental observation. A Bayesian inference approach facilitates combining data from complementary experiments along with physical principles, statistics of known structures, and prior models, for structure determination. Here, we review recent methods for integrative modeling based on statistical inference and machine learning. These methods improve over the current state-of-the-art by enhancing the data collection, optimizing coarse-grained model representations, making scoring functions more accurate, sampling more efficient, and model analysis more rigorous. We also discuss three new frontiers in integrative modeling: incorporating recent deep learning-based methods, integrative modeling with in situ data, and metamodeling.</description>

      <title>Pre-Training on Large-Scale Generated Docking Conformations with HelixDock to Unlock the Potential of Protein-ligand Structure Prediction Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13913v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein-ligand structure prediction is an essential task in drug discovery, predicting the binding interactions between small molecules (ligands) and target proteins (receptors). Recent advances have incorporated deep learning techniques to improve the accuracy of protein-ligand structure prediction. Nevertheless, the experimental validation of docking conformations remains costly, it raises concerns regarding the generalizability of these deep learning-based methods due to the limited training data. In this work, we show that by pre-training on a large-scale docking conformation generated by traditional physics-based docking tools and then fine-tuning with a limited set of experimentally validated receptor-ligand complexes, we can obtain a protein-ligand structure prediction model with outstanding performance. Specifically, this process involved the generation of 100 million docking conformations for protein-ligand pairings, an endeavor consuming roughly 1 million CPU core days. The proposed model, HelixDock, aims to acquire the physical knowledge encapsulated by the physics-based docking tools during the pre-training phase. HelixDock has been rigorously benchmarked against both physics-based and deep learning-based baselines, demonstrating its exceptional precision and robust transferability in predicting binding confirmation. In addition, our investigation reveals the scaling laws governing pre-trained protein-ligand structure prediction models, indicating a consistent enhancement in performance with increases in model parameters and the volume of pre-training data. Moreover, we applied HelixDock to several drug discovery-related tasks to validate its practical utility. HelixDock demonstrates outstanding capabilities on both cross-docking and structure-based virtual screening benchmarks.</description>
