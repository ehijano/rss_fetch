      <title>Lectures on stabilized ellipsoid embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes are based on a five-part minicourse on stabilized symplectic embeddings given in Les Mar\'ecottes, Switzerland during a September 2025 workshop. Our main goal is to explain the recent resolution of the (restricted) stabilized ellipsoid embedding problem by D. McDuff and the author. Along the way we also introduce various other ideas which shed light on the context and hint at possible generalizations. Some of the concepts covered include sesquicuspidal curves, symplectic inflation, multidirectional tangency constraints, well-placed curves, cluster transformations, Looijenga pairs, toric models, scattering diagrams, and the tropical vertex theorem.</description>

      <title>Double flip bifurcations in $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-symmetric Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a new bifurcation in Hamiltonian systems, which we call the double flip bifurcation. The Hamiltonian depends on two parameters, one of which controls the double flip bifurcation. The result of the bifurcation is the occurrence of two Hamiltonian flip bifurcations with respect to the other parameter. The two Hamiltonian flip bifurcations are simultaneous with respect to the first parameter, and are connected by a curve-segment of singular points. We find a normal form for Hamiltonians describing systems going through double flip bifurcations, and compute said normal form for some examples.</description>

      <title>On Ma\~n\'e's Critical Value for Tonelli Lagrangians on Half Lie-Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce Tonelli Lagrangians on half-Lie groups equipped with a strong right-invariant Riemannian metric. These are right-invariant Lagrangians defined on the tangent bundle of a half-Lie group with quadratic growth on each fiber. The main examples of half-Lie groups are groups of $H^s$ or $C^k$ diffeomorphisms of compact manifolds. We show that the Euler--Lagrange flow exists globally. We then introduce three thresholds of the energy, called the Ma~ne critical values, and prove that under mild regularity and completeness assumptions on the half-Lie group, any two points can be connected by a global Tonelli minimizer above the lowest of these energy thresholds. Under an additional assumption on the Lagrangian, such a minimizer is a flow line of the Euler--Lagrange flow. This extends the work of Contreras from closed finite-dimensional manifolds to the infinite-dimensional context. Moreover, our results also extend the recent work of Bauer, Harms, and Michor from geodesic flows to Euler--Lagrange flows of Tonelli Lagrangians. As an application, we obtain global well-posedness of all Euler--Poincare'e equations associated with Tonelli Lagrangians on half-Lie groups equipped with strong right-invariant Riemannian metrics.</description>

      <title>Cusped hyperbolic Lagrangians as mirrors to lines in three-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a Lagrangian in the cotangent bundle of a 3-torus whose projection to the fiber is a neighborhood of a tropical curve with a single 4-valent vertex. This Lagrangian has an isolated conical singular point, and its smooth locus is diffeomorphic to the minimally-twisted five component chain link complement, a cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold. From this singular Lagrangian, we construct an immersed Lagrangian, and determine when it is unobstructed in the wrapped Fukaya category. We show that for a generic line in projective 3-space, there is a local system on this immersed Lagrangian such that the resulting object of the wrapped Fukaya category is homologically mirror to an object of the derived category supported on the line. In the course of the proof, we construct a version of the wrapped Fukaya category with objects supported on Lagrangian immersions, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A Homotopical Invariant of Weinstein Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23377v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One generally expects that the techniques of arboreal singularities and gluing of local differential graded categories will result in a useful global invariant for all Weinstein manifolds. In this paper we construct explicit models for the homotopy limits of diagrams of microlocal sheaf categories which arise from Weinstein surfaces with arboreal skeleta. This is done by characterizing all relevant Reedy model structures on the categories of diagrams that we care about. We prove invariance using a complete set of moves for Weinstein homotopies in this setting. Finally we give combinatorial presentations of the invariant for all topological surfaces.</description>

      <title>A note on pullbacks and blowups of Lie algebroids, singular foliations, and Dirac structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03698v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lie algebroids, singular foliations, and Dirac structures are closely related objects. We examine the relation between their pullbacks under maps satisfying a constant rank or transversality assumption. A special case is given by blowdown maps. In that case, we also establish the relation between the blowup of a Lie algebroid and its singular foliation.</description>
