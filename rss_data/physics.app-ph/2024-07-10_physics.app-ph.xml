      <title>Unveiling mussel plaque core ductility: the role of pore distribution and hierarchical structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mussel thread-plaque system exhibits strong adhesion and high ductility, allowing it to adhere to various surfaces. While the microstructure of plaques has been thoroughly studied, the effect of their unique porous structure on ductility remains unclear. This study firstly investigated the porous structure of mussel plaque cores using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Two-dimensional (2D) porous representative volume elements (RVEs) with scaled distribution parameters were generated, and the calibrated phase-field modelling method was applied to analyse the effect of the pore distribution and multi-scale porous structure on the failure mechanism of porous RVEs. The SEM analysis revealed that large-scale pores exhibited a lognormal size distribution and a uniform spatial distribution. Simulations showed that increasing the normalised mean radius value of the large-scale pore distribution can statistically lead to a decreasing trend in ductility, strength and strain energy, but cannot solely determine their values. The interaction between pores can lead to two different failure modes under the same pore distribution: progressive failure mode and sudden failure mode. Additionally, the hierarchical structure of multi-scale porous RVEs can further increase ductility by 40%-60% compared to single-scale porous RVEs by reducing stiffness, highlighting the hierarchical structure could be another key factor contributing to the high ductility. These findings deepen our understanding of how the pore distribution and multi-scale porous structure in mussel plaques contribute to their high ductility and affect other mechanical properties, providing valuable insights for the future design of highly ductile biomimetic materials.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic interference control of a high-energy coherent electron beam using a three-element Boersch phase shifter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to static holographic phase shifters, which are restricted to specific electron beam energies and microscope settings, Boersch phase shifters are promising for creating programmable arrays for generating two- and three-dimensional electron beam patterns. We recently demonstrated a three-element Boersch phase shifter device [Thakkar et al., J. Appl. Phys. 128 (2020), 134502], which was fabricated by electron beam lithography and is compatible with up-scaling. However, it suffers from parasitic beam deflection and resulting cross-talk. Here, we report a five-layer phase shifter device, which is based on a metal-insulator-metal-insulator-metal structure (as originally envisioned by Boersch) that reduces cross-talk. We demonstrate a three-element Boersch phase shifter that shows minimal beam deflection of voltage-controlled three-electron-beam interference patterns in a transmission electron microscope operated at 200 keV. The feasibility of using such multi-element phase shifter arrays is discussed.</description>

      <title>Optoionic Impedance Spectroscopy (OIS): a model-less technique for in-situ electrochemical characterization of mixed ionic electronic conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06632v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional properties of mixed ionic electronic conductors (MIECs) can be radically modified by (de)insertion of mobile charged defects. A complete control of this dynamic behaviour has multiple applications in a myriad of fields including advanced computing, data processing, sensing or energy conversion. However, the effect of different MIECs state-of-charge is not fully understood yet and there is a lack of strategies for fully controlling the defect content in a material. In this work we present a model-less technique to characterize ionic defect concentration and ionic insertion kinetics in MIEC materials: Optoionic Impedance Spectroscopy (OIS). The proof of concept and advantages of OIS are demonstrated by studying the oxygen (de)insertion in thin films of hole-doped perovskite oxides. Ion migration into/out of the studied materials is achieved by the application of an electrochemical potential, achieving stable and reversible modification of its optical properties. By tracking the dynamic variation of optical properties depending on the gating conditions, OIS enables to extract electrochemical parameters involved in the electrochromic process. The results demonstrate the capability of the technique to effectively characterize the kinetics of single- and even multi- layer systems. The technique can be employed for studying underlying mechanisms of the response characteristics of MIEC-based devices.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable classifier based on spin torque driven magnetization switching in electrically connected magnetic tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A promising branch of neuromorphic computing aims to perform cognitive operations in hardware leveraging the physics of efficient and well-established nano-devices. In this work, we present a reconfigurable classifier based on a network of electrically connected magnetic tunnel junctions that categorizes information encoded in the amplitude of input currents through the spin torque driven magnetization switching output configuration. The network can be trained to classify new data by adjusting additional programming currents applied selectively to the junctions. We experimentally demonstrate that a network composed of three magnetic tunnel junctions can learn to classify spoken vowels with a recognition rate that surpasses the performance of software multilayer neural networks with the same number of trained parameters in this task. These results, obtained with the same nano-devices and working principle employed in industrial spin-transfer torque magnetic random-access memories (STT-MRAM), constitute an important step towards the development of large-scale neuromorphic networks based on well-established technology.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Simulating the Path-level Residual Stress in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing has revolutionized industries with its capability to create intricate and customized components. The LPBF process uses moving heat sources to melt and solidify metal powders. The fast melting and cooling leads to residual stress, which critically affects the part quality. Currently, the computational intensity of accurately simulating the residual stress on the path scale remains a significant challenge, limiting our understanding of the LPBF processes.
  This paper presents a framework for simulating the LPBF process residual stress based on the path-level thermal history. Compared with the existing approaches, the path-level simulation requires discretization only to capture the scanning path rather than the details of the melt pools, thus requiring less dense mesh and is more computationally efficient. We develop this framework by introducing a new concept termed effective thermal strain to capture the anisotropic thermal strain near and around the melt pool. We validate our approach with the high-fidelity results from the literature. We use the proposed approach to simulate various single-island scanning patterns and layers with multiple full and trimmed islands. We further investigate the influence of the path-level thermal history and the layer shape on the residual stress by analyzing their simulation results.</description>

      <title>Self-deployable contracting-cord metamaterials with tunable mechanical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in active materials and fabrication techniques have enabled the production of cyclically self-deployable metamaterials with an expanded functionality space. However, designing metamaterials that possess continuously tunable mechanical properties after self-deployment remains a challenge, notwithstanding its importance. Inspired by push puppets, we introduce an efficient design strategy to create reversibly self-deployable metamaterials with continuously tunable post-deployment stiffness and damping. Our metamaterial comprises contracting actuators threaded through beads with matching conical concavo-convex interfaces in networked chains. The slack network conforms to arbitrary shapes, but when actuated, it self-assembles into a preprogrammed configuration with beads gathered together. Further contraction of the actuators can dynamically tune the assembly's mechanical properties through the beads' particle jamming, while maintaining the overall structure with minimal change. We show that, after deployment, such metamaterials exhibit pronounced tunability in bending-dominated configurations: they can become more than 35 times stiffer and change their damping capability by over 50%. Through systematic analysis, we find that the beads'conical angle can introduce geometric nonlinearity, which has a major effect on the self-deployability and tunability of the metamaterial. Our work provides routes towards reversibly self-deployable, lightweight, and tunable metamaterials, with potential applications in soft robotics, reconfigurable architectures, and space engineering.</description>

      <title>Precision frequency tuning of tunable transmon qubits using alternating-bias assisted annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum processors are one of the leading platforms for realizing scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC). The recent demonstration of post-fabrication tuning of Josephson junctions using alternating-bias assisted annealing (ABAA) technique and a reduction in junction loss after ABAA illuminates a promising path towards precision tuning of qubit frequency while maintaining high coherence. Here, we demonstrate precision tuning of the maximum $|0\rangle\rightarrow |1\rangle$ transition frequency ($f_{01}^{\rm max}$) of tunable transmon qubits by performing ABAA at room temperature using commercially available test equipment. We characterize the impact of junction relaxation and aging on resistance spread after tuning, and demonstrate a frequency equivalent tuning precision of 7.7 MHz ($0.17\%$) based on targeted resistance tuning on hundreds of qubits, with a resistance tuning range up to $18.5\%$. Cryogenic measurements on tuned and untuned qubits show evidence of improved coherence after ABAA with no significant impact on tunability. Despite a small global offset, we show an empirical $f_{01}^{\rm max}$ tuning precision of 18.4 MHz by tuning a set of multi-qubit processors targeting their designed Hamiltonians. We experimentally characterize high-fidelity parametric resonance iSWAP gates on two ABAA-tuned 9-qubit processors with fidelity as high as $99.51\pm 0.20\%$. On the best-performing device, we measured across the device a median fidelity of $99.22\%$ and an average fidelity of $99.13\pm 0.12 \%$. Yield modeling analysis predicts high detuning-edge-yield using ABAA beyond the 1000-qubit scale. These results demonstrate the cutting-edge capability of frequency targeting using ABAA and open up a new avenue to systematically improving Hamiltonian targeting and optimization for scaling high-performance superconducting quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Charged Particle Resonance In Induction Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from First Principles, the space charge manipulation of charged particles in an induction field in free space based on an unique Magnetic field strength and its oscillation Frequency relationship is demonstrated numerically and theoretically. The Larmor precession frequency for a time varying magnetic field, instead of conventionally followed static magnetic field is derived for the first time. With the dispersion relation in Ion Resonance depending on its frequency of gyration, an AC driven electromagnet based particle resonance has been proposed circumventing the use of Superconducting Permanent Magnets. Complete resonance achieved under the proposed conditions results in a sustained, fixed-frequency particle trajectory that is independent of its speed or drift. Such oscillation is visualized in a D-Shaped Resonant assembly. The amplitude and the wavelength calculations for the trajectory are demonstrated analytically. Principally noting the objectives of Synchrotron in varying the magnetic field and its frequency to generate high energy particles, the present theory addresses the same. Its applications can be explored in Space Propulsion Systems, Magnetic Confinement Fusion, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and sub-harmonic heating and cooling. Using this theory one can aptly generate RF Power using device specific designed resonant antennas coupling it with with Plasma.</description>

      <title>The impact of microwave phase noise on diamond quantum sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision optical measurements of the electron-spin precession of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond form the basis of numerous applications. The most sensitivity-demanding applications, such as femtotesla magnetometry, require the ability to measure changes in GHz spin transition frequencies at the sub-millihertz level, corresponding to a fractional resolution of better than 10^{-12}. Here we study the impact of microwave (MW) phase noise on the response of an NV sensor. Fluctuations of the phase of the MW waveform cause undesired rotations of the NV spin state. These fluctuations are imprinted in the optical readout signal and, left unmitigated, are indistinguishable from magnetic field noise. We show that the phase noise of several common commercial MW generators results in an effective pT s^{1/2}-range noise floor that varies with the MW carrier frequency and the detection frequency of the pulse sequence. The data are described by a frequency domain model incorporating the MW phase noise spectrum and the filter-function response of the sensing protocol. For controlled injection of white and random-walk phase noise, the observed NV magnetic noise floor is described by simple analytic expressions that accurately capture the scaling with pulse sequence length and the number of pi pulses. We outline several strategies to suppress the impact of MW phase noise and implement a version, based on gradiometry, that realizes a &gt;10-fold suppression. Our study highlights an important challenge in the pursuit of sensitive diamond quantum sensors and is applicable to other qubit systems with a large transition frequency.</description>

      <title>Surface induced odd-frequency spin-triplet superconductivity as a veritable signature of Majorana bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We predict surface-induced odd-frequency (odd-$\nu$) spin-triplet superconducting pairing can be a veritable signature of Majorana bound states (MBS) in a Josephson nodal $p$-wave superconductor ($p_{x}$)-spin flipper (SF)-nodal $p$-wave superconductor ($p_{x}$) junction. Remarkably, in a $p_{x}$-SF-$p_{x}$ Josephson junction three distinct phases emerge: the topological phase featuring MBS, the topological phase without MBS, and the trivial phase devoid of MBS. Surface odd-$\nu$ spin-triplet pairing is induced only in the topological regime when MBS appears. In contrast, surface-induced even-frequency (even-$\nu$) spin-triplet pairing is finite regardless of the existence of MBS. Importantly, we find the surface induced odd-$\nu$ spin-triplet pairing is immune to disorder in the topological phase featuring MBS, while in the trivial phase the surface induced even-$\nu$ spin-triplet pairing is affected by disorder. Our study offers a potential means for distinguishing the topological phase featuring MBS from both the trivial phase as well as the topological phase devoid of MBS, primarily through the observation of induced surface odd-$\nu$ spin-triplet superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Synthetic iterative scheme for thermal applications in hotspot systems with large temperature variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A synthetic iterative scheme is developed for thermal applications in hotspot systems with large temperature variance. Different from previous work with linearized equilibrium state and small temperature difference assumption, the phonon equilibrium distribution shows a nonlinear relationship with temperature and mean free path changes with the spatial temperature when the temperature difference of system is large, so that the same phonon mode may suffer different transport processes in different geometric regions. In order to efficiently capture nonlinear and multiscale thermal behaviors, the Newton method is used and a macroscopic iteration is introduced for preprocessing based on the iterative solutions of the stationary phonon BTE. Macroscopic and mesoscopic physical evolution processes are connected by the heat flux, which is no longer calculated by classical Fourier's law but obtained by taking the moment of phonon distribution function. These two processes exchange information from different scales, such that the present scheme could efficiently deal with heat conduction problems from ballistic to diffusive regime. Numerical tests show that the present scheme could efficiently capture the multiscale heat conduction in hotspot systems with large temperature variances. In addition, a comparison is made between the solutions of the present scheme and effective Fourier's law by several heat dissipations problems under different sizes or selective phonon excitation. Numerical results show that compared to the classical Fourier's law, the results of the effective Fourier's law could be closer to the BTE solutions by adjusting effective coefficients. However, it is still difficult to capture some local nonlinear phenomena in complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Active Control of Bound States in the Continuum in Toroidal Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The remarkable properties of toroidal metasurfaces, featuring ultrahigh-Q bound states in the continuum (BIC) resonances and nonradiating anapole modes, have garnered significant attention. The active manipulation of quasi-BIC resonance characteristics offers substantial potential for advancing tunable metasurfaces. Our study explores explicitly the application of vanadium dioxide, a phase change material widely used in active photonics and room-temperature bolometric detectors, to control quasi-BIC resonances in toroidal metasurfaces. The phase change transition of vanadium dioxide occurs in a narrow temperature range, providing a large variation in material resistivity. Through heating thin film patches of vanadium dioxide integrated into a metasurface comprising gold split-ring resonators on a sapphire substrate, we achieve remarkable control over the amplitude and frequency of quasi-BIC resonances due to their high sensitivity to losses present in the system. Breaking the symmetry of meta-atoms reveals enhanced tunability. The predicted maximum change in the quasi-BIC resonance amplitude reaches 14 dB with a temperature variation of approximately 10 {\deg}C.</description>
