      <title>Detecting gene-environment interactions to guide personalized intervention: boosting distributional regression for polygenic scores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polygenic risk scores can be used to model the individual genetic liability for human traits. Current methods primarily focus on modeling the mean of a phenotype neglecting the variance. However, genetic variants associated with phenotypic variance can provide important insights to gene-environment interaction studies. To overcome this, we propose snpboostlss, a cyclical gradient boosting algorithm for a Gaussian location-scale model to jointly derive sparse polygenic models for both the mean and the variance of a quantitative phenotype. To improve computational efficiency on high-dimensional and large-scale genotype data (large n and large p), we only consider a batch of most relevant variants in each boosting step. We investigate the effect of statins therapy (the environmental factor) on low-density lipoprotein in the UK Biobank cohort using the new snpboostlss algorithm. We are able to verify the interaction between statins usage and the polygenic risk scores for phenotypic variance in both cross sectional and longitudinal analyses. Particularly, following the spirit of target trial emulation, we observe that the treatment effect of statins is more substantial in people with higher polygenic risk scores for phenotypic variance, indicating gene-environment interaction. When applying to body mass index, the newly constructed polygenic risk scores for variance show significant interaction with physical activity and sedentary behavior. Therefore, the polygenic risk scores for phenotypic variance derived by snpboostlss have potential to identify individuals that could benefit more from environmental changes (e.g. medical intervention and lifestyle changes).</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Clustering Stopping Rule Based on Multivariate Median</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18730v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel nonparametric criterion for determining the appropriate number of clusters, which is derived from the spatial median. The method is constructed to reconcile two competing objectives of cluster analysis: the preservation of internal homogeneity within clusters and the maximization of heterogeneity across clusters. To this end, the proposed algorithm optimizes the ratio of inter-cluster to intra-cluster variability, incorporating adjustments for both the sample size and the number of clusters. Unlike conventional techniques, the method is distribution-free and demonstrates robustness in the presence of outliers. Its properties were first examined through extensive simulation studies, followed by empirical evaluations on three applied datasets. To further assess comparative performance, the proposed procedure was benchmarked against 13 established algorithms for cluster number determination. In 11 of these comparisons, the proposed criterion exhibited superior performance, thereby underscoring its utility as a reliable and rigorous alternative for multivariate clustering applications.</description>

      <title>Testing Hypotheses regarding Covariance and Correlation matrices with the R package CovCorTest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In addition to the commonly analyzed measures of location, dispersion measurements such as variance and correlation provide many valuable information. Consequently, they play a crucial role in multivariate statistics, which leads to tests regarding covariance and correlation matrices. Furthermore, also the structure of these matrices leads to important hypotheses of interest, since it contains substantial information about the underlying model. In fact, assumptions regarding the structures of covariance and correlation matrices are often fundamental in statistical modelling and testing.
  In this context, semi-parametric settings with minimal distributional assumptions and very general hypotheses are essential for enabling manifold usage. The free available package CovCorTest provides suitable tests addressing all aforementioned issues, using bootstrap and similar techniques to achieve good performance, particularly in small samples. Additionally, the package offers flexible specification options for the hypotheses under investigation in two central tests, accommodating users with varying levels of expertise, which results in high flexibility and user-friendliness at the same time. This paper also presents the application of \textbf{CovCorTest} for various issues, illustrated by multiple examples, where the tests are applied to a real-world dataset.</description>

      <title>Energy based diffusion generator for efficient sampling of Boltzmann distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02080v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling from Boltzmann distributions, particularly those tied to high dimensional and complex energy functions, poses a significant challenge in many fields. In this work, we present the Energy-Based Diffusion Generator (EDG), a novel approach that integrates ideas from variational autoencoders and diffusion models. EDG uses a decoder to generate Boltzmann-distributed samples from simple latent variables, and a diffusion-based encoder to estimate the Kullback-Leibler divergence to the target distribution. Notably, EDG is simulation-free, eliminating the need to solve ordinary or stochastic differential equations during training. Furthermore, by removing constraints such as bijectivity in the decoder, EDG allows for flexible network design. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate the superior performance of EDG across a variety of sampling tasks with complex target distributions, outperforming existing methods.</description>

      <title>Geometry and factorization of multivariate Markov chains with applications to MCMC acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12589v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the factorizability and geometry of transition matrices of multivariate Markov chains. Specifically, we demonstrate that the induced chains on factors of a product space can be regarded as information projections with respect to the Kullback-Leibler divergence. This perspective yields Han-Shearer type inequalities and submodularity of the entropy rate of Markov chains, as well as applications in the context of large deviations and mixing time comparison. As concrete algorithmic applications in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), we provide two illustrations based on lifted MCMC and swapping algorithm respectively to demonstrate projection samplers improve mixing over the original samplers. The projection sampler based on the swapping algorithm resamples the highest-temperature coordinate at stationarity at each step, and we prove that such practice accelerates the mixing time by multiplicative factors related to the number of temperatures and the dimension of the underlying state space when compared with the original swapping algorithm. Through simple numerical experiments on a bimodal target distribution, we show that the projection samplers mix effectively, in contrast to lifted MCMC and the swapping algorithm, which mix less well.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Time-Dependent PDE Surrogates: Graph Neural Simulators vs. Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing accurate, data-efficient surrogate models is central to advancing AI for Science. Neural operators (NOs), which approximate mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces using conventional neural architectures, have gained popularity as surrogates for systems driven by partial differential equations (PDEs). However, their reliance on large datasets and limited ability to generalize in low-data regimes hinder their practical utility. We argue that these limitations arise from their global processing of data, which fails to exploit the local, discretized structure of physical systems. To address this, we propose Graph Neural Simulators (GNS) as a principled surrogate modeling paradigm for time-dependent PDEs. GNS leverages message-passing combined with numerical time-stepping schemes to learn PDE dynamics by modeling the instantaneous time derivatives. This design mimics traditional numerical solvers, enabling stable long-horizon rollouts and strong inductive biases that enhance generalization. We rigorously evaluate GNS on four canonical PDE systems: (1) 2D scalar Burgers', (2) 2D coupled Burgers', (3) 2D Allen-Cahn, and (4) 2D nonlinear shallow-water equations, comparing against state-of-the-art NOs including Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) and Fourier Neural Operator (FNO). Results demonstrate that GNS is markedly more data-efficient, achieving less than 1% relative L2 error using only 3% of available trajectories, and exhibits dramatically reduced error accumulation over time (82.5% lower autoregressive error than FNO, 99.9% lower than DeepONet). To choose the training data, we introduce a PCA combined with KMeans trajectory selection strategy. These findings provide compelling evidence that GNS, with its graph-based locality and solver-inspired design, is the most suitable and scalable surrogate modeling framework for AI-driven scientific discovery.</description>
