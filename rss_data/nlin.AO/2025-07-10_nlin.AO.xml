      <title>Multiple Timescale Dynamics of Network Adaptation with Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive network dynamical systems describe the co-evolution of dynamical quantities on the nodes as well as dynamics of the network connections themselves. For dense networks of many nodes, the resulting dynamics are typically high-dimensional. Here we consider adaptive dynamical systems subject to constraints on network adaptation: Asymptotically, the adaptive dynamics of network connections evolve on a low-dimensional subset of possible connectivity. Such dimension reduction may be intrinsic to the adaptation rule or arise from an additional dynamical mechanism acting on a timescale distinct from that of network adaptation. We illustrate how network adaptation with various constraints influences the dynamics of Kuramoto oscillator networks and elucidate the role of multiple timescales in shaping the dynamics. Our results shed light on why one may expect effective low-dimensional adaptation dynamics in generally high-dimensional adaptive network dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Modelling of Oscillatory Dynamics in Circular Traffic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous analytical model of traffic dynamics on a circular track, demonstrating the emergence of standing oscillations resulting from microscopic driver behaviour, delay responses, and proximity pressure. Without relying on simulation, we derive a series of coupled delay differential equations to model vehicular interactions. By introducing a mnemonic-based symbolic system, we establish a mathematical framework incorporating stochastic initial conditions, non-uniform reaction times, and cognitive lag. A full linear stability analysis is conducted using Fourier decomposition and modal perturbation techniques. Our results identify critical thresholds for harmonic induction, delineate the bounds of safe following distances, and reveal hysteresis in driver overcorrection. The analysis concludes with implications for autonomous vehicle control and potential suppression strategies for oscillatory instability. All derivations are purely symbolic and analytically proven.</description>

      <title>Modeling Multistability and Hysteresis in Urban Traffic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that the macroscopic functional states of urban road networks exhibit multistability and hysteresis, but microscopic mechanisms underlying these phenomena remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that in real-world road networks, the recovery process of congested roads is not spontaneous, as assumed in existing models, but is hindered by connected congested roads, and such hindered recovery can lead to the emergence of multistability and hysteresis in urban traffic dynamics. By analyzing real-world urban traffic data, we observed that congestion propagation between individual roads is well described by a simple contagion process like an epidemic, but the recovery rate of a congested road decreases drastically by the congestion of the adjacent roads unlike an epidemic. Based on this microscopic observation, we proposed a simple model of congestion propagation and dissipation, and found that our model shows a discontinuous phase transition between macroscopic functional states of road networks when the recovery hindrance is strong enough through a mean-field approach and numerical simulations. Our findings shed light on an overlooked role of recovery processes in the collective dynamics of failures in networked systems.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of stationary dynamical solutions in a directed chain and a Delay Differential Equation of neuroscientific relevance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While synchronized states, and the dynamical pathways through which they emerge, are often regarded as the paradigm to understand the dynamics of information spreading on undirected networks of nonlinear dynamical systems, when we consider directed network architectures, dynamical stationary states can arise. To study this phenomenon we consider the simplest directed network, a single cycle, and excitable FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neurons. We show numerically that a stationary dynamical state emerges in the form of a self-sustained traveling wave, through a saddle-point bifurcation of limit cycles that does not destabilize the global fixed point of the system. We then formulate an effective model for the dynamical steady state of the cycle in terms of a single-neuron Delay Differential Equation (DDE) featuring an explicitly delayed feedback, demonstrating numerically the possibility of mapping stationary solutions between the two models. The DDE based model is shown to reproduce the entire bifurcation, which also in this case does not destabilize the global fixed point, even though global properties differ in general between the systems. The discrete nature of the cycle graph is revealed as the origin of these coordinated states by the parametric analysis of solutions, and the DDE effective model is shown to preserve this feature accurately. Finally, the scaling of the inter-site propagation times hints to a solitonic nature of the wave state in the limit of large chain size.</description>

      <title>Essential metrics for Life on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a strong theoretical foundation that frames a well-defined family of outer-totalistic network automaton models as a topological generalisation of binary outer-totalistic cellular automata, of which the Game of Life is one notable particular case. These "Life-like network automata" are quantitatively described by expressing their genotype (the mean field curve and Derrida curve) and phenotype (the evolution of the state and defect averages). After demonstrating that the genotype and phenotype are correlated, we illustrate the utility of these essential metrics by tackling the firing squad synchronisation problem in a bottom-up fashion, with results that exceed a 90% success rate.</description>
