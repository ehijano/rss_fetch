      <title>Quantum Yang-Mills Charges in Strongly Coupled 2D Lattice QCD with Three Flavors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum properties of the truly gauge-invariant and conserved charges of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theories, focusing on lattice QCD in the strong coupling regime. The construction of those charges uses the integral version of the (1+1)-dimensional Yang-Mills equations, and they correspond to the eigenvalues of a charge operator. The gauge invariance of the charges suggests that they are not confined, hence hadronic states may carry them. Using the Feynman-Kac formalism, we evaluate the correlation functions of those charges on baryon and meson states through functional integrals over the gauge group SU(N) (N=2,3) and Grassmannian variables - the fermionic fields. Our results show that the expectation values of the lowest non-trivial charges are nonzero for baryon and meson states but vanish for non-gauge-invariant states, supporting the interpretation that hadrons indeed carry these charges. While renormalization effects and higher-order contributions remain to be analyzed, these findings point toward a potential link between gauge-invariant charges and confinement.</description>

      <title>Phase structure of (3+1)-dimensional dense two-color QCD at $T=0$ in the strong coupling limit with tensor renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phase structure of the (3+1)-dimensional strong coupling two-color QCD at zero temperature with finite chemical potential using the tensor renormalization group method. The chiral and diquark condensates and the quark number density are evaluated as a function of the chemical potential. Our results are compared with the previous analytical results using the mean field approximation. The critical exponents associated with the diquark condensation are also discussed.</description>

      <title>A lattice QCD study of low-energy interactions of doubly charmed baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD calculation of the S-wave interactions between the spin-1/2 doubly charmed baryons ($\Xi_{cc},\Omega_{cc}$) and Goldstone bosons ($\pi,K,\bar{K}$) using the $N_f=2+1$ CLQCD ensembles with lattice spacing $a = 0.07746$ fm and two pion masses $M_\pi \simeq 210$ and 300 MeV. Four single-channel interactions, $I=1/2$ $\Omega_{cc}\bar{K}$, $I=1$ $\Xi_{cc}K$, $I=0$ $\Xi_{cc}K$ and $I=3/2$ $\Xi_{cc}\pi$, are investigated, since they are free of disconnected diagrams. L\"uscher's finite volume method is utilized to extract the scattering parameters in the effective range expansion, i.e., the scattering lengths and effective ranges, from the finite-volume spectra. Our obtained results agree well with previous baryon chiral perturbation theory predictions.</description>

      <title>Finite-volume formalism for $N\pi\pi$ at maximal isospin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the relativistic field theoretic finite-volume formalism to $N \pi \pi$ scattering states at maximal isospin, $I=5/2$. As in previous work using the relativistic field theory approach, we work to all orders in a generic low-energy effective theory, and determine the quantization condition that relates finite-volume energies to intermediate K matrices, and the integral equations connecting the latter to the physical scattering amplitudes. We discuss the parametrization of the K matrices, and explain in detail the new features that arise in implementing the quantization condition due to the spin of the nucleon in combination with the use of non-degenerate particles. As a concrete example, we provide a sample numerical application including the $\Delta$ resonance in the $N\pi$ subchannel. The extension to the $I=3/2$ and $1/2$ channels is more involved, due to mixing with $N\pi$ states, and we do not provide a complete formalism for these cases. We explain why $N\pi$ states cannot be included by treating the nucleon as a pole in $p$-wave $N\pi$ scattering, an approach that has been successful in studying $D D^*$ scattering using the three-particle $DD\pi$ formalism. We additionally provide results for all isospins under the assumption of no two-to-three mixing, thereby laying the groundwork for a follow-up paper in which all $N\pi\pi \leftrightarrow N\pi$ systems are fully treated. Finally, we study the singularities in $N\pi\pi$ amplitudes arising from $N\pi\pi\pi$ intermediate states, and find that our subthreshold cutoff functions must be modified to avoid such singularities.</description>

      <title>Study of the Semileptonic Decay $\Lambda \to p\,\ell\,\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive study of the semileptonic decay process \(\Lambda \to p\,\ell\,\bar{\nu}_{\ell}\), focusing on the determination of all six vector and axial-vector form factors that govern the low-energy hadronic matrix elements of the underlying theory. These invariant form factors constitute the essential inputs for describing the decay, and their dependence on the momentum transfer \(q^{2}\) is analyzed across the entire physical kinematic region. To parameterize the \(q^{2}\)-dependence, we adopt both the \(z\)-expansion formalism and a polynomial fitting approach. Utilizing these parameterizations, we compute the exclusive decay widths for both the electron and muon channels and subsequently extract the corresponding branching ratios. Furthermore, we evaluate the ratio of decay widths between the muon and electron channels, defined as $R^{\mu e} \equiv \frac{\Gamma(\Lambda \to p\,\mu\,\bar{\nu}_{\mu})}{\Gamma(\Lambda \to p\,e\,\bar{\nu}_{e})}$, obtaining \(R^{\mu e} = 0.196^{+0.009}_{-0.012}\) from the polynomial fit and \(R^{\mu e} = 0.174^{+0.002}_{-0.005}\) from the \(z\)-expansion. While both ratios are compatible with previously reported values in the literature, the result from the \(z\)-expansion exhibits particularly strong agreement with the averages reported by the Particle Data Group (PDG).</description>

      <title>A brief introduction to dispersive methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These lectures aim to provide a basic introduction to dispersive methods and their modern applications to the phenomenology of the Standard Model at low energy. This approach exploits analyticity properties of Green functions and scattering amplitude, often combined with unitarity constraints. To find a logically coherent set of topics in this vast subject, I start with the two-point Green's function, show that this needs the three-point function as input which in turn needs the four-point function. The sequence stops here, just like these lectures, because the four-point function is related only to itself (if one ignores inelastic effects), I will discuss these dispersion relations both in the case of toy models, simple scalar theories, as well as in the phenomenologically relevant case of QCD.</description>

      <title>Heavy flavor angular correlations as probes of the glasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of the glasma fields, formed in the early stage of heavy-ion collisions, on the transport of $Q\bar{Q}$ pairs produced back-to-back. We find that for pairs with moderate initial transverse momentum $p_T$ evolving in glasma fields with sufficiently large saturation momentum $Q_s$, the azimuthal correlation $C({\Delta\phi})$ is quickly affected. The decorrelation widths $\sigma_{\Delta\phi}$ during the glasma and Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) phases are comparable.</description>

      <title>T-duality and bosonization as examples of continuum gauging and disentangling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dualities and duality transformations form a well established methodology in various aspects of quantum many body physics and quantum field theories, allowing one to exploit equivalence between models which may naively seem completely different in order to gain access to further physical regimes, either analytically, numerically or experimentally. Recently, in the context of condensed matter physics and quantum information, it was shown that dualities can be understood very well through a gauging and disentangling procedure that can be represented by a finite depth quantum circuit. In this letter we expand these concepts to the continuum, suggesting them as a way to derive duality transformations in continuum field theories and particle physics, and benchmark the presented ideas through the re-derivation of T-duality and bosonization.</description>

      <title>The Non-Abelian Casimir Effect for Plates, Symmetrical Tube and Box on the Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present non-perturbative results of the Casimir potential in non-abelian SU(3) gauge theory in (2+1)D and (3+1)D in the confined and deconfined phase. For the first time, geometries beyond parallel plates in (3+1)D are explored and we show that the Casimir effect for the symmetrical tube and symmetrical box is attractive. The Casimir potential for the tube differs from the massless non-interacting scalar field theory prediction, where a repulsive Casimir potential is expected. Unlike the parallel plate geometry where the plate-size is fixed, in the case of the tube and box, the sizes of the faces forming the walls of the geometries changes with separation distance. We propose various methods that can be used to account for the energy contributions from creating the boundaries. We show that increasing the temperature from a confined to a deconfined phase does not alter the Casimir potential. This observation is consistent with prior work suggesting that the region inside the walls is a boundary induced deconfined phase.</description>

      <title>Improving accuracy of tree-tensor network approach by optimization of network structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical methods based on tensor networks have been extensively explored in the research of quantum many-body systems in recent years. It has been recognized that the ability of tensor networks to describe a quantum many-body state crucially depends on the spatial structure of the network. In the previous work [Hikihara et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 5, 013031 (2023)], we proposed an algorithm based on tree tensor networks (TTNs) that automatically optimizes the structure of TTN according to the spatial profile of entanglement in the state of interest. In this paper, we apply the algorithm to the random XY-exchange model under random magnetic fields and the Richardson model in order to analyze how the performance of the algorithm depends on the detailed updating schemes of the structural optimization. We then find that for the random XY model, on the one hand, the algorithm achieves improved accuracy, and the stochastic algorithm, which selects the local network structure probabilistically, is notably effective. For the Richardson model, on the other hand, the resulting numerical accuracy subtly depends on the initial TTN and the updating schemes. In particular, the algorithm without the stochastic updating scheme certainly improves the accuracy, while the one with the stochastic updates results in poor accuracy due to the effect of randomizing the network structure at the early stage of the calculation. These results indicate that the algorithm successfully improves the accuracy of the numerical calculations for quantum many-body states, while it is essential to appropriately choose the updating scheme as well as the initial TTN structure, depending on the systems treated.</description>

      <title>Meson dynamics from locally exciting a particle-conserving $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories is an important avenue to gain insights into both particle physics phenomena and constrained quantum many-body dynamics. There is a growing interest in probing analogs of high energy collision phenomena in lattice gauge theories that can be implemented on current quantum simulators. Motivated by this, we characterize the confined mesons that originate from a local high energy excitation in a particle-conserving 1D $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory. We focus on a simple, experimentally accessible setting that does not require preparation of colliding wavepackets and isolates the effects of gauge field confinement strength and initial state energy on the nature of propagating excitations. We find that the dynamics is characterized by the propagation of a superposition of differently sized mesons. The linear confinement leads to meson size oscillations in time. The average meson size and oscillation frequency are controlled by the strength of the gauge field confinement. At a constant confinement field, the average meson length is controlled by the initial excitation's energy. Higher energies produce longer mesons and their effective mass depends strongly on their size: longer mesons propagate more slowly out of the central excitation. Mesons of different sizes get spatially filtered with time due to different speeds. We show that this phenomenology is a consequence of linear confinement and remains valid in both the strong and weak confinement limit. We present simple explanations of these phenomena supported by exact numerics.</description>

Abstract: We develop a novel approach for the self-consistent solution of coupled sets of Bethe-Salpeter and Schwinger-Dyson equations in QCD. This framework allows us to maintain the axial Ward-Takahashi identities of the theory within advanced approximation schemes, such as the skeleton or three-particle irreducible expansions. For this purpose we reformulate the Schwinger-Dyson equation of the axial-vector vertex such that the bulk of its quantum corrections is expressed in terms of a novel vertex. Crucially, this vertex satisfies a symmetry-induced relation of its own, which involves the full quark-gluon vertex. As a result, the Schwinger-Dyson equation reproduces the standard Ward-Takahashi identity satisfied by the axial-vector vertex. Consequently, the known relation between the quark mass function and the wave function of the pion in the chiral limit is duly fulfilled. The present approach offers valuable insights into the interplay between symmetry and dynamics, and provides a practical path towards computations of hadron physics within sophisticated approximations. In particular, the one-loop dressed truncation of the key dynamical equations, including that of the quark-gluon vertex, is shown to be completely compatible with the required symmetry relations. Further extensions and potential phenomenological applications of the developed framework are briefly discussed.</description>
