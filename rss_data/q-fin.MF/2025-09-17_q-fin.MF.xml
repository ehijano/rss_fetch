      <title>Optimal Annuitization with stochastic mortality: Piecewise Deterministic Mortality Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of determining the optimal time for an individual to convert retirement savings into a lifetime annuity. The individual invests their wealth into a dividend-paying fund that follows the dynamics of a geometric Brownian motion, exposing them to market risk. At the same time, they face an uncertain lifespan influenced by a stochastic mortality force. The latter is modelled as a piecewise deterministic Markov process (PDMP), which captures sudden and unpredictable changes in the individual's mortality force. The individual aims to maximise expected lifetime linear utility from consumption and bequest, balancing market risk and longevity risk under an irreversible, all-or-nothing annuitization decision. The problem is formulated as a three-dimensional optimal stopping problem and, by exploiting the PDMP structure, it is reduced to a sequence of nested one-dimensional problems. We solve the optimal stopping problem and find a rich structure for the optimal annuitization rule, which cover all parameter specifications. Our theoretical analysis is complemented by a numerical example illustrating the impact of a single health shock on annuitization timing, along with a sensitivity analysis of key model parameters.</description>

      <title>Strassen's theorem for biased convex order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strassen's theorem asserts that for given marginal probabilities $\mu,\nu$ there exists a martingale starting in $\mu$ and terminating in $\nu$ if and only if $\mu,\nu$ are in convex order. From a financial perspective, it guarantees the existence of market-consistent martingale pricing measures for arbitrage-free prices of European call options and thus plays a fundamental role in robust finance. Arbitrage-free prices of American options demand a stronger version of martingales which are 'biased' in a specific sense. In this paper, we derive an extension of Strassen's theorem that links them to an appropriate strengthening of the convex order. Moreover, we provide a characterization of this order through integrals with respect to compensated Poisson processes.</description>

      <title>Robust forward investment and consumption under drift and volatility uncertainties: A randomization approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies robust forward investment and consumption preferences and optimal strategies for a risk-averse and ambiguity-averse agent in an incomplete financial market with drift and volatility uncertainties. We focus on non-zero volatility and constant relative risk aversion forward preferences. Given the non-convexity of the Hamiltonian with respect to uncertain volatilities, we first construct robust randomized forward preferences through endogenous randomization in an auxiliary market. {Therein, w}e derive the corresponding optimal and robust investment and consumption strategies. Furthermore, we show that such forward preferences and strategies, developed in the auxiliary market, remain optimal and robust in the physical market, offering a comprehensive {analysis} for forward investment and consumption under model uncertainty.</description>
