      <title>All Models Are Wrong, But Can They Be Useful? Lessons from COVID-19 Agent-Based Models: A Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic prompted a surge in computational models to simulate disease dynamics and guide interventions. Agent-based models (ABMs) are well-suited to capture population and environmental heterogeneity, but their rapid deployment raised questions about utility for health policy. We systematically reviewed 536 COVID-19 ABM studies published from January 2020 to December 2023, retrieved from Web of Science, PubMed, and Wiley on January 30, 2024. Studies were included if they used ABMs to simulate COVID-19 transmission, where reviews were excluded. Studies were assessed against nine criteria of model usefulness, including transparency and re-use, interdisciplinary collaboration and stakeholder engagement, and evaluation practices. Publications peaked in late 2021 and were concentrated in a few countries. Most models explored behavioral or policy interventions (n = 294, 54.85%) rather than real-time forecasting (n = 9, 1.68%). While most described model assumptions (n = 491, 91.60%), fewer disclosed limitations (n = 349, 65.11%), shared code (n = 219, 40.86%), or built on existing models (n = 195, 36.38%). Standardized reporting protocols (n = 36, 6.72%) and stakeholder engagement were rare (13.62%, n = 73). Only 2.24% (n = 12) described a comprehensive validation framework, though uncertainty was often quantified (n = 407, 75.93%). Limitations of this review include underrepresentation of non-English studies, subjective data extraction, variability in study quality, and limited generalizability. Overall, COVID-19 ABMs advanced quickly, but lacked transparency, accessibility, and participatory engagement. Stronger standards are needed for ABMs to serve as reliable decision-support tools in future public health crises.</description>

      <title>Inject, Fork, Compare: Defining an Interaction Vocabulary for Multi-Agent Simulation Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent simulations are a rapidly growing field of research, but current simulations often lack clear modes for interaction and analysis, limiting the "what if" scenarios researchers are able to investigate. In this demo, we define three core operations for interacting with multi-agent simulations: inject, fork, and compare. Inject allows researchers to introduce external events at any point during simulation execution. Fork creates independent timeline branches from any timestamp, preserving complete state while allowing divergent exploration. Compare facilitates parallel observation of multiple branches, revealing how different interventions lead to distinct emergent behaviors. Together, these operations establish a vocabulary that transforms linear simulation workflows into interactive, explorable spaces. We demonstrate this vocabulary through a commodity market simulation with fourteen AI agents, where researchers can inject contrasting events and observe divergent outcomes across parallel timelines. By defining these fundamental operations, we provide a starting point for systematic causal investigation in LLM-based agent simulations, moving beyond passive observation toward active experimentation.</description>

      <title>ASTREA: Introducing Agentic Intelligence for Orbital Thermal Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents ASTREA, the first agentic system deployed on flight-heritage hardware (TRL 9) for autonomous spacecraft operations. Using thermal control as a representative use case, we integrate a resource-constrained Large Language Model (LLM) agent with a reinforcement learning controller in an asynchronous architecture tailored for space-qualified platforms. Ground experiments show that LLM-guided supervision improves thermal stability and reduces violations, confirming the feasibility of combining semantic reasoning with adaptive control under hardware constraints. However, on-orbit validation aboard the International Space Station (ISS) reveals performance degradation caused by inference latency mismatched with the rapid thermal cycles characteristic of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. These results highlight both the opportunities and current limitations of agentic LLM-based systems in real flight environments, providing practical design guidelines for future space autonomy.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Target Detection with AUVs: A Dual-Timescale Hierarchical MARDL Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) have shown great potential for cooperative detection and reconnaissance. However, collaborative AUV communications introduce risks of exposure. In adversarial environments, achieving efficient collaboration while ensuring covert operations becomes a key challenge for underwater cooperative missions. In this paper, we propose a novel dual time-scale Hierarchical Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (H-MAPPO) framework. The high-level component determines the individuals participating in the task based on a central AUV, while the low-level component reduces exposure probabilities through power and trajectory control by the participating AUVs. Simulation results show that the proposed framework achieves rapid convergence, outperforms benchmark algorithms in terms of performance, and maximizes long-term cooperative efficiency while ensuring covert operations.</description>

      <title>Who is Introducing the Failure? Automatically Attributing Failures of Multi-Agent Systems via Spectrum Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model Powered Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) are increasingly employed to automate complex real-world problems, such as programming and scientific discovery. Despite their promising, MASs are not without their flaws. However, failure attribution in MASs - pinpointing the specific agent actions responsible for failures - remains underexplored and labor-intensive, posing significant challenges for debugging and system improvement. To bridge this gap, we propose FAMAS, the first spectrum-based failure attribution approach for MASs, which operates through systematic trajectory replay and abstraction, followed by spectrum analysis.The core idea of FAMAS is to estimate, from variations across repeated MAS executions, the likelihood that each agent action is responsible for the failure. In particular, we propose a novel suspiciousness formula tailored to MASs, which integrates two key factor groups, namely the agent behavior group and the action behavior group, to account for the agent activation patterns and the action activation patterns within the execution trajectories of MASs. Through expensive evaluations against 12 baselines on the Who and When benchmark, FAMAS demonstrates superior performance by outperforming all the methods in comparison.</description>

      <title>Repulsive Trajectory Modification and Conflict Resolution for Efficient Multi-Manipulator Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient motion planning method designed to efficiently find collision-free trajectories for multiple manipulators. While multi-manipulator systems offer significant advantages, coordinating their motions is computationally challenging owing to the high dimensionality of their composite configuration space. Conflict-Based Search (CBS) addresses this by decoupling motion planning, but suffers from subsequent conflicts incurred by resolving existing conflicts, leading to an exponentially growing constraint tree of CBS. Our proposed method is based on repulsive trajectory modification within the two-level structure of CBS. Unlike conventional CBS variants, the low-level planner applies a gradient descent approach using an Artificial Potential Field. This field generates repulsive forces that guide the trajectory of the conflicting manipulator away from those of other robots. As a result, subsequent conflicts are less likely to occur. Additionally, we develop a strategy that, under a specific condition, directly attempts to find a conflict-free solution in a single step without growing the constraint tree. Through extensive tests including physical robot experiments, we demonstrate that our method consistently reduces the number of expanded nodes in the constraint tree, achieves a higher success rate, and finds a solution faster compared to Enhanced CBS and other state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>TransforMARS: Fault-Tolerant Self-Reconfiguration for Arbitrarily Shaped Modular Aerial Robot Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modular Aerial Robot Systems (MARS) consist of multiple drone modules that are physically bound together to form a single structure for flight. Exploiting structural redundancy, MARS can be reconfigured into different formations to mitigate unit or rotor failures and maintain stable flight. Prior work on MARS self-reconfiguration has solely focused on maximizing controllability margins to tolerate a single rotor or unit fault for rectangular-shaped MARS. We propose TransforMARS, a general fault-tolerant reconfiguration framework that transforms arbitrarily shaped MARS under multiple rotor and unit faults while ensuring continuous in-air stability. Specifically, we develop algorithms to first identify and construct minimum controllable assemblies containing faulty units. We then plan feasible disassembly-assembly sequences to transport MARS units or subassemblies to form target configuration. Our approach enables more flexible and practical feasible reconfiguration. We validate TransforMARS in challenging arbitrarily shaped MARS configurations, demonstrating substantial improvements over prior works in both the capacity of handling diverse configurations and the number of faults tolerated.

      <title>Nash Equilibria in Games with Playerwise Concave Coupling Constraints: Existence and Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the existence and computation of Nash equilibria in continuous static games where the players' admissible strategies are subject to shared coupling constraints, i.e., constraints that depend on their \emph{joint} strategies. Specifically, we focus on a class of games characterized by playerwise concave utilities and playerwise concave constraints. Prior results on the existence of Nash equilibria are not applicable to this class, as they rely on strong assumptions such as joint convexity of the feasible set. By leveraging topological fixed point theory and novel structural insights into the contractibility of feasible sets under playerwise concave constraints, we give an existence proof for Nash equilibria under weaker conditions. Having established existence, we then focus on the computation of Nash equilibria via independent gradient methods under the additional assumption that the utilities admit a potential function. To account for the possibly nonconvex feasible region, we employ a log barrier regularized gradient ascent with adaptive stepsizes. Starting from an initial feasible strategy profile and under exact gradient feedback, the proposed method converges to an $\epsilon$-approximate constrained Nash equilibrium within $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ iterations.</description>

      <title>Sound Value Iteration for Simple Stochastic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic analysis of Markov decision processes (MDP) and stochastic games (SG) in practice relies on value-iteration (VI) algorithms. Since basic VI does not provide guarantees on the precision of the result, variants of VI have been proposed that offer such guarantees. In particular, sound value iteration (SVI) not only provides precise lower and upper bounds on the result, but also converges faster in the presence of probabilistic cycles. Unfortunately, it is neither applicable to SG, nor to MDP with end components. In this paper, we extend SVI and cover both cases. The technical challenge consists mainly in proper treatment of end components, which require different handling than in the literature. Moreover, we provide several optimizations of SVI. Finally, we evaluate our prototype implementation experimentally to demonstrate its potential on systems with probabilistic cycles.</description>

      <title>CrazyMARL: Decentralized Direct Motor Control Policies for Cooperative Aerial Transport of Cable-Suspended Payloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collaborative transportation of cable-suspended payloads by teams of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has the potential to enhance payload capacity, adapt to different payload shapes, and provide built-in compliance, making it attractive for applications ranging from disaster relief to precision logistics. However, multi-UAV coordination under disturbances, nonlinear payload dynamics, and slack--taut cable modes remains a challenging control problem. To our knowledge, no prior work has addressed these cable mode transitions in the multi-UAV context, instead relying on simplifying rigid-link assumptions. We propose CrazyMARL, a decentralized Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for multi-UAV cable-suspended payload transport. Simulation results demonstrate that the learned policies can outperform classical decentralized controllers in terms of disturbance rejection and tracking precision, achieving an 80% recovery rate from harsh conditions compared to 44% for the baseline method. We also achieve successful zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and demonstrate that our policies are highly robust under harsh conditions, including wind, random external disturbances, and transitions between slack and taut cable dynamics. This work paves the way for autonomous, resilient UAV teams capable of executing complex payload missions in unstructured environments.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficient Multi Robot Package Delivery under Capacity-Constraints via Voronoi-Constrained Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of delivering multiple packages from a single pickup depot to distinct goal locations using a homogeneous fleet of robots with limited carrying capacity. We propose VCST-RCP, a Voronoi-Constrained Steiner Tree Relay Coordination Planning framework that constructs sparse relay trunks using Steiner tree optimization and then synthesizes robot-level pickup, relay, and delivery schedules. This framework reframes relays from incidental byproducts into central elements of coordination, offering a contrast with traditional delivery methods that rely on direct source-to-destination transport. Extensive experiments show consistent improvements of up to 34% compared to conventional baselines, underscoring the benefits of incorporating relays into the delivery process. These improvements translate directly to enhanced energy efficiency in multi-robot delivery under capacity constraints, providing a scalable framework for real-world logistics.</description>

      <title>ComfyGPT: A Self-Optimizing Multi-Agent System for Comprehensive ComfyUI Workflow Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ComfyUI is a popular workflow-based interface that allows users to customize image generation tasks through an intuitive node-based system. However, the complexity of managing node connections and diverse modules can be challenging for users. In this paper, we introduce ComfyGPT, a self-optimizing multi-agent system designed to generate ComfyUI workflows based on task descriptions automatically. The key innovations of ComfyGPT include: (1) consisting of four specialized agents to build a multi-agent workflow generation system: ReformatAgent, FlowAgent, RefineAgent, and ExecuteAgent; (2) focusing on generating precise node connections instead of entire workflows, improving generation accuracy; and (3) enhancing workflow generation through reinforcement learning. Moreover, we introduce FlowDataset, a large-scale dataset containing 13,571 workflow-description pairs, and FlowBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating workflow generation systems. Additionally, we propose four novel evaluation metrics: Format Validation (FV), Pass Accuracy (PA), Pass Instruct Alignment (PIA), and Pass Node Diversity (PND). Experimental results demonstrate that ComfyGPT significantly outperforms existing LLM-based methods in workflow generation, making it a significant step forward in this field.

      <title>Emergent Social Dynamics of LLM Agents in the El Farol Bar Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04537v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the emergent social dynamics of Large Language Model (LLM) agents in a spatially extended El Farol Bar problem, observing how they autonomously navigate this classic social dilemma. As a result, the LLM agents generated a spontaneous motivation to go to the bar and changed their decision making by becoming a collective. We also observed that the LLM agents did not solve the problem completely, but rather behaved more like humans. These findings reveal a complex interplay between external incentives (prompt-specified constraints such as the 60% threshold) and internal incentives (culturally-encoded social preferences derived from pre-training), demonstrating that LLM agents naturally balance formal game-theoretic rationality with social motivations that characterize human behavior. These findings suggest that a new model of group decision making, which could not be handled in the previous game-theoretic problem setting, can be realized by LLM agents.</description>

      <title>Applicability of the Minimal Dominating Set for Influence Maximization in Multilayer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15236v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The minimal dominating set (MDS) is a well-established concept in network controllability and has been successfully applied in various domains, including sensor placement, network resilience, and epidemic containment. In this study, we adapt the local-improvement MDS routine and explore its potential for enhancing seed selection for influence maximization in multilayer networks (MLN). We employ the Linear Threshold Model (LTM), which offers an intuitive representation of influence spread or opinion dynamics by accounting for peer influence accumulation. To ensure interpretability, we utilize rank-refining seed selection methods, with the results further filtered with MDS. Our findings reveal that incorporating MDS into the seed selection process improves spread only within a specific range of situations. Notably, the improvement is observed for larger seed set budgets, lower activation thresholds, and when an "AND" strategy is used to aggregate influence across network layers. This scenario reflects situations where an individual does not require the majority of their acquaintances to hold a target opinion, but must be influenced across all social circles.</description>

      <title>Welfare and Cost Aggregation for Multi-Agent Control: When to Choose Which Social Cost Function, and Why?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20772</link>

Abstract: Many multi-agent socio-technical systems rely on aggregating heterogeneous agents' costs into a social cost function (SCF) to coordinate resource allocation in domains like energy grids, water allocation, or traffic management. The choice of SCF often entails implicit assumptions and may lead to undesirable outcomes if not rigorously justified. In this paper, we demonstrate that what determines which SCF ought to be used is the degree to which individual costs can be compared across agents and which axioms the aggregation shall fulfill. Drawing on the results from social choice theory, we provide guidance on how this process can be used in control applications. We demonstrate which assumptions about interpersonal utility comparability - ranging from ordinal level comparability to full cardinal comparability - together with a choice of desirable axioms, inform the selection of a correct SCF, be it the classical utilitarian sum, the Nash SCF, or maximin. We then demonstrate how the proposed framework can be applied for principled allocations of water and transportation resources.</description>

      <title>DECAMP: Towards Scene-Consistent Multi-Agent Motion Prediction with Disentangled Context-Aware Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10426</link>

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a critical component of autonomous driving, essential for ensuring both safety and efficiency on the road. However, traditional approaches often struggle with the scarcity of labeled data and exhibit suboptimal performance in multi-agent prediction scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce a disentangled context-aware pre-training framework for multi-agent motion prediction, named DECAMP. Unlike existing methods that entangle representation learning with pretext tasks, our framework decouples behavior pattern learning from latent feature reconstruction, prioritizing interpretable dynamics and thereby enhancing scene representation for downstream prediction. Additionally, our framework incorporates context-aware representation learning alongside collaborative spatial-motion pretext tasks, which enables joint optimization of structural and intentional reasoning while capturing the underlying dynamic intentions. Our experiments on the Argoverse 2 benchmark showcase the superior performance of our method, and the results attained underscore its effectiveness in multi-agent motion forecasting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first context autoencoder framework for multi-agent motion forecasting in autonomous driving. The code and models will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Auto-Slides: An Interactive Multi-Agent System for Creating and Customizing Research Presentations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has opened new opportunities for education. While learners can interact with academic papers through LLM-powered dialogue, limitations still exist: absence of structured organization and high text reliance can impede systematic understanding and engagement with complex concepts. To address these challenges, we propose Auto-Slides, an LLM-driven system that converts research papers into pedagogically structured, multimodal slides (e.g., diagrams and tables). Drawing on cognitive science, it creates a presentation-oriented narrative and allows iterative refinement via an interactive editor, in order to match learners' knowledge level and goals. Auto-Slides further incorporates verification and knowledge retrieval mechanisms to ensure accuracy and contextual completeness. Through extensive user studies, Auto-Slides enhances learners' comprehension and engagement compared to conventional LLM-based reading. Our contributions lie in designing a multi-agent framework for transforming academic papers into pedagogically optimized slides and introducing interactive customization for personalized learning.</description>
