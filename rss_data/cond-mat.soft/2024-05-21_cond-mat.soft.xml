      <title>Generating ultrastable glasses by homogenizing the local virial stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the possibility of algorithmically preparing ultra-stable glasses (UG), i.e., states that lie very deep in the potential energy landscape, has considerably expanded our understanding of the glassy state. In this work, we report on a new protocol for ultrastable glass preparation that iteratively modifies the particle diameters to reduce local virial stress fluctuations. We apply the algorithm to an additive Lennard-Jones mixture and show that, compared to the states obtained via thermal annealing, virial homogenized glasses (VHG) are characterized by a considerable increase in both kinetic stability and the number of locally favored structures (icosahedra). We also consider the melting dynamics during heating ramps and show that it occurs via an accumulation of localized events. Our results highlight the connection between the thermodynamic and mechanical stability of ultra-stable glassy states.</description>

      <title>Self-assembling clusters of particles on a shrinking liquid surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After rainfall, pine needles are observed to float on the surface of small puddles. As the water evaporates, these pine needles exhibit spontaneous self-assembly into distinct clusters. Motivated by this natural phenomenon, we conducted experimental investigations into the dynamic evolution of particles during the shrinkage of a liquid surface. Our experiments revealed that particles tend to aggregate, forming distinct clusters as the liquid boundary shrinks. We systematically examined the emergence of these clusters and explored how their sizes and numbers evolve with changes in packing fraction. Furthermore, we analyze particle rotation during the process and discuss the formation of the final configuration comprising clusters of various orientations. Complementary numerical simulations demonstrate qualitative agreement with our experimental findings. Our study contributes to a better understanding of self-assembly phenomena involving macroscopic particles on shrinking liquid surfaces.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium dynamic hyperuniform states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered hyperuniform structures are an exotic state of matter having suppressed density fluctuations at large length-scale similar to perfect crystals and quasicrystals but without any long range orientational order. In the past decade, an increasing number of non-equilibrium systems were found to have dynamic hyperuniform states, which have emerged as a new research direction coupling both non-equilibrium physics and hyperuniformity. Here we review the recent progress in understanding dynamic hyperuniform states found in various non-equilibrium systems, including the critical hyperuniformity in absorbing phase transitions, non-equilibrium hyperuniform fluids and the hyperuniform structures in phase separating systems via spinodal decomposition.</description>

      <title>Memory effects in colloidal motion under confinement and driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport of individual particles in inhomogeneous environments is complex and exhibits non-Markovian responses. The latter may be quantified by a memory function within the framework of the linear generalised Langevin equation (GLE). Here, we exemplify the implications of steady driving on the memory function of a colloidal model system for Brownian motion in a corrugated potential landscape, specifically, for one-dimensional motion in a sinusoidal potential. To this end, we consider the overdamped limit of the GLE, which is facilitated by separating the memory function into a singular (Markovian) and a regular (non-Markovian) part. Relying on exact solutions for the investigated model, we show that the random force entering the GLE must display a bias far from equilibrium, which corroborates a recent general prediction. Based on data for the mean-square displacement obtained from Brownian dynamics simulations, we estimate the memory function for different driving strengths and show that already moderate driving accelerates the decay of the memory function by several orders of magnitude in time. We find that the memory may persist on much longer timescales than expected from the convergence of the mean-square displacement to its long-time asymptote. Furthermore, the functional form of the memory function changes from a monotonic decay to a non-monotonic, damped oscillatory behaviour, which can be understood from a competition of confined motion and depinning. Our analysis of the simulation data further reveals a pronounced non-Gaussianity, which questions the Gaussian approximation of the random force entering the GLE.</description>

      <title>Flow Through Porous Media at the Percolation Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study low-Reynolds-number fluid flow through a two-dimensional porous medium modeled as a Lorentz gas. Using extensive finite element simulations we fully resolve the flow fields for packing fractions approaching the percolation threshold. Near the percolation transition, we find a power-law scaling of the flow rate versus the pressure drop with an exponent of $\approx 5/2$, which has been predicted earlier by mapping the macroscopic flow to a discrete flow network [Phys. Rev. Lett. 54, 1985]. Importantly, we observe a rounding of the scaling behavior at small system sizes, which can be rationalized via a finite-size scaling ansatz. Finally, we show that the distribution of the kinetic energy exhibits a power-law scaling over several decades at small energies, originating from collections of self-similar, viscous eddies in the dead-end-channels. Our results lay the foundation for unraveling critical behavior of complex fluids omnipresent in biological and geophysical systems.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulations of the Blinking-Checkers Model for Polyamorphic Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The blinking-checkers model [F. Caupin and M. A. Anisimov, Phys. Rev. Lett, 127,185701 (2021)] is a minimal lattice model which has demonstrated that, in the meanfield approximation, it can reproduce the phenomenon of fluid polyamorphism. This model is a binary lattice-gas, in which each site has three possible states: empty, occupied with particles of type 1, and occupied with particles of type 2. Additionally, the two types of particles may interconvert from one to another. Equilibrium interconversion imposes a constraint that makes this model thermodynamically equivalent to a single-component system. In this work, Monte-Carlo simulations of the blinking-checkers model are performed, demonstrating polyamorphic phase behavior. The locations of the liquid-liquid and liquid-gas critical points are found to be different from the meanfield predictions for this model with the same interaction parameters, as the phase behavior is significantly affected by critical fluctuations. Based on the computed values of the critical exponents of the order parameter, susceptibility, correlation length, and surface tension, we confirm that the blinking-checkers model, for both liquid-gas and liquid-liquid equilibria, belongs to the three-dimensional Ising class of critical-point universality.</description>

      <title>Colloidal bubble propulsion mediated through viscous flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bubble-propelled catalytic colloids stand out as a uniquely efficient design for artificial controllable micromachines, but so far lack a general theoretical framework that explains the physics of their propulsion. Here we develop a combined diffusive and hydrodynamic theory of bubble growth near a spherical catalytic colloid, that allows us to explain the underlying mechanism and the influence of environmental and material parameters. We identify two dimensionless groups, related to colloidal activity and the background fluid, that govern a saddle-node bifurcation of the bubble growth dynamics, and calculate the generated flows analytically for both slip and no slip boundary conditions on the bubble. We finish with a discussion of the assumptions and predictions of our model in the context of existing experimental results, and conclude that some of the observed behaviour, notably the ratchet-like gait, stems from peculiarities of the experimental setup rather than fundamental physics of the propulsive mechanism.</description>

      <title>Quantum confinement theory of the heat capacity of thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theory and mechanistic understanding of the thermal properties of solids under nanoscale confinement are currently missing. We develop a theoretical quantum confinement description of thin films which predicts a new physical law for the heat capacity. In particular, due to the suppression of vibrational modes caused by the thin film confinement, the vibrational density of states (VDOS) deviates from the Debye quadratic law in frequency and is, instead, cubic in frequency. This leads to a temperature dependence of the heat capacity which is $\sim T^4$ instead of Debye's $\sim T^3$ law. Furthermore, the new theory predicts a linear increase of the heat capacity upon increasing the nanometric film thickness. Both dependencies are found in excellent agreement with recent experimental data on NbTiN thin films.</description>

      <title>Effects of coordination and stiffness scale-separation in disordered elastic networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many fibrous materials are modeled as elastic networks featuring a substantial separation between the stiffness scales that characterize different microscopic deformation modes of the network's constituents. This scale separation has been shown to give rise to emergent complexity in these systems' linear and nonlinear mechanical response. Here we study numerically a simple model featuring said stiffness scale-separation in two-dimensions and show that its mechanical response is governed by the competition between the characteristic stiffness of collective nonphononic soft modes of the stiff subsystem, and the characteristic stiffness of the soft interactions. We present and rationalize the behavior of the shear modulus of our complex networks across the unjamming transition at which the stiff subsystem alone loses its macroscopic mechanical rigidity. We further establish a relation in the soft-interaction-dominated regime between the shear modulus, the characteristic frequency of nonphononic vibrational modes, and the mesoscopic correlation length that marks the crossover from a disorder-dominated response to local mechanical perturbations in the near-field, to a linear, continuum-like response in the far field. The effects of spatial dimension on the observed scaling behavior are discussed, in addition to the interplay between stiffness scales in strain-stiffened networks, which is relevant to understanding the nonlinear mechanics of non-Brownian fibrous biomatter.</description>

      <title>Geometric frustration and pairing order transition in confined bacterial vortices</title>

Abstract: Dense systems of active matter exhibit highly dynamic collective motion characterized by intermingled vortices, referred to as active turbulence. The interaction between these vortices is key to controlling turbulent dynamics, and a promising approach for revealing the rules governing their interaction is geometric confinement. In this study, we investigate the vortex-pairing patterns in confined bacterial suspensions as a model frustrated system in which a perfect antiferromagnetic state is prohibited. We found that three-body vortex interactions exhibited anomalous pairing-order transition from co-rotational vortex-pairing to counter-rotating patterns with frustration. Although an active matter system is in non-equilibrium, our theory based on bending energy accounts for significant features including pattern transition and shift of the transition point in frustrated systems. Moreover, the interplay between the chirality in collective motion and frustration in vortex pairing creates a collective rotational flow under the broad geometric conditions of a confined space. Our results show that frustrated vortex patterning promotes a geometric approach for arranging active turbulence in microfluidic systems.</description>

      <title>Bending-Rotation coupling in the viscoelasticity of semiflexible polymers -- Rigorous perturbation analysis from the rod limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brownian motion and viscoelasticity of semiflexible polymers is a subject that has been studied for many years. Still, rigorous analysis has been hindered due to the difficulty in handling the constraint that polymer chains cannot be stretched along the contour. Here, we show a straightforward method to solve the problem. We consider a stiff polymer that has a persistent length $L_p$ much larger than the contour length $L$. We express the polymer configuration using three types of variables: the position vector of the center of mass $R_c$, the unit vector $n$ along the main axis, and the normal coordinates $u_p$ for bending. Solving the Smoluchowski equation for the distribution function of these variables, we calculate the equilibrium time correlation function $ \langle P(t)\cdot P(0) \rangle$ of the end-to-end vector $P$ and the complex modulus $G^*(\omega)$ of dilute solution. They include the bending effect to the first order in $\theta \equiv L/L_p$ and reduce to the exact results for the rigid rod in the limit of $\theta \to 0$. The rotational diffusion coefficient increases slightly by the semiflexibility because the equilibrium length of the semiflexible polymer is smaller than that of the rigid rod with the same contour length. The storage modulus shows the same asymptotic dependence $G'(\omega) \sim \omega^{3/4}$ predicted by Shankar, Pasquali, and Morse [J. Rheol. 2002, 46, 1111--1154]. The high-frequency viscosity is predicted to be dependent on the thickness of the semiflexible polymers.</description>

      <title>Role of Plasticizers in Film Formation and Deformation-Induced Bonding of Glassy Polymers of Bidisperse Blends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bonding between polymers below the glass transition temperature through molecular-scale dilatation (or densification)-based interdiffusion of macromolecules has recently been introduced. In this mechanism, plastic deformation enables polymer chains to interdiffuse and form entanglements at the interface, facilitating rapid bonding below the glass transition temperature ($T_g$). Here, we are addressing the role of low molecular weight plasticizer in bonding polymer interfaces of bidisperse blends through deformation-induced bonding (DIB) at temperatures well below the surface and bulk glass transition temperatures, $T_g^s$ and $T_g^b$, respectively, by using molecular simulations. These simulations reveal that addition of plasticizer ($\phi\le$20\%) drastically enhances the number of chain-ends at the interfacial region compared to a pure glass sample ($\phi=0\%$) during deformation below $T_g^s$, which improves the possibility of opposite side entanglement formation. The changes in stress-strain response of debonded samples correlate with the normalized entanglement density. Likewise, the maximum interfacial fracture energy $G_{I,max}$ of debonded samples is correlated with the plasticizer concentration ($\phi$), below $T_g^s$. Furthermore, the optimization of material and process conditions for DIB has yielded a notable advancement: achieving a higher bonding strength, approximately one-third of the bulk, all while remaining below $T_g$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explain the steering of slow degrees of freedom by coupling them to driven components for which the time-symmetric reactivities are manipulated. We present the strategy and main principle that make that sort of navigation feasible. For illustration, nonlinear limit cycles (as in the van der Pol oscillator) and strange attractors (as in the Lorenz dynamics) are seen to emerge when the driving in the nonequilibrium medium is kept fixed while the frenesy is tuned to produce the required forces. We imagine that such frenetic steering is available in Life as well, allowing selection of the appropriate biological functioning.</description>

Abstract: Molecular chirality has traditionally been viewed as a binary property where a molecule is classified as either chiral or achiral, yet in the recent decades mathematical methods for quantifying chirality have been explored. Here we use toy molecular systems to systematically compare the performance of two state of the art chirality measures (1) the Continuous Chirality Measure (CCM) and (2) the Chirality Characteristic ($\chi$). We find that both methods exhibit qualitatively similar behavior when applied to simple molecular systems such as a four-site molecule or the polymer double-helix, but we show that the CCM may be more suitable for evaluating the chirality of arbitrary molecules or abstract structures such as normal vibrational modes. We discuss a range of considerations for applying these methods to molecular systems in general, and we provide links to user-friendly codes for both methods. We aim this paper to serve as a concise resource for scientists attempting to familiarize themselves with these chirality measures or attempting to implement chirality measures in their own work.</description>

      <title>A hydrodynamic analog of critical phenomena: an uncountably infinite number of universality classes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of universality class has emerged from our understanding of critical phenomena widely observed in nature and has guided the recent development of physics. Accordingly, identifying a rich variety of universality class is a major issue in modern physics. Here, we report that a daily phenomenon, similar to a drop falling from a faucet, possesses a strikingly close analogy with critical phenomena, with this version remarkably revealing the existence of an uncountably infinite number of universality classes. The key for our present findings is the confinement of a system into a thin cell, in which we observe the dynamics of air-liquid interface formed by entrained air into viscous liquid by a solid disk, to find critical exponents that define a universality class depend on continuous numbers characterizing the confinement.</description>
