      <title>ViRAC: A Vision-Reasoning Agent Head Movement Control Framework in Arbitrary Virtual Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating lifelike virtual agents capable of interacting with their environments is a longstanding goal in computer graphics. This paper addresses the challenge of generating natural head rotations, a critical aspect of believable agent behavior for visual information gathering and dynamic responses to environmental cues. Although earlier methods have made significant strides, many rely on data-driven or saliency-based approaches, which often underperform in diverse settings and fail to capture deeper cognitive factors such as risk assessment, information seeking, and contextual prioritization. Consequently, generated behaviors can appear rigid or overlook critical scene elements, thereby diminishing the sense of realism. In this paper, we propose \textbf{ViRAC}, a \textbf{Vi}sion-\textbf{R}easoning \textbf{A}gent Head Movement \textbf{C}ontrol framework, which exploits the common-sense knowledge and reasoning capabilities of large-scale models, including Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large-Language Models (LLMs). Rather than explicitly modeling every cognitive mechanism, ViRAC leverages the biases and patterns internalized by these models from extensive training, thus emulating human-like perceptual processes without hand-tuned heuristics. Experimental results in multiple scenarios reveal that ViRAC produces more natural and context-aware head rotations than recent state-of-the-art techniques. Quantitative evaluations show a closer alignment with real human head-movement data, while user studies confirm improved realism and cognitive plausibility.</description>

      <title>Volumetric Temporal Texture Synthesis for Smoke Stylization using Neural Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artistic stylization of 3D volumetric smoke data is still a challenge in computer graphics due to the difficulty of ensuring spatiotemporal consistency given a reference style image, and that within reasonable time and computational resources. In this work, we introduce Volumetric Neural Cellular Automata (VNCA), a novel model for efficient volumetric style transfer that synthesizes, in real-time, multi-view consistent stylizing features on the target smoke with temporally coherent transitions between stylized simulation frames. VNCA synthesizes a 3D texture volume with color and density stylization and dynamically aligns this volume with the intricate motion patterns of the smoke simulation under the Eulerian framework. Our approach replaces the explicit fluid advection modeling and the inter-frame smoothing terms with the self-emerging motion of the underlying cellular automaton, thus reducing the training time by over an order of magnitude. Beyond smoke simulations, we demonstrate the versatility of our approach by showcasing its applicability to mesh stylization.</description>

      <title>Meta-INR: Efficient Encoding of Volumetric Data via Meta-Learning Implicit Neural Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implicit neural representation (INR) has emerged as a promising solution for encoding volumetric data, offering continuous representations and seamless compatibility with the volume rendering pipeline. However, optimizing an INR network from randomly initialized parameters for each new volume is computationally inefficient, especially for large-scale time-varying or ensemble volumetric datasets where volumes share similar structural patterns but require independent training. To close this gap, we propose Meta-INR, a pretraining strategy adapted from meta-learning algorithms to learn initial INR parameters from partial observation of a volumetric dataset. Compared to training an INR from scratch, the learned initial parameters provide a strong prior that enhances INR generalizability, allowing significantly faster convergence with just a few gradient updates when adapting to a new volume and better interpretability when analyzing the parameters of the adapted INRs. We demonstrate that Meta-INR can effectively extract high-quality generalizable features that help encode unseen similar volume data across diverse datasets. Furthermore, we highlight its utility in tasks such as simulation parameter analysis and representative timestep selection. The code is available at https://github.com/spacefarers/MetaINR.</description>

      <title>A Solver-Aided Hierarchical Language for LLM-Driven CAD Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been enormously successful in solving a wide variety of structured and unstructured generative tasks, but they struggle to generate procedural geometry in Computer Aided Design (CAD). These difficulties arise from an inability to do spatial reasoning and the necessity to guide a model through complex, long range planning to generate complex geometry. We enable generative CAD Design with LLMs through the introduction of a solver-aided, hierarchical domain specific language (DSL) called AIDL, which offloads the spatial reasoning requirements to a geometric constraint solver. Additionally, we show that in the few-shot regime, AIDL outperforms even a language with in-training data (OpenSCAD), both in terms of generating visual results closer to the prompt and creating objects that are easier to post-process and reason about.</description>

      <title>ReStyle3D: Scene-Level Appearance Transfer with Semantic Correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce ReStyle3D, a novel framework for scene-level appearance transfer from a single style image to a real-world scene represented by multiple views. The method combines explicit semantic correspondences with multi-view consistency to achieve precise and coherent stylization. Unlike conventional stylization methods that apply a reference style globally, ReStyle3D uses open-vocabulary segmentation to establish dense, instance-level correspondences between the style and real-world images. This ensures that each object is stylized with semantically matched textures. It first transfers the style to a single view using a training-free semantic-attention mechanism in a diffusion model. It then lifts the stylization to additional views via a learned warp-and-refine network guided by monocular depth and pixel-wise correspondences. Experiments show that ReStyle3D consistently outperforms prior methods in structure preservation, perceptual style similarity, and multi-view coherence. User studies further validate its ability to produce photo-realistic, semantically faithful results. Our code, pretrained models, and dataset will be publicly released, to support new applications in interior design, virtual staging, and 3D-consistent stylization.</description>

      <title>Coevolution of Camouflage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11793v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Camouflage in nature seems to arise from competition between predator and prey. To survive, predators must find prey, and prey must avoid being found. This work simulates an abstract model of that adversarial relationship. It looks at crypsis through evolving prey camouflage patterns (as color textures) in competition with evolving predator vision. During their "lifetime" predators learn to better locate camouflaged prey. The environment for this 2D simulation is provided by a set of photographs, typically of natural scenes. This model is based on two evolving populations, one of prey and another of predators. Mutual conflict between these populations can produce both effective prey camouflage and predators skilled at "breaking" camouflage. The result is an open source artificial life model to help study camouflage in nature, and the perceptual phenomenon of camouflage more generally.</description>

      <title>ArchComplete: Autoregressive 3D Architectural Design Generation with Hierarchical Diffusion-Based Upsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in 3D generative models have shown promising results but often fall short in capturing the complexity of architectural geometries and topologies and fine geometric details at high resolutions. To tackle this, we present ArchComplete, a two-stage voxel-based 3D generative pipeline consisting of a vector-quantised model, whose composition is modelled with an autoregressive transformer for generating coarse shapes, followed by a hierarchical upsampling strategy for further enrichment with fine structures and details. Key to our pipeline is (i) learning a contextually rich codebook of local patch embeddings, optimised alongside a 2.5D perceptual loss that captures global spatial correspondence of projections onto three axis-aligned orthogonal planes, and (ii) redefining upsampling as a set of conditional diffusion models learning from a hierarchy of randomly cropped coarse-to-fine local volumetric patches. Trained on our introduced dataset of 3D house models with fully modelled exterior and interior, ArchComplete autoregressively generates models at the resolution of $64^{3}$ and progressively refines them up to $512^{3}$, with voxel sizes as small as $ \approx 9\text{cm}$. ArchComplete solves a variety of tasks, including genetic interpolation and variation, unconditional synthesis, shape and plan-drawing completion, as well as geometric detailisation, while achieving state-of-the-art performance in quality, diversity, and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>AutoSketch: VLM-assisted Style-Aware Vector Sketch Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to automatically complete a partial sketch that depicts a complex scene, e.g., "a woman chatting with a man in the park", is very useful. However, existing sketch generation methods create sketches from scratch; they do not complete a partial sketch in the style of the original. To address this challenge, we introduce AutoSketch, a styleaware vector sketch completion method that accommodates diverse sketch styles. Our key observation is that the style descriptions of a sketch in natural language preserve the style during automatic sketch completion. Thus, we use a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) to describe the styles of the partial sketches in natural language and replicate these styles using newly generated strokes. We initially optimize the strokes to match an input prompt augmented by style descriptions extracted from the VLM. Such descriptions allow the method to establish a diffusion prior in close alignment with that of the partial sketch. Next, we utilize the VLM to generate an executable style adjustment code that adjusts the strokes to conform to the desired style. We compare our method with existing methods across various sketch styles and prompts, performed extensive ablation studies and qualitative and quantitative evaluations, and demonstrate that AutoSketch can support various sketch scenarios.</description>
