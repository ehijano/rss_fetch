      <title>Tropical cyclone genesis potential using a ventilated potential intensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genesis potential indices (GPIs) are widely used to understand the climatology of tropical cyclones (TCs). However, the sign of projected future changes depends on how they incorporate environmental moisture. Recent theory combines potential intensity and mid-tropospheric moisture into a single quantity called the ventilated potential intensity, which removes this ambiguity. This work proposes a new GPI ($GPI_v$) that is proportional to the product of the ventilated potential intensity and the absolute vorticity raised to a power. This power is estimated to be approximately 5 by fitting observed tropical cyclone best-track and ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) data. Fitting the model with separate exponents yields nearly identical values, indicating that their product likely constitutes a single joint parameter. Likewise, results are nearly identical for a Poisson model as for the power law. $GPI_v$ performs comparably well to existing indices in reproducing the climatological distribution of tropical cyclone genesis and its covariability with El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation, while only requiring a single fitting exponent. When applied to Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) projections, $GPI_v$ predicts that environments globally will become gradually more favorable for TC genesis with warming, consistent with prior work based on the normalized entropy deficit, though significant changes emerge only at higher latitudes under relatively strong warming. $GPI_v$ helps resolve the debate over the treatment of the moisture term and its implication for changes in TC genesis favorability with warming, and its clearer physical interpretation may offer a step forward towards a theory for genesis across climate states.</description>

      <title>Radiative forcing by super-volcano eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the climatic effects of volcanic eruptions spanning from Mt.\ Pinatubo-sized events to super-volcanoes. The study is based on ensemble simulations in the Community Earth System Model Version 2 (CESM2) climate model using the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model Version 6 (WACCM6) atmosphere model. Our analysis focuses on the impact of different \ce{SO2}-amount injections on stratospheric aerosol optical depth (AOD), effective radiative forcing (RF), and global temperature anomalies. Unlike the traditional linear models used for smaller eruptions, our results reveal a non-linear relationship between RF and AOD for larger eruptions. We also uncover a notable time-dependent decrease in aerosol forcing efficiency across all eruption magnitudes during the first post-eruption year. In addition, the study reveals that larger as compared to medium-sized eruption events produce a delayed and sharper peak in AOD, and a longer-lasting temperature response while the time evolution of RF remains similar between the two eruption types. When including the results of previous studies, we find that relating \ce{SO2} to any other parameter is inconsistent across models compared to the relationships between AOD, RF, and temperature anomaly. Thus, we expect the largest uncertainty in model codes to relate to the chemistry and physics of \ce{SO2} evolution. Finally, we find that the peak RF approaches a limiting value, and that the peak temperature response follows linearly, effectively bounding the temperature anomaly to at most (\sim\SI{-12}{\kelvin}).</description>

      <title>Multivariate post-processing of probabilistic sub-seasonal weather regime forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable forecasts of quasi-stationary, recurrent, and persistent large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns (weather regimes) are crucial for various socio-economic sectors. Despite steady progress, probabilistic weather regime predictions still exhibit biases in the exact timing and amplitude of weather regimes. This study thus aims at advancing probabilistic weather regime predictions in the North Atlantic-European region through ensemble post-processing. Here, we focus on the representation of seven year-round weather regimes in the sub-seasonal to seasonal reforecasts of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The manifestation of each of the seven regimes can be expressed by a continuous weather regime index, representing the projection of the instantaneous 500-hPa geopotential height anomalies (Z500A) onto the respective mean regime pattern. We apply a two-step ensemble post-processing involving first univariate ensemble model output statistics and second ensemble copula coupling, which restores the multivariate dependency structure. Compared to current forecast calibration practices, which rely on correcting the Z500 field by the lead time dependent mean bias, our approach extends the forecast skill horizon for daily/instantaneous regime forecasts moderately by 1.2 days to 14.5 days. Additionally, to our knowledge our study is the first to systematically evaluate the multivariate aspects of forecast quality for weather regime forecasts. Our method outperforms current practices in the multivariate aspect, as measured by the energy and variogram score. Still our study shows, that even with advanced post-processing weather regime prediction becomes difficult beyond 14 days, which likely points towards intrinsic limits of predictability for daily/instantaneous regime forecasts. The proposed method can easily be applied to operational weather regime forecasts.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Review of Coastal Compound Flooding Literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compound flooding, where the combination or successive occurrence of two or more flood drivers leads to an extreme impact, can greatly exacerbate the adverse consequences associated with flooding in coastal regions. This paper reviews the practices and trends in coastal compound flood research methodologies and applications, as well as synthesizes key findings at regional and global scales. Systematic review is employed to construct a literature database of 271 studies relevant to compound flood hazards in a coastal context. This review explores the types of compound flood events, their mechanistic processes, and synthesizes the definitions and terms exhibited throughout the literature. Considered in the review are six flood drivers (fluvial, pluvial, coastal, groundwater, damming/dam failure, and tsunami) and five precursor events and environmental conditions (soil moisture, snow, temp/heat, fire, and drought). Furthermore, this review summarizes the trends in research methodology, examines the wide range of study applications, and considers the influences of climate change and urban environments. Finally, this review highlights the knowledge gaps in compound flood research and discusses the implications of review findings on future practices. Our five recommendations for future compound flood research are to: 1) adopt consistent definitions, terminology, and approaches; 2) expand the geographic coverage of research; 3) pursue more inter-comparison projects; 4) develop modelling frameworks that better couple dynamic earth systems; and 5) design urban and coastal infrastructure with compound flooding in mind. We hope this review will help to enhance understanding of compound flooding, guide areas for future research focus, and close knowledge gaps.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and Scaling of Internally Cooled Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our goal is to investigate fundamental properties of the system of internally cooled convection. The system consists of an upward thermal flux at the lower boundary, a mean temperature lapse-rate and a constant cooling term in the bulk with the bulk cooling in thermal equilibrium with the input heat flux. This simple model represents idealised dry convection in the atmospheric boundary layer, where the cooling mimics the radiative cooling to space notably through longwave radiation. We perform linear stability analysis of the model for different values of the mean stratification to derive the critical forcing above which the fluid is convectively unstable to small perturbations. The dynamic behaviour of the fluid system is described and the scaling of various important measured quantities such as the total vertical convective heat flux and the upward mass flux is measured. We introduce a lapse-rate dependent dimensionless Rayleigh-number $Ra_\gamma$ that determines the behaviour of the system, finding that the convective heat-flux and mass-flux scale scale approximately as $Ra_\gamma^{0.5}$ and $Ra_\gamma^{0.7}$ respectively. The area-fraction of the domain that is occupied by upward and downward moving fluid and the skewness of the vertical velocity are studied to understand the asymmetry inherent in the system. We conclude with a short discussion on the relevance to atmospheric convection and the scope for further investigations of atmospheric convection using similar simplified approaches.</description>
