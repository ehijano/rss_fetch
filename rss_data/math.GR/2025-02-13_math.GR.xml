      <title>On a Class of Self-Similar Polycyclic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A group $G$ is self-similar if it admits a triple $(G,H,f)$ where $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ and $f: H \to G$ a simple homomorphism, that is, the only subgroup $K$ of $H$, normal in $G$ and $f$-invariant ($K^f \leq K$) is trivial. The group $G$ then has two chains of subgroups: \[ G_0 = G,\ H_0 = H,\ G_k = (H_{k-1})^f,\ H_k = H \cap G_{k}\ \text{for } (k \geq 1). \]
  We define a family of self-similar polycyclic groups, denoted $SSP$, where each subgroup $G_k$ is self-similar with respect to the triple $(G_k , H_k, f)$ for all $k$. By definition, a group $G$ belongs to this $SSP$ family provided $f: H \rightarrow G$ is a monomorphism, $H_k$ and $G_{k+1}$ are normal subgroups of index $p$ in $G_k$ ($p$ a prime or infinite) and $G_k=H_kG_{k+1}$. When $G$ is a finite $p$-group in the class $SSP$, we show that the above conditions follow simply from $[G:H] = p$ and $f$ is a simple monomorphism.
  We show that if the Hirsch length of $G$ is $n$, then $G$ has a polycyclic generating set $\{a_1, \ldots, a_n\}$ which is self-similar under the action of $f: a_1 \rightarrow a_2 \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow a_n$, and then $G$ is either a finite $p$-group or is torsion-free. Surprisingly, the arithmetic of $n$ modulo $3$ has a strong impact on the structure of $G$. This fact allows us to prove that $G$ is nilpotent metabelian whose center is free $p$-abelian ($p$ prime or infinite) of rank at least $n/3$.
  We classify those groups $G$ where $H$ has nilpotency class at most $2$. Furthermore, when $p=2$, we prove that $G$ is a finite $2$-group of nilpotency class at most $2$, and classify all such groups.</description>

      <title>Random Quotients of Free Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a density model for random quotients of a free product of finitely generated groups. We prove that a random quotient in this model has the following properties with overwhelming probability: if the density is below $1/2$, the free factors embed into the random quotient and the random quotient is hyperbolic relative to the free factors. Further, there is a phase transition at $1/2$, with the random quotient being a finite group above this density. If the density is below $1/6$, the random quotient is cubulated relative to the free factors. Moreover, if the free factors are cubulated, then so is the random quotient.</description>

      <title>Topological stability of semigroup actions and shadowing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that every expansive continuous monoid action on a compact Hausdorff space which has the shadowing property is topologically stable and that a subshift with finite alphabet over a monoid has the shadowing property if and only if it is of finite type. This extends results previously obtained by Walters, Chung and Lee, Meyerovitch, and Oprocha for continuous actions of countable groups on compact metric spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17551v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let G be a compact real Lie group, and let f be an irreducible complex character of G, of degree &gt; 1. We show that there exists an element g of G, of finite order, such that f(g)=0. We also give an unpublished result of Deligne, about replacing " of finite order " by " of order a power of a prime number ".</description>

      <title>Normal extensions and full restricted semidirect products of inverse semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the normal extensions of inverse semigroups isomorphic to full restricted semidirect products, and present a Kalouznin-Krasner theorem which holds for a wider class of normal extensions of inverse semigroups than that in the well-known embedding theorem due to Billhardt, and also strengthens that result in two respects. First, the wreath product construction applied in our result, and stemmming from Houghton's wreath product, is a full restricted semidirect product not merely a lambda-semidirect product. Second, the Kernel classes of our wreath product construction are direct products of some Kernel classes of the normal extension to be embedded rather than only inverse subsemigroups of the direct power of its whole Kernel.</description>

      <title>Semisimple groups interpretable in various valued fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study infinite groups interpretable in power bounded $T$-convex, $V$-minimal or $p$-adically closed fields. We show that if $G$ is an interpretable definably semisimple group (i.e., has no definable infinite normal abelian subgroups) then, up to a finite index subgroup, it is definably isogenous to a group $G_1\times G_2$, where $G_1$ is a $K$-linear group and $G_2$ is a $\mathbf{k}$-linear group. The analysis is carried out by studying the interaction of $G$ with four distinguished sorts: the valued field $K$, the residue field $\mathbf{k}$, the value group $\Gamma$, and the closed $0$-balls $K/\mathcal{O}$.</description>

      <title>Jordan correspondence and block distribution of characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We complete the determination of the $\ell$-block distribution of characters for quasi-simple exceptional groups of Lie type up to some minor ambiguities relating to non-uniqueness of Jordan decomposition. For this, we first determine the $\ell$-block distribution for finite reductive groups whose ambient algebraic group defined in characteristic different from $\ell$ has connected centre. As a consequence we derive a compatibility between $\ell$-blocks, $e$-Harish-Chandra series and Jordan decomposition. Further we apply our results to complete the proof of Robinson's conjecture on defects of characters.</description>

      <title>Jacobi polynomials, invariant rings, and generalized $t$-designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we provide results that relate the Jacobi polynomials in genus $g$. We show that if a code is $t$-homogeneous that is, the codewords of the code for every given weight hold a $t$-design, then its Jacobi polynomial in genus $g$ with composition $T$ with $|T|\leq t$ can be obtained from its weight enumerator in genus~$g$ using the polarization operator. Using this fact, we investigate the invariant ring, which relates the homogeneous Jacobi polynomials of the binary codes in genus $g$. Specifically, the generators of the invariant ring appearing for $g=1$ are obtained. Moreover, we define the split Jacobi polynomials in genus~$g$ and obtain the MacWilliams type identity for it. A split generalization for higher genus cases of the relation between the Jacobi polynomials and weight enumerator of a $t$-homogeneous code also given.</description>
