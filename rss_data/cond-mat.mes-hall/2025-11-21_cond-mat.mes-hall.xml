      <title>Floquet Bosonic Kitaev Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a class of periodically driven (Hermitian) modified bosonic Kitaev chains that effectively hosts rich nonHermitian Floquet topological phenomena. Two particular models are investigated in details as case studies. The first of these represents a minimal topologically nontrivial model in which nonHermitian skin effect, topological zero modes, and topological $\pi$ modes coexist. The other displays a more sophisticated model that supports multiple topological zero modes and topological $\pi$ modes in a tunable manner. By subjecting both models to perturbations such as a finite onsite bosonic frequency and spatial disorder, these features exhibit distinct responses. In particular, while generally all topological edge modes are robust against such perturbations, the nonHermitian skin effect is easily suppressed and revived by, respectively, the onsite bosonic frequency and spatial disorder in the first model, but it could be insensitive to both perturbations in the second model. Our studies thus demonstrate the prospect of a periodically driven bosonic Kitaev chain as a starting point in exploring various nonHermitian Floquet topological phases through the lens of a Hermitian system.</description>

      <title>Exciton and trion formation in systems with van Hove singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of van-Hove singularities (VHS) in a system's electronic band structure on the formation and properties of excitons and trions. We consider (i) the different parameters of a Mexican-hat-type dispersion of the valence band, which hosts a VHS at the band edge, and (ii) the presence of regular VHS or higher-order VHS (HOVHS). We find that for a given spin-degenerate Mexican-hat-shaped valence band, where a trion and exciton can form, trion formation becomes more favourable as the Mexican-hat dispersion becomes narrower. Also, we show that if the electronic band structure contains an HOVHS, then both the exciton and trion dispersion will also contain such a singularity. Therefore, a HOVHS in the valence band can suitably change the density of states (DOS) of the bound-state particle and lead to the generation of new states, which could impact the optical properties of the system. Our work provides a pathway to how 2D quantum materials, which host such singularities, can be engineered to favour a particular bound-state thus opening new avenues for these materials into potential applications.</description>

      <title>Selective Shuttling of Electrons on Helium Using a CMOS Control Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrons bound to the surface of liquid helium are an emerging quantum computing platform, offering the potential for highly mobile spin qubits that can be manipulated using CMOS-fabricated devices. Here, as a step toward realizing this technology, we demonstrate selective two-dimensional shuttling of electrons across a helium film condensed on the surface of a CMOS control chip. The electrons are moved in packets containing, on average, several tens down to single electrons. We perform CCD-style electron shuttling in any of 128 transport microchannels, each of which links electron storage zones and sensing zones in the 2D plane. Shuttling sequences can be repeated at least 10$^9$ times with no detectable electron loss. The device serves as a prototype quantum information processing platform that is readily scalable to control large monolithically integrated arrays of single electron spins.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Transport in Cr-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3: Absence of Nonchiral Edge States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect shows great promise for realization of the ohm without the need for an external magnetic field. The most mature material platform is magnetically doped topological insulators. In these materials, precise quantization is limited to low temperatures, with the activation energy for dissipative transport typically in the range of 1 K. One potential source of dissipative transport is non-chiral edge states. These states are expected to be present in sufficiently thick samples. In this work, we perform extensive Hall and non-local resistance measurements in a Hall bar geometry at 2 K. By comparing 15 independent transport measurements to different transport models, we find that the system behavior is well-described by a simple continuum Ohm's law model. The addition of non-chiral edge states into the model does not significantly improve the fitting, and we conclude that there is not strong evidence for these states. We discuss the implications of our results for the prospect of high temperature quantized anomalous Hall effect in these materials.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal spin wave in room-temperature van der Waals ferromagnet $(\rm Fe_{0.78}Co_{0.22})_{5}GeTe_{2}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we investigate the spin waves in room-temperature van der Waals ferromagnet $(\rm Fe_{0.78}Co_{0.22})_{5}GeTe_{2}$ by utilizing Brillouin light scattering technique. The spin wave dispersion in flakes of different thicknesses shows the key role of dipolar interaction in the spin waves of vdW ferromagnets, and the non-reciprocity of spin wave in thick flakes is observed, which is attributed to the bulk Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction after excluding the influence of dynamic dipolar interaction. The measured bulk DMI parameter D is 0.08 $\rm mJ/m^2$, which is double that of pure $\rm Fe_5GeTe_2$. Our work shows that Co-doped $\rm Fe_5GeTe_2$ is a promising platform for investigating propagating spin wave and topological spin textures at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Skyrmionium meta-matter: a topologically heterogeneous magnetic crystal with emergent hybrid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and systematically investigate a new class of topological magnetic textures, skyrmionium meta-matter, composed of skyrmioniums (Skm, $Q=0$) and skyrmions (Sk, $Q=-1$) arranged in periodic lattices mimicking the richness of atomic materials. Pure skyrmionium lattices are unstable against elongation distortions and relax into the spiral phase, but even a small fraction of skyrmions acts as topological "pins" that stabilize diverse mixed Skm--Sk crystals. We classify these states by topological stoichiometry (Skm$_n$Sk$_m$) and show that each composition hosts multiple metastable polymorphs with distinct plane-group symmetries. Structural transformations between polymorphs are achieved by varying the lattice spacing, suggesting experimental control via pressure or strain. The collective spin dynamics is explored for both in-plane and out-of-plane AC magnetic fields. The resulting absorption spectra show resonant modes beyond the two rotational and one breathing mode of conventional skyrmion lattices. We identify hybrid excitations unique to Skm--Sk crystals, including (i) deformation-assisted rotations, where skyrmions acquire polygonal shapes and rotate, and (ii) orbital modes, where breathing skyrmioniums induce circular motion of confined skyrmions without changing their size. Mode frequencies span sub-GHz to above 10 GHz, consistent with exchange and DMI energy scales. Our results establish skyrmionium-based meta-matter as a versatile platform for tunable, topologically heterogeneous magnetic lattices with rich structural and dynamical properties, paving the way for reconfigurable magnonic and spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>A simple quantum dot: numerical and variational solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a simple quantum dot that consists of two crossed troughs. As such there is no potential well; nonetheless this geometry gives rise to a bound state, centred around the point at which these troughs cross one another. In this paper we review existing numerical methods to solve this problem, and highlight one which we feel is particularly elegant and, in this case, provides the most accurate solution to the problem. The bound state is well-contained on the scale of the trough width, and yields a bound state energy of $0.659606$ in units of the minimum continuum state energy. This method also motivates a simple variational solution which yields the lowest energy known to date ($0.6812$ in the same units) to arise out of an analytical variational solution.</description>

      <title>Nature of 2D XY antiferromagnetism in a van der Waals monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional antiferromagnetism has long attracted significant interest in many areas of condensed matter physics, but only recently has experimental exploration become feasible due to the isolation of van der Waals antiferromagnetic monolayers. Probing the magnetic phase diagram of these monolayers remains however challenging because established experimental techniques often lack the required sensitivity. Here, we investigate antiferromagnetism in atomically thin van der Waals magnet NiPS3 using magnetotransport measurements in field-effect transistor devices. Temperature-dependent conductance and magnetoresistance data reveal a distinct magnetic behavior in monolayers as compared to thicker samples. While bilayer and multilayer NiPS3 exhibit a single magnetic phase transition into a zig-zag antiferromagnetic state driven by uniaxial anisotropy, monolayer NiPS3 undergoes two magnetic transitions, with a low-temperature phase governed by in-plane hexagonal magnetic anisotropy. The experimentally constructed phase diagram for monolayer NiPS3 matches theoretical predictions from the six-state clock and 2D-XY models incorporating hexagonal anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Phonon Dichroisms Revealing Unusual Electronic Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum geometry tensor, intrinsic geometric characteristics of electronic states, plays a crucial role in the various nontrivial electromagnetic phenomena in quantum materials. Here, we reveal that quantum geometry significantly modifies phonon dichroisms through electron-phonon interactions in solids that break time-reversal and spatial inversion symmetries. Specifically, the circular phonon dichroism is primarily dominated by the heat magnetic moments, while the linear phonon dichroism depends on the heat Drude weight, a thermal analog of band Drude weight. Furthermore, we establish the f-sum rule for the heat magnetic moment that facilitates its experimental detections. We demonstrate our key findings in an archetypal model system: ferromagnetic two-dimensional electron gases with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Our work uncovers the quantum-geometric origin of common phonon dichroisms and predicts the detectable signature of the heat magnetic moment of electrons in solids.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Spatiotemporal Plasmonic Vortices On Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal vortices are polychromatic modes that intertwine orbital angular momentum (OAM) in space and time. Here we introduce a new class of such vortices, spatiotemporal plasmonic vortices (STPVs), carrying nontrivial topological spin textures. They are generated by chronotopic interference of temporally delayed plasmonic eigen-vortices, where a $\pi$-phase dislocation in the space-frequency domain maps into a 2$\pi$ spiraling phase in space-time, with the resulting focus-defocus dynamics emulate U(1) gauge transitions. Using interferometric time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy (ITR-PEEM), we directly image their nanometer-attosecond (nano-atto) evolution and control vortex number and position. Quantum-path analysis of coherent two-photon photoemission (2PP) processes reveals the nonlinear plasmonic polarization fields and angular-momentum conservation, establishing STPVs as a platform for probing spatiotemporally structured quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast {\mu}eV-Precision Bandgap Engineering in Low-Dimensional Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise and ultrafast control of electronic band structures is a central challenge for advancing quantum functional materials and devices. Conventional approaches--such as chemical doping, lattice strain, or external gating--offer robust stability but remain confined to the quasi-static regime, far from the intrinsic femto- to picosecond dynamics that govern many-body interactions. Here, using cryogenic transient reflectance spectroscopy, we realize dynamic bandgap engineering in the anisotropic topological insulator $\alpha$-Bi$_4$Br$_4$ with unprecedented micro-electron-volt ($\mu$eV) precision. The exceptional sensitivity arises from the cooperative action of long-lived topological carriers, stabilized by restricted bulk-to-edge scattering phase space, together with symmetry-resolved coherent phonons that modulate inter-chain hopping. These channels jointly modify Coulomb screening and interband transitions, enabling both gradual and oscillatory control of the electronic structure. Supported by first-principles and tight-binding theory, we further demonstrate a dual-pump coherent control strategy for continuous, mode-selective tuning of electronic energies with $\mu$eV accuracy. This framework paves the way for ultrafast on-demand band-structure engineering, pointing toward new frontiers in quantum optoelectronics, precision measurement in molecular and biological systems, and attosecond control of matter.</description>

      <title>Geometrical properties of strained and twisted moir\'e heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experimental observations of many interaction-driven electronic phases in moir\'e superlattices have stimulated intense theoretical and experimental efforts to understand and engineer these correlated physics. Strain is a powerful tool for manipulating and controlling the geometrical and electronic structures of moir\'e superlattices. This review provides a comprehensive introduction to the geometry of strained moir\'e superlattices. First, starting from the linear elasticity theory, we briefly introduce the general formalism of small deformations in two-dimensional materials, and discuss the particular cases of uniaxial, shear and biaxial strain. Then, we apply the theory to twisted and strained moir\'e materials, mainly focusing on the hexagonal homobilayers, hexagonal heterobilayers and monoclinic lattices. Special moir\'e geometries, like the quasi-unidimensional patterns, square patterns and hexagonal, are theoretically predicted by manipulating the strain and twist. Finally, we review recently developed strain techniques and the special moir\'e geometries realized via these approaches. This review aims at equipping the reader with a robust understanding on the description and implementation of strain in moir\'e materials, as well as highlight some major breakthroughs in this active field.</description>

      <title>Failure of the Goldstone Theorem for Vector Fields and Boundary-Mode Proliferation in Hyperbolic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperbolic lattices extend crystallinity into curved space, where negative curvature and exponentially large boundaries reshape collective excitations beyond Euclidean intuition. In this Letter, we push the study beyond scalar fields by exploring vector fields on hyperbolic lattices. Using phonons as an example, we show that the Goldstone theorem breaks down for vector fields in hyperbolic lattices. In stark contrast to Euclidean crystals, where the Goldstone theorem ensures that acoustic phonon modes are gapless, hyperbolic lattices with coordination number $z &gt; 2d$ exhibit a finite bulk phonon gap. We identify the origin of this breakdown: the Goldstone modes here belong to nonunitary representations of the translation group and therefore cannot form gapless excitation branches. We further show that when boundaries are included, this bulk spetrum gap is filled by an extensive number of low-frequency boundary modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Simmons model is a well-known and widely used model for the elastic tunneling current of a metallic tunnel junction, and fitting it to electrical measurements can be used to estimate thicknesses and heights of the tunnel barriers. We present here an improvement of the Simmons model, deriving new more accurate analytical formulas for the tunneling current density and conductance at finite voltage and temperature. We demonstrate that our conductance-voltage formulas are much closer to the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation than the Simmons model and its commonly used simplified parabolic approximation. In addition, we demonstrate the practical use of our model, by fitting it to experimental tunnel junction conductance-voltage data and showing a sizeable difference from the Simmons model.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-Shaped Quantum Geometry in Nonlinear Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of the intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect, a key probe of quantum geometry, is plagued by conflicting expressions for the conductivity that is independent of the dissipation strength (rate, $\Gamma^0$). We clarify the origin of this ambiguity by demonstrating that the "intrinsic" response is not universal, but is inextricably linked to the dissipation mechanism that establishes the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS). We establish a benchmark by solving the exact NESS density matrix for a generic Bloch system coupled to a featureless fermionic bath. Our exact $\Gamma^0$ conductivity decomposes into two parts: (i) a geometric contribution, $\sigma^{\text{geo}}$, whose form recovers the intraband quantum metric dipole ($\sim\partial_k g$), providing an exact derivation that clarifies inconsistencies in the literature, and (ii) a novel, purely kinetic contribution, $\sigma^{\text{kin}} \propto v^3 f^{(4)}_0$, which is absent when dissipation is modeled by white-noise disorder (e.g., a constant-$\Gamma$ Green's function model). The discrepancy in $\sigma^{\text{kin}}$ between these distinct physical mechanisms is a proof that the $\Gamma^0$ nonlinear conductivity is not a unique property of the Bloch Hamiltonian, but is contingent on the physical system-bath coupling.</description>

      <title>Observation of Magnetostatic Surface Spin Wave Solitons in Yttrium Iron Garnet Thin Film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetostatic surface spin wave (MSSW) solitons hold great promise for magnonic information processing, but their existence has long been debated. In this work, we resolve this issue by advanced time-resolved Brillouin light scattering (TR-BLS) spectroscopy. We observe long-period MSSW soliton trains in yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin films by demonstrating their quasiparticle behavior, mode beating, and periodic modulations. We reveal that the MSSW soliton originates from the dipole gap mechanism with a unique comb-like frequency spectrum caused by the four-magnon process. By varying the microwave power, we find significant changes in soliton periods linked to the spin wave dispersion renormalization. Additionally, we report exotic transverse solitons across the YIG thickness. These findings deepen the understanding of nonlinear physics, and pave the way for spin-wave-soliton-based information technologies.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic charge transport through non-Bloch bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the non-reciprocal intracell hopping mediated non-Hermitian topological phases of an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model hosting second-nearest-neighbour hopping. We microscopically analyze the phase boundaries using the non-Bloch momentum while the off-critical (critical) phases are directly associated with the gapped (gapless) nature of the non-Bloch bands that we derive from the characteristic equation using the gauge freedom. The non-Bloch momentum accurately reflects the bulk boundary correspondence (BBC) explaining the winding number profile under open boundary conditions. We examine the adiabatic dynamics to promote the concept of adiabatic charge transport in a non-Hermitian scenario justifying the BBC in spatio-temporal Bott index and non-Bloch Chern number. Once the non-Bloch bands experience no (a) gap-closing during the evolution of time, quantized flow of is preserved (broken). Our study systematically unifies the concept of non-Bloch bands for both static and driven situations.</description>

      <title>Probing moire excitons in MoSe2/WSe2 heterobilayers by combined micro-photoluminescence and lateral force microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study interlayer excitons in MoSe2/WSe2 heterobilayers, by combining lateral force microscopy and micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy. This allows us to correlate the spatial profile of the moir\'e superlattice with the distribution of optically active states accessible to interlayer excitons. In heterostructures where a few degrees twist angle is imposed between the MoSe and WSe crystallographic axes, we show that a continuous moir\'e lattice is realized across areas close to the optical diffraction limit. In such regions, the photoluminescence reduces to a few narrow-band lines only, energetically distributed consistently with the geometry of the moir\'e lattice. This correlation reveals that interlayer excitons explore a controlled periodic confinement, paving the way towards implementations of Bose-Hubbard models.</description>

      <title>Pervasive spin-triplet superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields typically suppress superconductivity once the Zeeman energy exceeds the pairing gap, unless mechanisms such as unconventional pairing, strong spin-orbit coupling, or intrinsic magnetism intervene. Several graphene platforms realize such mitigating routes, exhibiting superconductivity resilient to magnetic fields. Here we report superconductivity in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene that is both induced and stabilized by in-plane magnetic field ($B_{\parallel}$), with critical fields far beyond the Pauli paramagnetic limit. The superconductivity spans a wide gate range and emerges from a sharp zero-field resistive ridge that tracks approximately constant conduction band filling. The presence of zero-field superconductivity and the evolution of the critical temperature with $B_{\parallel}$ are highly gate sensitive. We also observe a weak superconducting diode effect in several distinct regimes within the superconducting phase, including nearby to an integer quantum anomalous Hall state generated by a boron nitride moir\'e superlattice, indicating a potential coexistence of valley imbalance and superconductivity. These results establish several intriguing new properties of spin-triplet, field-induced superconductivity in a thick rhombohedral graphene stack.</description>

      <title>Generation of spin-squeezed states using dipole-coupled spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spins in solids and molecules are promising for applications of quantum sensing technology. The sensitivity of the quantum sensing depends on how precisely spin observables can be determined in the measurement, and is intrinsically limited by the uncertainties of the observables. The use of a spin-squeezed state in a quantum sensor can reduce the uncertainty below the standard quantum limit when combined with an appropriate measurement procedure. Here, we discuss the simulation study of the generation of a squeezed state in an interacting spin system. We show that a spin system coupled by the magnetic dipole interaction can create a squeezed state. Model systems to realize the spin squeezing experimentally are also discussed. In addition, we find that a squeezed state is a type of entangled state. The present work paves the way to realize a squeezed state using a spin system to build a quantum sensor network with improved sensitivity, and to use it for the detection of quantum entanglement.</description>

      <title>Single-mode magnon-polariton lasing and amplification controlled by dissipative coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate single-mode lasing of magnon polaritons in a cavity magnonic system enabled by dissipative coupling between two passive modes, microwave cavity mode and magnon mode in a ferrimagnetic spin ensemble. The cavity mode is partially compensated through a feedback circuit, which reduces its linewidth but retains its dissipative nature. By tuning the compensation strength and dissipative coupling strength, we reach a system cooperativity of unity, marking the lasing threshold and the formation of a zero-linewidth polariton mode. This mode also corresponds to a perfect Friedrich-Wintgen bound state in the continuum. Further increase of the cooperativity drives the system into the strong dissipative coupling regime, where magnon polariton amplification arises between two real frequency scattering poles. These results reveal that dissipative coupling cooperativity carries a clear physical meaning and serves as a key parameter for controlling phase transitions. Dissipative coupling offers an alternative paradigm for tailoring light matter interactions, paving the way for advances in both information processing and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Transfer of Freestanding Fluoropolymer Films for Advanced Semiconductor Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reliable transfer of insulating films onto semiconductor or metal surfaces is vital for enabling damage-free integration, especially where direct deposition is difficult or surface sensitivity to the growth environment degrades interface quality. However, insulating materials that are both easily transferable, scalable and capable of withstanding high electric fields remain limited, and the search for such materials has attracted significant attention. Herein, a distinct and robust method is demonstrated for damage-free transfer of freestanding fluoropolymer insulating films onto a wide range of substrates including low-adhesion surfaces such as hydrogen-terminated diamond. Water-soluble sacrificial layer allows the exfoliation of fluoropolymer films with peripheral support, enabling their transfer as uniform freestanding films, which exhibit root-mean-square roughness of $0.45 {\pm} 0.03$ nm. These films reveal high breakdown fields exceeding $7$ MV cm$^{-1}$, with leakage current density remaining below ${10}^{-8}$ A cm$^{-2}$ before the breakdown. The incorporation of these fluoropolymer films as gate dielectrics in p-channel hydrogen-terminated diamond field-effect transistors results in transfer and output characteristics with negligible hysteresis, enhanced channel mobility (${\approx}400$ cm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$) and a low interface trap density (${\le}3{\times}10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$eV$^{-1}$). These findings highlight the versatility of the transfer method and establish freestanding fluoropolymers as a practical alternative to deposited dielectrics for forming high-quality dielectric/semiconductor interfaces for advanced electronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum batteries are quantum mechanical systems able to store and release energy in a controlled fashion. Among them, a special role is played by quantum structures defined as networks of two-level systems. In this context, it has recently been shown that the energy stored in free fermion quantum batteries is sensitive to the quantum phase diagram of the battery itself. This sensitivity is relevant for stabilizing the stored energy and designing optimal charging protocols. In this article, we explore universal charging behaviors of free fermion quantum batteries across quantum phase transitions. We first analyze a Dirac cone-like model to extract general features. Then, we verify our findings by means of two relevant lattice models, namely the Ising chain in a transverse field and the Haldane model.</description>

      <title>Topological transition in spectrum of skyrmion crystal with uniaxial anisotropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The band structure of elementary excitations of skyrmion crystal in thin ferromagnetic film with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and uniaxial magnetic anisotropy under external magnetic field is studied. In the absence of anisotropy there is a topological transition in the spectrum of skyrmion crystal: the gap between breathing and counter-clock-wise modes closes, which is accompanied by changes of Berry curvature sign of these bands. In this work we demonstrate that such topological transition exists in some range of the uniaxial anisotropy values. We present a phase diagram showing that the value of the field of topological transition is higher in the easy-plane domain and lower in the easy-axis domain of anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary Control of Non-Hermitian Skin Modes via Disorder and Electric Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), characterized by the accumulation of a macroscopic number of bulk states at system boundaries, is a hallmark of non-Hermitian physics. However, effective control of skin-mode localization in higher-dimensional systems remains challenging. Here, we propose a versatile approach to manipulate the localization of skin modes in a two-dimensional nonreciprocal lattice by combining disorder and a static electric field. While the electric field alone suppresses the NHSE in a clean system, the introduction of disorder induces transverse wave-packet transport perpendicular to the field. When the nonreciprocal hopping direction is misaligned with the electric field, the hopping component perpendicular to the field guides the wave-packet propagation and leads to boundary localization. By tuning the relative orientations of the electric field and the nonreciprocal hopping, arbitrary control over the boundary localization position can be achieved. Our results demonstrate a robust and tunable mechanism for engineering boundary accumulation and directed transport in non-Hermitian systems, offering new opportunities for applications in classical platforms and quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Lindbladian approach for many-qubit thermal machines: enhancing the performance with geometric heat pumping by entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of slowly driven quantum thermal machines based on interacting qubits within the framework of the Lindblad master equation. By implementing a systematic expansion in the driving rate, we derive explicit expressions for the rate of work of the driving forces, the heat currents exchanged with the reservoirs, and the entropy production up to second order, ensuring full thermodynamic consistency in the linear-response regime. The formalism naturally separates geometric and dissipative contributions, identified by a Berry curvature and a metric in parameter space, respectively. Analytical results show that the geometric heat pumped per cycle is bounded by $k_B T N_q \ln 2$ for $N_q$ non-interacting qubits, in direct analogy with the Landauer limit for entropy change. This bound can be surpassed when qubit interactions and asymmetric couplings to the baths are introduced. Numerical results for the interacting two-qubit system reveal a non-trivial role of the interaction between qubits and the coupling between the qubits and the baths in the behavior of the dissipated power. The approach provides a general platform for studying dissipation, pumping, and performance optimization in driven quantum devices operating as heat engines.</description>

      <title>Strained hyperbolic Dirac fermions: Zero modes, flat bands, and competing orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from the nearest-neighbor tight-binding model on {10,3} and {14,3} hyperbolic lattices that, for a uniform hopping amplitude, gives rise to emergent Dirac fermions on a curved space with a constant negative curvature, displaying a vanishing density of states, we propose spatially modulated hopping pattern therein that preserve the underlying 5- and 7-fold rotational symmetries, respectively, and effectively couples fermions to time-reversal symmetric axial magnetic fields. Such strain-induced axial fields produce a flat band near zero-energy, triggering nucleation of a charge density-wave, featuring a staggered pattern of fermionic density between two sublattices, and the Haldane phase fostering intra-sublattice circulating currents with a net zero magnetic flux for weak nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsions, respectively. Sufficiently weak on-site Hubbard repulsion destabilizes such flat bands toward the formation of a magnetic phase that simultaneously supports antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic orders in the whole system. While the magnetization in the bulk and boundary cancel each other, the Ne\'el order is of the same sign everywhere, thereby yielding a global antiferromagnet. Throughout, we draw parallels between these findings and the well-studied qualitatively similar results on a 3-fold rotational symmetric strained honeycomb lattice, thereby unifying the phenomenon of axial magnetic catalysis for Dirac fermions, encompassing the ones living on the Euclidean plane. Finally, we show that with a specific class of non-Hermiticity, manifesting via an imbalance in the hopping amplitudes between two sublattices in the opposite directions, magnitudes of all these orders can be boosted substantially when all the eigenvalues in the noninteracting systems are real, staging a non-Hermitian amplification of axial magnetic catalysis.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic back-switching phenomenon in SOT-MRAM devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19840v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The writing process of SOT-MRAMs is considered deterministic when additional symmetry-breaking factors, such as the application of an external magnetic field aligned with the current, are present. Notably, the write probability exhibits a unique behavior as a function of the current: it drops to zero at high currents or even oscillates with the current. This phenomenon is attributed to back-switching, an intrinsic effect of magnetization reversal driven by spin-orbit torques. A systematic investigation of this back-switching phenomenon is conducted on sub-100 nm CoFeB magnetic pillars positioned at the center of $\beta$-W Hall crosses. Using a statistical approach, the study examines the impact of various parameters, including the amplitude of current pulses and the application of magnetic fields in different directions. The findings reveal that the back-switching phenomenon is not statistically random. Macrospin simulations, employing realistic magnetic parameter values, accurately replicate the experimental observations and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of back-switching. These simulations also explore strategies to mitigate the phenomenon, such as optimizing the shape of the writing pulses. Applying this approach to complete SOT-MRAM single cells achieves a write error rate below $2 \times 10^{-6}$, demonstrating the effectiveness of this strategy in expanding the operational current range for write operations in SOT-MRAMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a shifted magnetic bilayer that exhibits various magnetic phases and magnetic textures with arbitrarily large topological numbers. The proposed system is characterised by a mutually orthogonal Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in two different layers which can be induced by suitably placing non-magnetic atom with spin-orbit coupling. At weak interlayer coupling, the ground state resembles a checker-board pattern containing regions with unfavourable magnetic alignment which we call anti-aligned points. At finite interlayer coupling and finite external magnetic field, the bilayer can demonstrate a new class of magnetic solitons where multiple magnetic solitons can be connected by topological point defects which we call linked skyrmion. In addition to that the model also demonstrates conventional skyrmion-bags and $k\pi$-skyrmions. Finally, with rigorous first principle calculations, we propose a suitable material candidate where these magnetic configurations can be observed.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast optical excitation of magnons in 2D antiferromagnetic semiconductors via spin torque mediated by unbound electron-hole pairs and excitons: Signatures in magnonic charge pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02793v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments observing how femtosecond laser pulse (fsLP) excites magnons in two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic (AF) semiconductors -- such as CrSBr, NiPS$_3$, and MnPS$_3$, or their van der Waals heterostructures -- suggest an important role played by excitons. However, microscopic details of such an effect remain obscure, as resonant coupling of magnons, living in the sub-meV energy range, to excitons, living in the \mbox{$\sim 1$ eV} range, can hardly be operative. Here, we develop a quantum transport theory of this effect, in which time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's function (TDNEF) for electrons driven by fsLP is coupled self-consistently to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation describing classical dynamics of localized magnetic moments (LMMs) residing on magnetic atoms of 2D AF semiconductors. This theory explains how fsLP, of central frequency {\em above} the semiconductor gap, generates a photocurrent that becomes spin-polarized due to the background of LMMs, which, in turn, exerts spin-transfer torque (STT) onto LMMs as a genuinely nonequilibrium spintronic mechanism. The collective motion of LMMs analyzed by windowed Fast Fourier transform (FFT) decodes frequencies of excited magnons, as well as their lifetime governed by {\em nonlocal} damping with the LLG equation due to electronic bath. Finally, our theory also predicts that excited magnons will {\em pump} time-dependent charge currents into the attached electrodes, or locally within 2D AF semiconductor, thereby emitting electromagnetic radiation. The windowed FFT of these two signals contains imprints of excited magnons, as well as possible presence of excitons, which could be exploited as a novel probe in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Scalable Effective Models for Superconducting Nanostructures: Applications to Double, Triple, and Quadruple Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a versatile and scalable framework for constructing effective models of superconducting (SC) nanostructures described by the generalized SC Anderson impurity model with multiple quantum dots and leads. Our Chain Expansion (ChE) method maps each SC lead onto a finite tight-binding chain with parameters obtained from \emph{Pad\'e} approximants of the tunneling self-energy. We provide an explicit algorithm for the general case as well as simple analytical expressions for the chain parameters in the wide-band and infinite-chain limits. This mapping preserves low-energy physics while enabling efficient simulations: short chains are tractable using exact diagonalization, and longer ones are handled with density matrix renormalization group methods. The approach remains reliable and computationally efficient across diverse geometries, both in and out of equilibrium. We use ChE to map the ground-state phase diagrams of double, triple, and quadruple quantum dots coupled to a single SC lead. While half-filled symmetric systems show similar overall diagrams, the particular phases differ substantially with the dot number. Here, large parameter regions are entirely missed by the widely used zero-bandwidth approximation but are captured by ChE. Away from half-filling, additional dots markedly increase diagram complexity, producing a rich variety of stable phases. These results demonstrate ChE as a fast, accurate, and systematically improvable tool for exploring complex SC nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Orbital Accumulation Induced by Chiral Phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate orbital accumulation driven by chiral phonons via orbital-dependent electron-lattice coupling. We derive a formula for the orbital accumulation induced by classical lattice dynamics or nonequilibrium phonons, using the Berry curvature, linear response theory, and the nonequilibrium Green's function method. We show that chiral phonons primarily couple to orbital quadrupole moments and that static orbital dipole accumulation can be generated in the second-order of lattice displacement. Our study provides a useful method for generating orbital accumulation without using spin-orbit interactions and suggests a strategy to boost its magnitude by harnessing band structure hot spots associated with orbital degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Impact of Carrier Injector Design on the Threshold of Interband Cascade Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate theoretically how the injector region design of interband cascade lasers (ICLs) impacts the threshold carrier and current densities. The model combines a polarization-sensitive 8-band $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ calculation, electrostatics, and a microscopic calculation of Auger recombination rates. The carrier-carrier scattering is included to lowest order within the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism. It captures the combined effects of charge carrier redistribution, parasitic absorption and bias voltage on the Auger recombination rate. We show that heavily doping the electron injector suppresses the dominant multi-hole Auger recombination by reducing the hole population of the recombination quantum wells. This agrees with the experimental observation that the heavy doping reduces threshold currents. Yet, our model suggests that the Auger recombination alone is not sufficient to explain the increase of threshold currents at high doping concentrations. Furthermore, by introducing indium to the conventional GaSb hole injector wells, we explain the rule of thumb from experiments that raising the hole injector levels does not outperform the doping strategy. Our model provides physical insights toward optimization of ICL carrier injectors.</description>

      <title>First-principles prediction of altermagnetism in transition metal graphite intercalation compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the emergence of altermagnetism, a magnetic phase characterized by the coexistence of compensated spin ordering and momentum-dependent spin splitting, in graphite intercalation compounds (GICs), a prototypical material system long investigated for its tunable electronic and structural properties. Through first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that vanadium-intercalated stage-1 graphite compounds, exhibit inherent altermagnetic properties. The hexagonal crystal system and antiferromagnetic ordering of V atoms generate a magnetic space group that enforces alternating spin polarization in momentum space while maintaining zero net magnetization. The calculated band structure reveals robust altermagnetic signatures: along the high-symmetry direction, we observe a pronounced spin splitting of ~270 meV with alternating spin polarization. Crucially, the spin splitting exhibits minimal sensitivity to spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect, highlighting the dominance of exchange interactions over relativistic effects. From Monte Carlo simulations, we predict a magnetic transition temperature ($T_m$ ) of ~228 K, indicating stable magnetic ordering above liquid nitrogen temperatures. The combination of symmetry-protected spin textures, SOC-independent splitting, and elevated $T_m$ temperature makes V-GICs as a promising candidate for spintronic applications, particularly for zero-field spin-polarized current generation and topologically robust spin transport. As the first demonstration of carbon-based alternating magnetic systems, this work offers a design paradigm for engineering spin-polarized quantum states governed by crystalline symmetry constraints.</description>

      <title>Control of growth morphology of deposited fcc metals through tuning substrate-metal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise control over thin film morphology is critical for optimizing material properties across diverse technological applications, as the growth mode (whether 2D layer-by-layer or 3D island formation)determines key functional properties such as electrical conductivity in CMOS interconnect applications and catalytic activity, where island distribution and size dictate performance. To explore the role of the substrate on the morphology of deposited metals, we present extensive kinetic Monte Carlo simulations on six fcc metals growing in the (111) direction: Ag, Au, Cu, Ni, Pd and Pt. Our simulation framework enables screening and evaluation of their growth mode under homoepitaxial growth scenarios and proposes morphology control strategies by variation of substrate-metal interaction strengths, modeled by modifying the activation energies for upward and downward migration, combined with thermal vacuum annealing within typical back end of line (BEOL) integration thermal budget. Our simulation results demonstrate that modulation of the substrate interaction strength can be effectively employed to promote island formation or layer-by-layer growth modes overcoming limitations in achieving large flat surface areas. Au, Pd and Pt exhibit the highest sensitivity to substrate interaction strength variations, followed by Ag, showing that strongly interacting substrates decrease the root mean square (RMS) roughness, (uncovered) substrate exposure, island number and island aspect ratios, with moderate increases in flat surface areas and atomic coordination numbers. Additionally, interconnect relevant metrics are improved through thermal vacuum annealing particularly when sufficiently strong metal-substrate interactions are employed, reducing surface roughness, achieving larger flat surface areas, merging and smoothing islands, and decreasing defect density...</description>

      <title>Intrinsic structure of relaxor ferroelectrics from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We hybridize the swap Monte Carlo and geometric relaxation methods to determine the intrinsic compositional structure (CS) of the lead magnesium niobate (PMN) relaxor. We verify the stability of a Nb-rich sublattice in PMN, as prescribed by the prevailing random-site model. However, ions in the complementary sublattice are not randomly mixed. Most Nb ions collapse into a single percolating cluster with a mesh-like structure. This specific geometry serves to prevent large space charges, and this behavior differs from typical phase separation in metallic alloys. Subsequent molecular dynamics simulations predict a pair distribution function that is consistent with neutron scattering experiments. Analysis of dipolar structures in the Nb cluster sheds light on the unique dielectric properties of PMN.</description>
