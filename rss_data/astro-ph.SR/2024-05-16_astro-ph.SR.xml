      <title>Calibrating the WSA model in EUHFORIA based on PSP observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations during the latest solar minimum period (years 2018 -2021) to calibrate the version of the Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) coronal model used in the European space weather forecasting tool EUHFORIA. WSA provides a set of boundary conditions at 0.1 au necessary to initiate the heliospheric part of EUHFORIA, namely, the domain extending beyond the solar Alfvenic point. To calibrate WSA, we observationally constrain four constants in the WSA semi-empirical formula based on PSP observations. We show how the updated (after the calibration) WSA boundary conditions at 0.1 au are compared to PSP observations at similar distances, and we further propagate these conditions in the heliosphere according to EUHFORIAs magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) approach. We assess the predictions at Earth based on the Dynamic Time Warping technique. Our findings suggest that, for the period of interest, the WSA configurations which resembled optimally the PSP observations close to the Sun, were different than the ones needed to provide better predictions at Earth. One reason for this discrepancy can be attributed to the scarcity of fast solar wind velocities recorded by PSP. The calibration of the model was performed based on unexpectedly slow velocities that did not allow us to achieve generally and globally improved solar wind predictions, compared to older studies. Other reasons can be attributed to missing physical processes from the heliospheric part of EUHFORIA but also the fact that the currently employed WSA relationship, as coupled to the heliospheric MHD domain, may need a global reformulation beyond that of just updating the four constant factors that were taken into account in this study.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Predictive Modeling of Solar Coronal Holes Using Computer Vision and LSTM Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of space exploration, coronal holes on the sun play a significant role due to their impact on satellites and aircraft through their open magnetic fields and increased solar wind emissions. This study employs computer vision techniques to detect coronal hole regions and estimate their sizes using imagery from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Additionally, we utilize deep learning methods, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to analyze trends in the area of coronal holes and predict their areas across various solar regions over a span of seven days. By examining time series data, we aim to identify patterns in coronal hole behavior and understand their potential effects on space weather. This research enhances our ability to anticipate and prepare for space weather events that could affect Earth's technological systems.</description>

      <title>A Sample of Compact Object Candidates in Single-lined Spectroscopic Binaries from LAMOST Medium Resolution Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar spectra from LAMOST Medium Resolution Survey can be used to search for compact objects in binaries. The LAMOST DR10 catalog includes &gt; 980, 000 targets with multiple medium resolution spectra. We select the targets with large or rapid radial velocity variation, and obtained an input-sample of 1822 sources. We use light curves and spectra to identify and exclude eclipsing binaries and double-lined spectroscopic binaries in the input-sample. We finally derive a catalog of 89 candidates with well-folded radial velocity, which are all single-lined spectroscopic binaries, indicating an unseen companion residing in each system. The mass function of each system can be well constrained based on the radial velocity curve. In our sample, 26 sources have mass function higher than 0.1 $M_{\odot}$, among which 18 sources have ellipsoidal type light curves. In our opinion, compact objects are likely existent in all these 26 binaries, which are worth follow-up identification.</description>

      <title>Haro 5-2: A New Pre-Main Sequence Quadruple Stellar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have discovered that the Halpha emission line star Haro 5-2, located in the 3-6 Myr old Ori OB1b association, is a young quadruple system. The system has a 2+2 configuration with an outer separation of 2.6 arcseconds and with resolved subarcsecond inner binary components. The brightest component, Aa, dominates the A-binary, it is a weakline T Tauri star with spectral type M2.5pm1. The two stars of the B component are equally bright at J, but the Bb star is much redder. Optical spectroscopy of the combined B pair indicates a rich emission line spectrum with a M3pm1 spectral type. The spectrum is highly variable and switches back and forth between a classical and a weakline T Tauri star. In the near-infrared, the spectrum shows Paschen beta and Brackett gamma in emission, indicative of active accretion. A significant mid-infrared excess reveals the presence of circumstellar or circumbinary material in the system. Most multiple systems are likely formed during the protostellar phase, involving flybys of neighboring stars followed by an in-spiraling phase driven by accretion from circumbinary material and leading to compact sub-systems. However, Haro 5-2 stands out among young 2+2 quadruples as the two inner binaries are unusually wide relative to the separation of the A and B pair, allowing future studies of the individual components. Assuming the components are coeval, the system could potentially allow stringent tests of PMS evolutionary models.</description>

      <title>The IACOB project XI. No increase of mass-loss rates over the bi-stability region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of blue supergiants are key for constraining the end of the main sequence (MS) of massive stars. Whether the observed drop in the relative number of fast-rotating stars below $\sim$21$\,$kK is due to enhanced mass-loss rates at the location of the bi-stability jump, or the result of the end of the MS is still debated. Here, we combine newly derived estimates of photospheric and wind parameters with Gaia distances and wind terminal velocities from the literature to obtain upper limits on the mass-loss rates for a sample of 116 Galactic luminous blue supergiants. The parameter space covered by the sample ranges between 35-15$\,$kK in $T_{\rm eff}$ and 4.8-5.8$\,$dex in log(L/L$_{\odot}$). Our results show no increase in the mass-loss rates over the bi-stability jump. Therefore, we argue that the drop in rotational velocities cannot be explained by enhanced mass loss. Since a large jump in the mass-loss rates is commonly included in evolutionary models, we suggest an urgent revision of the currently used default prescriptions.</description>

      <title>Unveiling stellar aurorae: Simulating auroral emission lines in hot stars induced by high-energy irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auroral emission lines result from the interaction between magnetic field and stellar wind, offering valuable insights into physical properties and processes occurring within magnetospheres of celestial bodies. While extensively studied in planetary and exoplanetary atmospheres, in ultra-cool dwarfs, and as radio emission from early-type stars, the presence of specific auroral emission lines in hot star spectra remains unexplored. In this study, we utilized TLUSTY code to simulate the auroral lines, while modelling the effect of the interaction between stellar wind and magnetosphere through X-ray irradiation. Utilizing high-resolution synthetic spectra generated from model atmospheres, we identified potential candidate lines indicative of auroral emission, which were absent in non-irradiated spectra. Emission lines in synthetic spectra were present primarily in the infrared domain. The most prominent line generated by irradiation was He ii 69458 A, which appeared in all our model atmospheres with effective temperatures ranging from 15 kK to 30 kK. We also calculated the minimum irradiation required to detect emission in this most prominent line. The presence of emission lines was interpreted by considering changes in the population of different excited states of given atoms. Besides the appearance of infrared emission lines, high-energy irradiation causes infrared excess. To complement our simulations, we also searched for auroral lines in Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) observations, which are deposited in the Multimission Archive at Space Telescope (MAST) catalogue. The comparison of observed spectra with synthetic spectra did not identify any possible candidate emission lines in FUSE spectra.</description>

Abstract: The dependence of stellar magnetic activity on stellar parameters would be inspired by the chromospheric activity studies based on the large-scale spectroscopic surveys. The Ca II H and K lines are employed to construct indicators for assessing and studying the chromospheric activity of solar-like stars. We investigate the widely used bolometric and photospheric calibrated chromospheric activity index $R'_{\rm HK}$, derived from the method in the classic literature ($R'_{\rm HK,classic}$) and the method based on the PHOENIX model ($R'_{\rm HK,PHOENIX}$). Since the detailed stellar atmospheric parameters, effective temperature ($T_{\rm eff}$), surface gravity ($\log\,g$), and metallic</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Results of the speckle-interferometry observations at the 4.1 m Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope (SOAR) obtained during 2023 are presented: 1913 measurements of 1533 resolved pairs or subsystems (median separation 0.16") and non-resolutions of 552 targets; 42 pairs are resolved here for the first time. This work continues our long-term effort to monitor orbital motion in close binaries and hierarchical systems. A large number (147) of orbits have been determined for the first time or updated using these measurements. Complementarity of this program with the Gaia mission is highlighted.</description>

      <title>A new dimension in the variability of AGB stars: convection patterns size changes with pulsation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar convection plays an important role in atmospheric dynamics, wind formation and the mass-loss processes in Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars. However, a direct characterization of convective surface structures in terms of size, contrast, and life-span is quite challenging. Spatially resolving these features requires the highest angular resolution. In this work, we aim at characterizing the size of convective structures on the surface of the O-rich AGB star R Car to test different theoretical predictions, based on mixing-length theory from solar models. We used infrared low-spectral resolution (R~35) interferometric data in the H-band (~1.76 $\mu$m) with the instrument PIONIER at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) to image the star's surface at two epochs separated by ~6 years. Using a power spectrum analysis, we estimate the horizontal size of the structures on the surface of R Car. The sizes of the stellar disk, at different phases of a pulsation cycle, were obtained using parametric model-fitting in the Fourier domain. Our analysis supports that the sizes of the structures in R Car are correlated with variations of the pressure scale height in the atmosphere of the target, as predicted by theoretical models based on solar convective processes. We observe that these structures grow in size when the star expands within a pulsation cycle. While the information is still scarce, this observational finding highlights the role of convection in the dynamics of those objects. New interferometric imaging campaigns with the renewed capabilities of the VLTI are envisioned to expand our analysis to a larger sample of objects.</description>

      <title>Peering into the Wolf-Rayet phenomenon through [WO] and [WC] stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic observations have shown for decades that the Wolf-Rayet (WR) phenomenon is ubiquitous among stars with different initial masses. Although much effort to understand the winds from massive WR stars has been presented in the literature, not much has been done for such type of stars in the low-mass range. Here we present an attempt to understand the winds from [WR]-type stars using results from spectral analyses with the full non-LTE stellar atmosphere code PoWR. These results are put into context with the properties of massive WR stars. We found that WC+[WC] stars and WO+[WO] stars create independent sequences in the mass-loss rate ($\dot{M}$) and modified wind momentum ($D_\mathrm{mom}$) versus luminosity ($L$) diagrams. Our analysis indicates that even when the winds of WR and [WR] stars become optically thin, there is no breakdown of the general mass-loss trend, contrary to the observed ``weak wind phenomenon'' in OB stars. We report that all WR-type stars studied here broadly define single sequences in the wind efficiency ($\eta$) versus transformed mass-loss rate ($\dot{M}_\mathrm{t}$), the $\dot{M}_\mathrm{t}$-$T_\mathrm{eff}$ diagram, and the $(L, T_\mathrm{eff}, \dot{M})$ space, which suggest these to be fundamental properties of the WR phenomenon (regardless of the mass range), at least for WR-type stars of the O and C sequences. Our analytical estimations could drive computations of future stellar evolution models for WR-type stars.</description>

      <title>BxC Toolkit: Generating Tailored Turbulent 3D Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulent states are ubiquitous in plasmas and the understanding of turbulence is fundamental in modern astrophysics. Numerical simulations, which are the state-of-the-art approach to the study of turbulence, require substantial computing resources. Recently, attention shifted to methods for generating synthetic turbulent magnetic fields, affordably creating fields with parameter-controlled characteristic features of turbulence. In this context, the BxC toolkit was developed and validated against direct numerical simulations (DNS) of isotropic turbulent magnetic fields. Here, we demonstrate novel extensions of BxC to generate realistic turbulent magnetic fields in a fast, controlled, geometric approach. First, we perform a parameter study to determine quantitative relations between the BxC input parameters and desired characteristic features of the turbulent power spectrum, such as the extent of the inertial range, its spectral slope, and the injection and dissipation scale. Second, we introduce in the model a set of structured background magnetic fields B0, as a natural and more realistic extension to the purely isotropic turbulent fields. Third, we extend the model to include anisotropic turbulence properties in the generated fields. With all these extensions combined, our tool can quickly generate any desired structured magnetic field with controlled, anisotropic turbulent fluctuations, faster by orders of magnitude with respect to DNSs. These can be used, e.g., to provide initial conditions for DNS simulations or easily generate synthetic data for many astrophysical settings, all at otherwise unaffordable resolutions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical coupling of Keplerian orbits in a hierarchical four-body system: from the Galactic Centre to compact planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on the long-term evolution of two bodies in nearby initially coplanar orbits around a central dominant body perturbed by a fourth body on a distant Keplerian orbit. Our previous works that considered this setup enforced circular orbits by adding a spherical potential of extended mass, which dampens Kozai--Lidov oscillations; it led to two qualitatively different modes of the evolution of the nearby orbits. In one scenario, their mutual interaction exceeds the effect of differential precession caused by a perturbing body. This results in a long-term coherent evolution, with nearly coplanar orbits experiencing only small oscillations of inclination. We extend the previous work by (i) considering post-Newtonian corrections to the gravity of the central body, either instead of or in addition to the potential of extended mass, (ii) relaxing the requirement of strictly circular orbits, and (iii) removing the strict requirement of complete Kozai--Lidov damping. Thus, we identify the modes of inter-orbital interaction described for the zero-eccentricity case in the more general situation, which allows for its applicability to a much broader range of astrophysical systems than considered initially. In this work, we scale the systems to the orbits of S-stars; we consider the clockwise disc to represent the perturbing body, with post-Newtonian corrections to the gravity of Sagittarius A* playing the role of damping potential. Considering post-Newtonian corrections, even stellar-mass central bodies in compact planetary systems can allow for the coupled evolution of Keplerian orbits.</description>

      <title>A SN Ia Near a Globular Cluster in the Early-Type Galaxy NGC 5353</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: No progenitor of a Type Ia supernova is known, but in old population early-type galaxies, one may find SN Ia associated with globular clusters, yielding a population age and metallicity. It also provides insight into the formation path and the SN enhancement rate in globular clusters. We sought to find such associations and identified SN 2019ein to be within the ground-based optical positional uncertainty of a globular cluster candidate within the early-type galaxy NGC 5353 at about 30 Mpc distance. We reduced the positional uncertainties by obtaining Hubble Space Telescope images with the Advanced Camera for Surveys, using filters F475W and F814W and obtained in June 2020. We find that the globular cluster candidate has a magnitude, color, and angular extent that are consistent with it being a typical globular cluster. The separation between the globular cluster and SN 2019ein is 0.43'', or 59 pc in projection. The chance occurrence with a random globular cluster is about 3%, favoring but not proving an association. If the SN progenitor originated in the globular cluster, one scenario is that SN 2019ein was previously a double degenerate white dwarf binary that was dynamically ejected from the globular cluster and exploded within 10 Myr; models do not predict this to be common. Another, but less likely scenario is where the progenitor remained bound to the globular cluster, allowing the double degenerate binary to inspiral on a much longer timescale before producing a SN.</description>

      <title>Energy dependence of the low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations in Swift J1727.8-1613</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on observations from the Insight-Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT), an analysis of Type-C quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed during the outburst of the new black hole candidate Swift J1727.8-1613 in 2023 was conducted. This analysis scrutinized the QPO's evolution throughout the outburst, particularly noting its rapid frequency escalation during two flare events. Utilizing the energy range covered by Insight-HXMT, a dependency of the QPO frequency on energy was observed. Below approximately 3 Hz, minimal variations in frequency with energy were noted, whereas clear variations with photon energy were observed when it exceeded approximately 3 Hz. Additionally, a sharp drop in the rate of change was observed when the frequency exceeded approximately 8 Hz. This behavior, similar to several previously reported sources, suggests the presence of a common underlying physical mechanism. Moreover, the QPO rms-frequency relationship can be explained by the Lense-Thirring precession model. The relationship between rms-energy and phase lag with frequency suggests the black hole system as a high-inclination source.</description>

      <title>The youngest of hot jupiters in action: episodic accretion outbursts in Gaia20eae</title>

Abstract: Recent imaging observations with ALMA and other telescopes found widespread signatures of planet presence in protoplanetary discs at tens of au separations from their host stars. Here we point out that the presence of very massive planets at 0.1 au sized orbits can be deduced for protostars accreting gas at very high rates, when their discs display powerful Thermal Instability bursts. Earlier work showed that a massive planet modifies the nature of this instability, with outbursts triggered at the outer edge of the deep gap opened by the planet. We present simulations of this effect, finding two types of TI outbursts: downstream and upstream of the planet, which may or may not be causally connected. We apply our model to the outburst in Gaia20eae. We find that the agreement between the data and our disc thermal instability model is improved if there is a planet of 6 Jupiter masses orbiting the star at 0.062 au separation. Gaia20eae thus becomes the second episodically erupting star, after FU Ori, where the presence of a massive planet is strongly suspected. Future observations of similar systems will constrain the mode and the frequency of planet formation in such an early epoch.</description>

      <title>First star formation in extremely early epochs</title>

Abstract: First stars play crucial roles in development of the universe, influencing events like cosmic reionization and the chemical enrichment. While first stars are conventionally thought to form at around $z \sim 20-30$ in the standard $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology, observational constraints on small-scale density fluctuations remain limited, possibly differing significantly from the scale-invariant fluctuations assumed in the $\Lambda$CDM model. Should this be the case, the formation of first stars could occur much earlier than typically predicted. In this study, we investigate the formation process of first stars in the extremely early epochs of $z \gtrsim 100$ in the post-recombination universe. At such early times, the effects of the warm cosmic microwave background (CMB) become significant. We calculate the collapse of primordial star-forming clouds using a one-zone thermo-chemical model that accounts for CMB influences on radiative heating, Compton cooling, and photodissociation reactions. We found that the impact of the CMB on the evolution is limited at $z \lesssim 100$, with the temperature evolution closely resembling the conventional model. However, within the range $100 \lesssim z \lesssim 400$, the formation of H$_2$ via the H$^-$ channel is impeded by H$^-$ photodetachment induced by the CMB, leading to higher temperatures compared to standard one. Consequently, first stars with masses exceeding $1000 ~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ can emerge at $z \gtrsim 100$. Furthermore, at $z \gtrsim 500$, the temperature evolution becomes nearly isothermal solely due to atomic cooling, as H$_2$ formation is entirely suppressed. In such cases, supermassive stars with masses around $\sim 10^5 ~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ are expected to form solely via atomic cooling. These findings emphasize the significant variation in the typical mass of the first stars depending on the epoch of formation.</description>

      <title>Compact Binary Formation in Open Star Clusters II: Difficulty of Gaia NS formation in low-mass star clusters</title>

Abstract: Gaia mission offers opportunities to search for compact binaries not involved in binary interactions (hereafter inert compact binaries), and results in the discoveries of binaries containing one black hole (BH) or one neutron star (NS), called "Gaia BHs" and "Gaia NSs", respectively. We have assessed if Gaia BHs and NSs can be formed in open clusters through dynamical interactions. In order to obtain a large number of inert compact binaries similar to Gaia BHs and NSs, we have performed gravitational $N$-body simulations for a large number of open clusters whose total mass is $1.2 \times 10^8 M_\odot$. These clusters have various masses, metallicities, densities, and binary fractions. We have found that open clusters form Gaia BHs ($10^{-6}$-$10^{-5} M_\odot^{-1}$) much more efficiently than Gaia NSs ($\lesssim 10^{-7} M_\odot^{-1}$) for any cluster parameters. This is quite inconsistent with observational results, because the reported numbers of Gaia BHs and NSs are $3$ and $21$, respectively. Additionally, we have switched off NS natal kicks for $10^4$ open clusters each weighing $10^3 M_\odot$ in order to retain a large number of NSs in open clusters. Then, open clusters form inert NS binaries originating from primordial binaries rather than formed through dynamical interactions. This means that Gaia NSs are formed dominantly on isolated fields, not in open clusters, if there is no NS natal kick. We have concluded that Gaia BHs can be dominantly formed in open clusters, however Gaia NSs cannot.</description>

      <title>Rapidly rotating Population III stellar models as a source of primary nitrogen</title>

Abstract: The first stars might have been fast rotators. This would have important consequences for their radiative, mechanical and chemical feedback. We discuss the impact of fast initial rotation on the evolution of massive Population III models and on their nitrogen and oxygen stellar yields. We explore the evolution of Population III stars with initial masses in the range of 9Msol &lt; Mini &lt; 120Msol starting with an initial rotation on the Zero Age Main Sequence equal to 70% of the critical one. We find that with the physics of rotation considered here, our rapidly-rotating Population III stellar models do not follow a homogeneous evolution. They lose very little mass in case mechanical winds are switched on when the surface rotation becomes equal or larger than the critical velocity. Impact on the ionising flux appears modest when compared to moderately-rotating models. Fast rotation favours, in models with initial masses above ~20Msol, the appearance of a very extended intermediate convective zone around the H-burning shell during the core He-burning phase. This shell has important consequences on the sizes of the He- and CO-cores and thus impacts the final fate of stars. Moreover, it has a strong impact on nucleosynthesis boosting the production of primary 14N. Fast initial rotation impacts significantly the chemical feedback of Population III stars. Observations of extremely metal-poor stars and/or starbursting regions are essential to provide constraints on the properties of the first stars.</description>
