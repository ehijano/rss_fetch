      <title>Evolution of Functionals Under Extended Ricci Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the evolution of certain functionals involving higher powers of a scalar quantity $F$ under Bernard List's extended Ricci flow on a compact Riemannian manifold. By deriving explicit expressions for the time derivative of integrals of the form $\int_M F^n \cdot \frac{\partial F}{\partial t} \, d\mu$ for various powers $n$, we explore the intricate interplay between geometric quantities and scalar functions without making any assumptions about the manifold, the scalar field $\Phi$, or the function $u$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in finding the existence and uniqueness of the local, local maximal, and global solutions of the equation projected on the Hilbert manifold. Furthermore, we will show that for any given initial data in the Hilbert manifold $\mathcal{M}$, the solution to this equation is also in the Hilbert manifold $\mathcal{M}$.

      <title>A note on Ricci-flat manifolds, parallel spinors and the Rosenberg index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any closed connected Riemannian spin manifold of non-zero $\hat{A}$-genus or non-zero Hitchin invariant with non-negative scalar curvature admits a parallel spinor, in particular is Ricci-flat. In this note, we generalize this result to closed connected spin manifolds of non-vanishing Rosenberg index. This provides a criterion for the existence of a parallel spinor on a finite covering and yields that any closed connected Ricci-flat spin manifold of dimension $\geq 2$ with non-vanishing Rosenberg index has special holonomy.</description>

      <title>Manifold Diffusion Geometry: Curvature, Tangent Spaces, and Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce novel estimators for computing the curvature, tangent spaces, and dimension of data from manifolds, using tools from diffusion geometry. Although classical Riemannian geometry is a rich source of inspiration for geometric data analysis and machine learning, it has historically been hard to implement these methods in a way that performs well statistically. Diffusion geometry lets us develop Riemannian geometry methods that are accurate and, crucially, also extremely robust to noise and low-density data. The methods we introduce here are comparable to the existing state-of-the-art on ideal dense, noise-free data, but significantly outperform them in the presence of noise or sparsity. In particular, our dimension estimate improves on the existing methods on a challenging benchmark test when even a small amount of noise is added. Our tangent space and scalar curvature estimates do not require parameter selection and substantially improve on existing techniques.</description>

      <title>Curve shortening flow with an ambient force field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the anisotropic curve shortening flow in the plane in the presence of an ambient force. We consider force fields in which all their derivatives are bounded in the $L^{\infty}$ sense. We prove that closed embedded curves that have a minimum of curvature sufficiently large shrink to round points. The method of proof follows along the same lines of Gage and Hamilton, in that we study a rescaling to prove curvature bounds. We additionally show that the influence of an ambient force field may make such a result untrue, by giving sufficient conditions on the ambient field that ensures eventual non-convexity of an initially convex curve evolving under the flow.</description>

      <title>The M-algebra completes the hierarchy of Super-Exceptional Tangent Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conjectured symmetries of M-theory famously involve (1.) brane-extended super-symmetry (the M-algebra) and (2.) exceptional duality-symmetry (the $\mathfrak{e}_{11}$-algebra); but little attention has been given to their inevitable combination.
  In this little note, we highlight (by combining results available in the literature) that the $local$ exceptional duality-symmetry (the hyperbolic involutary $\mathfrak{k}_{1,10} \subset \mathfrak{e}_{11}$) acts on the M-algebra, through the "brane-rotating symmetry" $\mathfrak{sl}_{32}$, in a way which extends the known hierarchy of finite-dimensional $n$-exceptional tangent spaces compatibly beyond the traditional bound of $n \leq 7$ all the way to $n = 11$.</description>

      <title>Probability Versions of Li-Yau Type Inequalities and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By using stochastic analysis, two probability versions of Li-Yau type inequalities are established for diffusion semigroups on a manifold possibly with (non-convex) boundary. The inequalities are explicitly given by the Bakry-Emery curvature-dimension, as well as the lower bound of the second fundamental form if the boundary exists. As applications, a number of global and local estimates are presented, which extend or improve existing ones derived for manifolds without boundary. Compared with the maximum principle technique developed in the literature, the probabilistic argument we used is more straightforward and hence considerably simpler.</description>

      <title>Log Baum--Bott Residues for foliations by curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a Baum-Bott type residual formula for one-dimensional holomorphic foliations, with isolated singularities, and logarithmic along free divisors. More precisely, this provides a Baum--Bott theorem for a foliated triple $(X,\mathscr{F}, D)$, where $ \mathscr{F}$ is a foliation by curves and $D $ is a free divisor on a complex manifold $X$. From the local point of view, we show that the log Baum--Bott residues are a generalization of the Aleksandrov logarithmic index for vector fields with isolated singularities on hypersurfaces. We also show how these new indices are related to Poincar\'e's Problem for foliations by curves. In the case of foliated surfaces, we show that the differences between the logarithmic residues and Baum--Bott indices along invariant curves can be expressed in terms of the GSV and Camacho--Sad indices. We also obtain a Baum--Bott type formula for singular varieties via log resolutions. Finally, we prove a weak global version of the Lipman--Zariski conjecture for compact algebraic surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15147v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to T-duality based on Courant algebroid relations which subsumes the usual T-duality as well as its various generalisations. Starting from a relational description for the reduction of exact Courant algebroids over foliated manifolds, we introduce a weakened notion of generalised isometries that captures the generalised geometry counterpart of Riemannian submersions when applied to transverse generalised metrics. This is used to construct T-dual backgrounds as generalised metrics on reduced Courant algebroids which are related by a generalised isometry. We prove an existence and uniqueness result for generalised isometric exact Courant algebroids coming from reductions. We demonstrate that our construction reproduces standard T-duality relations based on correspondence spaces. We also describe how it applies to generalised T-duality transformations of almost para-Hermitian manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study left-invariant pseudo-Riemannian metrics on Lie groups using the bracket flow of the corresponding Lie algebra. We focus on metrics where the Lie algebra is in the null cone of the $G=O(p,q)$-action; i.e., Lie algebras $\mu$ where zero is in the closure of the orbits: $0\in\overline{G\cdot \mu}$. We provide examples of such Lie groups in various signatures and give some general results. For signatures $(1,q)$ and $(2,q)$ we classify all cases belonging to the null cone. More generally, we show that all nilpotent and completely solvable Lie algebras are in the null cone of some $O(p,q)$ action. In addition, several examples of non-trivial Levi-decomposable Lie algebras in the null cone are given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper first investigates solvability of Hermitian-Einstein equation on a Hermitian holomorphic vector bundle on the complement of an arbitrary closed subset in a compact Hermitian manifold. The uniqueness of Hermitian-Einstein metrics on a Zariski open subset in a compact K\"{a}hler manifold was only figured out by Takuro Mochizuki recently, for this model the second part of this paper gives an affirmative answer to a question proposed by Takuro Mochizuki and it leads to an alternative approach to the unique issue. We also prove stability from solvability of Hermitian-Einstein equation, which together with the classical existence result of Carlos Simpson in particular establish a Kobayashi-Hitchin bijective correspondence. The argument is also effective in more general settings, including basic models of Takuro Mochizuki, as well as non-K\"{a}hler and semi-stable contexts.</description>

      <title>Connected Components on Lie Groups and Applications to Multi-Orientation Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop and analyze a new algorithm to find the connected components of a compact set $I$ from a Lie group $G$ endowed with a left-invariant Riemannian distance. For a given $\delta&gt;0$, the algorithm finds the largest cover of $I$ such that all sets in the cover are separated by at least distance $\delta$. We call the sets in the cover the $\delta$-connected components of I. The grouping relies on an iterative procedure involving morphological dilations with Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman kernels on $G$ and notions of $\delta$-thickened sets. We prove that the algorithm converges in finitely many iteration steps, and we propose a strategy to find an optimal value for $\delta$ based on persistence homology arguments. We also introduce the concept of affinity matrices. This allows for grouping of $\delta$-connected components based on their local proximity and alignment.
  Among the many different applications of the algorithm, in this article, we focus on illustrating that the method can efficiently identify (possibly overlapping) branches in complex vascular trees on retinal images. This is done by applying an orientation score transform to the images that allows us to view them as functions from $\mathbb{L}_2(G)$ where $G=SE(2)$, the Lie group of roto-translations. By applying our algorithm in this Lie group, we illustrate that we obtain $\delta$-connected components that differentiate between crossing structures and that group well-aligned, nearby structures. This contrasts standard connected component algorithms in $\mathbb{R}^2$.</description>

      <title>Good Basic Invariants and Frobenius Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.01871v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we define a set of good basic invariants for a finite complex reflection group under certain conditions. We show that a set of good basic invariants for a finite real reflection group gives a set of the flat invariants obtained by Saito and the Taylor coefficients of these good basic invariants give the structure constants of the multiplication of the Frobenius structure obtained by Dubrovin.</description>

      <title>Good Basic Invariants for Elliptic Weyl Groups and Frobenius Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.03587v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we define a set of good basic invariants for the elliptic Weyl group for the elliptic root system. For an elliptic root system of codimension $1$, we show that a set of good basic invariants gives a set of flat invariants obtained by Saito and Taylor coefficients of the good basic invariants give the structure constants of the multiplication of the Frobenius structure obtained by the author.</description>

      <title>On the ergodicity of the frame flow on even-dimensional manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.14811v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that the frame flow on a closed $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with negative sectional curvature is ergodic if $n$ is odd and $n \neq 7$. In this paper we study its ergodicity in the remaining cases. For $n$ even and $n \neq 8, 134$, we show that: if $n \equiv 2$ mod $4$ or $n=4$, the frame flow is ergodic if the manifold is $\sim 0.3$-pinched, if $n \equiv 0$ mod $4$, it is ergodic if the manifold is $\sim 0.6$-pinched. In the three dimensions $n=7,8,134$, the respective pinching bounds that we need in order to prove ergodicity are $0.4962...$, $0.6212...$, and $0.5788...$. This is a significant improvement over the previously known results and a step forward towards solving a long-standing conjecture of Brin asserting that $0.25$-pinched even-dimensional manifolds have an ergodic frame flow.</description>

      <title>Deformations of Calabi-Yau varieties with isolated log canonical singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03755v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in the deformation theory of Calabi-Yau varieties $Y$ with canonical singularities has highlighted the key role played by the higher Du Bois and higher rational singularities, and especially by the so-called $k$-liminal singularities for $k\ge 1$. The goal of this paper is to show that certain aspects of this study extend naturally to the $0$-liminal case as well, i.e. to Calabi-Yau varieties $Y$ with Gorenstein log canonical, but not canonical, singularities. In particular, we show the existence of first order smoothings of $Y$ in the case of isolated $0$-liminal hypersurface singularities, and extend Namikawa's unobstructedness theorem for deformations of singular Calabi-Yau threefolds $Y$ with canonical singularities to the case where $Y$ has an isolated $0$-liminal lci singularity under suitable hypotheses. Finally, we describe an interesting series of examples.</description>

      <title>De Rham $L^p$-Cohomology For Higher Rank Spaces And Groups: Critical Exponents And Rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the investigation of critical exponents (in degree equal to the rank) for the vanishing of L^p-cohomology of higher rank Lie groups and related manifolds. We deal with the rank 2 case and exhibit such phenomena for SL$_3$(R) and for a family of 5-dimensional solvable Lie groups. This leads us to exhibit a continuum of quasi-isometry classes of rank 2 solvable Lie groups of non-positive curvature. We provide a detailed description of the $L^p$-cohomology of the real and complex hyperbolic spaces, to be combined with a spectral sequence argument for our higher-rank results.</description>

      <title>Cartan moving frames and the data manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to employ the language of Cartan moving frames to study the geometry of the data manifolds and its Riemannian structure, via the data information metric and its curvature at data points. Using this framework and through experiments, explanations on the response of a neural network are given by pointing out the output classes that are easily reachable from a given input. This emphasizes how the proposed mathematical relationship between the output of the network and the geometry of its inputs can be exploited as an explainable artificial intelligence tool.</description>

      <title>Coronas and Callias type operators in coarse geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We interpret the coarse symbol and index class of a Callias type Dirac operator $D+\Psi$ on a manifold $M$ as a pairing between the coarse symbol and index classes associated to $D$ and K-theory classes of the coarse corona of $M$ or $M$ itself determined by $\Psi$. Local positivity of $D$ and local invertibility of $\Psi$ are incorporated in terms of support conditions on the $K$-theoretic level.</description>
