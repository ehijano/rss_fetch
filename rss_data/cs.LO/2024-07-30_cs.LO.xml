      <title>A Construction of the Lie Algebra of a Lie Group in Isabelle/HOL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes a formal theory of smooth vector fields, Lie groups and the Lie algebra of a Lie group in the theorem prover Isabelle. Lie groups are abstract structures that are composable, invertible and differentiable. They are pervasive as models of continuous transformations and symmetries in areas from theoretical particle physics, where they underpin gauge theories such as the Standard Model, to the study of differential equations and robotics. Formalisation of mathematics in an interactive theorem prover, such as Isabelle, provides strong correctness guarantees by expressing definitions and theorems in a logic that can be checked by a computer. Many libraries of formalised mathematics lack significant development of textbook material beyond undergraduate level, and this contribution to mathematics in Isabelle aims to reduce that gap, particularly in differential geometry. We comment on representational choices and challenges faced when integrating complex formalisations, such as smoothness of vector fields, with the restrictions of the simple type theory of HOL. This contribution paves the way for extensions both in advanced mathematics, and in formalisations in natural science.</description>

      <title>Efficient Shield Synthesis via State-Space Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of synthesizing safety strategies for control systems, also known as shields. Since the state space is infinite, shields are typically computed over a finite-state abstraction, with the most common abstraction being a rectangular grid. However, for many systems, such a grid does not align well with the safety property or the system dynamics. That is why a coarse grid is rarely sufficient, but a fine grid is typically computationally infeasible to obtain. In this paper, we show that appropriate state-space transformations can still allow to use a coarse grid at almost no computational overhead. We demonstrate in three case studies that our transformation-based synthesis outperforms a standard synthesis by several orders of magnitude. In the first two case studies, we use domain knowledge to select a suitable transformation. In the third case study, we instead report on results in engineering a transformation without domain knowledge.</description>

      <title>Query maintenance under batch changes with small-depth circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Which dynamic queries can be maintained efficiently? For constant-size changes, it is known that constant-depth circuits or, equivalently, first-order updates suffice for maintaining many important queries, among them reachability, tree isomorphism, and the word problem for context-free languages. In other words, these queries are in the dynamic complexity class DynFO. We show that most of the existing results for constant-size changes can be recovered for batch changes of polylogarithmic size if one allows circuits of depth O(log log n) or, equivalently, first-order updates that are iterated O(log log n) times.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Processes with Expected Stopping Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.07278v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Markov chains are the de facto finite-state model for stochastic dynamical systems, and Markov decision processes (MDPs) extend Markov chains by incorporating non-deterministic behaviors. Given an MDP and rewards on states, a classical optimization criterion is the maximal expected total reward where the MDP stops after T steps, which can be computed by a simple dynamic programming algorithm. We consider a natural generalization of the problem where the stopping times can be chosen according to a probability distribution, such that the expected stopping time is T, to optimize the expected total reward. Quite surprisingly we establish inter-reducibility of the expected stopping-time problem for Markov chains with the Positivity problem (which is related to the well-known Skolem problem), for which establishing either decidability or undecidability would be a major breakthrough. Given the hardness of the exact problem, we consider the approximate version of the problem: we show that it can be solved in exponential time for Markov chains and in exponential space for MDPs.</description>

      <title>History-deterministic Timed Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03183v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the notion of history-determinism in the context of timed automata (TA) over infinite timed words. History-deterministic (HD) automata are those in which nondeterminism can be resolved on the fly, based on the run constructed thus far. History-determinism is a robust property that admits different game-based characterisations, and HD specifications allow for game-based verification without an expensive determinization step.
  We show that the class of timed $\omega$-languages recognized by HD timed automata strictly extends that of deterministic ones, and is strictly included in those recognised by fully non-deterministic TA.
  For non-deterministic timed automata it is known that universality is already undecidable for safety/reachability TA. For history-deterministic TA with arbitrary parity acceptance, we show that timed universality, inclusion, and synthesis all remain decidable and are EXPTIME-complete.
  For the subclass of TA with safety or reachability acceptance, one can decide (in EXPTIME) whether such an automaton is history-deterministic. If so, it can effectively determinized without introducing new automaton states.</description>

      <title>Unique Characterisability and Learnability of Temporal Queries Mediated by an Ontology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithms for learning database queries from examples and unique characterisations of queries by examples are prominent starting points for developing automated support for query construction and explanation. We investigate how far recent results and techniques on learning and unique characterisations of atemporal queries mediated by an ontology can be extended to temporal data and queries. Based on a systematic review of the relevant approaches in the atemporal case, we obtain general transfer results identifying conditions under which temporal queries composed of atemporal ones are (polynomially) learnable and uniquely characterisable.</description>

      <title>Regular Games with Imperfect Information Are Not That Regular</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two-player games with imperfect information and the synthesis of a randomized strategy for one player that ensures the objective is satisfied almost-surely (i.e., with probability 1), regardless of the strategy of the other player. Imperfect information is modeled by an indistinguishability relation describing the pairs of histories that the first player cannot distinguish, a generalization of the traditional model with partial observations. The game is regular if it admits a regular function whose kernel commutes with the indistinguishability relation.
  The synthesis of pure strategies that ensure all possible outcomes satisfy the objective is possible in regular games, by a generic reduction that holds for all objectives. While the solution for pure strategies extends to randomized strategies in the traditional model with partial observations (which is always regular), we show that a similar reduction does not exist in the more general model. Despite that, we show that in regular games with Buechi objectives the synthesis problem is decidable for randomized strategies that ensure the outcome satisfies the objective almost-surely.</description>
