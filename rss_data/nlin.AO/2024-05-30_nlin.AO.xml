      <title>Periodic forces combined with feedback induce quenching in a bistable oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coexistence of an abnormal rhythm and a normal steady state is often observed in nature (e.g., epilepsy). Such a system is modeled as a bistable oscillator that possesses both a limit cycle and a fixed point. Although bistable oscillators under several perturbations have been addressed in the literature, the mechanism of oscillation quenching, a transition from a limit cycle to a fixed point, has not been fully understood. In this study, we analyze quenching using the extended Stuart-Landau oscillator driven by periodic forces. Numerical simulations suggest that the entrainment to the periodic force induces the amplitude change of a limit cycle. By reducing the system with an averaging method, we investigate the bifurcation structures of the periodically-driven oscillator. We find that oscillation quenching occurs by the homoclinic bifurcation when we use a periodic force combined with quadratic feedback. In conclusion, we develop a state-transition method in a bistable oscillator using periodic forces, which would have the potential for practical applications in controlling and annihilating abnormal oscillations. Moreover, we clarify the rich and diverse bifurcation structures behind periodically-driven bistable oscillators, which we believe would contribute to further understanding the complex behaviors in non-autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Eco-evolutionary dynamics of cooperative antimicrobial resistance in a population of fluctuating volume and size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance to drugs (AMR), a global threat to human and animal health, is often regarded as resulting from a cooperative behaviour. Moreover, microbes generally evolve in volatile environments that, together with demographic fluctuations (birth and death events), drastically alter population size and strain survival. Motivated by the need to better understand the evolution of AMR, we study a population of time-varying size consisting of two competing strains, one drug-resistant and one drug-sensitive, subject to demographic and environmental variability. This is modelled by a binary carrying capacity randomly switching between mild and harsh environmental conditions, and driving the fluctuating volume (total amount of nutrients and antimicrobials at fixed concentration), and thus the size of the community (number of resistant and sensitive cells). We assume that AMR is a shared public good when the concentration of resistant cells exceeds a fixed concentration cooperation threshold, above which the sensitive strain has a growth advantage, whereas resistant cells dominate below it. Using computational means, and devising an analytical treatment (built on suitable quenched and annealed averaging procedures), we fully characterise the influence of fluctuations on the eco-evolutionary dynamics of AMR, and notably obtain specific strain fixation and long-lasting coexistence probabilities as a function of the environmental variation rate and cooperation threshold. We find that microbial strains tend to coexistence, but demographic fluctuations eventually lead to the extinction of resistant or sensitive cells for small or large values of the concentration cooperation threshold, respectively. This also holds for dynamic environments, whose specific properties determine the extinction timescale.</description>
