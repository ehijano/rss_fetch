      <title>XEmoGPT: An Explainable Multimodal Emotion Recognition Framework with Cue-Level Perception and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable Multimodal Emotion Recognition plays a crucial role in applications such as human-computer interaction and social media analytics. However, current approaches struggle with cue-level perception and reasoning due to two main challenges: 1) general-purpose modality encoders are pretrained to capture global structures and general semantics rather than fine-grained emotional cues, resulting in limited sensitivity to emotional signals; and 2) available datasets usually involve a trade-off between annotation quality and scale, which leads to insufficient supervision for emotional cues and ultimately limits cue-level reasoning. Moreover, existing evaluation metrics are inadequate for assessing cue-level reasoning performance. To address these challenges, we propose eXplainable Emotion GPT (XEmoGPT), a novel EMER framework capable of both perceiving and reasoning over emotional cues. It incorporates two specialized modules: the Video Emotional Cue Bridge (VECB) and the Audio Emotional Cue Bridge (AECB), which enhance the video and audio encoders through carefully designed tasks for fine-grained emotional cue perception. To further support cue-level reasoning, we construct a large-scale dataset, EmoCue, designed to teach XEmoGPT how to reason over multimodal emotional cues. In addition, we introduce EmoCue-360, an automated metric that extracts and matches emotional cues using semantic similarity, and release EmoCue-Eval, a benchmark of 400 expert-annotated samples covering diverse emotional scenarios. Experimental results show that XEmoGPT achieves strong performance in both emotional cue perception and reasoning.</description>

      <title>DCER: Dual-Stage Compression and Energy-Based Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal fusion faces two robustness challenges: noisy inputs degrade representation quality, and missing modalities cause prediction failures. We propose DCER, a
  unified framework addressing both challenges through dual-stage compression and energy-based reconstruction. The compression stage operates at two levels:
  within-modality frequency transforms (wavelet for audio, DCT for video) remove noise while preserving task-relevant patterns, and cross-modality bottleneck tokens
  force genuine integration rather than modality-specific shortcuts. For missing modalities, energy-based reconstruction recovers representations via gradient descent
  on a learned energy function, with the final energy providing intrinsic uncertainty quantification (\r{ho} &gt; 0.72 correlation with prediction error). Experiments on
  CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all benchmarks, with a U-shaped robustness pattern favoring multimodal fusion at
  both complete and high-missing conditions. The code will be available on Github.</description>

      <title>Food Portion Estimation: From Pixels to Calories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliance on images for dietary assessment is an important strategy to accurately and conveniently monitor an individual's health, making it a vital mechanism in the prevention and care of chronic diseases and obesity. However, image-based dietary assessment suffers from estimating the three dimensional size of food from 2D image inputs. Many strategies have been devised to overcome this critical limitation such as the use of auxiliary inputs like depth maps, multi-view inputs, or model-based approaches such as template matching. Deep learning also helps bridge the gap by either using monocular images or combinations of the image and the auxillary inputs to precisely predict the output portion from the image input. In this paper, we explore the different strategies employed for accurate portion estimation.</description>

      <title>Video Soundtrack Generation by Aligning Emotions and Temporal Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10154v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Providing soundtracks for videos remains a costly and time-consuming challenge for multimedia content creators. We introduce EMSYNC, an automatic video-based symbolic music generator that creates music aligned with a video's emotional content and temporal boundaries. It follows a two-stage framework, where a pretrained video emotion classifier extracts emotional features, and a conditional music generator produces MIDI sequences guided by both emotional and temporal cues. We introduce boundary offsets, a novel temporal conditioning mechanism that enables the model to anticipate upcoming video scene cuts and align generated musical chords with them. We also propose a mapping scheme that bridges the discrete categorical outputs of the video emotion classifier with the continuous valence-arousal inputs required by the emotion-conditioned MIDI generator, enabling seamless integration of emotion information across different representations. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in objective and subjective evaluations across different video datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating music aligned to video both emotionally and temporally. Our demo and output samples are available at https://serkansulun.com/emsync.</description>

      <title>Sounding Highlights: Dual-Pathway Audio Encoders for Audio-Visual Video Highlight Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio-visual video highlight detection aims to automatically identify the most salient moments in videos by leveraging both visual and auditory cues. However, existing models often underutilize the audio modality, focusing on high-level semantic features while failing to fully leverage the rich, dynamic characteristics of sound. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, Dual-Pathway Audio Encoders for Video Highlight Detection (DAViHD). The dual-pathway audio encoder is composed of a semantic pathway for content understanding and a dynamic pathway that captures spectro-temporal dynamics. The semantic pathway extracts high-level information by identifying the content within the audio, such as speech, music, or specific sound events. The dynamic pathway employs a frequency-adaptive mechanism as time evolves to jointly model these dynamics, enabling it to identify transient acoustic events via salient spectral bands and rapid energy changes. We integrate the novel audio encoder into a full audio-visual framework and achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale MrHiSum benchmark. Our results demonstrate that a sophisticated, dual-faceted audio representation is key to advancing the field of highlight detection.</description>

      <title>Training Data Efficiency in Multimodal Process Reward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Process Reward Models (MPRMs) are central to step-level supervision for visual reasoning in MLLMs. Training MPRMs typically requires large-scale Monte Carlo (MC)-annotated corpora, incurring substantial training cost. This paper studies the data efficiency for MPRM training. Our preliminary experiments reveal that MPRM training quickly saturates under random subsampling of the training data, indicating substantial redundancy within existing MC-annotated corpora. To explain this, we formalize a theoretical framework and reveal that informative gradient updates depend on two factors: label mixtures of positive/negative steps and label reliability (average MC scores of positive steps). Guided by these insights, we propose the Balanced-Information Score (BIS), which prioritizes both mixture and reliability based on existing MC signals at the rollout level, without incurring any additional cost. Across two backbones (InternVL2.5-8B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B) on VisualProcessBench, BIS-selected subsets consistently match and even surpass the full-data performance at small fractions. Notably, the BIS subset reaches full-data performance using only 10% of the training data, improving over random subsampling by a relative 4.1%.</description>
