      <title>Non-stationary dynamics of interspike intervals in neuronal populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the joint dynamics of membrane potential and time since the last spike in a population of integrate-and-fire neurons using a population density framework. This leads to a two-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation that captures the evolution of the full neuronal state, along with a one-dimensional hierarchy of equations for the moments of the inter-spike interval (ISI). The formalism allows us to characterize the time-dependent ISI distribution, even when the population is far from stationarity, such as under time-varying external input or during network oscillations. By performing a perturbative expansion around the stationary state, we also derive an analytic expression for the linear response of the ISI distribution to weak input modulations.</description>

      <title>The disordered Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum topology categorizes physical systems in integer invariants, which are robust to some deformations and certain types of disorder. A prime example is the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, which has two distinct topological phases, the trivial phase with no edge states and the non-trivial phase with zero-energy edge states. The energy dispersion of the SSH model is dominated by a gap around zero energy, which suppresses the transmission. This exponential suppression of the transmission with system length is determined by the Lyapounov exponent. Here we find an analytical expression of the Lyapounov as a function of energy in the presence of both diagonal and off-diagonal disorder. We obtain this result by finding a recurrence relation for the local density, which can be averaged over different disorder configurations. There is excellent agreement between our analytical expression and the numerical results over a wide range of disorder strengths and disorder types. The real space winding number is evaluated as a function of off-diagonal and on-site disorder for possible applications of quantum topology.</description>

      <title>Novel exact solutions of the Duffing equation: stability analysis and application to real non-linear deformation tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, novel exact solutions of the Duffing equation with their phase portraits have been proposed and reasoned. It is shown that phase trajectories are initially elliptical and become distorted in the unstable area within the growth of the variable parameter. Instability criteria of identified solutions have been determined together with the Fourier series transformation up to the first and high harmonics in a sense of the physical interpretation. An explicit form for the differential operator, corresponding to considered functions, has been derived with evaluation of its main functional spectrum. Non-isothermal creep tests of different materials were completely described using the Duffing equation via noted solutions up to the fracture as processes with personal deformation response. We successfully examined a relationship between the thermal and magnetic properties of the ferromagnetic amorphous alloy under its non-linear deformation, using the critical exponents. With a high linear correlation between our model and experiments, behaviour of organic and metallic systems is well predicted at the same thermo-mechanical testing conditions on the mesoscale.</description>

      <title>Graphicality of power-law and double power-law degree sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The graphicality problem -- whether or not a sequence of integers can be used to create a simple graph -- is a key question in network theory and combinatorics, with many important practical applications. In this work, we study the graphicality of degree sequences distributed as a power-law with a size-dependent cutoff and as a double power-law with a size-dependent crossover. We combine the application of exact sufficient conditions for graphicality with heuristic conditions for nongraphicality which allow us to elucidate the physical reasons why some sequences are not graphical. For single power-laws we recover the known phase-diagram, we highlight the subtle interplay of distinct mechanisms violating graphicality and we explain why the infinite-size limit behavior is in some cases very far from being observed for finite sequences. For double power-laws we derive the graphicality of infinite sequences for all possible values of the degree exponents $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$, uncovering a rich phase-diagram and pointing out the existence of five qualitatively distinct ways graphicality can be violated. The validity of theoretical arguments is supported by extensive numerical analysis.</description>

      <title>Diffusive metal in a percolating Chern insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional non-interacting fermions without any anti-unitary symmetries generically get Anderson localized in the presence of disorder. In contrast, topological superconductors with their inherent particle-hole symmetry can host a thermal metallic phase, which is non-universal and depends on the nature of microscopic disorder. In this work, we demonstrate that in the presence of geometric disorders, such as random bond dilution, a robust metal can emerge in a Chern insulator with particle-hole symmetry. The metallic phase is realized when the broken links are weakly stitched via concomitant insertion of $\pi$ fluxes in the plaquettes. These nucleate low-energy manifolds, which can provide percolating conduction pathways for fermions to elude localization. This diffusive metal, unlike those in superconductors, can carry charge current and even anomalous Hall current. We investigate the transport properties and show that while the topological insulator to Anderson insulator transition exhibits the expected Dirac universality, the metal insulator transition displays a different critical exponent $\nu \approx 2$ compared to a disordered topological superconductor, where $\nu \approx 1.4$. Our work emphasizes the unique role of geometric disorder in engineering novel phases and their transitions in topological quantum matter.</description>

      <title>The effect of HVDC lines in power-grids via Kuramoto modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical study on the synchronization and cascade failure behaviour by solving the adaptive second-order Kuramoto model on a large high voltage (HV) European power-grid. This non-perturbative analysis takes into account non-linear effects, which occur even when phase differences are large, when the system is away from the steady state, and even during a blackout cascade. Our dynamical simulations show that improvements in the phase synchronziation stabilization as well as the in the cascade sizes can be related to the finite size scaling behaviour of the second order Kuramoto on graphs with $d_s&lt;4$ spectral dimensions. On the other hand drawbacks in the frequency spread and Braess effects also occur by varying the total transmitted power at large and small global couplings, presumably when the fluctuations are small, causing a freezing in the dynamics. We compare simulations of the fully AC model with those of static or adaptive High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) line replacements. The adaptive (local frequency difference-based) HVDC lines are more efficient in the steady state, at the expense of very long relaxation times.</description>

      <title>High bosonic Bott index and transport of multi-band topological magnons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnons are bosonic quasiparticles in magnetically ordered systems. Bosonic Bott index has been affirmed as a real-space topological invariant for a two-band ferromagnetic model. In this work,we theoretically investigate the topology and transport of magnons in a multi-band bosonic Kagome ferromagnetic model. We demonstrate the validity of the bosonic Bott indices of values larger than 1 in multi-band magnonic systems by showing the agreement with Chern numbers in the clean limit and the bulk-boundary correspondence during the topological phase transition. For the high Bott index phase, the disorder-induced topological phase transition occurs in a multi-step manner. Using a generalized Landauer-Buttiker formalism, we reveal how the magnon transport depends on Gilbert damping and disorder under coherent excitation or temperature difference. The results further justify the bosonic Bott index as a robust real-space topological invariant for multi-band magnonic systems and provide insights into the transport of topological magnons.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Computers for Neural Quantum States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states efficiently represent many-body wavefunctions with neural networks, but the cost of Monte Carlo sampling limits their scaling to large system sizes. Here we address this challenge by combining sparse Boltzmann machine architectures with probabilistic computing hardware. We implement a probabilistic computer on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and use it as a fast sampler for energy-based neural quantum states. For the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model at criticality, we obtain accurate ground-state energies for lattices up to 80 $\times$ 80 (6400 spins) using a custom multi-FPGA cluster. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-sampling algorithm to train deep Boltzmann machines, replacing intractable marginalization with conditional sampling over auxiliary layers. This enables the training of sparse deep models and improves parameter efficiency relative to shallow networks. Using this algorithm, we train deep Boltzmann machines for a system with 35 $\times$ 35 (1225 spins). Together, these results demonstrate that probabilistic hardware can overcome the sampling bottleneck in variational simulation of quantum many-body systems, opening a path to larger system sizes and deeper variational architectures.</description>

      <title>Regularized universal topological local markers for Dirac systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local markers provide an efficient and powerful characterization of topological features of many systems, especially when the translation symmetry is broken. Recently, a universal topological local marker applicable in different symmetry classes of topological systems is proposed. However, it suffers from irregular behaviors at the boundary and its connection to other topological indexes remains elusive. In this work, we construct regularized universal topological local markers that apply to Dirac systems by utilizing position operators that are compatible with periodic boundary conditions. The regularized local markers eliminate the obstructive boundary irregularities successfully, and give rise to the desired global topological invariants such as the Chern number consistently when integrated over all the lattice sites. Furthermore, the regularized form allows us to establish an explicit connection between the local markers and some other known topological indices in two dimensions. For instance, it turns out to be equivalent to the Bott index in classes A, D, and C, and equivalent to the spin Chern number in classes DIII and AII. We further examine the utility and stability of this new marker in disordered scenarios. We find that its variance shows peaks at the phase boundaries, which promotes it as a useful indicator for detecting disorder-induced topological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Learning in Deep Asymmetric Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate recurrent neural networks with asymmetric interactions and demonstrate that the inclusion of self-couplings or sparse excitatory inter-module connections leads to the emergence of a densely connected manifold of dynamically accessible stable configurations. This representation manifold is exponentially large in system size and is reachable through simple local dynamics, despite constituting a subdominant subset of the global configuration space. We further show that learning can be implemented directly on this structure via a fully local, gradient-free mechanism that selectively stabilizes a single task-relevant network configuration. Unlike error-driven or contrastive learning schemes, this approach does not require explicit comparisons between network states obtained with and without output supervision. Instead, transient supervisory signals bias the dynamics toward the representation manifold, after which local plasticity consolidates the attained configuration, effectively shaping the latent representation space. Numerical evaluations on standard image classification benchmarks indicate performance comparable to that of multilayer perceptrons trained using backpropagation. More generally, these results suggest that the dynamical accessibility of fixed points and the stabilization of internal network dynamics constitute viable alternative principles for learning in recurrent systems, with conceptual links to statistical physics and potential implications for biologically motivated and neuromorphic computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Steady States and Quantum Chaos in a three-site Driven-Dissipative Bose-Hubbard Chains base on Self-Consistent Mean-Field Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.12844v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics and steady-state properties of a driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard chain using a self-consistent Gutzwiller mean-field (GMF) approach. By employing a robust Picard iteration scheme, we solve the non-linear master equation for the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) in the presence of strong Kerr nonlinearity. We identify two distinct dynamical regimes governed by the interplay between coherent drive, dissipation, and interaction: a regular quasilinear regime and a chaotic regime. Linear stability analysis reveals that the transition to the chaotic regime is triggered by parametric instabilities arising from the drive-induced coherence. Furthermore, we characterize the onset of quantum chaos by calculating the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). Our results show that in the strong coupling regime, the OTOC exhibits rapid exponential growth and saturation, providing a clear signature of information scrambling in this open quantum system. The proposed numerical framework offers an efficient pathway to explore many-body correlations in larger photonic lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14034v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum measurements performed on a subsystem of a quantum many-body state can generate entanglement for its remaining constituents. The whole system including the measurement record is described by a hybrid mixed state, which can exhibit exotic phase transitions and critical phenomena. We demonstrate that generic measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs) can be cast as decoherence-induced critical mixed states in one higher dimension, by constructing a projected entangled pair state (PEPS) prior to decoherence or measurement. In this context, a deeper conceptual understanding of such mixed-state criticality is called for, particularly with regard to algebraic symmetry as an advanced organizing principle for such entangled states of matter. Integrating these connections we investigate the role of self-dual symmetry -- a fundamental notion in theoretical physics -- in mixed states, showing that the decoherence of electric (e) and magnetic (m) vortices from the 2D bulk of the toric code, or equivalently, a 2D cluster state with symmetry-protected topological order, can leave a (1+1)D quantum critical mixed state protected by a weak Kramers-Wannier self-dual symmetry. The corresponding self-dual critical bulk is described by the N-&gt;1 limit of the 2D Non-linear Sigma Model in symmetry class D with target space SO(2N)/U(N) at $\Theta$-angle $\pi$, and represents a "measurement-version" of the Cho-Fisher network model subjected to Born-rule randomness...</description>

      <title>Quantum Signatures of Strange Attractors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01416v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In classical mechanics, driven systems with dissipation often exhibit complex, fractal dynamics known as strange attractors. This paper addresses the fundamental question of how such structures manifest in the quantum realm. We investigate the quantum Duffing oscillator, a paradigmatic chaotic system, using the Caldirola-Kanai (CK) framework, where dissipation is integrated directly into a time-dependent Hamiltonian. By employing the Husimi distribution to represent the quantum state in phase space, we present the first visualization of a quantum strange attractor within this model. Our simulations demonstrate how an initially simple Gaussian wave packet is stretched, folded, and sculpted by the interplay of chaotic dynamics and energy loss, causing it to localize onto a structure that beautifully mirrors the classical attractor. This quantum "photograph" is inherently smoothed, blurring the infinitely fine fractal details of its classical counterpart as a direct consequence of the uncertainty principle. We supplement this analysis by examining the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), which shows that stronger dissipation clarifies the exponential growth associated with the classical Lyapunov exponent, thereby confirming the model's semiclassical behavior. This work offers a compelling geometric perspective on open chaotic quantum systems and sheds new light on the quantum-classical transition.</description>

Abstract: Bilayer graphene cavities where electrons are confined within finite graphene flakes provide an alluring platform not only for the future nanoelectronic devices owing to the tunable energy gap but also for investigating the quantum nature of chaos due to the trigonal warping of their Fermi surface. Here we demonstrate that rotating the cavity boundary relative to the underlying lattice structure drives a quantum transition from nearly integrable dynamics to chaotic regime, observed as a concomitant crossover of eigenvalue statistics and eigenstate profiles. Complementing the full quantum treatment, we examine the classical backbone of this onset of chaos by employing semiclassical ray dynamics. Our results position bilayer graphene cavities as a promising venue for investigating and engineering quantum-chaotic behavior in graphene-based devices.</description>

Abstract: We investigate crystalline-like behavior of the spectral form factor (SFF) in unitary quantum systems with extremely strong eigenvalue repulsion. Using a low-temperature Coulomb gas as a model of repulsive eigenvalues, we derive the Debye-Waller factor suppressing periodic oscillations of the SFF and estimate the order of its singularities at multiples of the Heisenberg time. We also reproduce this crystalline-like behavior using perturbed permutation circuits and random matrix ensembles associated with Lax matrices. Our results lay a foundation for future studies of quantum systems that exhibit intermediate level statistics between standard random matrix ensembles and permutation circuits.</description>
