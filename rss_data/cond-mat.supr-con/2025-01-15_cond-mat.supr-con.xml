      <title>Thermal Annealing and Radiation Effects on Structural and Electrical Properties of NbN/GaN Superconductor/Semiconductor Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing, niobium nitride (NbN) superconductors have emerged as integral components due to their unique structural properties, including a high superconducting transition temperature (Tc), exceptional electrical conductivity, and compatibility with advanced device architectures. This study investigates the impact of high-temperature annealing and high-dose gamma irradiation on the structural and superconducting properties of NbN films grown on GaN via reactive DC magnetron sputtering. The as-deposited cubic {\delta}-NbN (111) films exhibited a high-intensity XRD peak, high Tc of 12.82K, and an atomically flat surface. Annealing at 500 and 950 {\deg}C for varying durations revealed notable structural and surface changes. High-resolution STEM indicated improved local ordering, while AFM showed reduced surface roughness after annealing. XPS revealed a gradual increase in the Nb/N ratio with higher annealing temperatures and durations. High-resolution XRD and STEM analyses showed lattice constant modifications in {\delta}-NbN films, attributed to residual stress changes following annealing. Additionally, XRD phi-scans revealed sixfold symmetry in NbN films due to rotational domains relative to GaN. While Tc remained stable after annealing at 500 {\deg}C, increasing the annealing temperature to 950 {\deg}C degraded Tc to ~8K and reduced the residual resistivity ratio from 0.85 in as-deposited films to 0.29 after 30 minutes. The effects of gamma radiation (5 Mrad (Si)) were also studied, demonstrating minimal changes to crystallinity and superconducting performance, indicating excellent radiation resilience. These findings highlight the potential of NbN superconductors for integration into advanced quantum devices and their suitability for applications in radiation-intensive environments such as space, satellites, and nuclear power plants.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle Fermi surfaces of niobium and niobium-titanium alloys at high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic structure of pure niobium and the niobium-titanium alloy Nb$_{0.44}$Ti$_{0.56}$ in the bcc-phase at pressures up to $250$ GPa is investigated, to reveal possible factors conducing toward the robust superconductivity reported for Ti-doped niobium upon a considerable volume reduction. We model the structural disorder using the coherent potential approximation, and the electronic correlations are taken into account using dynamical mean-field theory. At high pressure, a significant change in the topology of the Fermi surface is observed, while electronic correlations weaken with increasing pressure. Thus, the normal state of Nb$_{0.44}$Ti$_{0.56}$ is found to be a Fermi liquid with a well-defined Fermi surface, and well-defined quasiparticles near it. The systematic study of the impact of disorder upon the Fermi surface at such ultra high pressures allows notable insights into the nature of the electronic states near the Fermi level, i.e., within the energy scale relevant for superconducting pairing. Furthermore, our results clearly indicate the necessity of further experimental Fermi surface explorations.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and normal-state transport in compressively strained La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity under high pressure in Ruddlesden-Popper phases of bulk nickelates has sparked great interest in stabilizing ambient pressure superconductivity in thin-film form using epitaxial strain. Recently, signs of superconductivity have been observed in compressively strained bilayer nickelate thin films with an onset temperature exceeding 40 K, albeit with broad and two-step-like transitions. Here, we report intrinsic superconductivity and normal-state transport properties in compressively strained La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ thin films, achieved through a combination of isovalent Pr substitution, growth optimization, and precision ozone annealing. The superconducting onset occurs above 48 K, with zero resistance reached above 30 K, and the critical current density at 1.4 K is 100-fold larger than previous reports. The normal-state resistivity exhibits quadratic temperature dependence indicative of Fermi liquid behaviour, and other phenomenological similarities to transport in overdoped cuprates suggest parallels in their emergent properties.</description>

      <title>Resolving Structural Origins for Superconductivity in Strain-Engineered La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high hydrostatic pressure and, more recently, biaxial compression in epitaxial thin films has ignited significant interest in understanding the interplay between atomic and electronic structure in these compounds. Subtle changes in the nickel-oxygen bonding environment are thought to be key drivers for stabilizing superconductivity, but specific details of which bonds and which modifications are most relevant remains so far unresolved. While direct, atomic-scale structural characterization under hydrostatic pressure is beyond current experimental capabilities, static stabilization of strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films provides a platform well-suited to investigation with new picometer-resolution electron microscopy methods. Here, we use multislice electron ptychography to directly measure the atomic-scale structural evolution of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films across a wide range of biaxial strains tuned via substrate. By resolving both the cation and oxygen sublattices, we study strain-dependent evolution of atomic bonds, providing the opportunity to isolate and disentangle the effects of specific structural motifs for stabilizing superconductivity. We identify the lifting of crystalline symmetry through modification of the nickel-oxygen octahedral distortions under compressive strain as a key structural ingredient for superconductivity. Rather than previously supposed $c$-axis compression, our results highlight the importance of in-plane biaxial compression in superconducting thin films, which suggests an alternative -- possibly cuprate-like -- understanding of the electronic structure. Identifying local regions of inhomogeneous oxygen stoichiometry and high internal strain near crystalline defects, we suggest potential pathways for improving the sharpness and temperature of the superconducting transition.</description>

      <title>Negative superfluid density and spatial instabilities in driven superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider excitation of Higgs modes via the modulation of the BCS coupling within the Migdal-Eliashberg-Keldysh theory of time-dependent superconductivity. Despite the presence of phonons, which break integrability, we observe Higgs amplitude oscillations reminiscent of the integrable case. The dynamics of quasiparticles follows from the effective Bogolyubov-de Gennes equations, which represent a Floquet problem for the Bogoliubov quasiparticles. We find that when the Floquet-Bogoliubov bands overlap, the homogeneous solution formally leads to a negative superfluid density, which is no longer proportional to the amplitude of the order parameter. This result indicates an instability, which we explore using spatially-resolved BdG equations. Spontaneous appearance of spatial inhomogeneities in the order parameter is observed and they first occur when the superfluid density becomes unphysical. We conclude that the homogeneous solution to time-dependent superconductivity is generally unstable and breaks up into a complicated spatial landscape via an avalanche of topological excitations.</description>

      <title>Exploring the energy spectrum of a four-terminal Josephson junction: Towards topological Andreev band structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid multiterminal Josephson junctions (JJs) are expected to harbor a novel class of Andreev bound states (ABSs), including topologically nontrivial states in four-terminal devices. In these systems, topological phases emerge when ABSs depend on at least three superconducting phase differences, resulting in a three-dimensional (3D) energy spectrum characterized by Weyl nodes at zero energy. Here, we realize a four-terminal JJ in a hybrid Al/InAs heterostructure, where ABSs form a synthetic 3D band structure. We probe the energy spectrum using tunneling spectroscopy and identify spectral features associated with the formation of a tri-Andreev molecule, a bound state whose energy depends on three superconducting phases and, therefore, is able to host topological ABSs. The experimental observations are well described by a numerical model. The calculations predict the appearance of four Weyl nodes at zero energy within a gap smaller than the experimental resolution. These topological states are theoretically predicted to remain stable within an extended region of the parameter space, well accessible by our device. These findings establish an experimental foundation to study high-dimensional synthetic band structures in multiterminal JJs, and to realize topological Andreev bands.</description>

      <title>Electron-phonon coupling and phonon dynamics in single-layer NbSe$_2$ on graphene: the role of moir\'e phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between substrate interactions and electron-phonon coupling in two-dimensional (2D) materials presents a significant challenge in understanding and controlling their electronic properties. Here, we present a comparative study of the structural characteristics, phonon dynamics, and electron-phonon interactions in bulk and monolayer NbSe$_2$ on epitaxial bilayer graphene (BLG) using helium atom scattering (HAS). High-resolution helium diffraction reveals a (9x9)0$^{\circ}$ superstructure within the NbSe$_2$ monolayer, commensurate with the BLG lattice, while out-of-plane HAS diffraction spectra indicate a low-corrugated (3$\sqrt{3}$x3$\sqrt{3}$)30$^{\circ}$ substructure. By monitoring the thermal attenuation of the specular peak across a temperature range of 100 K to 300 K, we determined the electron-phonon coupling constant $\lambda_{HAS}$ as 0.76 for bulk 2H-NbSe$_2$. In contrast, the NbSe$_2$ monolayer on graphene exhibits a reduced $\lambda_{HAS}$ of 0.55, corresponding to a superconducting critical temperature (T$_C$) of 1.56 K according to the MacMillan formula, consistent with transport measurement findings. Inelastic HAS data provide, besides a set of dispersion curves of acoustic and lower optical phonons, a soft, dispersionless branch of phonons at 1.7 meV, attributed to the interface localized defects distributed with the superstructure period, and thus termed moir\'e phonons. Our data show that moir\'e phonons contribute significantly to the electron-phonon coupling in monolayer NbSe$_2$. These results highlight the crucial role of the BLG on the electron-phonon coupling in monolayer NbSe$_2$, attributed to enhanced charge transfer effects, providing valuable insights into substrate-dependent electronic interactions in 2D superconductors.</description>

      <title>Expression with self-consistent magnetic units for calculation of critical current density using the Bean's Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study analyzes the calculation of the critical current density Jc,mag by means of Bean's critical state model, using the equation formulated by Gyorgy et al. and other similar equations derived from it reported in the literature. While estimations of Jc,mag using Bean's model are widely performed, improper use of different equations with different magnetic units and pre-factors leads to confusion and to significant errors in the reported values of Jc,mag. In this work, a SINGLE general equation is proposed for the calculation of Jc,mag for a rectangular parallelepiped sample in perpendicular field using Bean's critical state model, underlying how the simple conversion of magnetic units can lead to a Jc,mag in the desired units, without the need to introduce any other correction or use other specific equations depending on the units of Jc,mag. In this equation, the numerical pre-factor is dimensionless, independent of the unit system used. A comparison between the expression reported in the literature is done, showing how they can lead to different results depending on the used units, and that these results can be at least one order of magnitude different from the correct results obtained with the general equation proposed in this work. This resolves all ambiguities and aligns with the correct dimensional analysis, eliminates discrepancies in the calculated Jc,mag, and will avoid further propagation of errors in the literature.</description>

      <title>Josephson effect and odd-frequency pairing in superconducting junctions with unconventional magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Josephson junctions formed by coupling two conventional superconductors via an unconventional magnet and investigate the formation of Andreev bound states, their impact on the Josephson effect, and the emergent superconducting correlations. We focus on unconventional magnets known as $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets. We find that the Andreev bound states in $d$-wave altermagnet and $p_y$-wave magnet Josephson junctions strongly depend on the transverse momentum, with a spin splitting and low-energy minima as a function of the superconducting phase difference $\varphi$. In contrast, the Andreev bound states for $p_{x}$-wave magnets are insensitive to the transverse momentum. We show that the Andreev bound states can be probed by the local density of states in the middle of the junction, which also reveals that $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$- and $p$-wave magnet junctions are prone to host zero energy peaks. While the zero-energy peak in $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave altermagnet junctions tends to oscillate with the magnetic order, it remains robust in $p$-wave magnet junctions. We also demonstrate that the critical currents in $d$-wave altermagnet Josephson junctions exhibit an oscillatory decay with the increase of the magnetic order, while the oscillations are absent in $p$-wave magnet junctions albeit the currents exhibit a slow decay. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the interplay of the Josephson effect and unconventional magnetic order of $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets originates from odd-frequency spin-triplet $s$-wave superconducting correlations that are otherwise absent. Our results can serve as a guide to pursue the new functionality of Josephson junctions based on unconventional magnets.</description>

      <title>Ballistic Andreev interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13669v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Josephson junction, formed between two phase-biased superconductors and a normal metal, hosts a discrete spectrum of Andreev bound states (ABS). In this paper, we develop a theory for long ballistic Andreev interferometers in two-dimensional metals. We consider three frameworks in our theoretical analysis: (i) perturbation theory in the tunneling amplitudes; (ii) non-perturbative transport theory; and (iii) physically motivated approximations to visualize the conductance maps in the (flux, voltage) plane. We find a non-standard phase-sensitive Andreev reflection process in ballistic interferometers that couples the supercurrent to the non-equilibrium populations of the ABS in the normal region. Furthermore, our model shows that conductance spectroscopy follows the spectrum of the ABS in long junctions. We also discuss our results in terms of the semiclassical theory, the classical orbits being the one-dimensional Andreev tubes. Our theoretical analysis captures the results of recent experiments by the Penn State and Harvard groups.</description>
