      <title>LightCPPgen: An Explainable Machine Learning Pipeline for Rational Design of Cell Penetrating Peptides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are powerful vectors for the intracellular delivery of a diverse array of therapeutic molecules. Despite their potential, the rational design of CPPs remains a challenging task that often requires extensive experimental efforts and iterations. In this study, we introduce an innovative approach for the de novo design of CPPs, leveraging the strengths of machine learning (ML) and optimization algorithms. Our strategy, named LightCPPgen, integrates a LightGBM-based predictive model with a genetic algorithm (GA), enabling the systematic generation and optimization of CPP sequences. At the core of our methodology is the development of an accurate, efficient, and interpretable predictive model, which utilizes 20 explainable features to shed light on the critical factors influencing CPP translocation capacity. The CPP predictive model works synergistically with an optimization algorithm, which is tuned to enhance computational efficiency while maintaining optimization performance. The GA solutions specifically target the candidate sequences' penetrability score, while trying to maximize similarity with the original non-penetrating peptide in order to retain its original biological and physicochemical properties. By prioritizing the synthesis of only the most promising CPP candidates, LightCPPgen can drastically reduce the time and cost associated with wet lab experiments. In summary, our research makes a substantial contribution to the field of CPP design, offering a robust framework that combines ML and optimization techniques to facilitate the rational design of penetrating peptides, by enhancing the explainability and interpretability of the design process.</description>

      <title>Sifting through the Noise: A Survey of Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Their Applications to Biomolecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models have made their way into a number of high-profile applications since their inception. In particular, there has been a wave of research into using diffusion models in the prediction and design of biomolecular structures and sequences. Their growing ubiquity makes it imperative for researchers in these fields to understand them. This paper serves as a general overview for the theory behind these models and the current state of research. We first introduce diffusion models and discuss common motifs used when applying them to biomolecules. We then present the significant outcomes achieved through the application of these models in generative and predictive tasks. This survey aims to provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of the increasingly critical role of diffusion models.</description>

      <title>TAGMol: Target-Aware Gradient-guided Molecule Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D generative models have shown significant promise in structure-based drug design (SBDD), particularly in discovering ligands tailored to specific target binding sites. Existing algorithms often focus primarily on ligand-target binding, characterized by binding affinity. Moreover, models trained solely on target-ligand distribution may fall short in addressing the broader objectives of drug discovery, such as the development of novel ligands with desired properties like drug-likeness, and synthesizability, underscoring the multifaceted nature of the drug design process. To overcome these challenges, we decouple the problem into molecular generation and property prediction. The latter synergistically guides the diffusion sampling process, facilitating guided diffusion and resulting in the creation of meaningful molecules with the desired properties. We call this guided molecular generation process as TAGMol. Through experiments on benchmark datasets, TAGMol demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 22% improvement in average Vina Score and yielding favorable outcomes in essential auxiliary properties. This establishes TAGMol as a comprehensive framework for drug generation.</description>

      <title>Kirigami: large convolutional kernels improve deep learning-based RNA secondary structure prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel fully convolutional neural network (FCN) architecture for predicting the secondary structure of ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules. Interpreting RNA structures as weighted graphs, we employ deep learning to estimate the probability of base pairing between nucleotide residues. Unique to our model are its massive 11-pixel kernels, which we argue provide a distinct advantage for FCNs on the specialized domain of RNA secondary structures. On a widely adopted, standardized test set comprised of 1,305 molecules, the accuracy of our method exceeds that of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) secondary structure prediction software, achieving a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) over 11-40% higher than that of other leading methods on overall structures and 58-400% higher on pseudoknots specifically.</description>

      <title>FusionDTI: Fine-grained Binding Discovery with Token-level Fusion for Drug-Target Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting drug-target interaction (DTI) is critical in the drug discovery process. Despite remarkable advances in recent DTI models through the integration of representations from diverse drug and target encoders, such models often struggle to capture the fine-grained interactions between drugs and protein, i.e. the binding of specific drug atoms (or substructures) and key amino acids of proteins, which is crucial for understanding the binding mechanisms and optimising drug design. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel model, called FusionDTI, which uses a token-level Fusion module to effectively learn fine-grained information for Drug-Target Interaction. In particular, our FusionDTI model uses the SELFIES representation of drugs to mitigate sequence fragment invalidation and incorporates the structure-aware (SA) vocabulary of target proteins to address the limitation of amino acid sequences in structural information, additionally leveraging pre-trained language models extensively trained on large-scale biomedical datasets as encoders to capture the complex information of drugs and targets. Experiments on three well-known benchmark datasets show that our proposed FusionDTI model achieves the best performance in DTI prediction compared with seven existing state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, our case study indicates that FusionDTI could highlight the potential binding sites, enhancing the explainability of the DTI prediction.</description>

      <title>Preference Optimization for Molecule Synthesis with Conditional Residual Energy-based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecule synthesis through machine learning is one of the fundamental problems in drug discovery. Current data-driven strategies employ one-step retrosynthesis models and search algorithms to predict synthetic routes in a top-bottom manner. Despite their effective performance, these strategies face limitations in the molecule synthetic route generation due to a greedy selection of the next molecule set without any lookahead. Furthermore, existing strategies cannot control the generation of synthetic routes based on possible criteria such as material costs, yields, and step count. In this work, we propose a general and principled framework via conditional residual energy-based models (EBMs), that focus on the quality of the entire synthetic route based on the specific criteria. By incorporating an additional energy-based function into our probabilistic model, our proposed algorithm can enhance the quality of the most probable synthetic routes (with higher probabilities) generated by various strategies in a plug-and-play fashion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can consistently boost performance across various strategies and outperforms previous state-of-the-art top-1 accuracy by a margin of 2.5%.

      <title>A unified framework for coarse grained molecular dynamics of proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding protein dynamics is crucial for elucidating their biological functions. While all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide detailed information, coarse-grained (CG) MD simulations capture the essential collective motions of proteins at significantly lower computational cost. In this article, we present a unified framework for coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation of proteins. Our approach utilizes a tree-structured representation of collective variables, enabling reconstruction of protein Cartesian coordinates with high fidelity. The evolution of configurations is constructed using a deep neural network trained on trajectories generated from conventional all-atom MD simulations. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness using the 168-amino protein target T1027 from CASP14. Statistical distributions of the collective variables and time series of root mean square deviation (RMSD) obtained from our coarse-grained simulations closely resemble those from all-atom MD simulations. This method is not only useful for studying the movements of complex proteins, but also has the potential to be adapted for simulating other biomolecules like DNA, RNA, and even electrolytes in batteries.</description>
