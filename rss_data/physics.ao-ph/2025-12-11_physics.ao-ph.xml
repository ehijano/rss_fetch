      <title>FuXi-Nowcast: Meet the longstanding challenge of convective initiation in nowcasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate nowcasting of convective storms remains a major challenge for operational forecasting, particularly for convective initiation and the evolution of high-impact rainfall and strong winds. Here we present FuXi-Nowcast, a deep-learning system that jointly predicts composite radar reflectivity, surface precipitation, near-surface temperature, wind speed and wind gusts at 1-km resolution over eastern China. FuXi-Nowcast integrates multi-source observations, such as radar, surface stations and the High-Resolution Land Data Assimilation System (HRLDAS), with three-dimensional atmospheric fields from the machine-learning weather model FuXi-2.0 within a multi-task Swin-Transformer architecture. A convective signal enhancement module and distribution-aware hybrid loss functions are designed to preserve intense convective structures and mitigate the rapid intensity decay common in deep-learning nowcasts. FuXi-Nowcast surpasses the operational CMA-MESO 3-km numerical model in Critical Success Index for reflectivity, precipitation and wind gusts across thresholds and lead times up to 12 h, with the largest gains for heavy rainfall. Case studies further show that FuXi-Nowcast more accurately captures the timing, location and structure of convective initiation and subsequent evolution of convection. These results demonstrate that coupling three-dimensional machine-learning forecasts with high-resolution observations can provide multi-hazard, long-lead nowcasts that outperforms current operational systems.</description>

      <title>Rogue Vertical Drafts in the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere: Evidence and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observational evidence of extreme vertical velocities (|w| ge 12.5 m/s and at times greater than 50 m/s) in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT), has emerged in recent years. We refer to these events as Rogue Vertical Drafts (RVDs). They exceed five standard deviations of observed vertical velocities and appear as paired updraft-downdraft structures in varicose mode. Four-dimensional observations reveal that RVDs are intermittent, recurrent, and unpredictable. On average, they are expected to occur every sim 12 days during summer over Northern Norway, assuming a 1000 s interval. Different instruments may capture only portions of these events, for example, only upward or downward drafts when restricted to a single altitude range. Despite their rarity, their magnitudes and frequency suggest potential impacts on dust-sized matter escaping from planets, natural and anthropogenic space material, and MLT climate and processes. We propose that RVDs are a fundamental yet under-recognized feature of the MLT, underscoring the need for global observations to assess their prevalence and significance.</description>

      <title>Oceanic internal tides: do they get phased at the Equator?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-mode baroclinic tides play a major role in ocean dynamics, especially for energy redistribution and deep ocean mixing. These internal waves, generated by tidal flow over submarine topography, can propagate for thousands of kilometres across ocean basins, and become unstable through wave-mean flow or wave-wave interactions. Satellite observations of internal tides have shown that part of their lunar semidiurnal (M2) altimetry signal loses phase coherence in equatorial regions, thus affecting how we interpret their dynamics and energy distribution (Buijsman et al. 2017). We investigate the interaction of a baroclinic M2 internal tide wavepacket with an equatorial zonal jet, possibly of any horizontal or vertical structure. The dynamics of the low modes are explored as well as the potential excitation of higher vertical modes and how these interactions can generate incoherences in the baroclinic tide signal.
  We develop an idealized linear model using modal decomposition (Kelly et al. 2016), which is solved using Dedalus, to study the dynamics of a mode 1 M2 internal wavepacket on an equatorial beta plane. A zonal jet, with a uniform or a sheared vertical structure, is added at the equator to investigate potential wave-mean flow interaction. We find that a vertically uniform zonal jet affects the propagation of the mode 1 wavepacket. Depending on the strength of the jet, this can cause total reflection or strong distortion of the wavepacket. In contrast, a wavepacket entering a vertically sheared jet shows energy scattering into higher modes, which have lower phase and group speeds, shorter wavelengths, and are thus more susceptible to dissipation (and critical layers for non-uniform stratification). As the wavepacket exits the jet, reverse energy transfer occurs and the phase speed difference between the modes may explain part of the phase incoherence observed in altimetry data.</description>

      <title>A Model Intercomparison Study of Mixed-Phase Clouds in a Laboratory Chamber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed-phase clouds, composed of supercooled liquid droplets and ice crystals, play a critical role in weather and climate systems. Their complex microphysical interactions and coupling with turbulence at microscales govern the cloud properties at macroscales, yet remain challenging to observe and quantify under atmospheric conditions. This model intercomparison study utilizes ten model configurations to simulate mixed-phase cloud evolution in the Michigan Technological University's Pi Chamber. The models span a range of frameworks, including box models, direct numerical simulation, and large-eddy simulation models, and incorporate both bin and Lagrangian microphysics. Each model was tuned to reproduce the observed liquid-phase steady state prior to ice injection. Ice particles were then introduced into the domain at various rates to examine cloud glaciation behavior. By the intercomparison design, all models successfully reproduced the observed mean droplet radius and number concentration during the liquid-phase stage. Increasing ice particle injection rates led to consistent qualitative trends across models: depletion of liquid water, reduced total water content, and a shift in particle size distributions toward larger radii. However, quantitative differences arose due to variations in model treatment in dynamics and microphysics, including subgrid-scale turbulence parameterizations, wall forcing, and particle removal parameterizations. Most models that simulate the full chamber retained liquid droplets near the lower boundary, where supersaturation forcing is strongest and droplets are replenished before mixing into the core region. These surviving liquids droplets were absent in simulations assuming a well-mixed domain, excluding the near-wall region, or using coarse grid spacing.</description>

      <title>Conserved Pseudomomenta in Linear Quasigeostrophic Fluid Flows From Noether's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formulations for the two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic equations linearized about a zonally-symmetric basic flow are presented. The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian exhibit an infinite U(1) symmetry due to the absence of wave + wave -&gt; wave interactions in the linearized approximation. By Noether's theorem the symmetry has a corresponding infinite set of conservation laws which are the well-known pseudomomenta. There exist separately conserved pseudomomenta at each zonal wavenumber, a point that has sometimes been obscured in past treatments.</description>

      <title>Lazy Diffusion: Mitigating spectral collapse in generative diffusion-based stable autoregressive emulation of turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulent flows posses broadband, power-law spectra in which multiscale interactions couple high-wavenumber fluctuations to large-scale dynamics. Although diffusion-based generative models offer a principled probabilistic forecasting framework, we show that standard DDPMs induce a fundamental \emph{spectral collapse}: a Fourier-space analysis of the forward SDE reveals a closed-form, mode-wise signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that decays monotonically in wavenumber, $|k|$ for spectra $S(k)\!\propto\!|k|^{-\lambda}$, rendering high-wavenumber modes indistinguishable from noise and producing an intrinsic spectral bias. We reinterpret the noise schedule as a spectral regularizer and introduce power-law schedules $\beta(\tau)\!\propto\!\tau^\gamma$ that preserve fine-scale structure deeper into diffusion time, along with \emph{Lazy Diffusion}, a one-step distillation method that leverages the learned score geometry to bypass long reverse-time trajectories and prevent high-$k$ degradation. Applied to high-Reynolds-number 2D Kolmogorov turbulence and $1/12^\circ$ Gulf of Mexico ocean reanalysis, these methods resolve spectral collapse, stabilize long-horizon autoregression, and restore physically realistic inertial-range scaling. Together, they show that na\"ive Gaussian scheduling is structurally incompatible with power-law physics and that physics-aware diffusion processes can yield accurate, efficient, and fully probabilistic surrogates for multiscale dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the Future with Yesterday's Climate: Temperature Bias in AI Weather and Climate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI-based climate and weather models have rapidly gained popularity, providing faster forecasts with skill that can match or even surpass that of traditional dynamical models. Despite this success, these models face a key challenge: predicting future climates while being trained only with historical data. In this study, we investigate this issue by analyzing boreal winter land temperature biases in AI weather and climate models. We examine two weather models, FourCastNet V2 Small (FourCastNet) and Pangu Weather (Pangu), evaluating their predictions for 2020-2025 and Ai2 Climate Emulator version 2 (ACE2) for 1996-2010. These time periods lie outside of the respective models' training sets and are significantly more recent than the bulk of their training data, allowing us to assess how well the models generalize to new, i.e. more modern, conditions. We find that all three models produce cold-biased mean temperatures, resembling climates from 15-20 years earlier than the period they are predicting. In some regions, like the Eastern U.S., the predictions resemble climates from as much as 20-30 years earlier. Further analysis shows that FourCastNet's and Pangu's cold bias is strongest in the hottest predicted temperatures, indicating limited training exposure to modern extreme heat events. In contrast, ACE2's bias is more evenly distributed but largest in regions, seasons, and parts of the temperature distribution where climate change has been most pronounced. These findings underscore the challenge of training AI models exclusively on historical data and highlight the need to account for such biases when applying them to future climate prediction.</description>

      <title>The Role of Planetary-Scale Waves on the Stratospheric Superrotation in Titan's Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze simulation results from the TitanWRF global circulation model to understand the mechanisms that maintain the equatorial superrotation in Titan's stratosphere. We find that the eddies associated with wave activities can transport angular momentum upgradient to zonal flow, leading to acceleration of the equatorial superrotation. The dominant wave modes identified in this study are consistent with previous studies, with zonal wavenumber 1 being the major contributor to the prograde acceleration. Despite the same conclusion of maintenance of equatorial superrotation via wave-mean interactions, we find that the way waves interact with the zonal flow in TitanWRF is slightly different from some other studies. We confirm our previous findings that in TitanWRF this occurs primarily during a dozen or so annual, short-duration (a few Titan sols) angular momentum "transfer events", which have a repeatable seasonal pattern but differ slightly in timing and magnitude between years. This is not the case in the Titan Atmosphere Model (TAM), which found milder angular momentum transfers that produced the strongest acceleration of superrotation around solstice in the upper stratosphere and more continuous year-around acceleration in the lower stratosphere. Despite differences in angular momentum transfer across models, we further find that, similar to the TAM wave analysis results, eddies generated by Rossby-Kelvin instabilities may be the major source of prograde angular momentum for the equatorial superrotation, although TitanWRF may also include contributions from the absorption of vertically propagating equatorial Kelvin waves. This differs from our previous work, which suggested barotropic waves were responsible for TitanWRF's solsticial transfer event.</description>
