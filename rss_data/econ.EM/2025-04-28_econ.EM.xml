      <title>Deep Learning for Individual Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.14694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper integrates deep neural networks (DNNs) into structural economic models to increase flexibility and capture rich heterogeneity while preserving interpretability. Economic structure and machine learning are complements in empirical modeling, not substitutes: DNNs provide the capacity to learn complex, non-linear heterogeneity patterns, while the structural model ensures the estimates remain interpretable and suitable for decision making and policy analysis. We start with a standard parametric structural model and then enrich its parameters into fully flexible functions of observables, which are estimated using a particular DNN architecture whose structure reflects the economic model. We illustrate our framework by studying demand estimation in consumer choice. We show that by enriching a standard demand model we can capture rich heterogeneity, and further, exploit this heterogeneity to create a personalized pricing strategy. This type of optimization is not possible without economic structure, but cannot be heterogeneous without machine learning. Finally, we provide theoretical justification of each step in our proposed methodology. We first establish non-asymptotic bounds and convergence rates of our structural deep learning approach. Next, a novel and quite general influence function calculation allows for feasible inference via double machine learning in a wide variety of contexts. These results may be of interest in many other contexts, as they generalize prior work.</description>

      <title>Flexible Covariate Adjustments in Regression Discontinuity Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.07942v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirical regression discontinuity (RD) studies often include covariates in their specifications to increase the precision of their estimates. In this paper, we propose a novel class of estimators that use such covariate information more efficiently than existing methods and can accommodate many covariates. Our estimators are simple to implement and involve running a standard RD analysis after subtracting a function of the covariates from the original outcome variable. We characterize the function of the covariates that minimizes the asymptotic variance of these estimators. We also show that the conventional RD framework gives rise to a special robustness property which implies that the optimal adjustment function can be estimated flexibly via modern machine learning techniques without affecting the first-order properties of the final RD estimator. We demonstrate our methods' scope for efficiency improvements by reanalyzing data from a large number of recently published empirical studies.</description>

      <title>Stratifying on Treatment Status</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04700v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the estimation of treatment effects using samples stratified by treatment status. Standard estimators of the average treatment effect and the local average treatment effect are inconsistent in this setting. We propose consistent estimators and characterize their asymptotic distributions.</description>

      <title>Testing for Underpowered Literatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How many experimental studies would have come to different conclusions had they been run on larger samples? I show how to estimate the expected number of statistically significant results that a set of experiments would have reported had their sample sizes all been counterfactually increased. The proposed deconvolution estimator is asymptotically normal and adjusts for publication bias. Unlike related methods, this approach requires no assumptions of any kind about the distribution of true intervention treatment effects. An application to randomized trials (RCTs) published in economics journals finds that doubling every sample would increase the power of t-tests by 7.2 percentage points on average. This effect is smaller than for non-RCTs and comparable to systematic replications in laboratory psychology where previous studies enabled more accurate power calculations. This suggests that RCTs are on average relatively insensitive to sample size increases. Funders should generally consider sponsoring more experiments rather than fewer, larger ones.</description>
