      <title>Type B Set partitions, an analogue of restricted growth functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study type B set partitions for a given specific positive integer $k$ defined over $\langle n\rangle=\{-n, -(n-1),\cdots -1,0,1,\cdots n-1,n\}$. We found a few generating functions of type B analogue for some of the set partition statistics defined by Wachs, White and Steingrimsson for partitions over positive integers $[n] =\{1,2,\cdots n\}$, both for standard and ordered set partitions respectively. We extended the idea of restricted growth functions utilized by Wachs and White for set partitions over $[n]$, in the scenario of $\langle n\rangle$ and called the analogue as Signed Restricted Growth Function (SRGF).
  We discussed analogues of major index for type B partitions in terms of SRGF. We found an analogue of Foata bijection and reduced matrix for type B set partitions as done by Sagan for set partitions of $[n]$ with sepcific number of blocks $k$. We conclude with some open questions regarding the type B analogue of some well known results already done in case of set partitions of $[n]$.</description>

      <title>On the sizes of BDDs and ZDDs representing matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matroids are often represented as oracles since there are no unified and compact representations for general matroids. This paper initiates the study of binary decision diagrams (BDDs) and zero-suppressed binary decision diagrams (ZDDs) as relatively compact data structures for representing matroids in a computer. This study particularly focuses on the sizes of BDDs and ZDDs representing matroids. First, we compare the sizes of different variations of BDDs and ZDDs for a matroid. These comparisons involve concise transformations between specific decision diagrams. Second, we provide upper bounds on the size of BDDs and ZDDs for several classes of matroids. These bounds are closely related to the number of minors of the matroid and depend only on the connectivity function or pathwidth of the matroid, which deeply relates to the classes of matroids called strongly pigeonhole classes. In essence, these results indicate upper bounds on the number of minors for specific classes of matroids and new strongly pigeonhole classes.</description>

      <title>$\alpha_i$-Metric Graphs: Hyperbolicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is called $\alpha_i$-metric ($i \in {\cal N}$) if it satisfies the following $\alpha_i$-metric property for every vertices $u, w, v$ and $x$: if a shortest path between $u$ and $w$ and a shortest path between $x$ and $v$ share a terminal edge $vw$, then $d(u,x) \ge d(u,v) + d(v,x) - i$. The latter is a discrete relaxation of the property that in Euclidean spaces the union of two geodesics sharing a terminal segment must be also a geodesic. Recently in (Dragan &amp; Ducoffe, WG'23) we initiated the study of the algorithmic applications of $\alpha_i$-metric graphs. Our results in this prior work were very similar to those established in (Chepoi et al., SoCG'08) and (Chepoi et al., COCOA'18) for graphs with bounded hyperbolicity. The latter is a heavily studied metric tree-likeness parameter first introduced by Gromov. In this paper, we clarify the relationship between hyperbolicity and the $\alpha_i$-metric property, proving that $\alpha_i$-metric graphs are $f(i)$-hyperbolic for some function $f$ linear in $i$. We give different proofs of this result, using various equivalent definitions to graph hyperbolicity. By contrast, we give simple constructions of $1$-hyperbolic graphs that are not $\alpha_i$-metric for any constant $i$. Finally, in the special case of $i=1$, we prove that $\alpha_1$-metric graphs are $1$-hyperbolic, and the bound is sharp. By doing so, we can answer some questions left open in (Dragan &amp; Ducoffe, WG'23).</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue bounds for the distance-$t$ chromatic number of a graph and their application to Lee codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive eigenvalue bounds for the $t$-distance chromatic number of a graph, which is a generalization of the classical chromatic number. We apply such bounds to hypercube graphs, providing alternative spectral proofs for results by Ngo, Du and Graham [Inf. Process. Lett., 2002], and improving their bound for several instances. We also apply the eigenvalue bounds to Lee graphs, extending results by Kim and Kim [Discrete Appl. Math., 2011]. Finally, we provide a complete characterization for the existence of perfect Lee codes of minimum distance $3$. In order to prove our results, we use a mix of spectral and number theory tools. Our results, which provide the first application of spectral methods to Lee codes, illustrate that such methods succeed to capture the nature of the Lee metric.</description>

      <title>The inversion number of dijoins and blow-up digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an oriented graph \(D\), the \emph{inversion} of \(X \subseteq V(D)\) in \(D\) is the digraph obtained from \(D\) by reversing the direction of all arcs with both ends in \(X\). The \emph{inversion number} of \(D\), denoted by \(\invd\), is the minimum number of inversions needed to transform \(D\) into an acyclic digraph. In this paper, we first show that \( \mathrm{inv} (\overrightarrow{C_3} \Rightarrow D)= \invd +1 \) for any oriented graph \(D\) with even inversion number \(\invd\), where the dijoin \(\overrightarrow{C_3} \Rightarrow D\) is the oriented graph obtained from the disjoint union of \(\overrightarrow{C_3}\) and \(D\) by adding all arcs from \(\overrightarrow{C_3}\) to \(D\). Thus we disprove the conjecture of Aubian el at. \cite{2212.09188} and the conjecture of Alon el at. \cite{2212.11969}. We also study the blow-up graph which is an oriented graph obtained from a tournament by replacing all vertices into oriented graphs. We construct a tournament \(T\) with order \(n\) and \(\invt=\frac{n}{3}+1\) using blow-up graphs.</description>

      <title>Defective and Clustered Colouring of Graphs with Given Girth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The defective chromatic number of a graph class $\mathcal{G}$ is the minimum integer $k$ such that for some integer $d$, every graph in $\mathcal{G}$ is $k$-colourable such that each monochromatic component has maximum degree at most $d$. Similarly, the clustered chromatic number of a graph class $\mathcal{G}$ is the minimum integer $k$ such that for some integer $c$, every graph in $\mathcal{G}$ is $k$-colourable such that each monochromatic component has at most $c$ vertices. This paper determines or establishes bounds on the defective and clustered chromatic numbers of graphs with given girth in minor-closed classes defined by the following parameters: Hadwiger number, treewidth, pathwidth, treedepth, circumference, and feedback vertex number. One striking result is that for any integer $k$, for the class of triangle-free graphs with treewidth $k$, the defective chromatic number, clustered chromatic number and chromatic number are all equal. The same result holds for graphs with treedepth $k$, and generalises for graphs with no $K_p$ subgraph. We also show, via a result of K\"{u}hn and Osthus~[2003], that $K_t$-minor-free graphs with girth $g\geq 5$ are properly $O(t^{c_g})$ colourable, where $c_g\in(0,1)$ with $c_g\to 0$, thus asymptotically improving on Hadwiger's Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Zero Forcing with Vertex Reversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic zero forcing is a graph coloring process in which blue vertices "infect" (color blue) white vertices with a probability proportional to the number of neighboring blue vertices. We introduce reversion probabilistic zero forcing (RPZF), which shares the same infection dynamics but also allows for blue vertices to revert to being white in each round. We establish a tool which, given a graph's RPZF Markov transition matrix, calculates the probability that the graph turns all white or all blue as well as the time at which this is expected to occur. For specific graph families we produce a threshold number of blue vertices for the graph to become entirely blue in the next round with high probability.</description>

      <title>Normal ordered grammars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the theory of normal ordered grammars, which gives a natural generalization of the normal ordering problem. To illustrate the main idea, we explore normal ordered grammars associated with the Eulerian polynomials and the second-order Eulerian polynomials. In particular, we present a normal ordered grammatical interpretation for the (cdes,cyc) (p,q)-Eulerian polynomials, where cdes and cyc are the cycle descent and cycle statistics, respectively. The exponential generating function for a family of polynomials, generated by a normal ordered grammar associated with the second-order Eulerian polynomials, reveals an interesting feature: its expression involves the generating function for Catalan numbers as its exponent. In the final part, we discuss some normal ordered grammars related to the type B Eulerian polynomials. A normal ordered grammatical interpretation of the up-down run polynomial is also established.</description>

      <title>Improving the Gilbert-Varshamov bound for permutation Codes in the Cayley metric and Kendall $\tau$-Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cayley distance between two permutations $\pi, \sigma \in S_n$ is the minimum number of \textit{transpositions} required to obtain the permutation $\sigma$ from $\pi$. When we only allow adjacent transpositions, the minimum number of such transpositions to obtain $\sigma$ from $\pi$ is referred to the Kendall $\tau$-distance. A set $C$ of permutation words of length $n$ is called a $t$-Cayley permutation code if every pair of distinct permutations in $C$ has Cayley distance greater than $t$. A $t$-Kendall permutation code is defined similarly. Let $C(n,t)$ and $K(n,t)$ be the maximum size of a $t$-Cayley and a $t$-Kendall permutation code of length $n$, respectively. In this paper, we improve the Gilbert-Varshamov bound asymptotically by a factor $\log(n)$, namely \[ C(n,t) \geq \Omega_t\left(\frac{n!\log n}{n^{2t}}\right) \text{ and } K(n,t) \geq \Omega_t\left(\frac{n! \log n}{n^t}\right).\] Our proof is based on graph theory techniques.</description>

      <title>A Nordhaus--Gaddum problem for spectral gap of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices, with complement $\overline{G}$. The spectral gap of the transition probability matrix of a random walk on $G$ is used to estimate how fast the random walk becomes stationary. We prove that the larger spectral gap of $G$ and $\overline{G}$ is $\Omega(1/n)$. Moreover, if all degrees are $\Omega(n)$ and $n-\Omega(n)$, then the larger spectral gap of $G$ and $\overline{G}$ is $\Theta(1)$. We also show that if the maximum degree is $n-O(1)$ or if $G$ is a join of two graphs, then the spectral gap of $G$ is $\Omega(1/n)$. Finally, we provide a family of graphs such that the larger spectral gap of $G$ and $\overline{G}$ is $O(1/n^{3/4})$.</description>

Abstract: We prove the arborescence of any locally finite complex that is $CAT(0)$ with a polyhedral metric for which all vertex stars are convex. In particular locally finite $CAT(0)$ cube complexes or equilateral simplicial complexes are arborescent. Moreover, a triangulated manifold admits a $CAT(0)$ polyhedral metric if and only if it admits arborescent triangulations. We prove eventually that every locally finite complex which is $CAT(0)$ with a polyhedral metric has a barycentric subdivision which is arborescent.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Ideals and Invariant Hilbert Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A symmetric ideal is an ideal in a polynomial ring which is stable under all permutations of the variables. In this paper we initiate a global study of zero-dimensional symmetric ideals. By this we mean a geometric study of the invariant Hilbert schemes $\mathrm{Hilb}_{\rho}^{S_n}(\mathbb{C}^n)$ parametrizing symmetric subschemes of $\mathbb{C}^n$ whose coordinate rings, as $S_n$-modules, are isomorphic to a given representation $\rho$. In the case that $\rho = M^\lambda$ is a permutation module corresponding to certain special types of partitions $\lambda$ of $n$, we prove that $\mathrm{Hilb}_{\rho}^{S_n}(\mathbb{C}^n)$ is irreducible or even smooth. We also prove irreducibility whenever $\dim \rho \leq 2n$ and the invariant Hilbert scheme is non-empty. In this same range, we classify all homogeneous symmetric ideals and decide which of these define singular points of $\mathrm{Hilb}_{\rho}^{S_n}(\mathbb{C}^n)$. A central tool is the combinatorial theory of higher Specht polynomials.</description>

      <title>Prime Factorization of Meanders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.10289v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a prime factorization of open meanders, articulated through the framework of 2-colored operads. We demonstrate that each open meander can be canonically constructed from building blocks of two types: iterated snakes and irreducible meanders. We find out that iterated snakes allow efficient enumeration, and thus the problem of enumerating meanders reduces to the problem of enumerating irreducible meanders. Additionally, we present some results concerning the asymptotic of meanders of both classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.07324v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that in q-matroids, axioms for independent spaces, bases, and spanning spaces differ from the classical case of matroids, since the straightforward q-analogue of the classical axioms does not give a q-matroid. For this reason, a fourth axiom has been proposed. In this paper we show how we can describe these spaces with only three axioms, providing two alternative ways to do that. As an application, we show direct cryptomorphisms between independent spaces and circuits and between independent spaces and bases.</description>

      <title>Bounds for the collapsibility number of a simplicial complex and non-cover complexes of hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.10607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The collapsibility number of simplicial complexes was introduced by Wegner in order to understand the intersection patterns of convex sets. This number also plays an important role in a variety of Helly type results. We show that the non-cover complex of a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ is $|V(\mathcal{H)}|- \gamma_i(\mathcal{H})-1$-collapsible, where $\gamma_i(\mathcal{H})$ is the generalization of independence domination number of a graph to hypergraph. This extends the result of Choi, Kim and Park from graphs to hypergraphs. Moreover, the upper bound in terms of strong independence domination number given by Kim and Kim for the Leray number of the non-cover complex of a hypergraph can be obtained as a special case of our result.
  %There are only a few upper bounds for the collapsibility number of complexes available in literature.
  In general, there can be a large gap between the collapsibility number of a complex and its well-known upper bounds.
  %it is difficult to establish non-trivial upper bounds on the collapsibility number.
  In this article, we construct a sequence of upper bounds $\mathcal{M}_k(X)$ for the collapsibility number of a simplicial complex $X$, which lie in this gap. We also show that the bound given by $\mathcal{M}_k$ is tight if the underlying complex is $k$-vertex decomposable.</description>

      <title>Criticality in Sperner's Lemma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.03420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We answer a question posed by T. Gallai in 1969 concerning criticality in Sperner's lemma, listed as Problem 9.14 in the collection of Jensen and Toft [Graph coloring problems, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, 1995].
  Sperner's lemma states that if a labelling of the vertices of a triangulation of the $d$-simplex $\Delta^d$ with labels $1, 2, \ldots, d+1$ has the property that (i) each vertex of $\Delta^d$ receives a distinct label, and (ii) any vertex lying in a face of $\Delta^d$ has the same label as one of the vertices of that face, then there exists a rainbow facet (a facet whose vertices have pairwise distinct labels). For $d\leq 2$, it is not difficult to show that for every facet $\sigma$, there exists a labelling with the above properties where $\sigma$ is the unique rainbow facet. For every $d\geq 3$, however, we construct an infinite family of examples where this is not the case, which implies the answer to Gallai's question as a corollary. The construction is based on the properties of a $4$-polytope which had been used earlier to disprove a claim of T. S. Motzkin on neighbourly polytopes.</description>

      <title>Total positivity of some polynomial matrices that enumerate labeled trees and forests. II. Rooted labeled trees and partial functional digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03999v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study three combinatorial models for the lower-triangular matrix with entries $t_{n,k} = \binom{n}{k} n^{n-k}$: two involving rooted trees on the vertex set $[n+1]$, and one involving partial functional digraphs on the vertex set $[n]$. We show that this matrix is totally positive and that the sequence of its row-generating polynomials is coefficientwise Hankel-totally positive. We then generalize to polynomials $t_{n,k}(y,z)$ that count improper and proper edges, and further to polynomials $t_{n,k}(y,\mathbf{\phi})$ in infinitely many indeterminates that give a weight $y$ to each improper edge and a weight $m! \, \phi_m$ for each vertex with $m$ proper children. We show that if the weight sequence $\mathbf{\phi}$ is Toeplitz-totally positive, then the two foregoing total-positivity results continue to hold. Our proofs use production matrices and exponential Riordan arrays.</description>

      <title>The structure of quasi-transitive graphs avoiding a minor with applications to the domino problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01823v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An infinite graph is quasi-transitive if its vertex set has finitely many orbits under the action of its automorphism group. In this paper we obtain a structure theorem for locally finite quasi-transitive graphs avoiding a minor, which is reminiscent of the Robertson-Seymour Graph Minor Structure Theorem. We prove that every locally finite quasi-transitive graph $G$ avoiding a minor has a tree-decomposition whose torsos are finite or planar; moreover the tree-decomposition is canonical, i.e. invariant under the action of the automorphism group of $G$. As applications of this result, we prove the following.
  * Every locally finite quasi-transitive graph attains its Hadwiger number, that is, if such a graph contains arbitrarily large clique minors, then it contains an infinite clique minor. This extends a result of Thomassen (1992) who proved it in the 4-connected case and suggested that this assumption could be omitted.
  * Locally finite quasi-transitive graphs avoiding a minor are accessible (in the sense of Thomassen and Woess), which extends known results on planar graphs to any proper minor-closed family.
  * Minor-excluded finitely generated groups are accessible (in the group-theoretic sense) and finitely presented, which extends classical results on planar groups.
  * The domino problem is decidable in a minor-excluded finitely generated group if and only if the group is virtually free, which proves the minor-excluded case of a conjecture of Ballier and Stein (2018).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interior polynomial of a directed graph is defined as the $h^*$-polynomial of the graph's (extended) root polytope, and it displays several attractive properties. Here we express its degree in terms of the minimum cardinality of a directed join, and give a formula for the leading coefficient. We present natural generalizations of these results to oriented regular matroids; in the process we also give a facet description for the extended root polytope of a regular oriented matroid.
  By duality, our expression for the degree of the interior polynomial implies a formula for the degree of the parking function enumerator of an Eulerian directed graph (which is equivalent to the greedoid polynomial of the corresponding branching greedoid). We extend that result to obtain the degree of the parking function enumerator of an arbitrary rooted directed graph in terms of the minimum cardinality of a certain type of feedback arc set.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional polynomial patterns over finite fields: bounds, counting estimates and Gowers norm control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine multidimensional polynomial progressions involving linearly independent polynomials in finite fields, proving power saving bounds for sets lacking such configurations. This jointly generalises earlier results of Peluse (for the single dimensional case) and the author (for distinct degree polynomials). In contrast to the cases studied in the aforementioned two papers, a usual PET induction argument does not give Gowers norm control over multidimensional progressions that involve polynomials of the same degrees. The main challenge is therefore to obtain Gowers norm control, and we accomplish this for all multidimensional polynomial progressions with pairwise independent polynomials. The key inputs are: (1) a quantitative version of a PET induction scheme developed in ergodic theory by Donoso, Koutsogiannis, Ferr\'e-Moragues and Sun, (2) a quantitative concatenation result for Gowers box norms in arbitrary finite abelian groups, motivated by earlier results of Tao, Ziegler, Peluse and Prendiville; (3) an adaptation to combinatorics of the box norm smoothing technique, recently developed in the ergodic setting by the author and Frantzikinakis; and (4) a new version of the multidimensional degree lowering argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A linear graph code is a family $\mathcal{C}$ of graphs on $n$ vertices with the property that the symmetric difference of the edge sets of any two graphs in $\mathcal{C}$ is also the edge set of a graph in $\mathcal{C}$. In this article, we investigate the maximal size of a linear graph code that does not contain a copy of a fixed graph $H$. In particular, we show that if $H$ has an even number of edges, the size of the code is $O(2^{\binom{n}{2}}/\log n)$, making progress on a question of Alon. Furthermore, we show that for almost all graphs $H$ with an even number of edges, there exists $\varepsilon_H&gt;0$ such that the size of a linear graph code without a copy of $H$ is at most $2^{\binom{n}{2}}/n^{\varepsilon_H}$.</description>

      <title>A near-optimal zero-free disk for the Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The partition function of the Ising model of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is defined as $Z_{\text{Ising}}(G;b)=\sum_{\sigma:V\to \{0,1\}} b^{m(\sigma)}$, where $m(\sigma)$ denotes the number of edges $e=\{u,v\}$ such that $\sigma(u)=\sigma(v)$. We show that for any positive integer $\Delta$ and any graph $G$ of maximum degree at most $\Delta$, $Z_{\text{Ising}}(G;b)\neq 0$ for all $b\in \mathbb{C}$ satisfying $|\frac{b-1}{b+1}| \leq \frac{1-o_\Delta(1)}{\Delta-1}$ (where $o_\Delta(1) \to 0$ as $\Delta\to \infty$). This is optimal in the sense that $\tfrac{1-o_\Delta(1)}{\Delta-1}$ cannot be replaced by $\tfrac{c}{\Delta-1}$ for any constant $c &gt; 1$ subject to a complexity theoretic assumption.
  To prove our result we use a standard reformulation of the partition function of the Ising model as the generating function of even sets. We establish a zero-free disk for this generating function inspired by techniques from statistical physics on partition functions of a polymer models. Our approach is quite general and we discuss extensions of it to a certain types of polymer models.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Gamma_k(V)$ be the Grassmann graph whose vertex set ${\mathcal G}_{k}(V)$ is formed by all $k$-dimensional subspaces of an $n$-dimensional vector space $V$ over the finite field $F_q$ consisting of $q$ elements. We discuss its subgraph $\Gamma(n,k)_q$ with the vertex set ${\mathcal C}(n,k)_q$ consisting of all non-degenerate linear $[n, k]_q$ codes. %We assume that $1&lt;k&lt;n-1$. We study maximal cliques $\langle U]^{c}_{k}$ of $\Gamma(n,k)_q$, which are intersections of tops of $\Gamma_k(V)$ with ${\mathcal C}(n,k)_q$. We show when they are contained in a line of ${\mathcal G}_{k}(V)$ and then we prove that $\langle U]^{c}_{k}$ is a maximal clique of $\Gamma(n,k)_q$ when it is not contained in a line of ${\mathcal G}_{k}(V)$. Furthermore, we show that the automorphism group of the set of such maximal cliques is isomorphic with the automorphism group of $\Gamma(n,k+1)_{q}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given integers $n &gt; k &gt; 0$, and a set of integers $L \subset [0, k-1]$, an \emph{$L$-system} is a family of sets $\mathcal{F} \subset \binom{[n]}{k}$ such that $|F \cap F'| \in L$ for distinct $F, F'\in \mathcal{F}$. $L$-systems correspond to independent sets in a certain generalized Johnson graph $G(n, k, L)$, so that the maximum size of an $L$-system is equivalent to finding the independence number of the graph $G(n, k, L)$. The \emph{Lov\'asz number} $\vartheta(G)$ is a semidefinite programming approximation of the independence number $\alpha$ of a graph $G$.
  In this paper, we determine the leading order term of $\vartheta(G(n, k, L))$ of any generalized Johnson graph with $k$ and $L$ fixed and $n\rightarrow \infty$. As an application of this theorem, we give an explicit construction of a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with a large gap between the Lov\'asz number and the Shannon capacity $c(G)$. Specifically, we prove that for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, for sufficiently large $n$ there is a generalized Johnson graph $G$ on $n$ vertices which has ratio $\vartheta(G)/c(G) = \Omega(n^{1-\epsilon})$, which improves on all known constructions. The graph $G$ \textit{a fortiori} also has ratio $\vartheta(G)/\alpha(G) = \Omega(n^{1-\epsilon})$, which greatly improves on the best known explicit construction.</description>

  Second, we prove that every two PL homeomorphic polyhedra have a common stellar subdivisions, as conjectured by Alexander in~1930.</description>

      <title>A congruential recurrence characterizes the inverses of S\'{o}s permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a proof of the three gaps theorem, a class of permutations known as the S\'{o}s permutations was introduced. It is known that a S\'{o}s permutation, as a sequence, satisfies a certain recurrence (S\'{o}s's recurrence), however, whether the converse holds remains unknown. On the other hand, the inverses of S\'{o}s permutations have been studied also. It has been reported that such a permutation satisfies a congruential recurrence as a sequence. The converse problem of this fact, i.e., whether a permutation satisfying the congruential recurrence is the inverse of a S\'{o}s permutation, is also unsolved, except for a finite number of the degrees of the permutations. This paper relates the set of permutations satisfying the congruential recurrence to other sets of permutations and gives upper bounds for their cardinalities. The upper bounds are in fact tight. In particular, the set of permutations satisfying the congruential recurrence has the same cardinality as that of S\'{o}s permutations, giving the affirmative answer to the above unsolved problem as a corollary. As another corollary, it is shown that all permutation, which is regarded as a congruential quasi-progression of diameter 1 in that the set formed by the first order differences modulo the degree of the permutation is a singleton or a set of two successive integers, is the inverse of a S\'{o}s permutation with an elementary operation called as shift applied. As an application of these facts, we present a procedure that lifts the set of the inverses of the S\'{o}s permutations of a given degree to the set of the same kind with the degree increased by one, without referring to the underlying parameters defining the S\'{o}s permutations or the Farey sequence associated to them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.09993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The independence number of a tree decomposition is the maximum of the independence numbers of the subgraphs induced by its bags. The tree-independence number of a graph is the minimum independence number of a tree decomposition of it. Several NP-hard graph problems, like maximum weight independent set, can be solved in time n^{O(k)} if the input n-vertex graph is given together with a tree decomposition of independence number k. Yolov in [SODA 2018] gave an algorithm that given an n-vertex graph G and an integer k, in time n^{O(k^3)} either constructs a tree decomposition of G whose independence number is O(k^3) or correctly reports that the tree-independence number of G is larger than k.
  In this paper, we first give an algorithm for computing the tree-independence number with a better approximation ratio and running time and then prove that our algorithm is, in some sense, the best one can hope for. More precisely, our algorithm runs in time 2^{O(k^2)} n^{O(k)} and either outputs a tree decomposition of G with independence number at most 8k, or determines that the tree-independence number of G is larger than k. This implies 2^{O(k^2)} n^{O(k)}-time algorithms for various problems, like maximum weight independent set, parameterized by the tree-independence number k without needing the decomposition as an input. Assuming Gap-ETH, an n^{\Omega(k)} factor in the running time is unavoidable for any approximation algorithm for the tree-independence number.
  Our second result is that the exact computation of the tree-independence number is para-NP-hard: We show that for every constant k \ge 4 it is NP-hard to decide if a given graph has the tree-independence number at most k.</description>

Abstract: Given some binary matrix $M$, suppose we are presented with the collection of its rows and columns in independent arbitrary orderings. From this information, are we able to recover the unique original orderings and matrix? We present an algorithm that identifies whether there is a unique ordering associated with a set of rows and columns, and outputs either the unique correct orderings for the rows and columns or the full collection of all valid orderings and valid matrices. We show that there is a constant $c &gt; 0$ such that the algorithm terminates in $O(n^2)$ time with high probability and in expectation for random $n \times n$ binary matrices with i.i.d.\ Bernoulli $(p)$ entries $(m_{ij})_{ij=1}^n$ such that $\frac{c\log^2(n)}{n(\log\log(n))^2} \leq p \leq \frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Limit Laws for Critical Dispersion on Complete Graphs</title>

Abstract: We consider a synchronous process of particles moving on the vertices of a graph $G$, introduced by Cooper, McDowell, Radzik, Rivera and Shiraga (2018). Initially, $M$ particles are placed on a vertex of $G$. In subsequent time steps, all particles that are located on a vertex inhabited by at least two particles jump independently to a neighbour chosen uniformly at random. The process ends at the first step when no vertex is inhabited by more than one particle; we call this (random) time step the dispersion time.
  In this work we study the case where $G$ is the complete graph on $n$ vertices and the number of particles is $M=n/2+\alpha n^{1/2} + o(n^{1/2})$, $\alpha\in \mathbb{R}$. This choice of $M$ corresponds to the critical window of the process, with respect to the dispersion time. We show that the dispersion time, if rescaled by $n^{-1/2}$, converges in $p$-th mean, as $n\rightarrow \infty$ and for any $p \in \mathbb{R}$, to a continuous and almost surely positive random variable $T_\alpha$. We find that $T_\alpha$ is the absorption time of a standard logistic branching process, thoroughly investigated by Lambert (2005), and we determine its expectation. In particular, in the middle of the critical window we show that $\mathbb{E}[T_0] = \pi^{3/2}/\sqrt{7}$, and furthermore we formulate explicit asymptotics when $|\alpha|$ gets large that quantify the transition into and out of the critical window. We also study the random variable counting the total number of jumps that are performed by the particles until the dispersion time is reached and prove that, if rescaled by $n\ln n$, it converges to $2/7$ in probability.</description>
