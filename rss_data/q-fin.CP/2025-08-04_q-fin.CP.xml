      <title>ContestTrade: A Multi-Agent Trading System Based on Internal Contest Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In financial trading, large language model (LLM)-based agents demonstrate significant potential. However, the high sensitivity to market noise undermines the performance of LLM-based trading systems. To address this limitation, we propose a novel multi-agent system featuring an internal competitive mechanism inspired by modern corporate management structures. The system consists of two specialized teams: (1) Data Team - responsible for processing and condensing massive market data into diversified text factors, ensuring they fit the model's constrained context. (2) Research Team - tasked with making parallelized multipath trading decisions based on deep research methods. The core innovation lies in implementing a real-time evaluation and ranking mechanism within each team, driven by authentic market feedback. Each agent's performance undergoes continuous scoring and ranking, with only outputs from top-performing agents being adopted. The design enables the system to adaptively adjust to dynamic environment, enhances robustness against market noise and ultimately delivers superior trading performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system significantly outperforms prevailing multiagent systems and traditional quantitative investment methods across diverse evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Decision by Supervised Learning with Deep Ensembles: A Practical Framework for Robust Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13544v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Decision by Supervised Learning (DSL), a practical framework for robust portfolio optimization. DSL reframes portfolio construction as a supervised learning problem: models are trained to predict optimal portfolio weights, using cross-entropy loss and portfolios constructed by maximizing the Sharpe or Sortino ratio. To further enhance stability and reliability, DSL employs Deep Ensemble methods, substantially reducing variance in portfolio allocations. Through comprehensive backtesting across diverse market universes and neural architectures, shows superior performance compared to both traditional strategies and leading machine learning-based methods, including Prediction-Focused Learning and End-to-End Learning. We show that increasing the ensemble size leads to higher median returns and more stable risk-adjusted performance. The code is available at https://github.com/DSLwDE/DSLwDE.</description>
