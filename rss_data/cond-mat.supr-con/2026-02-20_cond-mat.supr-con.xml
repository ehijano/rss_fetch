      <title>3D Unconventional Superconductivity in Bulk LaO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lanthanum-based compounds are cornerstones of superconductivity research, yet the La-5d orbitals typically remain empty spectator states far above the Fermi level (EF). While superconductivity has been induced in LaO up to 5.37 K in tensile epitaxy films, the intrinsic ground state of the bulk phase has remained controversial mostly due to synthetic challenges, with early reports suggesting a metallic nature. Here we report the high-pressure and high-temperature synthesis of pure bulk rock-salt LaO and unveil its intrinsic type-II superconductivity with a transition temperature (TC) of ~6 K at ambient pressure. The bulk TC is further enhanced to 6.9 K in La1-xYxO at x = 0.10, where Y doping leads to lattice contraction (chemical pressing) and a remarkable increase in electron carrier concentration. Strikingly, applying physical pressure further enhances the TC to a maximum of 12.7 K at 20 GPa, the highest TC in lanthanum monochalcogenides LaX (X = S, Se, Te, and O) to date. This pressure dependence is diametrically opposed to the behavior observed in films, and occurs despite a pressure-induced reduction in the density of states at EF - a trend that sharply contradicts the conventional phonon-mediated BCS mechanism. Our first-principles calculations reveal that compressive strain modifies the crystal field splitting to enhance La-5d/O-2p hybridization, fostering a three-dimensional multi-pocket Fermi surface favorable for spin/orbital fluctuation-mediated pairing. This work clarifies the intrinsic superconductivity of bulk LaO and provides a foundation for designing new rare-earth-based superconductors with higher TC</description>

      <title>BaFe2Se3 a quasi-unidimensional non-centrosymmetric superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-ladder compounds of the BaFe2X3 (X = chalcogen) family may be viewed as dimensional reductions (along stripe-like motifs) of the two-dimensional iron-based pnictide planes extensively studied since 2006. Remarkably, despite their reduced dimensionality, these materials retain the capacity for unconventional ground states, exemplified by the emergence of superconductivity in \bfse\ under applied pressure beyond 10 GPa, following a structural phase transition at 4 GPa. Here, we report a comprehensive investigation combining high-resolution single-crystal X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and ab initio calculations, which together elucidate the true crystallographic nature of this pressure-induced superconducting phase. While X-ray diffraction alone reveals a symmetry lowering from the widely accepted orthorhombic Cmcm group to a monoclinic structure, it lacks sufficient sensitivity to resolve the precise space group. By integrating vibrational spectroscopy with density functional theory, we provide unambiguous evidence that the high-pressure phase is non-centrosymmetric, adopting the polar space group P2_1. These findings not only revise the structural assignment of \bfse\ in its superconducting state but also establish its non-centrosymmetric character (an essential ingredient for potential unconventional pairing mechanisms- thereby opening new perspectives on the interplay between lattice symmetry, dimensionality, and superconductivity in iron-based materials.</description>

      <title>Power attenuation in millimeter-wave and terahertz superconducting rectangular waveguides: linear response, TLS loss, and Higgs-mode nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting waveguides are a promising platform for ultralow-loss transmission in the millimeter-wave to terahertz band under cryogenic conditions, with potential applications in astronomical instrumentation and emerging quantum technologies. We develop a framework, based on microscopic superconductivity theory, to evaluate the power-flow attenuation constant $\alpha$ of superconducting rectangular waveguides in the $100~\mathrm{GHz}$--THz range, applicable to arbitrary electronic mean free paths $\ell$ from the dirty limit $\ell\ll\xi_0$ to the clean limit $\ell\gg\xi_0$. We also derive an analytical expression for two-level-system (TLS)-induced attenuation $\alpha_{\rm TLS}$ in thin native oxide layers within the standard TLS model. Using this framework, we perform numerical evaluations of $\alpha$ for representative materials over standard waveguide sizes from WR15 to WR1. In the high-frequency regime $f \gtrsim 0.5 \Delta/h$, low attenuation favors the clean regime $\ell\gtrsim\xi_0$, indicating that high-purity materials can achieve very low attenuation below their gap frequency. For the TLS contribution, using parameter values representative of native Nb oxides, we find that $\alpha_{\rm TLS}$ can become relevant at sufficiently low temperatures $T/T_c\lesssim 0.1$-0.2, where quasiparticle dissipation is exponentially suppressed. Finally, we extend the discussion to the strong-excitation regime using a recently developed nonlinear-response theory within the Keldysh--Usadel framework of nonequilibrium superconductivity and show that nonlinear dissipation produces a Higgs-mode peak in $\alpha$ near $f\simeq \Delta/h$ via a Kerr-type nonlinearity of the dissipative conductivity. This peak provides a distinct hallmark of the Higgs mode that has been largely overlooked so far.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical theory for the orbital magnetic moment of superconducting quasiparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the orbital magnetic moment of Bogoliubov quasiparticles in superconductors with the semiclassical approach. We derive the orbital magnetic moment of a quasiparticle wavepacket by considering the energy correction of the wavepacket to the linear order of the magnetic field. The semiclassical result is further verified by a linear response calculation with a full quantum mechanical method. From the analytical expression we find that nontrivial structure in the superconducting pairing gap alone is unable to produce quasiparticle orbital magnetic moment, which is in sharp contrast to the behavior of quasiparticle Berry curvatures. We apply the formula to study a tight-binding model with chiral $d$-wave superconducting gap, and show the influence of orbital magnetic moment on the energy spectrum and local density of states. We also calculate the orbital Nernst effect driven by the interplay between the orbital magnetic moment and the Berry curvature of Bogoliubov quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Fractional $1/3$ quantum vortices in chiral $d+id$ kagome superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a theoretical investigation of the nature of vortices in chiral $d+id$ superconductors on the kagome lattice. The study is motivated by recent experimental developments reporting evidence of time-reversal symmetry breaking in the superconducting state of kagome metals. Using self-consistent microscopic calculations that incorporate the characteristics of the band structure of the kagome lattice, we find that fractional vortices permeate the ground state condensate in the presence of an external field. Each fractional vortex carries one third of the superconducting flux quantum and exhibits a characteristic signature related to one of the three sublattice degrees of freedom of the kagome lattice. We discuss the relevance of these results to recent experimental studies of kagome superconductors in the presence of an external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>High-temperature $\eta$-pairing superconductivity in the photodoped Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate superconductivity emerging in the photodoped Mott insulating Hubbard model using steady-state dynamical mean-field theory implemented on the real-frequency axis. By employing high-order strong-coupling impurity solvers, we obtain the nonequilibrium phase diagram for photoinduced $\eta$-pairing superconductivity with a remarkably high effective critical temperature. We further identify a superconducting gap in the momentum-resolved spectral function and optical conductivity, providing spectroscopic signatures accessible to experiments. Our results highlight a route to a controllable form of high-temperature superconductivity in nonequilibrium strongly correlated systems, fundamentally distinct from the equilibrium $s$-wave pairing state in the attractive Hubbard model or cuprate-like $d$-wave superconductors.</description>

      <title>Near-single-domain superconducting aluminum films on GaAs(111)A with exceptional crystalline quality for scalable quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have reproducibly grown near-single-domain superconducting aluminum (Al) films on GaAs(111)A wafers using molecular beam epitaxy. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction revealed twin-domain ratios of 0.00005 and 0.0003 for 19.4-nm- and 9.6-nm-thick films, respectively-the lowest reported for Al on any substrate and long considered unattainable for practical device platforms. Azimuthal scans across off-normal Al{$11\bar{1}$} reflections exhibit narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) values down to $0.55^\circ$, unmatched by epi-Al grown by any other method. Normal scans showed a well-defined (111) orientation with pronounced Pendell\"osung fringes, and $\theta$-rocking-curve FWHM values down to $0.018^\circ$; the former indicates abrupt film-substrate and oxide-film interfaces. Electron backscatter diffraction mapping confirms macroscopic in-plane uniformity and the absence of $\Sigma$3 twin domains. Atomic force microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy confirmed atomically smooth surfaces and abrupt heterointerfaces. The films exhibit critical temperatures approaching bulk values, establishing a materials platform for scalable, high-coherence superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Orbital current signature using neutron diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the hallmarks of orbital loop currents in various correlated electron materials and how they have been evidenced using polarized neutron diffraction. Over the last 20 years, loop current signatures have been observed in high temperature copper oxide superconductors, iridates, copper oxides spin ladders and recently kagome vanadate superconductors. Such currents induce orbital magnetic moments within the unit cell of these quantum materials that can be detected through their interaction with the neutron spin. In addition to the usual description of orbital moments using point-like local magnetic moments, we here show an alternative description of the neutron magnetic cross-section involving the microscopic currents running between different atomic orbitals. We discuss the corresponding magnetic structure factors and the resulting quantitative differences between both approaches.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Multimodal Superfluidity of Neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present theoretical and experimental evidence for a new phase of matter in neutron-rich systems that we call multimodal superfluidity. Using ab initio lattice calculations, we show that the condensate consists of coexisting s-wave pairs, p-wave pairs in entangled double pair combinations, and quartets composed of bound states of two s-wave pairs. We identify multimodal superfluidity as a general feature of single-flavor spin-1/2 fermionic systems with attractive s-wave and p-wave interactions, provided the system is stable against collapse into a dense droplet. Beyond neutrons at sub-saturation densities, we demonstrate that this phase appears in generalized attractive extended Hubbard models in one, two, and three dimensions. We elucidate the mechanism for this coexistence using self-consistent few-body Cooper models and compare with Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. We also derive the form of the effective action and show that spin, rotational, and parity symmetries remain unbroken. Finally, we analyze experimental data to show that p-wave pair gaps and quartet gaps are present in atomic nuclei, and we discuss the consequences of this new phase for the structure and dynamics of neutron star crusts.</description>

      <title>Doping-induced evolution of the intrinsic hump and dip energies dependent on the sample fabrication conditions in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In oxygen-doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$, the spectra, as observed by tunneling or photoemission spectroscopic measurements, depend on the sample fabrication conditions, such as the temperature and pressure for fabricating the junction or surface. This implies that the hump and dip energies extracted from the spectra depend on the sample fabrication conditions. When the samples were fabricated at 4.2 K and/or under ultra-high vacuum (UHV), the hump energy exhibited a new step-like doping dependence and the dip energy followed the upper pseudo-gap line. As the fabrication conditions deteriorated, the hump and dip energies reproduced the previous results, in that the dip energy was significantly dependent on the sample, whereas the hump energy exhibited a smooth doping dependence. It can be concluded that the observations for the samples fabricated at 4.2 K and/or under UHV reflect the intrinsic bulk properties, whereas those for the samples fabricated under deteriorated conditions reflect degraded surface properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic nematic and smectic liquid crystals are spontaneous symmetry-breaking phases that are seen to precede or coexist with enigmatic unconventional superconducting states in multiple classes of materials. In this Letter we describe scanning tunneling microscopy observations of a short ranged charge stripe (smectic) order in NaAlSi, whose superconductivity is speculated to have an unconventional origin. As well as this we resolve a clear spatial modulation of the superconducting gap amplitude, which arises due to the intertwined superconducting and smectic orders. Numerical calculations help to understand the possible driving mechanism as a suppression of kinetic energy on the Fermi surface formed in part by two large, flat-topped hole pockets of p-orbital character.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Majorana Zero Modes in Topological Superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45 with Machine-Learning-Assisted Spectral Deconvolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unambiguous identification of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in topological superconductors (TSCs) remains a challenge due to complex in-gap states that can also produce zero-bias conductance peaks (ZBPs). Here we demonstrate a data-driven workflow that integrates pixel-wise spectral deconvolution with machine-learning (ML) to analyze tunneling spectroscopy from FeTe0.55Se0.45, an intrinsic TSC. Based on the local density of states (LDOS) spectra acquired with a millikelvin scanning tunneling microscope under magnetic fields, each spectrum was decomposed into multiple Lorentzian peaks. The extracted peak parameters were assembled into a structured feature set and subsequently embedded and clustered with unsupervised ML algorithms. ML-based clustering identified distinct classes of LDOS spectra, separating superconductor vortices exhibiting ZBPs consistent with established characteristics of MZMs from vortices displaying ZBP-mimicking features of trivial origin. Furthermore, spatially resolved ZBP distributions differentiate isotropic vortex cores with well-defined ZBPs from vortices that exhibit locally distorted ZBPs. By comparing the ZBP distributions to defect locations measured without magnetic field, we found a correlation between local heterogeneity and the ZBP formation, necessitating the systematic, data-driven analysis to disentangle genuine MZM signatures in TSC. This objective and reproducible workflow advances reliable MZM detection in TSCs, providing a foundation for MZM manipulation towards quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Uniaxial stress enhanced anisotropic magnetoresistance and superconductivity in the kagome superconductor LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elucidating the role of the kagome electronic structure in determining the various quantum ground states is of fundamental importance. In this work, we employ in-plane uniaxial stress as a tuning parameter to probe the electronic structure and its impact on the superconducting and normal-state properties of the kagome superconductor LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$, combining magnetotransport measurements with first-principles calculations. We identify a pronounced anisotropy in both the upper critical field and the normal-state magnetoresistance, indicating strong electronic anisotropy despite the three-dimensional crystal structure. Furthermore, we find that the superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ increases under in-plane stress applied within the kagome plane, although the enhancement is modest, reaching approximately 0.3 K at 0.6 GPa. Furthermore, the absolute magnetoresistance exhibits a pronounced increase from about 22${\%}$ at zero stress to 35${\%}$ at 0.6 GPa, indicating a substantial modification of the normal state above $T_{\rm c}$. Previous studies have reported time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) breaking below a temperature scale that coincides with the onset of magnetoresistance. The simultaneous enhancement of both $T_{\rm c}$ and magnetoresistance under stress therefore suggests a positive correlation between superconductivity and normal-state electronic and magnetic properties in LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$. Detailed calculations demonstrate that stress-induced changes in $T_{\rm c}$ arise from the joint evolution of the total density of states and the flat band, whereas the large magnetoresistance enhancement is dominated by the stress-driven downward shift of the Ru $dz^{2}$ kagome flat band.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by recent studies on superconducting (SC) diode nonreciprocity, we uncover an unexpected hierarchy of SC-phase decoherence in bilayer superconductors hosting both interlayer Josephson coupling and a Josephson diode effect. Contrary to the conventional single-energy-scale paradigm where Josephson coherence and diode nonreciprocity vanish simultaneously at the SC gap-closing temperature, we demonstrate, using a self-consistent microscopic theory incorporating phase fluctuations, that the system undergoes a sequence of distinct thermal crossovers upon heating: the diode effect disappears first at $T_{\eta}$, Josephson coherence is subsequently lost at $T_c$, and the SC gap collapses only at a higher temperature $T_s$. Rather than a direct SC-normal transition, the system thus evolves through successive nonreciprocal, reciprocal, and incoherent Josephson regimes before entering the normal state. Counterintuitively, the separation between these regimes is governed not only by interlayer coupling, but also sensitively by in-plane disorder and carrier density. These findings point to a generic hierarchy of SC decoherence in low-dimensional Josephson systems, and suggest broader relevance to layered superconductors, including cuprates and recently discovered nickelates, as well as to SC qubits.</description>

      <title>Predicted third-order sweet spots for phi-junction Josephson parametric amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire Josephson junctions exhibit skewed and phi-shifted current phase relations when an in-plane magnetic field is applied along the weak link's spin-orbit effective field direction. These junctions can have an asymmetric Josephson potential with odd-order nonlinearities. A dominant third-order nonlinearity can be achieved by tuning the magnetic field to a sweet spot. Sweet spots persist when higher order Josephson harmonics are included. This makes it possible to have a single Josephson junction dipole element with three-wave mixing capability, which is favorable for pump-efficient amplification. Electrostatic gate tunability of the semiconductor weak link can make it operable within an extended range of working frequencies, and the inclusion of micromagnets can facilitate near-zero magnetic field operation.</description>
