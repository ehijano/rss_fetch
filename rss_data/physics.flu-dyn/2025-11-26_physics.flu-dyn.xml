      <title>Modeling of turbulence kinetic energy added by wind-turbine wakes in the atmospheric boundary layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) added by wind-turbine wakes is of significant scientific value for understanding the wake recovery mechanisms. Furthermore, this physical quantity is a critical input for engineering applications. In this study, we propose a novel wake-added TKE prediction model capable of accurately predict the three-dimensional spatial distribution of wake-added TKE using only basic inflow and wind turbine operation conditions as inputs. The model consists of two sub-modules: one for calculating the azimuthally-averaged wake-added TKE and the other for determining the ground effect correction function. The calculation of the azimuthally-averaged wake-added TKE is based on the analytical solution derived from the corresponding wake-added TKE budget, while the ground effect correction function is determined using a unified functional form, owing to its self-similarity. To ensure the closure of these two sub-modules, we develop methods for determining all free parameters based on the large-eddy simulation (LES) cases. This results in an end-to-end prediction framework, enabling direct engineering applications of the proposed model. We compared the proposed model with LES calibration data and publicly available validation datasets from the literature, which include LES and wind tunnel experiments under various inflow and turbine operating conditions. The comparison results show that the proposed model can accurately predict the spatial distribution of wake-added TKE, particularly capturing the vertical asymmetry of wake-added TKE and the streamwise evolution of the hub-height wake-added TKE profile. The averaged normalized mean absolute error of the proposed model across all validation datasets is only 8.13%, demonstrating its robustness and broad applicability.</description>

      <title>Simulating droplet adhesion on superhydrophobic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical model is proposed to simulate the adhesion, compression, and subsequent detachment of a micro-liter droplet from a superhydrophobic surface composed of chemically homogeneous pillars arranged in a periodic fashion, replicating a typical force probe microscopy experiment. We observe that as the droplet is pulled away from the surface, the net vertical force varies in a typical sawtooth manner with peculiar peaks and troughs, characteristic of the surface. The force first reaches a maximum before the droplet detaches from the surface with a comparatively lower force. The force variation predicted by the numerical model is in good agreement with the experimental results of Kumar et al. [1]. We also studied the effect of evaporation on the variation in the adhesion force by simulating an evaporating droplet on a superhydrophobic surface. For an evaporating droplet, the numerically predicted maximum and detachment force magnitudes are in good agreement with those obtained experimentally when we take into account the change in the droplet weight as it evaporates. The proposed method will be useful for the quantitative analysis and design of a variety of superhydrophobic surfaces and will pave the way for more accurate surface characterization based on droplet adhesion force measurements.</description>

      <title>Probing superhydrophobic surface topography using droplet adhesion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding contact line dynamics on superhydrophobic surfaces with microscopic structures is essential for designing materials with reduced drag, anti-icing, self-cleaning, and anti-fouling properties. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that forces on droplets receding over structured surfaces are governed by microscale deformations near the contact line. We present and experimentally validate an expression demonstrating that adhesion force increases logarithmically with pillar area fraction at constant droplet volume and pillar surface chemistry. Furthermore, we establish that the average tensile force measured in direct force measurements provides a more reliable indicator of surface structure than the commonly used maximum force. This newfound insight enables precise quantification of superhydrophobic surface structure using a droplet probe.</description>

      <title>Fusion of Simulation and Experiment Data for Hypersonic Flow Field Prediction via Pre-Training and Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of hypersonic flow fields over a compression ramp is critical for aerodynamic design but remains challenging due to the scarcity of experimental measurements such as velocity. This study systematically develops a data fusion framework to address this issue. In the first phase, a model trained solely on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) data establishes a baseline for flow field prediction. The second phase demonstrates that enriching the training with both CFD and experimental data significantly enhances predictive accuracy: errors in pressure and density are reduced to 12.6% and 7.4%, respectively. This model also captures key flow features such as separation and reattachment shocks more distinctly. Physical analyses based on this improved model, including investigations into ramp angle effects and global stability analysis, confirm its utility for efficient design applications. In the third phase, a pre-trained model (using only CFD data) is successfully fine-tuned with experimental schlieren images, effectively reconstructing velocity fields and validating the transferability of the approach. This step-wise methodology demonstrates the effectiveness of combining simulation and experiment by pre-training and fine-tuning, offering a robust and efficient pathway for hypersonic flow modeling in real-world.</description>

      <title>Implications of the Four-Color Theorem on the Dynamics of N-Component Phase Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study phase separation dynamics of $N &gt;2$ immiscible fluid components. In two-dimensions, as a consequence of four-color theorem in mathematics, there is a change in topological constraints for $N = 3$ and $N \ge 4$ components. This leads to a suppression of hydrodynamics effects and we show that the diffusion-dominated coarsening dynamics for $N \ge 4$ can be collapsed to a single master curve. The behavior extends to thin three-dimensional systems as the fluid domain size reaches the smallest system dimension. However, by varying the fluid interfacial tensions, cloaking may occur, resulting in highly complex coarsening dynamics that can differ for each component. In full three-dimensional cases, the absence of four-color theorem (or its equivalent) means that the diffusive scaling law is only reached asymptotically for large $N$ rather than at a certain critical $N$.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulation of the Cleaning Process of Microchannel by an External Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the problem of drift of solid non-interacting particles in a microchannel, which can stick to its walls under the action of the van der Waals forces and break away from the wall due to thermal noise and viscous stresses arising from the flow. The pressure drop is given between the channel inlet and outlet. At the initial moment of time, the channel walls are contaminated with adhered particles, i.e. the walls are uneven, which affects the formation of the flow structure through the channel. Over time, under the action of viscous stresses and thermal noise, the particles break away from the channel walls, causing its cleaning. The interaction of the detached particles with the flow is taken into account in the Stokes approximation. In addition, the model takes into account random particle motion caused by diffusion. The problem is solved numerically within the framework of the random walk model. The evolution of the liquid flow in the channel during its cleaning is obtained: stream function, pressure, and vorticity fields. The dependencies of the volume occupied by settled particles, the flow rate through the channel and the channel gap on time are determined for different values of the interaction force between particles and channel wall. The estimations of the channel cleaning time are obtained and discussed. The possibility of control the cleaning process by the modulation of liquid flux through the channel is investigated. It is shown that resonance phenomena can be observed. The dependencies of cleaning time on the modulation amplitude and frequency is obtained and studied. It is shown that changing the modulation parameters leads to a significant change in the cleaning time and helps control the cleaning process.</description>

      <title>Stood-up drop to measure receding contact angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wetting behavior of drops on natural and industrial surfaces is determined by the advancing and receding contact angles. They are commonly measured by the sessile drop technique, also called goniometry, which doses liquid through a solid needle. Consequently, this method requires substantial drop volumes, long contact times, tends to be user-dependent, and is difficult to automate. Here, we propose the stood-up drop (SUD) technique as an alternative to measure receding contact angles. The method consists of depositing a liquid drop on a surface by a short liquid jet, at which it spreads radially forming a pancake-shaped film. Then the liquid retracts, forming a spherical cap drop shape (stood-up drop). At this quasi-equilibrium state, the contact angle ($\theta_\text{SUD}$) closely resembles the receding contact angle measured by goniometry. Our method is suitable for a wide variety of surfaces from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, overcoming typical complications of goniometry such as needle-induced distortion of the drop shape, and it reduces user dependence. We delineate when the receding contact angle can be obtained by the stood-up method using Volume-of-Fluid (VoF) simulations that systematically vary viscosity, contact angle, and deposited drop volume. Finally, we provide simple scaling criteria to predict when the stood-up drop technique works.</description>

      <title>Morphology of mucus films in lung airways: secretion and ciliary evacuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lung airways are lined by a film of mucus which protects the epithelium from inhaled particles. To maintain a uniform coating, the mucus that is secreted into airways must be distributed into a film by wall-attached cilia, which constantly convey mucus along the airway. However, the film's natural tendency is to accumulate into humps and plugs, due to the Rayleigh-Plateau instability. To understand the behaviour of the film amidst these competing factors, we perform simulations of an idealized tubular airway using a reduced-order thin-film model. The axial boundaries are nonperiodic, allowing for cilia-driven inflow and outflow; a tangential velocity along the tubular wall models ciliary transport, while a localized source at the wall accounts for secretion. On increasing the mucus input rate, we find three distinct film morphologies: (i) uniform flat films; (ii) nonuniform films that are composed of travelling unduloid-shaped humps, separated by mucus-depleted zones; and (iii) films that form an occluding plug. The flat-film regime, absent in closed periodic domains, emerges as a consequence of the convective nature of the Rayleigh-Plateau instability in the presence of ciliary transport. Higher secretion rates increase the mean film-thickness and induce a convective-to-absolute transition, which manifests in the appearance of travelling humps. In the plug-forming regime, capillary forces dominate and drive the incoming mucus into a single hump, which resists ciliary translation and remains near the mucus source. Our results show how low-level baseline secretion sustains a protective, uniform mucus film, and how hypersecretion -- stimulated, for example, by inhaled allergens -- produces mucus plugs.</description>

      <title>A meshless data-tailored approach to compute statistics from scattered data with adaptive radial basis functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constrained radial basis function (RBF) regression has recently emerged as a powerful meshless tool for reconstructing continuous velocity fields from scattered flow measurements, particularly in image-based velocimetry. However, existing formulations based on isotropic kernels often suffer from spurious oscillations in regions with sharp gradients or strong flow anisotropy. This work introduces an anisotropic, gradient-informed, and adaptively sampled extension of the constrained RBF framework for regression of scattered data. Gradient information is estimated via local polynomial regression at collocation points, smoothed, and used to (1) re-sample data, maximizing sampling density near steep gradients while downsampling in smooth regions, and (2) construct a local anisotropic metric that shapes each basis function according to the flow directionality. In addition, a gradient-informed regularization is introduced by embedding observed gradients into the least-squares system as weighted soft constraints. The resulting formulation is fully meshless, linear, and computationally efficient, while significantly improving reconstruction quality in challenging regions. The method is evaluated on both synthetic and experimental datasets, including direct numerical simulation (DNS) data of a turbulent channel and time-resolved particle tracking velocimetry of a turbulent jet. Results show that the proposed approach outperforms isotropic and gradient-free RBF formulations in accuracy, smoothness, and physical consistency -- particularly near shear layers and boundaries -- while reducing the number of bases by an order of magnitude. To support the application, we have created a repository (https://github.com/mendezVKI/SPICY_VKI) that provides access to the investigated datasets.</description>

      <title>Fluid Intelligence: A Forward Look on AI Foundation Models in Computational Fluid Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by the advancement of GPUs and AI, the field of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is undergoing significant transformations. This paper bridges the gap between the machine learning and CFD communities by deconstructing industrial-scale CFD simulations into their core components. Our main contribution is to propose the first scaling law that incorporates CFD inputs for both data generation and model training to outline the unique challenges of developing and deploying these next-generation AI models for complex fluid dynamics problems. Using our new scaling law, we establish quantitative estimates for the large-scale limit, distinguishing between regimes where the cost of data generation is the dominant factor in total compute versus where the cost of model training prevails. We conclude that the incorporation of high-fidelity transient data provides the optimum route to a foundation model. We constrain our theory with concrete numbers, providing the first public estimates on the computational cost and time to build a foundation model for CFD.</description>

      <title>Fast spectral solver for viscoelastic structures under oscillatory flow in free space or wall-bounded domains: applications to quartz crystal microbalance and force spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fast spectral solver for the linear response of viscoelastic structures under oscillatory flow either in free space or close to a flat moving wall. The scheme works in the frequency domain (using phasors) and couples the oscillatory Stokes equation with rigid or flexible structures, modeled by viscoelastic networks of immersed boundary kernels. The fluid-structure coupling can be solved by two routes. One route calculates the hydrodynamic mobility matrix required to solve the equation for the structure deformation rate in matrix form. The second route iteratively solves the coupled fluid-structure equations: fluid-induced forces on the structures create a tension field which is then transferred to the fluid, until convergence. The resulting fixed-point problem is solved iteratively using the Anderson acceleration method. The mobility route is optimal when dealing with one or few structures, while the iterative scheme is preferred for denser dispersions. In any case, the flow resulting from the body forces is solved by a recently developed scheme [J. Fluid. Mech. 1010 A57, 2025] which is spectral in space and time and deals with doubly periodic open domains (either free-space or wall-bounded) where meshing is restricted to the region of interest around the structures. We test the present scheme in two applied contexts: quartz-crystal-microbalance (QCM) of spheres, suspended, adsorbed or tethered to viscoelastic linkers; and force spectroscopy (via atomic force microscopy) reproducing the power spectra of vibrating microparticles near a solid boundary. In all cases, comparisons with analytical, numerical and experimental results show excellent agreement. We conclude by discussing new routes the scheme opens in force spectroscopy and QCM analyses of soft objects.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the role of seepage forces in the acceleration of landslides creep</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of global climate change, geological materials are increasingly destabilized by water flow and infiltration. We study the creeping dynamics of a densely monitored landslide in Western Norway to decipher the role of fluid flow in destabilizing this landslide. In {\AA}knes, approximately 50 million cubic meter of rock mass continuously creeps over a shear zone made of rock fragments, with seasonal accelerations that strongly correlate with rainfall. In this natural laboratory for fluid-induced frictional creep, unprecedented monitoring equipment reveals low fluid pressure across the shear zone, thereby challenging the dominant theory of fluid-driven instability in landslides. Here, we show that a generic micromechanical model can disentangle the effects of fluid flow from those of fluid pressure, and demonstrate that seepage forces applied by channelized flow along the shear zone are the main driver of creep accelerations. We conclude by discussing the significance of seepage forces, the implications for hazard mitigation and the broader applicability of our model to various geological contexts governed by friction across saturated shear zones.</description>

      <title>Periodic extreme rainfall in a warmer climate due to stronger convectively-coupled waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tropical regions may experience periodic extreme precipitation and suffer from associated periodic deluges in a warmer climate. Recent studies conducted small-domain (around 100 km x 100 km) atmospheric model simulations and found that precipitation transitions from a steady state to a periodic oscillation state in a hothouse climate when the sea surface temperature reaches 320-325 K. Here we conduct global-scale atmospheric model simulations with different complexity, and we find that tropical precipitation in convective regions already transitions to a O(10 day) periodic oscillation state with a O(100 mm/day) amplitude at 305-310 K. This temperature is substantially lower than previously reported, and within reach in a century under a high carbon emission scenario. We attribute the onset of the periodic extreme precipitation to the intensification of convectively-coupled waves, which occurs at temperatures much lower than the radiative mechanism responsible for the transition around 320-325 K identified before.</description>

      <title>The modulation of vortex growth by periodic convective activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important process in tropical cyclone formation is the development of a deep, warm core, which corresponds to the growth of a barotropic cyclone. Persistent convective activity is known to be crucial for the growth of barotropic vorticity. However, it remains unclear whether the fluctuating component of convective activity, such as that caused by the diurnal cycle and inertial-gravity waves, also accelerates the vortex development. To investigate this problem, numerical simulations are performed in an axisymmetric model with the Boussinesq approximation on the f-plane. Convection is parameterized with a bulk-plume mass-flux scheme. To represent a mesoscale convective system modulated by the diurnal cycle, periodic convective mass flux is imposed in a local region. The convection induces periodic diabatic heating and convective momentum transfer in the vertical direction (CMT). The CMT is an irreversible effect that breaks the quadrature phase relation between vertical velocity and vertical vorticity, producing a residual barotropic vorticity in each cycle. The barotropic vorticity consists of a barotropic cyclonic core and an anticyclonic shell. The cyclonic core is produced by the vertical advection and stretching of vertical vorticity. The anticyclonic shell is produced by the radial advection and tilting of radial vorticity. The analytical solution reproduces the formation and growth of the core-shell vorticity structure. This research reveals a potential acceleration effect of periodic convective activity on tropical cyclone genesis.</description>

      <title>How elasticity affects bubble pinch-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pinch-off of bubbles in viscoelastic liquids is a fundamental process that has received little attention compared to viscoelastic drop pinch-off. While these processes exhibit qualitative similarities, the dynamics of the pinch-off process are fundamentally different. When a drop of a dilute polymer solution pinches off, a thread is known to develop that prevents breakup due the diverging polymer stresses. Conversely, our experiments reveal that this thread is absent for bubble pinch-off in dilute polymer solutions. We show that a thread becomes apparent only for high polymer concentrations, where the pinch-off dynamics become very sensitive to the size of the needle from which the bubble detaches. The experiments are complemented by numerical simulations and analytical modeling using the Oldroyd-B model, which capture the dilute regime. The model shows that polymer stresses are still singular during bubble pinch-off, but the divergence is much weaker as compared to drop pinch-off. This explains why, in contrast to droplets, viscoelastic bubble-threads do not appear for dilute suspensions but require large polymer concentrations</description>

      <title>An ALE approach to reduce spurious numerical mixing through variational minimizers: application to internal waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spurious numerical mixing is a frequent phenomenon in ocean models. In the present paper, we present an efficient and robust methodology that defines the vertical grid motion so that this mixing is reduced. This motion is defined through the solution of an optimization problem that -using the ideas of the calculus of variations- results in an elliptic equation. This framework is generally applicable to any ocean model that uses an ALE vertical coordinate and can be tuned to fit the modeler's specific needs based on the guidelines presented herein. The method is applied to the nonhydrostatic solver presented by the authors in [Alexandris-Galanopoulos et al., 2024] and its applicability in fully nonlinear internal waves is investigated for the demanding test cases of wave breaking and overturning. These numerical benchmarks show the ability of the method to reduce spurious mixing, while attaining the physical relevancy of the results.</description>

      <title>A finite element method for a non-Newtonian dilute polymer fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the discretisation of a uniaxial (rank-one) reduction of the Oldroyd-B model for dilute polymer solutions, in which the conformation tensor is represented as $\sig = \vec b \otimes \vec b$. Building on structural analogies with MHD, we formulate a finite element framework compatible with the de Rham complex, so that the discrete velocity is exactly divergence-free. The spatial discretisation combines an interior-penalty treatment of viscosity with upwind transport to control stress layers and we prove inf-sup conditions on the mixed pairs. For time-stepping, we design an IMEX scheme that is linear at each step and show well-posedness of the fully discrete problem together with a discrete energy law mirroring the continuum dissipation. Numerical experiments on canonical benchmarks (lid-driven cavity, pipe-with-cavity and $4{:}1$ planar contraction) demonstrate accuracy and robustness for moderate-to-high Weissenberg numbers, capturing sharp stress gradients and corner singularities while retaining the efficiency gains of the uniaxial model. The results indicate that de Rham-compatible discretisations coupled with energy-stable IMEX time integration provide a reliable pathway for viscoelastic computations at elevated elasticity.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Generative Learning Methods for Turbulence Surrogates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of turbulent flows present significant challenges in fluid dynamics due to their complexity and high computational cost. High resolution techniques such as Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) are generally not computationally affordable, particularly for technologically relevant problems. Recent advances in machine learning, specifically in generative probabilistic models, offer promising alternatives as surrogates for turbulence. This paper investigates the application of three generative models - Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) - in simulating a von K\'arm\'an vortex street around a fixed cylinder projected into 2D, as well as a real-world experimental dataset of the wake flow of a cylinder array. Training data was obtained by means of LES in the simulated case and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) in the experimental case. We evaluate each model's ability to capture the statistical properties and spatial structures of the turbulent flow. Our results demonstrate that DDPM and DCGAN effectively replicate all flow distributions, highlighting their potential as efficient and accurate tools for turbulence surrogacy. We find a strong argument for DCGAN, as although they are more difficult to train (due to problems such as mode collapse), they show the fastest inference and training time, require less data to train compared to VAE and DDPM, and provide the results most closely aligned with the input stream. In contrast, VAE train quickly (and can generate samples quickly) but do not produce adequate results, and DDPM, whilst effective, are significantly slower at both, inference and training time.</description>

      <title>Surface instabilities in laminar compressible boundary layers with sublimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface patterns on ablating materials are observed in high-speed ground and flight tests, but the mechanisms behind their formation are not known. In this paper, the origin of surface patterns is investigated via a local linear stability analysis of compressible laminar boundary layers over a flat camphor plate. The effects of sublimation and conjugate heat transfer are included both on the baseflow and the linear fluctuations. This framework identifies one mode that fully characterizes the stability of the surface, which becomes unstable when the wall temperature exceeds that of an adiabatic wall, $T_{ad}$. These findings are consistent with experimental observations, where laminar flow conditions at adiabatic wall temperatures are found to be stable. The analysis also reveals that the nature of this surface mode varies as a function of the oblique angle $\psi = \tan^{-1}{\beta/\alpha}$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the streamwise and spanwise wavenumbers. Specifically, for baseflow temperatures below $\approx 1.15~T_{ad}$, the surface mode is most unstable at $\psi = 0$. Conversely, above $\approx 1.15~T_{ad}$ the surface is most unstable near the sonic angle $\psi_s = \cos^{-1}(1/M_e)$, which is the angle at which the normal Mach number equals one. Finally, a critical wavenumber is identified (i.e., one at which the temporal growth rate reaches a maximum) that is in good agreement with available experimental observations of turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Evidence on the incompatibility of modern smoothed particle hydrodynamics and eddy viscosity models for large eddy simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we will present evidence for the incompatibility of modern Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) methods and eddy viscosity models. Taking a coarse-graining perspective, we physically argue that modern SPH methods operate intrinsically as Lagrangian Large Eddy Simulations (LES) for turbulent flows with strongly overlapping discretization elements. However, these overlapping elements in combination with numerical errors cause a significant amount of implicit subfilter stresses (SFS). Considering a Taylor-Green flow at $Re=10^4$, the SFS will be shown to be relevant where turbulent fluctuations are created, explaining why turbulent flows are challenging even for modern SPH methods. Although one might hope to mitigate the implicit SFS using eddy viscosity models, we show a degradation of the turbulent transition process, which is rooted in the non-locality of these methods.</description>

      <title>Optically-Trapped Particle Tracking Velocimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a microflow velocimetry based on particle tracking with the aid of the optical trapping of tracers, namely, optically-trapped particle tracking velocimetry (ot-PTV). The ot-PTV has two phases: a trap phase, in which individual tracers are trapped by an optical force and held at a measurement position; a release phase, in which the tracer is released and advected by the fluid flow, without interference from the optical force. The released tracer is subsequently trapped again by the optical force. By repeating the set of trap and release phases, we can accumulate the sequential images of the tracer that have the same initial position. The advantages of ot-PTV are that (i) the measurement positions can be chosen by experimenters and (ii) the effect of statistical noise inherent in the Brownian motion of small tracers can be evaluated quantitatively. These features are useful for the analysis of extremely slow microflows, such as near-wall creeping flows, and the flows under some external effects acting on tracers, such as thermally-induced microflows. The concept of ot-PTV is validated using a benchmark experiment, i.e., a pressure-driven flow in a straight microchannel with a square cross-section. An application to thermally-induced microflows is also demonstrated.</description>

      <title>A HHO formulation for variable density incompressible flows where the density is purely advected</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a Hybrid High-Order (HHO) formulation of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations with variable density that provides exact conservation of volume and, accordingly, pure advection of the density variable. The spatial discretization relies on hybrid velocity-density-pressure spaces and the temporal discretization is based on Explicit Singly Diagonal Implicit Runge-Kutta (ESDIRK) methods. The formulation possesses some attractive features that can be fruitfully exploited for the simulation of mixtures of immiscible incompressible fluids, namely: pressure-robustness, conservation of volume enforced cell-by-cell up to machine precision, robustness in the convection dominated regime thanks to upwind stabilizations, weak imposition of boundary conditions, implicit high-order accurate time stepping encompassing unsteady boundary conditions, reduced memory footprint thanks to static condensation, possibility to exploit inherited $p$-multilevel solution strategies to improve performance of iterative solvers. Numerical validation is performed showcasing convergence rates, pressure-robustness and pure advection of the density, thus we tackle the Rayleigh-Taylor instability at Reynolds $1~000$ and $5~000$.</description>

      <title>Performance of an open-source image-based history matching framework for CO$_2$ storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20614v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a history matching (HM) workflow applied to the International FluidFlower benchmark study dataset, which features high-resolution images of CO$_2$ storage in a meter-scale, geologically complex reservoir. The dataset provides dense spatial and temporal observations of fluid displacement, offering a rare opportunity to validate and enhance HM techniques for geological carbon storage (GCS). The combination of detailed experimental data and direct visual observation of flow behavior at this scale is novel and valuable. This study explores the potential and limitations of using experimental data to calibrate standard models for GCS simulation. By leveraging high-resolution images and resulting interpretations of fluid phase distributions, we adjust uncertain parameters and reduce the mismatch between simulation results and observed data. Simulations are performed using the open-source OPM Flow simulator, while the open-source Everest decision-making tool is employed to conduct the HM. After the HM process, the final simulation results show good agreement with the experimental CO$_2$ storage data. This suggests that the system can be effectively described using standard flow equations, conventional saturation functions, and typical PVT properties for CO$_2$-brine mixtures. Our results demonstrate that the Wasserstein distance is a particularly effective metric for matching multi-phase, multi-component flow data. The entire workflow is implemented in a Python package named pofff (Python OPM Flow FluidFlower), which organizes all functionality through a single input file. This design ensures reproducibility and facilitates future extensions of the study.</description>

      <title>An efficient discrete unified gas kinetic scheme for strongly inhomogeneous fluids at the nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The kinetic model with multiple integral terms based on the Enskog-Vlasov(EV) equation is widely employed to describe the inhomogeneous fluids at the nanoscale. However, previous studies have mainly focused on one-dimensional cases, partly due to the significant computational cost $O(NN_{\sigma})$ associated with direct computation of integrals, where $N$ is the number of cells in the flow field and $N_\sigma$ is the number of cells in a cube with a side length equal to the molecular diameter $\sigma$. In this study, we propose a discrete unified gas kinetic scheme (DUGKS) with efficient numerical strategies for integrals to overcome the inefficiency of the direct method, reducing the computational cost to $O(N)$. Both accuracy and efficiency of the proposed DUGKS are assessed through several test cases, including static fluid structures and force-driven flow dynamics in parallel plate channels. As example applications, pressure-driven flow between two flat plates and force-driven flow in a square duct are investigated to highlight distinctive phenomena at the nanoscale.</description>
