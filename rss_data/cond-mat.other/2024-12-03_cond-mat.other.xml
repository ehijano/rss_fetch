      <title>Probing nonlocal correlations in magnetic rare-earth clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and quantifying entanglement entropy is crucial to characterize the quantum behaviors that drive phenomena in a variety of systems. Rare-earth spin complexes, with their unique magnetic properties, provide fertile ground for exploring these nonlocal correlations. In this work, we study Eu$^{2+}$ ions deposited on a Au(111) substrate, modeling finite clusters of large spin-moments using a Heisenberg Hamiltonian parameterized by first-principles calculations. Our analysis reveals a one-to-one correspondence between structures in the differential conductance profiles and changes in the von Neumann entanglement entropy of bipartite subsystems, influenced by probe-ion separation and applied magnetic fields. Distinct braiding patterns in the conductance profiles are shown to correspond to stepwise changes in the entanglement entropy, providing a new avenue for investigating quantum correlations. These results establish a foundation for experimentally probing and controlling entanglement in lanthanide-based systems, with potential applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Software-defined lock-in demodulator for low-frequency resistance noise measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The resolution of low-frequency resistance noise measurements is increased by amplitude modulation, shifting the spectrum of the resistance fluctuations away from the 1/f noise contributed by measurement instruments. However, commercial lock-in amplifiers used for de-modulating the fluctuations exhibit a problematic 1/f noise contribution, which imposes a hard lower limit on the relative resistance noise that can be detected. We replace the lock-in amplifier hardware by equivalent digital signal processing performed using open-source software and inexpensive data acquisition systems. Our solution offers superior low-frequency noise performance with a reduction of the voltage power spectral density by about two orders of magnitude compared to high-end commercial instruments.</description>

      <title>Prediction and observation of topological modes in fractal nonlinear optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This item from the News &amp; Views category, to be published in Light: Science &amp; Applications, aims to provide a summary of theoretical and experimental results recently published in Ref. [24], which demonstrate the creation of corner modes in nonlinear optical waveguides of the higher-order topological-insulator (HOTI) type. Actually, these are second-order HOTIs, in which the transverse dimension of the topologically protected edge modes is smaller than the bulk dimension (it is 2, in the case of optical waveguide) by 2, implying zero dimension of the protected modes, that are actually realized as corner or defect ones. Work [24] reports prediction and creation of various forms of the corner modes in a HOTI with a fractal transverse structure, represented by the Sierpinski gasket (SG). The self-focusing nonlinearity of the waveguide's material transforms the corner modes into corner solitons, almost all of which are stable. The solitons may be attached to external or internal corners created by the underlying SG. This N&amp;V item offers an overview of these new findings reported in Ref. [24] and other recent works, and a brief discussion of directions for the further work on this topic.</description>

      <title>Spontaneously formed phonon frequency combs in van der Waals solid CrXTe$_3$ (X=Ge,Si)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical phonon engineering through nonlinear effects has been utilized in ultrafast control of material properties. However, nonlinear optical phonons typically exhibit rapid decay due to strong mode-mode couplings, limiting their effectiveness in temperature or frequency sensitive applications. In this study, we report the observation of long-lived nonlinear optical phonons through the spontaneous formation of phonon frequency combs in the van der Waals material CrXTe$_3$ (X=Ge, Si) using high-resolution Raman scattering. Unlike conventional optical phonons, the highest $A_g$ mode in CrGeTe$_3$ splits into equidistant, sharp peaks forming a frequency comb that persists for hundreds of oscillations and survives up to 100K before decaying. These modes correspond to localized oscillations of Ge$_2$Te$_6$ clusters, isolated from Cr hexagons, behaving as independent quantum oscillators. Introducing a cubic nonlinear term to the harmonic oscillator model, we simulate the phonon time evolution and successfully replicate the observed comb structure. Similar frequency comb behavior is observed in CrSiTe$_3$, demonstrating the generalizability of this phenomenon. Our findings reveal that Raman scattering effectively probes high-frequency nonlinear phonon modes, providing new insight into generating long-lived, tunable phonon frequency combs with applications in ultrafast material control and phonon-based technologies.</description>
