      <title>Phase transitions at high and low densities for a rotating QCD matter from holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We applied the exact Andreev soft-wall holographic model to investigate phase transitions in rotating strongly interacting matter at high and low densities. Using the dual description of hadronic matter and quark-gluon plasma via thermal and charged black holes in five-dimensional AdS space with cylindrical symmetry, we find that for relativistic rotations exceeding 16\% of the speed of light, crossover transitions emerge in the low-density regime up to a critical baryon chemical potential $\mu_{CPB}$. These smooth transitions, governed by the negative QCD $\beta$-function, describe a mixed phase of confined and deconfined matter with different angular momenta evolving into a pure plasma at very high temperatures. For $\mu \geq \mu_{CPB}$, first-order transitions dominate, following the critical-temperature curve of non-rotating matter. The critical point separating the low-density crossovers from high-density first-order transitions is numerically estimated as $(\mu_{CPB}, T_{CP}) = (363.554, 58.507)\,\text{MeV}$.</description>

      <title>Impact of the in-medium cross section on cluster spectra in ${}^{40,48}\mathrm{Ca}+{}^{58,64}\mathrm{Ni}$ collisions at $56$ and $140$ $\mathbf{\mathrm{MeV}}/\mathrm{\mathbf{nucleon}}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although significant efforts have been made to investigate the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy, the influence of the in-medium cross section on particle production in transport models is not well constrained. The in-medium cross section reflects the dynamic situation of the medium such as a nontrivial phase space distribution. In this study, we analyze the transverse momentum spectra of $p$, $d$, $t$, ${}^3{\mathrm{He}}$ and $\alpha$ particles emitted near mid-rapidity in central $^{40,48}\mathrm{Ca}$ + $^{58, 64}\mathrm{Ni}$ reactions at $56$ and $140$ $\mathrm{MeV}/\mathrm{nucleon}$. The Antisymmetrized Molecular Dynamics ($\mathrm{AMD}$) model is chosen as the transport model for data comparison. Central events are selected based on charged-particle multiplicity in both the experimental data and AMD calculations after applying an experimental filter. Our results show that the in-medium nucleon-nucleon scattering cross-sections are more strongly reduced at $56$ $\mathrm{MeV}/\mathrm{nucleon}$ than at $140$ $\mathrm{MeV}/\mathrm{nucleon}$ incident energy.</description>

      <title>Dynamical correlations across momentum scales in the Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental probes of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) generated in heavy-ion collisions span a broad range in momentum scale: low transverse momentum (low $p_T$) measurements probe collective dynamics, while high $p_T$ measurements probe the response to QGP excitation by jets (jet quenching). However, the dynamical interplay between QGP collective dynamics and jet quenching is currently poorly understood. We present a new framework for exploring dynamical correlations across momentum scales in heavy-ion collisions, based on the $p_T$-differential radial-flow observable $v_0(p_T)$. Measured $v_0(p_T)$ phenomenology is traced to the evolution in strength and coherence of distinct underlying fluctuation modes. We then propose new experimental observables to quantify this evolution. The eigenvalue ratio $\lambda_2/\lambda_1$ of the reference-aligned covariance matrix $V_0$ is shown to measure the effective fluctuation rank, while the $p_T$-dependence of the corresponding eigenvectors maps the evolution from a single coherent soft mode to multi-mode dynamics including coalescence and jet quenching. These observables map the soft-mid-hard correlation structure and provide a unified description of the collective-to-partonic transition in the QGP.</description>

      <title>Stationary Couette-type flows in relativistic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a class of stationary, planar-symmetric solutions of relativistic hydrodynamics, in which a dissipative fluid is confined between two parallel plates that move relative to each other and/or are maintained at different temperatures. We find that neglecting the heat flux leads to qualitatively incorrect flow profiles, even in systems with temperature-independent viscosity. This arises from the fact that, in special relativity, the heat flux itself contributes to the momentum density (the so-called "inertia of heat"). This effect is most evident in the Landau frame, where the fluid removes the excess energy generated by viscous heating by streaming across the boundaries. The analysis is further extended to the limit of vanishing chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Living on the edge: radius effects in the angular substructure of heavy-ion jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jet substructure observables serve as essential tools for probing the quark-gluon plasma produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Their interpretation, however, is often complicated by edge effects, which arise when correlated particles fall outside the reconstructed jet radius, introducing distortions that obscure the underlying QCD dynamics. In this work, we present a comprehensive phenomenological study of edge effects in soft-insensitive angular observables, taking the two-point energy correlator (EEC) as a representative example. We argue that these distortions scale linearly with the average angular separation between the winner-take-all and $E$-scheme axes $\langle \phi \rangle$, and validate this behavior across proton-proton (p-p) simulations with Pythia8 and Herwig7, as well as lead-lead (Pb-Pb) simulations using JEWEL and CoLBT. In p-p collisions, edge effects are strongly suppressed, scaling as $(R_L/R)^4$, whereas medium-modified jets can exhibit larger distortions, with contributions scaling as $(R_L/R)^2$ and $(R_L/R)^4$. Taking Pb-Pb/p-p ratios of the EEC substantially reduces, but does not completely eliminate, these distortions, highlighting the need of accounting for edge effects in the interpretation of heavy-ion jet substructure measurements. Since edge effects are largely governed by the $\langle \phi \rangle$ distribution, studying this distribution provides a new handle for benchmarking and constraining the modeling of edge effects in heavy-ion event generators.</description>

      <title>Unpolarized GPDs at small $x$ and non-zero skewness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the small-$x$ asymptotics of unpolarized generalized parton distributions (GPDs) and generalized transverse momentum distributions (GTMDs). Unlike the previous works in the literature, we consider the case of non-zero (but small) skewness while allowing for non-linear contributions to the evolution equations. We show that unpolarized GPDs and GTMDs at small $x$ are related to the eikonal dipole amplitude $N$, whose small-$x$ evolution is given by the BK/JIMWLK evolution equations, and to the odderon amplitude $\cal O$, whose evolution is also known in the literature. We show that the effect of non-zero skewness $\xi \neq 0$ is to modify the value of the evolution parameter (rapidity) in the arguments for the dipole amplitudes $N$ and $\cal O$ from $Y = \ln (1/x)$ to $Y = \ln \min \left\{ 1/|x| , 1/|\xi| \right\}$.</description>

      <title>A unified approach for the hadronic weak decays of $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma^{\pm}\to N\pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a unified approach for the two-body hadronic weak decays of hyperons with $S=-1$, i.e. $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma^\pm$, in the framework of the non-relativistic constitute quark model (NRCQM). A combined analysis shows that the branching ratios and asymmetry parameters of the decay channels $\Lambda\to p\pi^-$ and $\Sigma^\pm\to N\pi$ can be well described in the same framework with the direct pion emission, color suppressed internal $W$ emission, and pole terms included. However, the channel $\Lambda\to n\pi^0$ indicates significant deviations from the experimental data based on these mentioned transition mechanism. We demonstrate that the final state interactions (FSIs) via the coupled-channel rescatterings play a crucial role in $\Lambda\to n\pi^0$. Namely, the dominant decay channel of $\Lambda\to p\pi^-$ can contribute to $\Lambda\to n\pi^0$ via the $p\pi^-\to n\pi^0$ rescatterings. This is a leading correction effect for $\Lambda\to n\pi^0$ at the one-loop level. We find that such FSIs only become the leading effects in $\Lambda\to n\pi^0$, but contribute as subleading contributions in other channels. We also demonstrate that the pole terms are indispensable in these hyperon decays. In particular, for $\Sigma^-\to n\pi^-$ and $\Sigma^+\to n\pi^+$, it shows that $\Lambda(1405)$ as the intermediate state in the pole term amplitude is necessary for reproducing the experimental data. We also find that a dynamic selection rule forbids the radial excitation state $N(1710)$ of the quark model multiplet $|70, ^28,2,0^+,1/2^+\rangle$ from contribution. To some extent, the hyperon hadronic weak decays serve as a special probe for the underlying transition mechanisms and can provide some constraints on the intermediate $J^P=1/2^\pm$ baryon resonances.</description>

      <title>Three-body resonances of $\alpha\alpha M$ clusters ($M=\phi$, $J/\psi$, $\eta_c$) in $^{9}_{M}{\mathrm{Be}}$ nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recently obtained HAL QCD potentials for the $N$-$\phi$, $N$-$J/\psi$, and $N$-$\eta_c$ interactions. interactions, we investigate the structure of the exotic nuclei $^{9}_{\phi}{\text{Be}}$, $^{9}_{J/\psi}{\text{Be}}$, and $^{9}_{\eta_c}{\mathrm{Be}}$ as $\alpha+\alpha+M$ three-body systems ($M$ denotes the meson). The bound and resonant states are calculated consistently using the Gaussian expansion method, with resonances identified via the complex scaling method. For the $\alpha\phi$ and $\alpha$-charmonium interactions, a folding potential is constructed based on the HAL QCD potentials and fitted to a Woods-Saxon form. We find that the $\phi$ meson exhibits a strong "glue-like" effect, binding the $0^+_1$, $2^+_1$, and $4^+_1$ resonant states of $^8$Be into stable states and significantly reducing the $\alpha$-$\alpha$ distance. In contrast, the interactions of $J/\psi$ and $\eta_c$ with the nucleus are weaker, forming only shallow bound states with the $0^+_1$ state of $^8$Be and even increasing the $\alpha$-$\alpha$ separation. Notably, our analysis predicts weakly bound $\alpha$-$J/\psi$ states in the $^4S_{3/2}$ and $^2S_{1/2}$ channels, a result not reported in prior studies, which suggests that $^{9}_{J/\psi}{\text{Be}}$ may not be a Borromean nucleus. The sensitivity of the $^{9}_{\phi}{\text{Be}}(4^+_1)$ state-transitioning from bound to resonant depending on the $\alpha$-particle radius-highlights the subtle dynamics at play. These results provide a systematic theoretical comparison of how different vector mesons modify nuclear clustering, offering critical predictions for future experimental searches of such exotic hadron-nucleus systems.</description>

Abstract: We present disperon QED, a method to deal with data input in loop processes in Monte Carlo codes. It relies on dispersion relations, automated tools such as OpenLoops, effective field theory methods and a threshold subtraction. We motivate this method and apply it to the process $ee\to\pi\pi$ in McMule to deal with hadronic vacuum polarisation insertions in two-loop contributions as well as the vector form factor of the pion within the form-factor scalar QED approximation. The generality of this method for more complicated processes is emphasised.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the Moments of Inertia of Forced Split Fragments for Nuclei 232Th(n,f) and 238U(n,f)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper discusses modern methods for estimating the moments of inertia of fragments formed during forced fission of the isotopes 232Th(n,f) and 238U(n,f). The study analyzes two fundamental approaches -- statistical and microscopic. Special attention is given to their implementation within both classical and superfluid models, enabling a more detailed description of nuclear dynamics during fission. Various physical factors influencing the calculation of moments of inertia are examined, including transverse vibrational modes and nucleon exchange mechanisms. These effects significantly impact spin distributions and the interpretation of experimental data. The analysis also addresses the role of nuclear models that vary with fragment deformation, allowing key regularities in internal structure to be identified. Emphasis is placed on comparing theoretical predictions with experimental results, which remain essential for model validation. This approach not only deepens understanding of fission mechanisms but also supports the broader study of fundamental nuclear properties.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the mechanism of $J/\psi$-nucleon scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19526v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The low-energy $J/\psi N$ scattering is important for various reasons: it is related to the hidden-charm $P_c$ pentaquark states, provides insights into the role of gluons in nucleon structures, and is relevant to the $J/\psi$ properties in nuclear medium. The scattering can happen through two distinct mechanisms: the coupled-channel mechanism via open-charm meson-baryon intermediate states, and the soft-gluon exchange mechanism. We investigate the $J/\psi N$ $S$-wave scattering length through both mechanisms, and find that the soft-gluon exchange mechanism leads to a scattering length at least one order of magnitude larger than that from the coupled-channel mechanism and thus is the predominant one. The findings can be verified by lattice calculations and will enhance our understanding of the scattering processes breaking the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka rule.</description>

      <title>A Generalized False Vacuum Skyrme model</title>

Abstract: We propose a generalization of the False Vacuum Skyrme model for any simple compact Lie groups $G$ that leads to Hermitian symmetric spaces. The Skyrme field that in the original theory takes its values in $SU(2)$ Lie group, now takes its values in $G$, while the remaining fields correspond to the entries of a symmetric, positive, and invertible $\dim G \times \dim G$-dimensional matrix $h$. This model is also an extension of the generalized BPS Skyrme model. We prove that the global minima correspond to the $h$ fields being self-dual solutions of the generalized BPS Skyrme model, together with a particular field configuration for the Skyrme field that leads to a spherically symmetric topological charge density. As in the case of the original model, the minimization of the energy leads to the so-called reduced problem, defined in the context of false vacuum decay. This imposes a condition on the Skyrme field, which, if satisfied, makes the total energy of the global minima, as well as the main properties of the model, equivalent to those obtained for the $G=SU(2)$ case. We study this condition and its consequences within the generalized rational map ansatz and show how it can be satisfied for $G=SU(p+q)$, where $p$ and $q$ are positive integers, with the Hermitian symmetric spaces being $SU(p+q)/SU(p) \otimes SU(q) \otimes U(1)$. In such a case, the model is completely equivalent to the $G=SU(2)$ False Vacuum Skyrme model, independent of the values of $p$ and $q$. We also provide a numerical study of the baryon density, RMS radius, and binding energy per nucleon, which deepens the previous analysis conducted for the $SU(2)$ False Vacuum Skyrme model. Additionaly, in the case of $G = SU(3)$, we have studied the application of our model to the description of the binding energies and masses of the $\Lambda$-hypernuclei.</description>

      <title>Collapsar Disk Outflows III: Detectable Neutrino and Gravitational Wave Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the neutrino and gravitational wave (GW) signals from accretion disks formed during the failed collapse of a rotating massive star (a collapsar). Following black hole formation, a neutrino-cooled, shocked accretion disk forms, which displays non-spherical oscillations for a period of seconds before becoming advective and exploding the star. We compute the neutrino and GW signals (matter quadrupole, frequencies $\lesssim 100$ Hz) from collapsar disks using global axisymmetric, viscous hydrodynamic simulations. The neutrino signal with typical energies of O$(10)$ MeV is maximal during the neutrino-cooled (NDAF) phase that follows shock formation. This phase lasts for a few seconds and is easily detectable within O$(10-100)$ kpc by the IceCube Neutrino Telescope. Additional neutrino signatures from a precursor equatorial shock and by stochastic accretion plumes during the advective phase are detectable within the galaxy. The GW signal during the NDAF phase is detectable in the galaxy by current and next-generation ground-based observatories. The explosion (memory) GW signal is similar to that of standard core-collapse supernovae and can be probed with a deci-Hertz space-based detector. Shock oscillations during the NDAF phase impart time variations with frequency O$(10-100)$ Hz to the neutrino and GW signals, encoding information about the shock dynamics and inner disk. These time variations can be detectable in neutrinos by IceCube within O$(1-10)$ kpc depending on progenitor model, flavor transformation scenario, and detailed properties of the angular momentum transport mechanism.</description>

      <title>Scaling properties of nuclear parton distributions in short-range-correlation motivated two-component parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide some critical remarks on the recently proposed two-component parametrization of nuclear parton distribution functions, which was motivated by the apparent correlation between the nuclear modifications of structure functions and nucleon-nucleon short-range correlation phenomena. This parametrization, we show, is invariant under a rescaling transformation of the involved abundance coefficients, which means that the global normalization of these coefficients cannot be meaningfully determined in a fit, and only their ratios should be studied for finding evidence of short-range-correlation type behavior at parton level. As we show, however, the current constraints for the nuclear-mass dependence of these coefficients allow also for interpretations different from short-range correlations. Nevertheless, this two-component parametrization exhibits a similar scaling relation for DIS structure functions as demonstrated in earlier works, and, as we demonstrate, yields testable predictions for structure-function and hard-process cross-section ratios. We also note on the non-trivial isospin dependence of the short-range-correlation motivated parametrization, which under proton-neutron pair dominance assumption can lead to charge-symmetry-violation resembling terms.</description>

      <title>Insights into Nucleon Resonances via Continuum Schwinger Function Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first baryon resonance was discovered in the early 1950s. The Roper resonance joined the collection ten years later. Today, many baryon resonances are known and more are being discovered. As baryons, these states are the most fundamental three-body systems in Nature. They must all be understood, not just the isolated ground state nucleon. This contribution sketches applications of continuum Schwinger function methods to the baryon resonance problem. Whilst spectroscopy is of value, particular emphasis is placed on resonance electroproduction because transition form factors extracted from electroproduction data provide a keen tool for revealing resonance structure.</description>
