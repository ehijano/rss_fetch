      <title>Matrix Formulation of Moreira Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a celebrated article, Moreira proved for every finite coloring of the set of naturals, there exists a monochromatic copy of the form $\{x,x+y,xy\},$ which gives a partial answer to one of the central open problems of Ramsey theory asking whether $\{x,y,x+y,xy\}$ is partition regular. In this article, we prove the matrix version of the Moreira theorem. We prove that if $A$ and $B$ are two finite image partition regular matrices of the same order, then for every finite coloring of the set of naturals, there exist two vectors $\overrightarrow{X}, \overrightarrow{Y}$ such that $\{A\overrightarrow{X}, A\overrightarrow{X}+B\overrightarrow{Y}, A \overrightarrow{X}\cdot B\overrightarrow{Y}\}$ is monochromatic, where addition and multiplication are defined coordinate-wise.</description>

      <title>Grothendieck positivity for normal square root crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Normal crystals (also known as Stembridge crystals) are commonly used to establish the Schur positivity of symmetric functions, as their characters are sums of Schur polynomials. In this paper, we develop a combinatorial framework for a novel family of objects called normal square root crystals, which are closely related to symmetric Grothendieck functions, the $K$-theoretic analogue of Schur functions. Among other applications, this tool leads to a new proof of Buch's combinatorial rule for the multiplication of symmetric Grothendieck functions. The definition of a normal square root crystal, originally formulated by the first two authors, largely mirrors that of normal crystals. Our main result is to show that the character of such a crystal is always a sum of symmetric Grothendieck polynomials. The proof relies on an unexpected connection between the raising operators for our crystals and the Hecke insertion algorithm developed by Buch, Kresch, Shimozono, Tamvakis, and Yong.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic results on the $2$-adic complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is devoted to solving some closely related open problems on the average and asymptotic behavior of the $2$-adic complexity of binary sequences. First, for fixed $N$, we prove that the expected value $E^{\mathrm{2-adic}}_N$ of the $2$-adic complexity over all binary sequences of length $N$ is close to $\frac{N}{2}$ and the deviation from $\frac{N}{2}$ is at most of order of magnitude $\log(N)$. More precisely, we show that
  $$\frac{N}{2}-1 \le E^{\mathrm{2-adic}}_N= \frac{N}{2}+O(\log(N)).$$
  We also prove bounds on the expected value of the $N$th rational complexity.
  Our second contribution is to prove for a random binary sequence $\mathcal{S}$ that the $N$th $2$-adic complexity satisfies with probability $1$ $$ \lambda_{\mathcal{S}}(N)=\frac{N}{2}+O(\log(N)) \quad \mbox{for all $N$}. $$</description>

      <title>Water transport on finite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a simple finite graph and its nodes to represent identical water barrels (containing different amounts of water) on a level plane. Each edge corresponds to a (locked, water-filled) pipe connecting two barrels below the plane. We fix one node $v$ and consider the optimization problem relating to the maximum value to which the level in $v$ can be raised without pumps, i.e. by opening/closing pipes in a suitable order. This fairly natural optimization problem originated from the analysis of an opinion formation process and proved to be not only sufficiently intricate in order to be of independent interest, but also difficult from an algorithmic point of view.</description>

      <title>Partitioning a graph into $\Delta$-convex sets of graphs and graph products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and a set $S \subseteq V(G)$, we say that $S$ is $\Delta$-convex if the neighborhood of every vertex not in $S$ is an independent set. A collection ${\cal V} = (V_1, V_2, \ldots , V_p)$ of convex sets of $G$ is a convex $p$-cover if $V(G) = \underset{1 \leq i \leq p}{\bigcup} V_i$ and $V_i \nsubseteq {\underset{1 \leq j \leq p, j\ne i}{\bigcup}} V_j$ for $i \in \{1, \ldots, p\}$. If the convex sets of ${\cal V}$ are pairwise disjoint, ${\cal V}$ is a convex $p$-partition of $V(G)$. The convex cover number $\phi_c(G)$ (the convex partition number $\Theta_c(G)$) of a graph $G$ is the least integer $p \geq 2$ for which $G$ has a convex $p$-cover (convex $p$-partition). In this work, we prove that the {\sc Convex p-cover} and {\sc Convex p-Partition} problems are \NP-complete for any fixed $p \ge 4$ in $\Delta$-convexity. Furthermore, for the three standard graph products, namely, the Cartesian, strong and lexicographic products, we determine these parameters for some cases and present bounds for others.</description>

      <title>Distribution of Alternating Sums of Parts in Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, many authors have investigated how various partition statistics distribute as the size of the partition grows. In this work, we look at a particular statistic arising from the recent rejuvenation of MacMahon's partition analysis. More specifically, we show that the alternating sum of parts in partitions has an asymptotically normal distribution. We prove this results using the saddle point method. We also propose a general framework for studying further questions of this type that may avoid some of the complications that arise in traditional approaches to the distributions of partition statistics.</description>

      <title>Lifting Voltages in Graph Covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider voltage digraphs, here referred to as graphs, whose edges are labeled with elements from a given group, and explore their derived graphs. Given two voltage graphs, with voltages in abelian groups, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for their two derived graphs to be isomorphic. This condition requires: (1) the existence of a voltage graph that covers both given graphs, and (2) when the two sets of voltages are lifted to the common cover, the correspondence between these sets of voltages determines an isomorphism between the groups generated by these voltages. We show that conditions (1) and (2) are decidable, and provide a method for constructing the common cover and for lifting the voltage assignments.</description>

      <title>Colorful Helly via induced matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a theorem regarding the maximum size of an {\it{induced}} matching in the bipartite complement of the incidence graph of a set system $(X,\mathcal{F})$. We show that this quantity plus one provides an upper bound on the colorful Helly number of this set system, i.e. the minimum positive integer $N$ for which the following statement holds: if finite subfamilies $\mathcal{F}_1,\ldots, \mathcal{F}_{N} \subset \mathcal{F}$ are such that $\cap_{F \in \mathcal{F}_{i}} F = 0$ for every $i=1,\ldots,N$, then there exists $F_i \in \mathcal{F}_i$ such that $F_1 \cap \ldots \cap F_{N} = \emptyset$. We will also discuss some natural refinements of this result and applications.</description>

      <title>On the Hilbert depth of the quotient ring of the edge ideal of a star graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $S_n=K[x_1,\ldots,x_n,y]$ and $I_n=(x_1y,x_2y,\ldots,x_ny)\subset S_n$ be the edge ideal of star graph. We prove that $\operatorname{hdepth}(S_n/I_n)\geq \left\lceil \frac{n}{2} \right\rceil + \left\lfloor \sqrt{n} \right\rfloor - 2$. Also, we show that for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, there exists some integer $A=A(\varepsilon)\geq 0$ such that $\operatorname{hdepth}(S_n/I_n)\leq \left\lceil \frac{n}{2} \right\rceil + \left\lfloor \varepsilon n \right\rfloor + A - 2$. We deduce that $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n}\operatorname{hdepth}(S_n/I_n) = \frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing random pictures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a random binary picture $P_n$ of size $n$, i.e., an $n\times n$ grid filled with zeros and ones uniformly at random, when is it possible to reconstruct $P_n$ from its $k$-deck, i.e., the multiset of all its $k\times k$ subgrids? We demonstrate ``two-point concentration'' for the reconstruction threshold by showing that there is an integer $k_c(n) \sim (2 \log n)^{1/2}$ such that if $k &gt; k_c$, then $P_n$ is reconstructible from its $k$-deck with high probability, and if $k &lt; k_c$, then with high probability, it is impossible to reconstruct $P_n$ from its $k$-deck. The proof of this result uses a combination of interface-exploration arguments and entropic arguments.</description>

      <title>Flexible list coloring of graphs with maximum average degree less than $3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02979v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the flexible list coloring problem, we consider a graph $G$ and a color list assignment $L$ on $G$, as well as a subset $U \subseteq V(G)$ for which each $u \in U$ has a preferred color $p(u) \in L(u)$. Our goal is to find a proper $L$-coloring $\phi$ of $G$ such that $\phi(u) = p(u)$ for at least $\epsilon|U|$ vertices $u \in U$. We say that $G$ is $\epsilon$-flexibly $k$-choosable if for every $k$-size list assignment $L$ on $G$ and every subset of vertices with coloring preferences, $G$ has a proper $L$-coloring that satisfies an $\epsilon$ proportion of these coloring preferences. Dvo\v{r}\'ak, Norin, and Postle [Journal of Graph Theory, 2019] asked whether every $d$-degenerate graph is $\epsilon$-flexibly $(d+1)$-choosable for some constant $\epsilon = \epsilon(d) &gt; 0$.
  In this paper, we prove that there exists a constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$ such that every graph with maximum average degree less than $3$ is $\epsilon$-flexibly $3$-choosable, which gives a large class of $2$-degenerate graphs which are $\epsilon$-flexibly $(d+1)$-choosable. In particular, our results imply a theorem of Dvo\v{r}\'ak, Masa\v{r}\'ik, Mus\'ilek, and Pangr\'ac [Journal of Graph Theory, 2020] stating that every planar graph of girth $6$ is $\epsilon$-flexibly $3$-choosable for some constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$. To prove our result, we generalize the existing reducible subgraph framework traditionally used for flexible list coloring to allow reducible subgraphs of arbitrarily large order.</description>

      <title>Lattice paths and Rogers--Ramanujan--Gordon type overpartitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a connection between Rogers-Ramanujan-Gordon type overpartitions to lattice paths with four kinds of unitary steps. By establishing the bijective relationship between overpartitions and lattice paths, we demonstrate that the theorems provided by Chen, Sang and Shi can be formulated in the form of lattice paths. Subsequently, inspired by Andrews' work on parity in partition identities and its related implications, we impose parity constraints on lattice paths and present some novel discoveries. By leveraging the parity outcomes within lattice paths, we also revisit overpartitions to derive results pertaining to overpartitions with parity considerations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove Jones' famous conjecture for Halin graphs and a somewhat more general class of graphs too. A based planar graph is a planar one that has a face adjacent to every other face. We confirm Jones' conjecture for based planar graphs. Namely, if a based planar graph does not contain $k+1$ vertex-disjoint cycles, then it suffices to delete $2k$ vertices to make it acyclic.</description>

      <title>Random walks on Coxeter interchange graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A tournament is an orientation of a graph. Vertices are players and edges are games, directed away from the winner. Kannan, Tetali and Vempala and McShine showed that tournaments with given score sequence can be rapidly sampled, via simple random walks on the interchange graphs of Brualdi and Li. These graphs are generated by the cyclically directed triangle, in the sense that traversing an edge corresponds to the reversal of such a triangle in a tournament.
  We study Coxeter tournaments on Zaslavsky's signed graphs. These tournaments involve collaborative and solitaire games, as well as the usual competitive games. The interchange graphs are richer in complexity, as a variety of other generators are involved. We prove rapid mixing by an intricate application of Bubley and Dyer's method of path coupling, using a delicate re-weighting of the graph metric. Geometric connections with the Coxeter permutahedra introduced by Ardila, Castillo, Eur and Postnikov are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We study the zero set of polynomials built from partition statistics, complementing earlier work in this direction by Boyer, Goh, Parry, and others. In particular, addressing a question of Males with two of the authors, we prove asymptotics for the values of $t$-hook polynomials away from an annulus and isolated zeros of a theta function. We also discuss some open problems and present data on other polynomial families, including those associated to deformations of Rogers--Ramanujan functions.</description>

Abstract: We consider a 2-player permutation game inspired by the celebrated Erd\H{o}s-Szekeres Theorem. The game depends on two positive integer parameters $a$ and $b$ and we determine the winner and give a winning strategy when $a \geq b$ and $b \in \left\{2,3,4,5\right\}$.</description>

      <title>Colouring signed Kneser, Schrijver, and Borsuk graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The signed Kneser graph $SK(n,k)$, $k\leq n$, is the graph whose vertices are signed $k$-subsets of $[n]$ (i.e. $k$-subsets $S$ of $\{ \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots, \pm n\}$ such that $S\cap -S=\emptyset$). Two vertices $A$ and $B$ are adjacent with a positive edge if $A\cap -B=\emptyset$ and with a negative edge if $A\cap B=\emptyset$. We prove that the balanced chromatic number of $SK(n,k)$ is $n-k+1$. We then introduce the signed analogue of Schrijver graphs and show that they form vertex-critical subgraphs of $SK(n,k)$ with respect to balanced colouring. Further connection to topological methods, in particular, connection to signed Borsuk graphs is also considered.</description>

      <title>Degree Realization by Bipartite Multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of realizing a given degree sequence by a multigraph can be thought of as a relaxation of the classical degree realization problem (where the realizing graph is simple). This paper concerns the case where the realizing multigraph is required to be bipartite.
  The problem of characterizing sequences that can be realized by a bipartite graph has two variants. In the simpler one, termed BDR$^P$, the partition of the sequence into two sides is given as part of the input. A complete characterization for realizability in this variant was given by Gale and Ryser over sixty years ago. However, the variant where the partition is not given, termed BDR, is still open.
  For bipartite multigraph realizations, there are also two variants. For BDR$^P$, where the partition is given as part of the input, a characterization was known for determining whether there is a multigraph realization whose underlying graph is bipartite, such that the maximum number of copies of an edge is at most $r$. We present a characterization for determining if there is a bipartite multigraph realization such that the total number of excess edges is at most $t$. We show that optimizing these two measures may lead to different realizations, and that optimizing by one measure may increase the other substantially. As for the variant BDR, where the partition is not given, we show that determining whether a given (single) sequence admits a bipartite multigraph realization is NP-hard. Moreover, we show that this hardness result extends to any graph family which is a sub-family of bipartite graphs and a super-family of paths. On the positive side, we provide an algorithm that computes optimal realizations for the case where the number of balanced partitions is polynomial, and present sufficient conditions for the existence of bipartite multigraph realizations that depend only on the largest degree of the sequence.</description>

      <title>Arrangements of Pseudocircles: On Digons and Triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.12110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the cell-structure of simple arrangements of pairwise intersecting pseudocircles. The focus will be on two problems of Gr\"unbaum (1972).
  First, we discuss the maximum number of digons or touching points. Gr\"unbaum conjectured that there are at most $2n - 2$ digon cells or equivalently at most $2n - 2$ touchings. Agarwal et al. (2004) verified the conjecture for cylindrical arrangements. We show that the conjecture holds for any arrangement which contains three pairwise touching pseudocircles. The proof makes use of the result for cylindrical arrangements. Moreover, we construct non-cylindrical arrangements which attain the maximum of $2n - 2$ touchings and have no triple of pairwise touching pseudocircles.
  Second, we discuss the minimum number of triangular cells (triangles) in arrangements without digons and touchings. Gr\"unbaum conjectured that such arrangements have $2n - 4$ triangles. Snoeyink and Hershberger (1991) established a lower bound of $\lceil \frac{4}{3}n \rceil$. Felsner and Scheucher (2017) disproved the conjecture and constructed a family of arrangements with only $\lceil \frac{16}{11}n \rceil$ triangles. We provide a construction which shows that $\lceil \frac{4}{3}n \rceil$ is the correct value.</description>

      <title>Minimal cellular resolutions of powers of matching field ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10729v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a family of monomial ideals, called block diagonal matching field ideals, which arise as monomial Gr\"obner degenerations of determinantal ideals. Our focus is on the minimal free resolutions of these ideals and all of their powers. Initially, we establish their linear quotient property and compute their Betti numbers, illustrating that their minimal free resolution is supported on a regular CW complex. Our proof relies on the results of Herzog and Takayama, demonstrating that ideals with a linear quotient property have a minimal free resolution, and on the construction by Dochtermann and Mohammadi of cellular realizations of these resolutions. We begin by proving the linear quotient property for each power of such an ideal. Subsequently, we show that their corresponding decomposition map is regular, resulting in a minimal cellular resolution. Finally, we demonstrate that distinct decomposition maps lead to different cellular complexes with the same face numbers.</description>

      <title>The Square-Root Law Does Not Hold in the Presence of Zero Divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13248v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a finite ring (with unit, not necessarily commutative) and define the paraboloid $P = \{(x_1, \dots, x_d)\in R^d|x_d = x_1^2 + \dots + x_{d-1}^2\}.$ Suppose that for a sequence of finite rings of size tending to infinity, the Fourier transform of $P$ satisfies a square-root law of the form $|\hat{P}(\chi)|\leq C|R|^{-d}|P|^\frac{1}{2}$ for some fixed constant $C$ (for instance, if $R$ is a finite field, this bound will be satisfied with $C = 1$). Then all but finitely many of the rings are fields.
  Most of our argument works in greater generality: let $f$ be a polynomial with integer coefficients in $d-1$ variables, with a fixed order of variable multiplications (so that it defines a function $R^{d-1}\rightarrow R$ even when $R$ is noncommutative), and set $V_f = \{(x_1, \dots, x_d)\in R^d|x_d = f(x_1, \dots, x_{d-1})\}$. If (for a sequence of finite rings of size tending to infinity) we have a square root law for the Fourier transform of $V_f$, then all but finitely many of the rings are fields or matrix rings of small dimension. We also describe how our techniques let us see that certain varieties do not satisfy a square root law even over finite fields.</description>

      <title>Near-factorizations of dihedral groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate near-factorizations of nonabelian groups, concentrating on dihedral groups. We show that some known constructions of near-factorizations in dihedral groups yield equivalent near-factorizations. In fact, there are very few known examples of nonequivalent near-factorizations in dihedral or other nonabelian groups; we provide some new examples with the aid of the computer. We also analyse a construction for near-factorizations in dihedral groups from near-factorizations in cyclic groups, due to P\^{e}cher, and we investigate when nonequivalent near-factorizations can be obtained by this method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze Sz\"oll\H{o}si's recent construction of a conjecturally optimal five-dimensional kissing configuration and produce a new such configuration, the fourth to be discovered. We construct five-dimensional sphere packings from these configurations, which augment Conway and Sloane's list of conjecturally optimal packings. We also construct a new kissing configuration in nine dimensions. None of these constructions improves on the known records, but they provide geometrically distinct constructions achieving these records.</description>

      <title>Crystals and Double Quiver Algebras from Jeffrey-Kirwan Residues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct statistical mechanical models of crystal melting describing the flavoured Witten indices of $\mathcal{N}\ge 2$ supersymmetric quiver gauge theories. Our results can be derived from the Jeffrey-Kirwan (JK) residue formulas, and generalize the previous results for quivers corresponding to toric Calabi-Yau threefolds and fourfolds to a large class of quivers satisfying the no-overlap condition, including those corresponding to some non-toric Calabi-Yau manifolds. We construct new quiver algebras which we call the double quiver Yangians/algebras, as well as their representations in terms of the aforementioned crystals. For theories with four supercharges, we compare the double quiver algebras with the existing quiver Yangians/BPS algebras, which we show can also be constructed from the JK residues. For theories with two supercharges, the double quiver algebras provide an algebraic description of the BPS states, including the information of the fixed points and their relative coefficients in the full partition functions.</description>

      <title>Trace of Multi-variable Matrix Functions and its Application to Functions of Graph Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix extension of a scalar function of a single variable is well-studied in literature. Of particular interest is the trace of such functions. It is known that for diagonalizable matrices, $M$, the function $g(M) = \text{Tr}(f(M)) = \sum_{j=1}^n f(\mu_j)$ (where $\{\mu_j\}_{j=1,2,\cdots,n}$ are the eigenvalues of $M$) inherits the monotonocity and convexity properties of $f$ (i.e., for $g$ to be convex, $f$ need not be operator convex -- convexity is sufficient). In this paper we formalize the idea of matrix extension of a function of multiple variables, study the monotonicity and convexity properties of the trace, and thus show that a function of form $g(M) = \sum_{j_1=1}^n \sum_{j_2=1}^n \cdots \sum_{j_m=1}^n f(\mu_{j_1}, \mu_{j_2},\cdots, \mu_{j_m})$ also inherits the monotonocity and convexity properties of the multi-variable function, $f$. We apply these results to functions of the spectrum of the weighted Laplacian matrix of undirected, simple graphs.</description>
