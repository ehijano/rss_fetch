      <title>An Improved Framework for Computing Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine the observable-based formalism (KMOC), the analytic properties of the scattering amplitude, generalised unitarity and the heavy-mass expansion with a newly introduced IBP reduction for Fourier integrals, to provide an efficient framework for computing scattering waveforms. We apply this framework to the scattering of two charged massive bodies in classical electrodynamics. Our work paves the way for the computation of the analytic one-loop waveform in General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Free fermions, neutrality and modular transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a view towards higher-spin applications, we study the partition function of a free complex fermion in 2d CFT, restricted to the neutral (zero fermion number) sector. This restriction leads to a partial theta function with a combinatoric interpretation in terms of Dyson's crank of a partition. More crucially, this partition function can be expressed in terms of a q-hypergeometric function with quantum modular properties. This allows us to find its high-temperature asymptotics, including subleading terms which agree with, but also go beyond, what one obtains by imposing neutrality thermodynamically through a chemical potential. We evaluate the asymptotic density of states for this neutral partition function, including the first few subleading terms. Our results should be extendable to more fermions, as well as to higher-spin chemical potentials, which would be of relevance to the higher-spin/minimal model correspondence.</description>

      <title>On harvesting physical predictions from asymptotically safe quantum field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymptotic safety is a powerful mechanism for obtaining a consistent and predictive quantum field theory beyond the realm of perturbation theory. It hinges on an interacting fixed point of the Wilsonian renormalization group flow which controls the microscopic dynamics. Connecting the fixed point to observations requires constructing the set of effective actions compatible with this microscopic dynamics. Technically, this information is stored in the UV-critical surface of the fixed point. In this work, we describe a novel approach for extracting this information based on analytical and pseudo-spectral methods. Our construction is illustrated at the level of the two-dimensional Ising model and easily generalizes to any asymptotically safe quantum field theory. It also constitutes an important step towards setting up a well-founded swampland program within the gravitational asymptotic safety program.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the renormalized one-loop quantum corrections to the energy density $T_{00}(x)$ and pressure $T_{11}(x)$ for solitons in the $1+1$ dimensional scalar sine-Gordon and kink models. We show how precise implementation of counterterms in dimensional regularization resolves previously identified discrepancies between the integral of $T_{00}(x)$ and the known correction to the total energy.</description>

      <title>On the non-perturbative bulk Hilbert space of JT gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What is the bulk Hilbert space of quantum gravity? In this paper, we resolve this problem in 2d JT gravity, both with and without matter, providing the first example of an explicit definition of a non-perturbative Hilbert space specified in terms of metric variables. The states are wavefunctions of the length and matter state, but with a non-trivial and highly degenerate inner product. We explicitly identify the null states, and discuss their importance for defining operators non-perturbatively. To highlight the power of the formalism we developed, we study the non-perturbative effects for two bulk linear operators that may serve as proxies for the experience of an observer falling into a two-sided black hole: one captures the length of an Einstein-Rosen bridge and the other captures the center-of-mass collision energy between two particles falling from opposite sides. We track the behavior of these operators up to times of order $e^{S_\text{BH}}$, at which point the wavefunction spreads to the complete set of eigenstates of these operators. If these observables are indeed good proxies for the experience of an infalling observer, our results indicate an O(1) probability of detecting a firewall at late times that is self-averaging and universal.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative correction on the black hole geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we use the holographic principle to obtain a modified metric of black holes that reproduces the exponentially corrected entropy. The exponential correction of the black hole entropy comes from non-perturbative corrections. It interprets as a quantum effect which affects black hole thermodynamics especially in the infinitesimal scales. Hence, it may affect black hole stability at the final stage. Then, we study modified thermodynamics due to the non-perturbative corrections and calculate thermodynamics quantities of several non-rotating black holes.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Unitarity and the 4-Point Vertices in the Constructive Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find a complete set of 4-point vertices in the Constructive Standard Model (CSM). This set is smaller than in Feynman diagrams as the CSM does not need or allow any additional 4-point vertices (or contact terms) beyond what is present in Feynman diagrams and, furthermore, it does not need or allow a 4-point vertex for A,Z,W+,W- or A,A,W+,W-, in addition to the already known absence of the 4-gluon vertex. We show that with this set of 4-point vertices, perturbative unitarity is satisfied in the CSM. Additionally, we show that many constructive diagrams are not Feynman diagrams rewritten in spinor form. In fact, we show that there is a significant rearrangement of contributions from the diagrams in constructive calculations relative to Feynman diagrams, for some processes. In addition to the already known or expected rearrangement in diagrams involving external photons, we also find that diagrams involving a 4-vector-boson vertex are also significantly different than their Feynman counterparts.</description>

      <title>A Complete Set of 4-Point Amplitudes in the Constructive Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a complete set of 4-point amplitudes in the constructive Standard Model at tree level. Any 4-point amplitude can be obtained from the results presented here by a suitable choice of masses, a permutation of the particles (by crossing symmetry), and a reversal of the momenta of the outgoing particles. We have validated all of these amplitudes by comparing with Feynman diagrams for a variety of masses, scattering energy and angles, and helicities of the photons and gluons, when they are in the initial states. The standard constructive techniques work for these amplitudes without the need for any contact terms and indeed, contact terms are not allowed. Only five 4-point vertices are used (allowed), involving the Higgs boson and the W and Z bosons. When external photons or gluons are present, the amplitude simplifies to a single spinor-product structure, present in the numerator. In a few cases, however, the propagator structure is more complex, with different terms depending on the charge or color structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories have a long history as possible phenomenological alternatives to General Relativity, but are known to potentially produce deviations from the (strong) equivalence principle in systems involving self-gravitating objects, as a result of the presence of an additional gravitational scalar field besides the tensor modes of General Relativity. We describe here a novel mechanism whereby the equivalence principle is violated for an isolated rotating neutron star, if the gravitational scalar field is changing in time far from the system. We show that the neutron star rotational period changes due to an effective coupling ("angular momentum sensitivity") to the gravitational scalar, and compute that coupling for viable equations of state for nuclear matter. We comment on the relevance of our findings for testing scalar-tensor theories and models of ultralight dark matter with pulsar timing observations, a topic that we tackle in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Nucleation Rate in a High-Temperature Quantum Field Theory with Hard Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of thermal, hard particles on nucleation rates in high-temperature quantum field theories (QFTs). The hard particles, which form the heat bath for nucleating fields, can be regarded as the most qualitatively distinct aspect of high-temperature QFTs in comparison with Langer's classical nucleation theory: They have their own dynamics and interactions with the nucleating fields, and consequently they do not obey a purely equilibrium distribution during nucleation. We focus on the situation where the hard particles are correctly described by a Vlasov equation, and show that the hard particles can be included into Langer's framework, with only the dynamical part of the nucleation rate changing. The statistical part retains its form and is in accordance with the effective field theory approach to thermal nucleation. It is also shown that the dominant damping from a light bosonic quantum field comes from the corresponding long-wavelength classical field instead of the corresponding bosonic hard particles.</description>

      <title>Generic autonomous system approach to interacting dark energy models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore an autonomous system analysis of dark energy models with interactions between dark energy and cold dark matter in a general systematic approach to cosmological fluids. We investigate two types of models such as local and non-local ones. In particular, a local form of interaction is directly proportional to only the energy density, while a non-local interaction is directly proportional to the energy density as well as the Hubble parameter. As a consequence, it is explicitly demonstrated that in both cases there exist the stability points in terms of cosmological parameters. This work aims at obtaining acceleration and stability using interaction models without modifying the matter or geometric component of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Generalized free energy and thermodynamic phases of black holes in the gauged Kaluza-Klein theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of the generalized (off-shell) free energy, we explore the phase emergence and corresponding phase transitions of charged dilaton $\text{AdS}$ black holes in the gauged Kaluza-Klein (KK) theory where the KK vector field is gauged such that the fermionic fields are charged under the U(1)$_{\text{KK}}$ gauge group. The black hole solutions are asymptotic to the AdS$_D$ geometry and can be realized as the dimensional reduction of the gauged supergravities on the compact internal manifolds, leading to the restriction as $4\leq D\leq 7$. By studying the behavior of the generalized free energy under the change of the ensemble temperature, we determine the thermodynamic phases and the corresponding phase transitions of black holes. This is confirmed by investigating the heat capacity at the constant pressure and the on-shell free energy. In the canonical ensemble, the thermodynamics of black holes can be classified into three different classes as follows: (i) $D=4$, (ii) $D=5$, and (iii) $D=6,7$. Whereas, in the grand canonical ensemble, the thermodynamics of black holes is independent of the number of spacetime dimensions and the pressure, but depends on the chemical potential $\Phi$. The thermodynamic behavior of black holes can be classified into three different classes as follows: (i) $\Phi&lt;1$, (ii) $\Phi&gt;1$, and (iii) $\Phi=1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider slowly rotating Ellis-Bronnikov wormholes and investigate their radial perturbations ($\mathrm{l}=0$), expanding up to second order in rotation. We present the detailed derivations in the general case, including symmetric and non-symmetric wormholes. The calculations show that the unstable mode present in the static case becomes less unstable with increasing rotation, until it reaches zero and then disappears. This indicates that wormhole solutions may become linearly mode stable at sufficiently fast rotation.</description>

      <title>Regular Friedmann Universes and Matter Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply a very simple procedure to construct non-singular cosmological models for flat Friedmann universes filled with minimally coupled scalar fields or by tachyon Born-Infeld-type fields. Remarkably, for the minimally coupled scalar field and the tachyon field, the regularity of the cosmological evolution, or in other words, the existence of bounce, implies the necessity of the transition between scalar fields with standard kinetic terms to those with phantom ones. In both cases, the potentials in the vicinity of the point of the transition have a non-analyticity of the cusp form that is characterized by the same exponent and is equal to 2/3. If, in the tachyon models evolution, the pressure changes its sign, then another transformation of the Born-Infeld-type field occurs: the tachyon transforms into a pseudotachyon, and vice versa. We also undertake an analysis of the stability of the cosmological evolution in our models; we rely on the study of the speed of sound squared.</description>

Abstract: We prove a uniqueness theorem for the charged Nariai black holes and ultracold black holes in four dimensions. In particular, we show that an analytic solution to four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory with a positive cosmological constant containing a static extremal Killing horizon with spherical cross-sections of large radius (compared to the cosmological scale), must be locally isometric to the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter black hole or its near-horizon geometry. The theorem generalises to extremal static horizons with small radius, establishing uniqueness of cold black holes for generic values of the radius.</description>

      <title>Negative pressure as a quantum effect in free-streaming in the cosmological background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of energy density and pressure of a free real scalar quantum field after its decoupling from a thermal bath in the spatially flat Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker space-time by solving the Klein-Gordon equation both analytically and numerically for different predetermined scale factor functions $a(t)$. The energy density and pressure, defined by subtracting the vacuum expectation values at the decoupling time, feature corrections with respect to the classical free-streaming solution of the relativistic Boltzmann equation. We show that if the expansion rate is comparable or larger than $mc^2/\hbar$ or $KT_0/\hbar$ where $m$ is the mass and $T_0$ the decoupling temperature, both energy density and pressure gets strong quantum corrections which substantially modify their classical dependence on the scale factor $a(t)$ and drive pressure to large negative values. For a minimally coupled field with a very low mass in an expanding de Sitter universe quantum corrections are dominant driving pressure and energy density to become asymptotically constant with an equation of state $p/\varepsilon \simeq -1$, thereby mimicking a cosmological constant. For a minimally coupled massless field, quantum corrections are asymptotically dominant for any accelerated expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.00013v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct initial data violating the Anti-deSitter Penrose inequality using scalars with various potentials. Since a version of the Penrose inequality can be derived from AdS/CFT, we argue that it is a new swampland condition, ruling out holographic UV completion for theories that violate it. We produce exclusion plots on scalar couplings violating the inequality, and we find no violations for potentials from string theory. In the special case where the dominant energy condition holds, we use GR techniques to prove the AdS Penrose inequality in all dimensions, assuming spherical, planar, or hyperbolic symmetry. However, our violations show that this result cannot be generically true with only the null energy condition, and we give an analytic sufficient condition for violation of the Penrose inequality, constraining couplings of scalar potentials. Like the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound, this gives a necessary condition for the stability of AdS.</description>

      <title>A scenario for AdS${}_2$ and dS${}_2$ emergence from quantum fluctuations</title>

Abstract: Spacetime emergence from entanglement has long been presumed to be holographic, with emergence from quantum interactions in a boundary theory. Since that setup is difficult to extend to general spacetimes, it is imperative to understand the key aspects of the map from entanglement to spacetime. We consider a scenario for spacetime emergence from quantum interactions directly in the spacetime, where the effective spacetime theory emerges from interactions similar to how fluid dynamics arises from molecule interactions. We show that this ansatz constitutes a working scenario for spacetime emergence in 2D, with explicit examples for AdS and dS spacetimes. Importantly, by basing the emergence on interactions between quantum fluctuations that are present in the spacetime, key aspects of the dynamics observed in gauge/gravity duality analyses can be retained, at the same time as the quantisation can be applied to general spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Wave scattering event shapes at high energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the space and properties of global and local observables for radiation emitted in the scattering of a massive scalar field in gauge and gravitational plane-wave backgrounds, in both the quantum and classical theory. We first compute the radiated momentum and angular momentum flow, demonstrating that they are good local observables determined by the amplitude and phase of the waveform. We then focus on the corresponding global observables, which in the gravitational case requires dealing with the collinear divergence of the gravitational Compton cross-section. We show using the KLN theorem that we can obtain an infrared-finite cross-section only by summing over forward scattering diagrams; this suggests dressing the initial state in the direction collinear to the plane wave in order to be able to compute observables integrated over the celestial sphere. Finally, we explore the high-energy behaviour of our observables. We find that classical global observables generically exhibit a power-law mass divergence in electrodynamics and a logarithmic mass divergence in gravity, even when radiation reaction is included. We then show explicitly how this is consistently resolved in the full quantum theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the algebraic structures which govern the deformation of supersymmetric intersections of M2 and M5 branes. The universal algebras on M2 and M5 branes are deformed double current algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_K$ and $\mathfrak{gl}_K$-extended $\mathcal{W}_{\infty}$-algebra respectively. We give a new presentation of the deformed double current algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_K$, and we give a rigorous mathematical construction of the $\mathfrak{gl}_K$-extended $\mathcal{W}_{\infty}$-algebra. A new presentation of the affine Yangian of $\mathfrak{gl}_K$ is also obtained. We construct various coproducts of these algebras, which are expected to encode the fusions of defects in twisted M-theory. The matrix extended Miura operators are identified as intertwiners in certain bimodules of these algebras.</description>

      <title>The Hitchin Image in Type-D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by their appearance as Coulomb branch geometries of Class S theories, we study the image of the local Hitchin map in tame Hitchin systems of type-D with residue in a special nilpotent orbit $\mathcal{O}_H$. We describe two important features which distinguish it from the type A case studied in arXiv:2008.01020. The first feature, which we term even type constraints, arise iff the partition label $[\mathcal{O}_H]$ has even parts. In this case, our Hitchin image is non-singular and thus different from the one studied by Baraglia and Kamgarpour. We argue that our Hitchin image always globalizes to being the Hitchin base of an integrable system. The second feature, which we term odd type constraints, is related to a particular finite group $\overline{A}_b(\mathcal{O}_H)$ being non-trivial. When this finite group is non-trivial, we have $\mid \overline{A}_b \mid$ choices for the local Hitchin base. Additionally, we also show that the finite group $\overline{A}_b(\mathcal{O}_H)$ encodes the size of the dual special piece.</description>

Abstract: Anti-de-Sitter space acts as an infra-red cut off for asymptotically free theories, allowing interpolation between a weakly-coupled small-sized regime and a strongly-coupled flat-space regime. We scrutinize the interpolation for theories in two dimensions from the perspective of boundary conformal theories. We show that the appearance of a singlet marginal operator destabilizes a gapless phase existing at a small size, triggering a boundary renormalization group flow to a gapped phase that smoothly connects to flat space. We conjecture a similar mechanism for confinement in gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Crossed Products, Conditional Expectations and Constraint Quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has highlighted the importance of crossed products in correctly elucidating the operator algebraic approach to quantum field theories. In the gravitational context, the crossed product simultaneously promotes von Neumann algebras associated with subregions in diffeomorphism covariant quantum field theories from type III to type II, and provides the necessary ingredients to gravitationally dress operators, thereby enforcing the constraints of the theory. In this note we enhance the crossed product construction to the context of general gauge theories with arbitrary combinations of internal and spacetime local symmetries. This is done by leveraging the correspondence between the crossed product and the extended phase space. We then undertake a detailed study of constraint quantization from the perspective of a generic crossed product algebra. We study and compare four distinct approaches to constraint quantization from this point of view: refined algebraic quantization, BRST quantization, path integral quantization, and the commutation theorem for crossed products. Far from simply reproducing existing analyses, the operator algebraic viewpoint sheds new light on old problems by reformulating the dressing of operators in terms of a (generalized) conditional expectation. We conclude by applying our approach to the constraint quantization of three distinct gauge theories including a discussion of gravity on null hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>3d gravity from Virasoro TQFT: Holography, wormholes and knots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We further develop the description of three-dimensional quantum gravity with negative cosmological constant in terms of Virasoro TQFT formulated in our previous paper arXiv:2304.13650. We compare the partition functions computed in the Virasoro TQFT formalism to the semiclassical evaluation of Euclidean gravity partition functions. This matching is highly non-trivial, but can be checked directly in some examples. We then showcase the formalism in action, by computing the gravity partition functions of many relevant topologies. For holographic applications, we focus on the partition functions of Euclidean multi-boundary wormholes with three-punctured spheres as boundaries. This precisely quantifies the higher moments of the structure constants in the proposed ensemble boundary dual and subjects the proposal to thorough checks. Finally, we investigate in detail the example of the figure eight knot complement as a hyperbolic 3-manifold. We show that the Virasoro TQFT partition function is identical to the partition function computed in Teichm\"uller theory, thus giving strong evidence for the equivalence of these TQFTs. We also show how to produce a large class of manifolds via Dehn surgery on the figure eight knot.</description>

Abstract: With the aim of computing bound waveforms from scattering amplitudes, we explore gravitational two-body dynamics using the Schwinger-Dyson equations and Bethe-Salpeter recursion. We show that the tree-level scattering waveform admits a natural analytic continuation, in rapidity, to the bound waveform, which we confirm from an independent calculation, in the Post-Newtonian expansion, of the time-domain multipoles at large eccentricity. We demonstrate consistency of this scattering-to-bound map with the Damour-Deruelle prescription for orbital elements in the quasi-Keplerian parametrization (which enters into the evaluation of the multipoles) and with the analytic continuation, in the binding energy, of radiated energy and angular momentum at 3PM.</description>

Abstract: Krylov methods have reappeared recently, connecting physically sensible notions of complexity with quantum chaos and quantum gravity. In these developments, the Hamiltonian and the Liouvillian are tridiagonalized so that Schrodinger/Heisenberg time evolution is expressed in the Krylov basis. In the context of Schrodinger evolution, this tridiagonalization has been carried out in Random Matrix Theory. We extend these developments to Heisenberg time evolution, describing how the Liouvillian can be tridiagonalized as well until the end of Krylov space. We numerically verify the analytical formulas both for Gaussian and non-Gaussian matrix models.</description>

      <title>On pole-skipping with gauge-invariant variables in holographic axion theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the pole-skipping phenomenon within holographic axion theories, a common framework for studying strongly coupled systems with chemical potential ($\mu$) and momentum relaxation ($\beta$). Considering the backreaction characterized by $\mu$ and $\beta$, we encounter coupled equations of motion for the metric, gauge, and axion field, which are classified into spin-0, spin-1, and spin-2 channels. Employing gauge-invariant variables, we systematically address these equations and explore pole-skipping points within each sector using the near-horizon method. Our analysis reveals two classes of pole-skipping points: regular and singular pole-skipping points in which the latter is identified when standard linear differential equations exhibit singularity. Notably, pole-skipping points in the lower-half plane are regular, while those elsewhere are singular. This suggests that the pole-skipping point in the spin-0 channel, associated with quantum chaos, corresponds to a singular pole-skipping point. Additionally, we observe that the pole-skipping momentum, if purely real or imaginary for $\mu=\beta=0$, retains this characteristic for $\mu \neq0$ and $\beta \neq 0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the decay of strongly excited oscillons in a single vacuum model reveals a chaotic, fractal-like pattern very much like one found in kink-antikink collision in the $\phi^4$ model. This structure can be attributed to the resonant energy transfer mechanism triggered by the modulations of amplitudes of constituent oscillons which form the excited oscillon. We also find evidence that such modulations arise as a motion of two quasi-breathers inside the constituent oscillon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The correlators of large-scale fluctuations belong to the most important observables in modern cosmology. Recently, there have been considerable efforts in analytically understanding the cosmological correlators and the related wavefunction coefficients, which we collectively call cosmological amplitudes. In this work, we provide a set of simple rules to directly write down analytical answers for arbitrary tree-level amplitudes of conformal scalars with time-dependent interactions in power-law FRW universe. With the recently proposed family-tree decomposition method, we identify an over-complete set of multivariate hypergeometric functions, called family trees, to which all tree-level conformal scalar amplitudes can be easily reduced. Our method yields series expansions and monodromies of family trees in various kinematic limits, together with a large number of functional identities. The family trees are in a sense generalizations of polylogarithms and do reduce to polylogarithmic expressions for the cubic coupling in inflationary limit. We further show that all family trees can be decomposed into linear chains by taking shuffle products of all subfamilies, with which we find simple connection between bulk time integrals and boundary energy integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the scenarios in which a holonomic versus a non-holonomic frame description of gravity theories are equivalent. It turns out that classically, the equivalence holds in a way that is independent of the particular dynamics and/or spacetime dimension. This includes general metric-affine dynamics. A global bundle-theoretical investigation is carried out, uncovering the equivalence principle as the culprit. The equivalence holds as long as the equivalence principle holds. This is not something to be expected when non-invertible configurations of the vielbein field are taken into account. In such case, the gauge-theoretical description of gravity unsolders from spacetime, and one has to decide if gravity is spacetime geometry or an internal gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamization in hybrid Bjorken flow attractors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.05480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid fluid models, consisting of two sectors with more weakly and more strongly self-interacting degrees of freedom coupled consistently as in the semi-holographic framework, have been shown to exhibit an attractor surface for Bjorken flow. Retaining only the simple viscid fluid descriptions of both sectors, we find that, on the attractor surface, the hydrodynamization times of both subsectors decrease with increasing total energy density at the respective point of hydrodynamization following a conformal scaling, reach their minimum values, and subsequently rise rapidly. The minimum values are obtained when the respective energy densities are of the order of the inverse of the dimensionful inter-system coupling. Restricting to attractor curves which can be matched to glasma models at a time set by the saturation scale for both $p$-$p$ and Pb-Pb collisions, we find that the more weakly coupled sector hydrodynamizes much later, and the strongly coupled sector hydrodynamizes earlier in $p$-$p$ collisions, since the total energy densities at the respective hydrodynamization times of these sectors fall inside and outside of the conformal window. This holds true also for phenomenologically relevant solutions that are significantly away from the attractor surface at the time we match to glasma models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach to Monge-Ampere geometry based on techniques from higher symplectic geometry. Our work is motivated by the application of Monge-Ampere geometry to the Poisson equation for the pressure that arises for incompressible Navier-Stokes flows. Whilst this equation constitutes an elliptic problem for the pressure, it can also be viewed as a non-linear partial differential equation connecting the pressure, the vorticity, and the rate-of-strain. As such, it is a key diagnostic relation in the quest to understand the formation of vortices in turbulent flows. We study this equation via an associated (higher) Lagrangian submanifold in the cotangent bundle to the configuration space of the fluid. Using our definition of a (higher) Monge-Ampere structure, we study an associated metric on the cotangent bundle together with its pull-back to the (higher) Lagrangian submanifold. The signatures of these metrics are dictated by the relationship between vorticity and rate-of-strain, and their scalar curvatures can be interpreted in a physical context in terms of the accumulation of vorticity, strain, and their gradients. We show explicity, in the case of two-dimensional flows, how topological information can be derived from the Monge-Ampere geometry of the Lagrangian submanifold. We also demonstrate how certain solutions to the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, such as Hill's spherical vortex and an integrable case of Arnol'd-Beltrami-Childress flow, have symmetries that facilitate a formulation of these solutions from the perspective of (higher) symplectic reduction.</description>

      <title>From the XXZ chain to the integrable Rydberg-blockade ladder via non-invertible duality defects</title>

Abstract: Strongly interacting models often possess "dualities" subtler than a one-to-one mapping of energy levels. The maps can be non-invertible, as apparent in the canonical example of Kramers and Wannier. We analyse an algebraic structure common to the XXZ spin chain and three other models: Rydberg-blockade bosons with one particle per square of a ladder, a three-state antiferromagnet, and two Ising chains coupled in a zigzag fashion. The structure yields non-invertible maps between the four models while also guaranteeing all are integrable. We construct these maps explicitly utilising topological defects coming from fusion categories and the lattice version of the orbifold construction, and use them to give explicit conformal-field-theory partition functions describing their critical regions. The Rydberg and Ising ladders also possess interesting non-invertible symmetries, with the spontaneous breaking of one in the former resulting in an unusual ground-state degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Complex dynamics approach to dynamical quantum phase transitions: the Potts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14827v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces complex dynamics methods to study dynamical quantum phase transitions in the one- and two-dimensional quantum 3-state Potts model. The quench involves switching off an infinite transverse field. The time-dependent Loschmidt echo is evaluated by an exact renormalization group (RG) transformation in the complex plane where the thermal Boltzmann factor is along the positive real axis, and the quantum time evolution is along the unit circle. One of the characteristics of the complex dynamics constituted by repeated applications of RG is the Julia set, which determines the phase transitions. We show that special boundary conditions can alter the nature of the transitions, and verify the claim for the one-dimensional system by transfer matrix calculations. In two dimensions, there are alternating symmetry-breaking and restoring transitions, both of which are first-order, despite the criticality of the Curie point. In addition, there are finer structures because of the fractal nature of the Julia set. Our approach can be extended to multi-variable problems, higher dimensions, and approximate RG transformations expressed as rational functions.</description>

      <title>Robust extended states in Anderson model on partially disordered random regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05691v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we analytically explain the origin of the mobility edge in the partially disordered random regular graphs of degree d, i.e., with a fraction $\beta$ of the sites being disordered, while the rest remain clean. It is shown that the mobility edge in the spectrum survives in {a certain range of parameters} $(d,\beta)$ at infinitely large uniformly distributed disorder. The critical curve separating extended and localized states is derived analytically and confirmed numerically. The duality in the localization properties between the sparse and extremely dense RRG has been found and understood.</description>

      <title>Non-Singular Gravitational Collapse through Modified Heisenberg Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of cut-off physics, in the form of a modified algebra inspired by Polymer Quantum Mechanics and by the Generalized Uncertainty Principle representation, on the collapse of a spherical dust cloud. We analyze both the Newtonian formulation, originally developed by Hunter, and the general relativistic formulation, that is the Oppenheimer-Snyder model; in both frameworks we find that the collapse is stabilized to an asymptotically static state above the horizon, and the singularity is removed. In the Newtonian case, by requiring the Newtonian approximation to be valid, we find lower bounds of the order of unity (in Planck units) for the deformation parameter of the modified algebra. We then study the behaviour of small perturbations on the non-singular collapsing backgrounds, and find that for certain range of the parameters (the polytropic index for the Newtonian case and the sound velocity in the relativistic setting) the collapse is stable to perturbations of all scales, and the non-singular super-Schwarzschild configurations have physical meaning.</description>

      <title>Dynamical de Sitter black holes in a quasi-stationary expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit and improve the analytic study arXiv:1804.03462 of spherically symmetric but dynamical black holes in Einstein's gravity coupled to a real scalar field. We introduce a series expansion in a small parameter $\epsilon$ that implements slow time dependence. At the leading order, the generic solution is a quasi-stationary Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) metric, i.e. one where time-dependence enters only through the mass and cosmological constant parameters of SdS. The two coupled ODEs describing the leading order time dependence are solved up to quadrature for an arbitrary scalar potential. Higher order corrections can be consistently computed, as we show by explicitly solving the Einstein equations at the next to leading order as well. We comment on how the quasi-stationary expansion we introduce here is equivalent to the non-relativistic $1/c$ expansion.</description>

      <title>Particle detector models from path integrals of localized quantum fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16083v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Schwinger-Keldysh path integral, we draw a connection between localized quantum field theories and more commonly used models of local probes in Relativistic Quantum Information (RQI). By integrating over and then tracing out the inaccessible modes of the localized field being used as a probe, we show that, at leading order in perturbation theory, the dynamics of any finite number of modes of the probe field is exactly that of a finite number of harmonic-oscillator Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors. The equivalence is valid for a rather general class of input states of the probe-target field system, as well as for any arbitrary number of modes included as detectors. The path integral also provides a closed-form expression which gives us a systematic way of obtaining the corrections to the UDW model at higher orders in perturbation theory due to the existence of the additional modes that have been traced out. This approach vindicates and extends a recently proposed bridge between detector-based and field-theory-based measurement frameworks for quantum field theory [T. R. Perche et al., Particle detectors from localized quantum field theories, Phys. Rev. D 109, 045013 (2024)], and also points to potential connections between particle detector models in RQI and other areas of physics where path integral methods are more commonplace -- in particular, the Wilsonian approach to the renormalization group and effective field theories.</description>

      <title>(Multi-field) Natural Inflation and Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a detailed study of natural inflation with a periodic non-minimal coupling, which is a well-motivated inflationary model that admits an explicit UV completion. We demonstrate that this construction can satisfy the most recent observational constraints from Planck and the BICEP/Keck collaborations. We also compute the corresponding relic gravitational wave background due to tensor perturbations and show that future space-borne interferometers, such as DECIGO, BBO and ALIA, may be able to detect it. Next, we extend this analysis and establish the validity of these results in a multi-field model featuring an additional $R^2$ term in the action, which allows us to interpolate between natural and scalaron (a.k.a.~Starobinsky) inflation. We investigate the conditions under which the aforementioned future interferometers will have the capability to differentiate between pure natural inflation and natural-scalaron inflation. The latter analysis could open the door to distinguishing between single-field and multi-field inflation through gravitational wave observations in more general contexts.</description>

      <title>Two pseudo-Goldstone bosons in the Gildener-Weinberg model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a dimensionless multi-scalar extension of the Standard Model, Gildener and Weinberg assumed that along a flat direction, there is only one classically massless scalar, known as the "scalon", which acquires mass through radiative corrections \`a la Coleman-Weinberg, while all other scalars remain heavy. In this paper, by introducing a toy model with four scalar degrees of freedom we show that this assumption is not always correct. In fact, we demonstrate the existence of two scalons along a specific flat direction that we construct. We present the effective potential for the model and provide the masses of the heavy scalars and two radiatively light pseudo-Goldstone bosons.</description>

      <title>Binary black hole mergers and intermediate-mass black holes in dense star clusters with collisional runaways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are believed to be the missing link between the supermassive black holes (BHs) found at the centers of massive galaxies and BHs formed through stellar core collapse. One of the proposed mechanisms for their formation is a collisional runaway process in high-density young star clusters, where an unusually massive object forms through repeated stellar collisions and mergers, eventually collapsing to form an IMBH. This seed IMBH could then grow further through binary mergers with other stellar-mass BHs. Here we investigate the gravitational-wave (GW) signals produced during these later IMBH--BH mergers. We use a state-of-the-art semi-analytic approach to study the stellar dynamics and to characterize the rates and properties of IMBH--BH mergers. We also study the prospects for detection of these mergers by current and future GW observatories, both space-based (LISA) and ground-based (LIGO Voyager, Einstein Telescope, and Cosmic Explorer). We find that most of the merger signals could be detected, with some of them being multi-band sources. Therefore, GWs represent a unique tool to test the collisional runaway scenario and to constrain the population of dynamically assembled IMBHs.</description>

      <title>Infrared fixed point in the massless twelve-flavor SU(3) gauge-fermion system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present strong numerical evidence for the existence of an infrared fixed point in the renormalization group flow of the SU(3) gauge-fermion system with twelve massless fermions in the fundamental representation. Our numerical simulations using nHYP-smeared staggered fermions with Pauli-Villars improvement do not exhibit any first-order bulk phase transition in the investigated parameter region. We utilize an infinite volume renormalization scheme based on the gradient flow transformation to determine the renormalization group $\beta$ function. We identify an infrared fixed point at $g^2_{\mathrm{GF}\star}=6.60(62)$ in the GF scheme and calculate the leading irrelevant critical exponent $\gamma_{g}^{\star}=0.199(32)$. Our prediction for $\gamma_{g}^{\star}$ is consistent with available literature at the $1\mbox{-}2\sigma$ level.</description>

      <title>Yet another lattice formulation of 2D $U(1)$ chiral gauge theory via bosonization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, lattice formulations of Abelian chiral gauge theory in two dimensions have been devised on the basis of the Abelian bosonization. A salient feature of these two-dimensional lattice formulations is that the gauge invariance is \emph{exactly\/} preserved for anomaly-free theories and thus is completely free from the question of the gauge mode decoupling. In the present paper, we propose a yet another lattice formulation sharing this desired property. A particularly unique point in our formulation is that the vertex operator of the dual scalar field, which carries the vector charge of the fermion and the ``magnetic charge'' in the bosonization, is represented by a ``hole'' excised from the lattice; this is the excision method formulated recently by Abe et al. in a somewhat different context.</description>
