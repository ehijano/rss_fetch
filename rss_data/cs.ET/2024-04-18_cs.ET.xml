      <title>Simulating Cloud Environments of Connected Vehicles for Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of connected vehicles is driven by increasing customer and regulatory demands. To meet these, more complex software applications, some of which require service-based cloud and edge backends, are developed. When new software is deployed however, the high complexity and interdependencies between components can lead to unforeseen side effects in other system parts. As such, it becomes more challenging to recognize whether deviations to the intended system behavior are occurring, ultimately resulting in higher monitoring efforts and slower responses to errors. To overcome this problem, a simulation of the cloud environment running in parallel to the system is proposed. This approach enables the live comparison between simulated and real cloud behavior. Therefore, a concept is developed mirroring the existing cloud system into a simulation. To collect the necessary data, an observability platform is presented, capturing telemetry and architecture information. Subsequently, a simulation environment is designed that converts the architecture into a simulation model and simulates its dynamic workload by utilizing captured communication data. The proposed concept is evaluated in a real-world application scenario for electric vehicle charging: Vehicles can apply for an unoccupied charging station at a cloud service backend, the latter which manages all incoming requests and performs the assignment. Benchmarks are conducted by comparing the collected telemetry data with the simulated results under different loads and injected faults. The results show that regular cloud behavior is mirrored well by the simulation and that misbehavior due to fault injection is well visible, indicating that simulations are a promising data source for anomaly detection in connected vehicle cloud environments during operation.</description>

      <title>RAGAR, Your Falsehood RADAR: RAG-Augmented Reasoning for Political Fact-Checking using Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The escalating challenge of misinformation, particularly in the context of political discourse, necessitates advanced solutions for fact-checking. We introduce innovative approaches to enhance the reliability and efficiency of multimodal fact-checking through the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG)- based advanced reasoning techniques. This work proposes two novel methodologies, Chain of RAG (CoRAG) and Tree of RAG (ToRAG). The approaches are designed to handle multimodal claims by reasoning the next questions that need to be answered based on previous evidence. Our approaches improve the accuracy of veracity predictions and the generation of explanations over the traditional fact-checking approach of sub-question generation with chain of thought veracity prediction. By employing multimodal LLMs adept at analyzing both text and images, this research advances the capability of automated systems in identifying and countering misinformation.</description>

      <title>Preserving Nature's Ledger: Blockchains in Biodiversity Conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the contemporary era, biodiversity conservation emerges as a paramount challenge, necessitating innovative approaches to monitoring, preserving, and enhancing the natural world. This paper explores the integration of blockchain technology in biodiversity conservation, offering a novel perspective on how digital resilience can be built within ecological contexts. Blockchain, with its decentralized and immutable ledger and tokenization affordances, presents a groundbreaking solution for the accurate monitoring and tracking of environmental assets, thereby addressing the critical need for transparency and trust in conservation efforts. Unlike previous more theoretical approaches, by addressing the research question of how blockchain supports digital resilience in biodiversity conservation, this study presents a grounded framework that justifies which blockchain features are essential to decipher specific data contribution and data leveraging processes in an effort to protect our planet's biodiversity, while boosting potential economic benefits for all actors involved, from local farmers, to hardware vendors and artificial intelligence experts, to investors and regular users, volunteers and donors.</description>
