      <title>Gauge field smearing and controlled continuum extrapolations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When designing lattice actions, gauge field smearing is often used in the definition of the lattice Dirac operator. Too much smearing can result in uncontrolled continuum extrapolations as the short distance behaviour of the theory is mutilated, which is a situation to be avoided. As a smearing prescription we focus on the gradient flow formalism as it allows to study both smearing and physical flow simultaneously. We investigate the effect of smearing and physical flow on the scaling towards the continuum limit in pure gauge theory. We focus on the example of Creutz ratios, which provide a measure of the physical forces felt by the fermions. For suitable smearing strengths we further investigate the impact of replacing the Wilson gradient flow by stout smearing.</description>

      <title>Building Hadron Potentials from Lattice QCD with Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we develop a deep learning method to learn hadronic interactions unsupervisedly from the correlation functions calculated in lattice QCD simulations. We present our approach of using deep neural networks to model the inter-hadron potentials that are learned from Nambu-Bethe-Salpeter (NBS) wave functions. This enables the incorporation of most general forms of potentials into the Schr\"odinger-type equation for detailed analysis of hadronic interactions. Our results include validations with separable potentials, as well as the local and non-local potentials for the $\Omega_{ccc}-\Omega_{ccc}$ system. The neural networks accurately capture the essential features of these interactions, providing a reliable tool for predicting and analyzing hadron scattering properties, potentially bridging the experimental observables and lattice QCD data.</description>

      <title>Moments of Axial-Vector GPD from Lattice QCD: Quark Helicity, Orbital Angular Momentum, and Spin-Orbit Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a lattice QCD calculation of the Mellin moments of the twist-2 axial-vector generalized parton distribution (GPD), $\widetilde{H}(x,\xi,t)$, at zero skewness, $\xi$, with multiple values of the momentum transfer, $t$. Our analysis employs the short-distance factorization framework on ratio-scheme renormalized quasi-GPD matrix elements. The calculations are based on an $N_f=2+1+1$ twisted mass fermions ensemble with clover improvement, a lattice spacing of $a = 0.093$ fm, and a pion mass of $m_\pi = 260$ MeV. We consider both the iso-vector and iso-scalar cases, utilizing next-to-leading-order perturbative matching while ignoring the disconnected contributions and gluon mixing in the iso-scalar case. For the first time, we determine the Mellin moments of $\widetilde{H}$ up to the fifth order. From these moments, we discuss the quark helicity and orbital angular momentum contributions to the nucleon spin, as well as the spin-orbit correlations of the quarks. Additionally, we perform a Fourier transform over the momentum transfer, which allows us to explore the spin structure in the impact-parameter space.</description>

      <title>Exploring gauge-fixing conditions with gradient-based optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice gauge fixing is required to compute gauge-variant quantities, for example those used in RI-MOM renormalization schemes or as objects of comparison for model calculations. Recently, gauge-variant quantities have also been found to be more amenable to signal-to-noise optimization using contour deformations. These applications motivate systematic parameterization and exploration of gauge-fixing schemes. This work introduces a differentiable parameterization of gauge fixing which is broad enough to cover Landau gauge, Coulomb gauge, and maximal tree gauges. The adjoint state method allows gradient-based optimization to select gauge-fixing schemes that minimize an arbitrary target loss function.</description>

      <title>Sampling SU(3) pure gauge theory with Stochastic Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium Monte Carlo simulations based on Jarzynski's equality are a well-understood method to compute differences in free energy and also to sample from a target probability distribution without the need to thermalize the system under study. In each evolution, the system starts from a given base distribution at equilibrium and it is gradually driven out-of-equilibrium while evolving towards the target parameters. If the target distribution suffers from long autocorrelation times, this approach represents a promising candidate to mitigate critical slowing down. Out-of-equilibrium evolutions are conceptually similar to Normalizing Flows and they can be combined into a recently-developed architecture called Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNFs). In this contribution we first focus on the promising scaling with the volume guaranteed by the purely stochastic approach in the $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory in 4 dimensions; then, we define an SNF by introducing gauge-equivariant layers between the out-of-equilibrium Monte Carlo updates, and we analyse the improvement obtained as well as the inherited scaling with the volume. Finally, we discuss how this approach can be systematically improved and how simulations of lattice gauge theories in four dimensions for large volumes and close to criticality can be realistically achieved.</description>

      <title>Nonmonotonic specific entropy on the transition line near the QCD critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) critical point on the isentropic trajectories in the QCD phase diagram. We point out that the universality of the critical equation of state and the third law of thermodynamics require the specific entropy (per baryon) along the coexistence (first-order transition) line to be nonmonotonic at least on one side of that line. Specifically, a maximum must occur. We show how the location of the maximum relative to the QCD critical point depends on the parameters of the critical equation of state commonly used in the literature. We then examine how the isentropic trajectories followed by adiabatically expanding heavy-ion collision fireballs behave near the critical point. We find that a crucial role is played by the sign of the isochoric temperature derivative of pressure at the critical point; this sign determines on which side of the coexistence curve the specific entropy must be nonmonotonic (i.e., has a maximum). We classify different scenarios of the adiabatic expansion that arise depending on the value of the discriminant parameter and the proximity of the trajectory to the critical point.</description>

      <title>Cross Validation in Stochastic Analytic Continuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06763v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Analytic Continuation (SAC) of Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) imaginary-time correlation function data is a valuable tool in connecting many-body models to experimentally measurable dynamic response functions. Recent developments of the SAC method have allowed for spectral functions with sharp features, e.g. narrow peaks and divergent edges, to be resolved with unprecedented fidelity. Often times, it is not known what exact sharp features, if any, are present \textit{a priori}, and, due to the ill-posed nature of the analytic continuation problem, multiple spectral representations may be acceptable. In this work, we borrow from the machine learning and statistics literature and implement a cross validation technique to provide an unbiased method to identify the most likely spectrum amongst a set obtained with different spectral parameterizations and imposed constraints. We demonstrate the power of this method with examples using imaginary-time data generated by QMC simulations and synthetic data generated from artificial spectra. Our procedure, which can be considered a form of model selection, can be applied to a variety of numerical analytic continuation methods, beyond just SAC.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative determination of the ${\cal N} = 1$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills gluino condensate at large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first nonperturbative large-$N$ calculation of the $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric (SUSY) $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang$-$Mills gluino condensate obtained by means of numerical simulations of the lattice-discretized theory, exploiting large-$N$ twisted volume reduction. We present two different determinations based, respectively, on the Banks$-$Casher formula and on the Gell-Mann$-$Oakes$-$Renner relation, both giving perfectly consistent results. By expressing the lattice results in the Novikov$-$Shifman$-$Vainshtein$-$Zakharov (NSVZ) scheme, we are able for the first time to compare numerical and analytic computations. Our most accurate determination of the Renormalization Group Invariant (RGI) gluino condensate gives $\Sigma_{\rm RGI} /\Lambda_{\rm NSVZ}^3 = [1.18\, (08)_{\rm stat}\, (12)_{\rm syst}]^3 = 1.64(33)_{\rm stat} \, (50)_{\rm syst} = 1.64(60)$, in agreement with the $N$-dependence and the value predicted by the weak coupling instanton-based approach $\Sigma_{\rm RGI} /\Lambda_{\rm NSVZ}^3 = 1$.</description>

      <title>Curvature perturbations from kinetic preheating after $\alpha$-attractor inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preheating at the end of inflation is a violent nonlinear process that efficiently transfers the energy of the inflaton to a second field, the preheat field. When the preheat field is light during inflation and its background value modulates the preheating process, the superhorizon isocurvature perturbations of the preheat field may be converted to curvature perturbations that leave an imprint on the cosmic microwave background and the large-scale structure of the universe. We use high-precision lattice simulations to study kinetic preheating after $\alpha$-attractor inflation, a case where the effective mass of the preheat field is naturally suppressed during inflation. By comparing the expansion e-folds between different Hubble patches, we find that the conversion from isocurvature perturbations to curvature perturbations is very inefficient and can hardly be detected by cosmological observations.</description>
