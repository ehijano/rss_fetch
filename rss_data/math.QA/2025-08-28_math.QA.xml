      <title>On an analogue of Frobenius formalism for 3-algebras and pentagon equations solutions arising from projectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ruth J.Lawrence introduced a notion of a 3-algebra to construct invariants of 3-manifolds based on their triangulations in her paper "Algebras and triangular relations". Her primary definition is suitable for certain triangulations only although a hint to handle arbitrary ones has been proposed. Here I introduce an analogue of Frobenius compatibility for one class of 3-algebras hence I obtain a way to construct a full 3-algebra. Additionally, I provide with examples of a 3-algebra and invariants for lens spaces. Moreover, it leads to a new family of pentagon equations solutions: arising from projectors.</description>

      <title>Centers and representations of the ${\rm SL}_n$ quantum Teichm{\"u}ller Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the center of the balanced Fock-Goncharov algebra and determine its rank over the center when the quantum parameter is a root of unity. These results have potential applications to the study of the center and rank of the ${\rm SL}_n$-skein algebra. Building on this computation, we classify the irreducible representations of the balanced Fock-Goncharov algebra.
  Due to the Frobenius homomorphism, every irreducible representation of the (projected) ${\rm SL}_n$-skein algebra of a punctured surface $\mathfrak{S}$ determines a point in the ${\rm SL}_n$ character variety of $\mathfrak{S}$, known as the classical shadow of the representation. By pulling back the irreducible representations of the balanced Fock-Goncharov algebra via the quantum trace map, we show that there exists a ``large'' subset of the ${\rm SL}_n$ character variety such that, for any point in this subset, there exists an irreducible representation of the (projected) ${\rm SL}_n$-skein algebra whose classical shadow is this point. Finally, we prove that, under mild conditions, the representations of the ${\rm SL}_n$-skein algebra obtained in this way are independent of the choice of ideal triangulation.</description>

      <title>Morita invariants of quasitriangular comodule algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use representations of braid groups of Coxeter types BC and D to produce invariants of representation categories of quasitriangular comodule algebras. Such categories form a prevalent class of braided module categories. This is analogous to how representations of braid groups of Coxeter type A produce invariants of representation categories of quasitriangular Hopf algebras, a prevalent class of braided monoidal categories. This work also includes concrete examples, and classification results for $K$-matrices of quasitriangular comodule algebras.</description>

      <title>Generalized Macdonald functions and quantum toroidal gl(1) algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Macdonald operator is known to coincide with a certain element of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$ algebra in the Fock representation of levels $(1,0)$. A generalization of this operator to higher levels $(r,0)$ can be built using the coproduct structure, it is diagonalized by the generalized Macdonald symmetric functions, indexed by $r$-tuple partitions and depending on $r$ alphabets. In this paper, we extend to the generalized case some of the known formulas obeyed by ordinary Macdonald symmetric functions, such as the $e_1$-Pieri rule or the identity relating them to Whittaker vectors obtained by Garsia, Haiman, and Tesler. We also propose a generalization of the five-term relation, and the Fourier/Hopf pairing. In addition, we prove the factorized expression of the generalized Macdonald kernel conjectured previously by Zenkevich.</description>

      <title>Optimal Remainder Estimates in the Quantization of Complex Projective Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Berezin-Toeplitz quantization of complex projective spaces $\mathbb{CP}^{d-1}$ and obtain full asymptotic expansions of the Berezin transformation and of products of Toeplitz operators. In each case, the remainder is controlled by the next term of the expansion, either through a positivity-preserving transformation or via an operator inequality. This leads to bounds which are optimal in terms of the required regularity and feature sharp or asymptotically sharp constants.</description>

      <title>Generalized Charges, Part II: Non-Invertible Symmetries and the Symmetry TFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17159v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a d-dimensional quantum field theory (QFT) $\mathfrak{T}$, with a generalized symmetry $\mathcal{S}$, which may or may not be invertible. We study the action of $\mathcal{S}$ on generalized or $q$-charges, i.e. $q$-dimensional operators. The main result of this paper is that $q$-charges are characterized in terms of the topological defects of the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) of $\mathcal{S}$, also known as the ``Sandwich Construction''. The SymTFT is a $(d+1)$-dimensional topological field theory, which encodes the symmetry $\mathcal{S}$ and the physical theory in terms of its boundary conditions. Our proposal applies quite generally to any finite symmetry $\mathcal{S}$, including non-invertible, categorical symmetries. Mathematically, the topological defects of the SymTFT form the Drinfeld Center of the symmetry category $\mathcal{S}$. Applied to invertible symmetries, we recover the result of Part I of this series of papers. After providing general arguments for the identification of $q$-charges with the topological defects of the SymTFT, we develop this program in detail for QFTs in 2d (for general fusion category symmetries) and 3d (for fusion 2-category symmetries).</description>

      <title>A basic triad in Macdonald theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the context of wavefunctions of integrable many-body systems, rational multivariable Baker-Akhiezer (BA) functions were introduced by O. Chalykh, M. Feigin and A. Veselov and, in the case of the trigonometric Ruijsenaars-Schneider system, can be associated with a reduction of the Macdonald symmetric polynomials at $t=q^{-m}$ with integer partition labels substituted by arbitrary complex numbers. A parallel attempt to describe wavefunctions of the bispectral trigonometric Ruijsenaars-Schneider problem was made by M. Noumi and J. Shiraishi who proposed a power series that reduces to the Macdonald polynomials at particular values of parameters. It turns out that this power series also reduces to the BA functions at $t=q^{-m}$, as we demonstrate in this letter. This makes the Macdonald polynomials, the BA functions and the Noumi-Shiraishi (NS) series a closely tied {\it triad} of objects, which have very different definitions, but are straightforwardly related with each other. In particular, theory of the BA functions provides a nice system of simple linear equations, while the NS functions provide a nice way to represent the multivariable BA function explicitly with arbitrary number of variables.</description>
