      <title>STILTS-NLI: A Natural Language Interface for STILTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Starlink Tables Infrastructure Library Tool Set (STILTS) is a powerful suite for astronomical data analysis, particularly useful when dealing with large datasets. However, like other software suites in astronomy its comprehensive syntax creates a significant learning curve to new users. To address this, we present STILTS-NLI, a natural language interface that generates STILTS commands from user prompts, with agentic support for a user-friendly experience. We developed STILTS-NLI by fine-tuning a compact, open-source Large Language Model (LLM) on a synthetically generated dataset. This dataset was curated and validated to ensure both comprehensive coverage of key STILTS functionalities and the syntactic correctness of the resulting commands. Our results demonstrate that this specialised model generates valid commands that match and in some cases outperform larger proprietary models. By leveraging small, open-source models, STILTS-NLI provides an accessible, low-resource solution that lowers the barrier to entry for using STILTS.</description>

      <title>WFST Astrometric Calibration -- I. Modeling Global Geometric Distortion with Zernike Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of geometric distortion is essential for precise astrometric calibration in wide-field imaging surveys. We present a self-calibration method based on Zernike polynomials, applied to imaging data from the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST). Our approach constructs a global geometric distortion (GD) model from the position offsets of stars in the WFST r-band relative to Gaia DR3, achieving a median systematic uncertainty of below 10 mas for individual exposures. The correspondence between Zernike polynomials and optical aberrations reveals that the global GD of WFST is dominated by coma, inherent to the optical design, while rapid variations are likely attributed to the atmospheric dispersion corrector. Applying this method to 82 exposures from a single night (20250218), we find that the relative positions of the WFST CCDs remain stable, with standard deviations of less than 0.1 pixel in translation and 1.8 arcsec in rotation. The corrected WFST astrometric system is thereby tied to the Gaia DR3 coordinate frame, with further refinements to be presented in future work.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating Single Photon Counting with Kinetic Inductance Detectors from 3.8 to 25 $\mu$m</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the primary objectives of modern astronomy is the atmospheric characterization of Earth-like exoplanets at visible and infrared wavelengths. Achieving this goal requires extremely sensitive detectors capable of measuring faint signal of the exoplanet at the single-photon level while maintaining near-zero dark count rates. In the infrared, however, conventional semiconducting detector technologies struggle to meet these stringent requirements. In this work we demonstrate single-photon counting with superconducting Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors at the wavelengths 3.8, 8.5, 18.5, and 25 $\mu$m and measure resolving powers ($E/\delta E$) of 9.9, 5.9, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively, with corresponding dark count rates of 4, 8, 34, and 48 mHz. Our membrane-based devices reach phonon-loss limited performance at 3.8 $\mu$m, more than doubling the performance attainable with comparable solid-substrate devices. These results showcase the detector technology in the mid-infrared and the intricate measurement setup required for these sensitive detectors. We discuss how the detector design and measurement setup can be further optimized to increase the detector performance in the mid-infrared.</description>

      <title>Phase-Induced Amplitude Apodization Complex Mask Coronagraph (PIAACMC) on-sky demonstration with MagAO-X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancing the technological development of small inner working angle (IWA) coronagraphs is essential to enabling high-contrast imaging of temperate exoplanets with future extremely large telescopes. The PIAACMC has been shown to closely approach the theoretical limit for coronagraphic throughput but its performance has not been fully characterised on-sky. This study serves as the first on-sky characterisation of contrast and IWA performance of the PIAACMC and its first technological demonstration at sub-micron wavelengths. We designed and manufactured phase-shifting focal plane masks optimised for two cases, a narrowband 875 filter (875nm, 3% band) and a broadband z' filter (908nm, 14% band). We tested the coronagraphs both with an internal source and on-sky using MagAOX, the extreme adaptive optics instrument for the Magellan Clay 6.5 m telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. We show good recovery of the off-axis light's PSF shape within 92% and 97% depending on the separation when aligning the inverse set of PIAA lenses. We demonstrate sub-lambda/D IWAs of about 0.74 lambda/D in 875 and 0.76 lambda/D in z'. We reach average raw contrasts within 1 and 5 lambda/D with the internal source of about 1.6e-3 in 875 and 1.3e-3 in z'. These are mainly limited by the focal plane mask manufacturing errors, jitter, and residual quasi-static speckles in MagAO-X. We also show on-sky average raw contrasts within 1 and 5 lambda/D of about 1.4e-2 in 875 and 7.8e-3 in z'. These are likely limited by wavefront control, low-order aberrations, and poor observing conditions. Future work will improve the design and manufacturing processes of the focal plane masks to improve robustness and reach deeper contrast, as well as integrate focal plane wavefront control for non-common path aberrations correction.</description>

      <title>A High-Throughput AES-GCM Implementation on GPUs for Secure, Policy-Based Access to Massive Astronomical Catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The era of large astronomical surveys generates massive image catalogs requiring efficient and secure access, particularly during pre-publication periods where data confidentiality and integrity are paramount. While Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles guide the eventual public dissemination of data, traditional security methods for restricted phases often lack granularity or incur prohibitive performance penalties. To address this, we present a framework that integrates a flexible policy engine for fine-grained access control with a novel GPU-accelerated implementation of the AES-GCM authenticated encryption protocol.
  The novelty of this work lies in the adaptation and optimization of a parallel tree-reduction strategy to overcome the main performance bottleneck in authenticated encryption on GPUs: the inherently sequential Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) authentication hash (GHASH). We present both the algorithmic adaptation and its efficient execution on GPU architectures. Although similar parallelization techniques have been explored in cryptographic research, this is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of their integration into a high-throughput encryption framework specifically designed for large-scale astronomical data. Our implementation transforms the sequential GHASH computation into a highly parallelizable, logarithmic-time process, achieving authenticated encryption throughput suitable for petabyte-scale image analysis.
  Our solution provides a robust mechanism for data providers to enforce access policies, ensuring both confidentiality and integrity without hindering research workflows, thereby facilitating a secure and managed transition of data to public, FAIR archives.</description>

      <title>Deep ensemble graph neural networks for probabilistic cosmic-ray direction and energy reconstruction in autonomous radio arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using advanced machine learning techniques, we developed a method for reconstructing precisely the arrival direction and energy of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays from the voltage traces they induced on ground-based radio detector arrays.
  In our approach, triggered antennas are represented as a graph structure, which serves as input for a graph neural network (GNN). By incorporating physical knowledge into both the GNN architecture and the input data, we improve the precision and reduce the required size of the training set with respect to a fully data-driven approach. This method achieves an angular resolution of 0.092{\deg} and an electromagnetic energy reconstruction resolution of 16.4% on simulated data with realistic noise conditions.
  We also employ uncertainty estimation methods to enhance the reliability of our predictions, quantifying the confidence of the GNN's outputs and providing confidence intervals for both direction and energy reconstruction. Finally, we investigate strategies to verify the model's consistency and robustness under real life variations, with the goal of identifying scenarios in which predictions remain reliable despite domain shifts between simulation and reality.</description>

      <title>The global structure of the time delay likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a fundamental pathology in the likelihood for time delay inference which challenges standard inference methods. By analysing the likelihood for time delay inference with Gaussian process light curve models, we show that it generically develops a boundary-driven "W"-shape with a global maximum at the true delay and gradual rises towards the edges of the observation window. This arises because time delay estimation is intrinsically extrapolative. In practice, global samplers such as nested sampling are steered towards spurious edge modes unless strict convergence criteria are adopted. We demonstrate this with simulations and show that the effect strengthens with higher data density over a fixed time span. To ensure convergence, we provide concrete guidance, notably increasing the number of live points. Further, we show that methods implicitly favouring small delays, for example optimisers and local MCMC, induce a bias towards larger $H_0$. Our results clarify failure modes and offer practical remedies for robust fully Bayesian time delay inference.</description>

      <title>PICASO 4.0: Clouds and Photochemistry in Climate Models of Brown Dwarfs and Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a major update to the open-source atmospheric modeling package \texttt{PICASO}, designed for simulating the thermal structure and spectra of hydrogen-rich atmospheres of brown dwarfs and exoplanets. This release, \texttt{PICASO 4.0}, expands upon the existing radiative-convective equilibrium model framework by incorporating several new capabilities. Key additions include the integration of \texttt{Virga} for self-consistent cloud modeling, new flexible treatments for rainout and cold trapping of volatile species, and support for photochemistry. We also introduce a parameterized energy injection scheme to simulate additional external or internal heating processes. These features are motivated by lessons from recent JWST observations that reveal the prevalence of non-equilibrium chemistry and clouds. We benchmark the new functionalities against previously published results in the literature, including the Sonora Diamondback grid, energy injected atmospheres, patchy cloud models, and other photochemical models of WASP-39b. \texttt{PICASO} continues to be actively developed as an open-source package aimed at enabling reproducible, community-driven atmospheric modeling of all substellar objects.</description>

      <title>Automated Identification of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch in Globular Clusters with Gaia Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces an automated approach for identifying the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) in globular clusters, combining astronomical data with algorithmic methods. Using a dataset of 160 globular clusters and Python scripts, we matched stellar sources with Gaia data. Our script generates color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), and uses the local outlier factor (LOF) algorithm to remove outliers. Applying a second-degree polynomial to fit red giant branch (RGB), we identify the TRGB as the star closest to the fitted curve's endpoint. By this method, we expanded TRGB samples in global clusters to 91 with newer observational data. Our results show a decreasing trend in I-band luminosity for metallicities greater than $-$1, consistent with previous studies. The results show a robust trend fitting and the $\rm M_{I}$ of TRGB is about $-$4.02 with extremely low metallicity. Our approach enhances TRGB identification efficiency while providing valuable insights for developing automatic tools in astronomical data analysis.</description>

      <title>Beyond Colors: Probing Redshifts from Galaxy Morphology in Single-band Images with ViT-MDNz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To address the challenge of estimating redshifts when only single-band images are available, this study introduces a deep learning model named ViT-MDNz. Leveraging robust statistical priors learned from large-scale data concerning the correlation between redshift and morphology, the model can directly estimate redshifts and their associated uncertainties from single-band galaxy images. It integrates a Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract deep morphological features and a Mixture Density Network (MDN) to predict the full redshift probability density function. Trained and evaluated on approximately 300,000 single-band images from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DESI-LS), the model achieves a normalized median absolute deviation $\sigma_{\rm NMAD} = 0.034$ and an outlier fraction $f_{\rm out} = 2.6\%$ in the $r$-band for redshifts up to $z \lesssim 1$. Evaluations using probability integral transform (PIT) and continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) confirm that the predicted probability density functions are well calibrated and closely match the true distribution. These results demonstrate that competitive redshift estimates can be obtained using morphological features alone, and that incorporating color information further enhances the accuracy and robustness of the estimation. Therefore, ViT-MDNz provides a practical approach for redshift estimation of galaxy samples with limited photometric band coverage, contributing to improved completeness and usability of redshift catalogs for future large-scale surveys such as DESI and LSST.</description>

      <title>The ASKAP Variables and Slow Transients (VAST) Extragalactic Survey - Data Release 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Variables and Slow Transients (VAST) Survey on the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) is designed to systematically explore the dynamic radio sky, detecting sources that vary on timescales from minutes to several years. In this paper, we present Data Release 1 of the VAST Extragalactic Survey, which targets slowly evolving synchrotron transients in the southern sky. The observations were carried out between June 2023 and May 2025, comprising 2945 images of 276 fields spanning $\sim 12300\ \mathrm{deg}^2$, observed at 888 MHz with a typical rms sensitivity of 0.24 mJy $\rm{beam}^{-1}$ and 12-20 arcsec resolution. Each field was revisited approximately every two months, yielding 10 or 11 observations per field. The VAST pipeline extracts the light curves for all the observed sources, and additional filters are implemented to improve the reliability of the resulting light curve database. The light curve database contains 0.5 million sources and 6.4 million individual measurements, publicly available through the CSIRO data access portal. An untargeted variability search yields 117 astrophysical variables, including 27 pulsars, 40 radio stars (10 newly detected at radio wavelengths), 44 active galactic nuclei, two optically identified supernovae, one supernova candidate, one brown dwarf, and two sources without multi-wavelength counterparts that are yet to be identified. This data release provides the first large-scale, high-cadence, uniform view of long-term radio variability in the extragalactic sky and lays the groundwork for future population studies of radio transients with ASKAP.</description>

      <title>Trial dispersion measure spacing in fast radio burst searches with HEIMDALL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are brief flashes of emission detectable to cosmological distances. Cosmology applications rely on an understanding of how the detected sample relates to the underlying population. To this end we examine the dispersion measure `tolerance' parameter employed by the FRB search tool \textsc{heimdall} and provide the relation between this and minimum search depth. Several FRB samples can be `retro-fitted' using this to more properly account for survey completeness.</description>

      <title>TEPCat: The Transiting Extrasolar Planet Catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transiting extrasolar planets are extraordinarily valuable for understanding the characteristics and formation of planets, because they are the only exoplanets whose physical and orbital properties can be measured to high precision. Thousands are now known, and it is important to maintain a database of them for use by the scientific community. TEPCat performs this task: it is a critical compilation of the physical and observable properties of the known transiting planetary systems. This work introduces the motivation for TEPCat, its scope, contents, and implementation. Example plots of interesting quantities are constructed. The classification of planets and of the eclipse features in their light curves is discussed. TEPCat is maintained and freely available online at https://www.astro.keele.ac.uk/jkt/tepcat/</description>

      <title>Exploring Ambient Radio Frequency Emissions</title>

Abstract: Radio astronomy observatories, such as the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory in Penticton, British Columbia, try to limit radio frequency interference to observe incredibly faint astronomical signals. These protective measures include placing observatories in geographically remote locations, the implementation of radio-frequency-interference-free quiet zones, or removal of interference in data processing. In 2018, we set out to explore how necessary radio-quiet zones are, by studying the radio frequency emission around the Observatory and around our local environment in Calgary, Alberta. We studied five well-used radio frequency bands and found the emission to be variable and environment dependent. While the radio frequency environment has changed since then, as a consequence of increased satellite activity and other forms of emission, we present these results as documentation of the past environment with the aim to redo the measurements. Overall, as there is use from both public and private services across the radio spectrum, protective measures at astronomical observatories are essential to reduce radio frequency interference.</description>

      <title>A Semi-Supervised Learning Method for the Identification of Bad Exposures in Large Imaging Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the data volume of astronomical imaging surveys rapidly increases, traditional methods for image anomaly detection, such as visual inspection by human experts, are becoming impractical. We introduce a machine-learning-based approach to detect poor-quality exposures in large imaging surveys, with a focus on the DECam Legacy Survey (DECaLS) in regions of low extinction (i.e., $E(B-V)&lt;0.04$). Our semi-supervised pipeline integrates a vision transformer (ViT), trained via self-supervised learning (SSL), with a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier. We train and validate our pipeline using a small set of labeled exposures observed by surveys with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam). A clustering-space analysis of where our pipeline places images labeled in ``good'' and ``bad'' categories suggests that our approach can efficiently and accurately determine the quality of exposures. Applied to new imaging being reduced for DECaLS Data Release 11, our pipeline identifies 780 problematic exposures, which we subsequently verify through visual inspection. Being highly efficient and adaptable, our method offers a scalable solution for quality control in other large imaging surveys.</description>

      <title>Denoising the Deep Sky: Physics-Based CCD Noise Formation for Astronomical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astronomical imaging remains noise-limited under practical observing conditions. Standard calibration pipelines remove structured artifacts but largely leave stochastic noise unresolved. Although learning-based denoising has shown strong potential, progress is constrained by scarce paired training data and the requirement for physically interpretable models in scientific workflows. We propose a physics-based noise synthesis framework tailored to CCD noise formation in the telescope. The pipeline models photon shot noise, photo-response non-uniformity, dark-current noise, readout effects, and localized outliers arising from cosmic-ray hits and hot pixels. To obtain low-noise inputs for synthesis, we stack multiple unregistered exposures to produce high-SNR bases. Realistic noisy counterparts synthesized from these bases using our noise model enable the construction of abundant paired datasets for supervised learning. Extensive experiments on our real-world multi-band dataset curated from two ground-based telescopes demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in both photometric and scientific accuracy.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov analysis of pulsar TOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kolmogorov stochasticity parameter (KSP) as a sensitive descriptor of the degree of randomness of signals was used to analyze the properties of the NANOGrav pulsar timing data associated with a stochastic gravitational wave background. The time of arrival (TOA) data of white noise for 68 pulsars were analyzed regarding their KSP properties. The analysis enabled us to obtain the degree of randomness of the white noise for various pulsars and to reveal its inhomogeneity, i.e., pulsars with low and high randomness of the white noise. The time dependence of the randomness in the white noise was also studied, indicating the existence of nonstationary physical processes influencing the pulsar timing. The KSP is thus acting as an indicator for the degree of the agreement between the observations and the timing models and as a test in revealing the contribution of various physical processes in the stochastic background signal.</description>

      <title>Fundamental quantum limits for detecting ultrahigh frequency gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ultrahigh-frequency (above 10 kHz) gravitational waves (GW) window provides a unique opportunity to detect primordial GWs, free from astrophysical foregrounds that dominate lower frequencies. A stochastic GW background in this range is generically predicted from cosmological phase transitions and topological defects associated with grand unification and other ultra-high energy theories. We establish a universal quantum limit framework for various detection schemes, setting a fundamental bound on GW detectability. Our analysis reveals that backgrounds in the kHz-MHz range are in principle observable, whereas higher-frequency signals lie below the quantum limit. These results offer theoretical guidance for future detector designs and open new avenues for probing early universe physics.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Zoo: Cosmic Dawn -- morphological classifications for over 41,000 galaxies in the Euclid Deep Field North from the Hawaii Two-0 Cosmic Dawn survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present morphological classifications of over 41,000 galaxies out to $z_{\rm phot}\sim2.5$ across six square degrees of the Euclid Deep Field North (EDFN) from the Hawaii Twenty Square Degree (H20) survey, a part of the wider Cosmic Dawn survey. Galaxy Zoo citizen scientists play a crucial role in the examination of large astronomical data sets through crowdsourced data mining of extragalactic imaging. This iteration, Galaxy Zoo: Cosmic Dawn (GZCD), saw tens of thousands of volunteers and the deep learning foundation model Zoobot collectively classify objects in ultra-deep multiband Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) imaging down to a depth of $m_{HSC-i} = 21.5$. Here, we present the details and general analysis of this iteration, including the use of Zoobot in an active learning cycle to improve both model performance and volunteer experience, as well as the discovery of 51 new gravitational lenses in the EDFN. We also announce the public data release of the classifications for over 45,000 subjects, including more than 41,000 galaxies (median $z_{\rm phot}$ of $0.42\pm0.23$), along with their associated image cutouts. This data set provides a valuable opportunity for follow-up imaging of objects in the EDFN as well as acting as a truth set for training deep learning models for application to ground-based surveys like that of the Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS) collaboration and the newly operational Vera C. Rubin Observatory.</description>

      <title>Constraining Power of Wavelet vs. Power Spectrum Statistics for CMB Lensing and Weak Lensing with Learned Binning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present forecasts for constraints on the matter density ($\Omega_m$) and the amplitude of matter density fluctuations at 8h$^{-1}$Mpc ($\sigma_8$) from CMB lensing convergence maps and galaxy weak lensing convergence maps. For CMB lensing convergence auto statistics, we compare the angular power spectra ($C_\ell$'s) to the wavelet scattering transform (WST) coefficients. For CMB lensing convergence $\times$ galaxy weak lensing convergence statistics, we compare the cross angular power spectra to wavelet phase harmonics (WPH). This work also serves as the first application of WST and WPH to these probes. For CMB lensing convergence, we find that WST and $C_\ell$'s yield similar constraints in forecasts for all surveys considered in this work. When CMB lensing convergence is crossed with galaxy weak lensing convergence projected from $\textit{Euclid}$ Data Release 2 (DR2), we find that WPH outperforms cross-$C_\ell$'s by factors between $2.2$ and $3.4$ for individual parameter constraints. To compare these different summary statistics, we develop a novel learned binning approach. This method compresses summary statistics while maintaining interpretability. We find this leads to improved constraints compared to more naive binning schemes for our wavelet-based statistics, but not for $C_\ell$'s. By learning the binning and measuring constraints on distinct data sets, our method is robust to overfitting by construction.</description>
