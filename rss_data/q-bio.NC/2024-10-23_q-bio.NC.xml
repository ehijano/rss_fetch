      <title>Cortical Dynamics of Neural-Connectivity Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Macroscopic studies of cortical tissue reveal a prevalence of oscillatory activity, that reflect a fine tuning of neural interactions. This research extends neural field theories by incorporating generalized oscillatory dynamics into previous work on conservative or semi-conservative neural field dynamics. Prior studies have largely assumed isotropic connections among neural units; however, this study demonstrates that a broad range of anisotropic and fluctuating connections can still sustain oscillations. Using Lagrangian field methods, we examine different types of connectivity, their dynamics, and potential interactions with neural fields. From this theoretical foundation, we derive a framework that incorporates Hebbian and non-Hebbian learning, i.e., plasticity, into the study of neural fields via the concept of a connectivity field.</description>

      <title>Topological and Graph Theoretical Analysis of Dynamic Functional Connectivity for Autism Spectrum Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a prevalent neurological disorder. However, the multi-faceted symptoms and large individual differences among ASD patients are hindering the diagnosis process, which largely relies on subject descriptions and lacks quantitative biomarkers. To remediate such problems, this paper explores the use of graph theory and topological data analysis (TDA) to study brain activity in ASD patients and normal controls. We employ the Mapper algorithm in TDA and the distance correlation graphical model (DCGM) in graph theory to create brain state networks, then innovatively adopt complex network metrics in Graph signal processing (GSP) and physical quantities to analyze brain activities over time. Our findings reveal statistical differences in network characteristics between ASD and control groups. Compared to normal subjects, brain state networks of ASD patients tend to have decreased modularity, higher von Neumann entropy, increased Betti-0 numbers, and decreased Betti-1 numbers. These findings attest to the biological traits of ASD, suggesting less transitioning in brain dynamics. These findings offer potential biomarkers for ASD diagnosis and deepen our understanding of its neural correlations.</description>

      <title>Gradient-Free Supervised Learning using Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity for Image Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An approach to supervised learning in spiking neural networks is presented using a gradient-free method combined with spike-timing-dependent plasticity for image recognition. The proposed network architecture is scalable to multiple layers, enabling the development of more complex and deeper SNN models. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by its application to the MNIST dataset, showing good learning accuracy. The proposed method provides a robust and efficient alternative to the backpropagation-based method in supervised learning.</description>

      <title>Real-time Sub-milliwatt Epilepsy Detection Implemented on a Spiking Neural Network Edge Inference Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to detect the epileptic seizure status of a subject presents a challenge to existing technologies aimed at providing timely and efficient diagnosis. In this study, we aimed to detect interictal and ictal periods of epileptic seizures using a spiking neural network (SNN). Our proposed approach provides an online and real-time preliminary diagnosis of epileptic seizures and helps to detect possible pathological conditions.To validate our approach, we conducted experiments using multiple datasets. We utilized a trained SNN to identify the presence of epileptic seizures and compared our results with those of related studies. The SNN model was deployed on Xylo, a digital SNN neuromorphic processor designed to process temporal signals. Xylo efficiently simulates spiking leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with exponential input synapses. Xylo has much lower energy requirments than traditional approaches to signal processing, making it an ideal platform for developing low-power seizure detection systems.Our proposed method has a high test accuracy of 93.3% and 92.9% when classifying ictal and interictal periods. At the same time, the application has an average power consumption of 87.4 uW(IO power) + 287.9 uW(computational power) when deployed to Xylo. Our method demonstrates excellent low-latency performance when tested on multiple datasets. Our work provides a new solution for seizure detection, and it is expected to be widely used in portable and wearable devices in the future.</description>

      <title>IdenBAT: Disentangled Representation Learning for Identity-Preserved Brain Age Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain age transformation aims to convert reference brain images into synthesized images that accurately reflect the age-specific features of a target age group. The primary objective of this task is to modify only the age-related attributes of the reference image while preserving all other age-irrelevant attributes. However, achieving this goal poses substantial challenges due to the inherent entanglement of various image attributes within features extracted from a backbone encoder, resulting in simultaneous alterations during the image generation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel architecture that employs disentangled representation learning for identity-preserved brain age transformation called IdenBAT. This approach facilitates the decomposition of image features, ensuring the preservation of individual traits while selectively transforming age-related characteristics to match those of the target age group. Through comprehensive experiments conducted on both 2D and full-size 3D brain datasets, our method adeptly converts input images to target age while retaining individual characteristics accurately. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates superiority over existing state-of-the-art regarding performance fidelity.</description>

      <title>On the control of recurrent neural networks using constant inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the controllability properties of a general class of recurrent neural networks that are widely used for hypothesis generation in theoretical neuroscience, including the modeling of large-scale human brain dynamics. Our study focuses on the control synthesis of such networks using constant and piecewise constant inputs, motivated by emerging applications in non-invasive neurostimulation such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). The neural network model considered is a continuous Hopfield-type system with nonlinear activation functions and arbitrary input matrices representing interactions among multiple brain regions. Our main contribution is the formulation and solution of a control synthesis problem for these nonlinear systems. We provide a proper generalization of the variation of the constants formula that constitutes a novel representation of the system's state trajectory. This representation admits a verifiable condition on the existence of the constant control input to solve a short-time two-point boundary value problem in the state space. This formulation admits a synthesis for the input in question, which can be realized using modern algorithmic optimization tools. In the case of linear activation functions, this analysis and synthesis reduces to the verification of algebraic conditions on the system matrices. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed control strategies. These results offer a novel control synthesis for an important class of neural network models that may, in turn, enable the design of brain stimulation protocols to modulate whole-brain activity in therapeutic and cognitive enhancement applications.</description>
