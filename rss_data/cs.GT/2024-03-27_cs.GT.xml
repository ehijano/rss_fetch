      <title>An Equilibrium Analysis of the Arad-Rubinstein Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colonel Blotto games with discrete strategy spaces effectively illus- trate the intricate nature of multidimensional strategic reasoning. This paper studies the equilibrium set of such games where, in line with prior experimental work, the tie-breaking rule is allowed to be flexible. We begin by pointing out that equilibrium constructions known from the literature extend to our class of games. However, we also note that, irrespective of the tie-breaking rule, the equilibrium set is excessively large. Specifically, any pure strategy that allocates at most twice the fair share to each battlefield is used with positive probability in some equilibrium. Furthermore, refinements based on the elimination of weakly dominated strategies prove ineffective. To derive specific predictions amid this multiplicity, we compute strategies resulting from long-run adaptive learning.</description>

      <title>So Long Sucker: Endgame Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: So Long Sucker is a strategy board game requiring 4 players, each with $c$ chips of their designated color, and a board made of $k$ empty piles. With a clear set-up come intricate rules, such as: players taking turns but not in a fixed order, agreements between some players being made and broken at any time, and a player winning the game even without any chips in hand.
  One of the main points of interest in studying this game, is finding when a player has a winning strategy. The game begins with four players that get eliminated successively until the winner is left. To study winning strategies, it is of interest to look at endgame situations. We present the following game set-up: there are two players left in the game, Blue and Red, and only their respective chip colors. In this paper, we characterize Blue's winning situations and strategies through inductive reasoning.</description>

      <title>Prediction-sharing During Training and Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two firms are engaged in a competitive prediction task. Each firm has two sources of data -- labeled historical data and unlabeled inference-time data -- and uses the former to derive a prediction model, and the latter to make predictions on new instances. We study data-sharing contracts between the firms. The novelty of our study is to introduce and highlight the differences between contracts that share prediction models only, contracts to share inference-time predictions only, and contracts to share both. Our analysis proceeds on three levels. First, we develop a general Bayesian framework that facilitates our study. Second, we narrow our focus to two natural settings within this framework: (i) a setting in which the accuracy of each firm's prediction model is common knowledge, but the correlation between the respective models is unknown; and (ii) a setting in which two hypotheses exist regarding the optimal predictor, and one of the firms has a structural advantage in deducing it. Within these two settings we study optimal contract choice. More specifically, we find the individually rational and Pareto-optimal contracts for some notable cases, and describe specific settings where each of the different sharing contracts emerge as optimal. Finally, in the third level of our analysis we demonstrate the applicability of our concepts in a synthetic simulation using real loan data.</description>

      <title>Multilinear formulations for computing Nash equilibrium of multi-player matrix games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present multilinear and mixed-integer multilinear programs to find a Nash equilibrium in multi-player noncooperative games. We compare the formulations to common algorithms in Gambit, and conclude that a multilinear feasibility program finds a Nash equilibrium faster than any of the methods we compare it to, including the quantal response equilibrium method, which is recommended for large games. Hence, the multilinear feasibility program is an alternative method to find a Nash equilibrium in multi-player games, and outperforms many common algorithms. The mixed-integer formulations are generalisations of known mixed-integer programs for two-player games, however unlike two-player games, these mixed-integer programs do not give better performance than existing algorithms.</description>
