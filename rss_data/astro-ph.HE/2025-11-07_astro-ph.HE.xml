      <title>Photon Orbit Signatures in Spectra of Black Hole Accretion Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light orbiting an accreting black hole may impact the disk or jet multiple times before escaping to the observer, at a variety of angles with respect to the local magnetic field. In this letter, we characterize the imprints of these long path lengths and disparate magnetic field impacts in synchrotron spectra of hot accretion disks, as the strongly lensed ``photon ring'' exhibits a higher synchrotron turnover frequency in each lensed sub-image. We apply tools of varying complexity: first, we develop a minimal, unlensed one-zone model that isolates the first two sub-images of the accretion flow. By varying the magnetic field geometry encountered by each sub-image, we show that distinctive spectral signatures emerge in both total intensity and fractional linear polarization. Second, we examine a semi-analytic radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) model, in which we find that there is generally a frequency at which the first indirect image outshines the direct image even in total flux density. Lastly, we demonstrate that even general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation snapshots show this spectral character. We find a typical correction to the unresolved spectrum of order $10\%$ near the turnover frequency that grows with increasing viewing inclination, growing to order unity at higher frequencies. We predict sensitive spectral studies of the cores of Messier 87* and Sagittarius A* at frequencies exceeding $300$ GHz to constrain the existence of the photon ring even without imaging, with prospects for photon ring detection even in other sources with unresolved shadows.</description>

      <title>Spectral Diversity in Type Ibn Supernovae and the Large Host Offset of SN2024acyl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first present observations of SN~2024acyl, a normal Type Ibn supernova with a large projected offset ($\sim$35~kpc) from its host galaxy. The low star-formation rate measured at the explosion site raises the possibility that the progenitor of SN~2024acyl may not have been a massive star. We then examine, more broadly, the spectral diversity of Type Ibn supernovae around 20--35 days after peak brightness and identify two distinct groups: Group I, which shows bluer rest-frame optical color and narrower He~I emission lines; and Group II, which shows redder rest-frame optical color and broader He~I lines. Group~I also tends to show higher peak luminosities. The diversity we identify appears to be closely connected to the diversity observed around peak and to persist into late phases ($&gt;80$ days after peak). Given its redder color and broader He~I lines, we classify SN~2024acyl as belonging to Group II. Based on the current dataset, we find no clear connection between this spectral diversity and either the host environments of Type Ibn SNe or their pre-explosion activity. The observed diversity in Type Ibn SNe likely reflects differences in circumstellar material properties and/or explosion energetics. These differences could result from a range of progenitor properties, such as different helium star mass, orbital period and companion type if they are in binary systems, and may indicate fundamentally diverse progenitors. Whether a continuous distribution exists between the two groups remains to be determined and will require further data to explore.</description>

      <title>Origin and Evolution of the $\Omega$ Structure in the Head-Tail Radio Galaxy of Abell 3322</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A head-tail galaxy is thought to be a radio galaxy with bent active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets interacting with the intracluster medium (ICM). Study of head-tail galaxies provides us with fruitful insights into the mechanisms of shock waves and turbulence, as well as magnetic-field amplification and cosmic-ray acceleration. A recent MeerKAT observation revealed that a head-tail galaxy in the galaxy cluster, Abell 3322, exhibits a peculiar ``Omega" structure in its shape. In this paper, we investigated this Omega-tail galaxy using the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). We found that the southern jet tends to be brighter than the northern jet, with a brightness ratio of about 2. This can be attributed to Doppler boost and the inclination of the jets. Our broadband data suggest that the radio spectrum becomes steeper along the jet propagation direction, and the cosmic-ray aging model with a weak reacceleration of cosmic rays is preferable to explain the index profile. We further found a gradient of the spectral index perpendicular to the jet propagation. We discussed the origin of the gradient and suggested that a shock wave along one side of the jets is present. The resultant ram pressure as well as the backflow made at the early stage of the jet may produce the tail component of this Omega-tail galaxy, while the observed Omega-shape structure is more likely due to a twin vortex seen in the low Reynolds number flow.</description>

      <title>Hadronic Processes in Advection-Dominated Accretion Flow as the Origin of TeV Excesses in BL Lac Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of certain BL Lac objects (BL Lacs) exhibit an additional hard $\gamma$-ray component in the TeV energy range that surpasses the predictions of the one-zone leptonic jet model. The origin of this excess emission remains unclear. In this study, we selected five BL Lacs whose SEDs display a very hard intrinsic spectrum in the TeV band and successfully reproduced their broadband SEDs using a two-zone lepto-hadronic model. Within this framework, the emission observed in the optical, X-ray, GeV $\gamma$-ray, and sub-TeV $\gamma$-ray bands is modeled using the synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton radiation processes of the relativistic electrons in the jets. Meanwhile, the TeV excess is attributed to $\gamma$-ray emission resulting from the photomeson ($p\gamma$) process via $\pi^0$ decay occurring within advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs). This scenario requires a hard proton spectrum with a spectral index of $p \sim 1.6-1.7$ and a cutoff energy ranging from 30 to 90 TeV, as well as a relatively large ADAF radius. Such hard proton spectra suggest that the dominant acceleration mechanisms are likely magnetic reconnection and/or stochastic acceleration processes within ADAFs. Additionally, the emission from the cascaded electrons results in a bump in the keV--MeV band; however, it is overwhelmed by the jet emission. Although the hadronuclear ($pp$) process cannot be entirely ruled out, it would necessitate an even harder proton spectrum and a higher cutoff energy compared to the $p\gamma$ process, making it a less favorable explanation for the observed TeV excess.</description>

      <title>Revealing an Oscillating and Contracting Compact Corona near the Event Horizon of the Supermassive Black Hole in 1ES 1927+654</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic processes in the accretion flow near black holes produce X-ray flux variability, sometimes quasi-periodic. Determining its physical origin is key to mapping accretion geometry but remains unresolved. We perform a novel phase-resolved analysis on a newly discovered quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in the active galactic nucleus 1ES 1927+654. For the first time in a supermassive black hole (SMBH), we detect a unique `U'-shaped QPO lag-energy spectrum and observe coronal spectral variability over the QPO phase. We find that the QPO is adequately explained by plasma resonant oscillations within a corona. Modeling of QPO spectral properties and reverberation mapping reveal that the corona is contracting and confined to only a few gravitational radii regions near the SMBH, consistent with theoretical predictions for a decreasing QPO period of near 10 minutes. These results present the first observational evidence for an oscillating and contracting compact corona around an SMBH.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a 9.67-s pulsar in an ultraluminous X-ray source in NGC 4631 with XMM-Newton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to a recent observation with XMM-Newton, we discovered periodic pulsations at P= 9.6652 +/- 0.0002 s in a new ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) in the galaxy NGC 4631. This source, dubbed as X-8, shows one of the largest spin-up rates ever observed, dP/dt = (-9.6 +/- 0.5)*1E-8 s/s. These findings indicate that the compact object is a neutron star, and X-8 is a new member of the pulsating ULX class. The 0.3-10 keV luminosity of X-8 is ~3.4E39 erg/s, and its X-ray spectrum can be described by an absorbed disk blackbody or a cut-off power law, similar to what is observed in other pulsating ULXs. We discuss two possible causes for the large spin-up rate: Doppler shift from orbital motion of the neutron star and intrinsic spin-up due to accretion torque. This new ULX pulsar adds a key source to the small known population, and will enable future studies to better constrain the physical mechanisms responsible for their super-Eddington luminosities.</description>

      <title>The TeV emission of 3C273: inverse Compton radiation from shear-accelerated high-energy electrons in the large-scale jet?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The VERITAS Collaboration recently reported the detection of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission from the prototypical radio quasar 3C273. The temporal and the spectral properties of this component do not appear compatible with the extrapolation of the beamed blazar-like emission of the inner, pc-scale jet. We explore the possibility that the VHE component is produced in the jet at kpc scale through the inverse Compton emission of a population of ultra-high energy electrons (with Lorentz factor $\gamma\sim 10^8$). In the model these electrons are accelerated through the shear acceleration mechanism, and they also account for the still puzzling X-ray emission of knots detected by {\it Chandra} in the large-scale jets of several powerful quasars (including 3C273). In our scenario the VHE component can be interpreted as the integrated emission from the two brightest knots of the 3C273 jet. We speculate that the decay of the emission on the timescale of $\sim 3$ years could be accounted for by the scenario if the VHE radiation is produced in some compact regions in the downstream flow of a recollimation shock.</description>

      <title>Environmental effects in stellar mass gravitational wave sources II: Joint detections of eccentricity and phase shifts in binary sub-populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the properties of eccentric gravitational wave (GW) signals enhance the detectability of GW phase shifts caused by environmental effects (EEs): The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEs can be boosted by up to $\ell_{\rm max}^{1 - n}$ with respect to corresponding circular signals, where $\ell_{\rm max}$ is the highest modeled eccentric GW harmonic and $n$ is the frequency scaling of the GW dephasing prescription associated to the EE. We investigate the impact on a population level, adopting plausible eccentricity distributions for binary sources observed by LIGO/Virgo/Kagra (A+ and A\# sensitivities), as well as Cosmic Explorer (CE) and the Einstein Telescope (ET). For sources in the high eccentricity tail of a distribution ($e \gtrsim 0.2$ at 10 Hz), phase shifts can systematically be up to $\ell_{\rm max}^{1 - n}$ times smaller than in a corresponding circular signal and still be detectable. For typical EEs, such as Roemer delays and gas drag, this effect amounts to SNR enhancements that range from $10^2$ up to $10^5$. For CE and ET, our analysis shows that EEs will be an ubiquitous feature in the eccentric tail of merging binaries, regardless of the specific details of the formation channel. Additionally, we find that the joint analysis of eccentricity and phase shift is already plausible in current catalogs if a fraction of binaries merge in AGN migration traps.</description>

      <title>Intermittency in Collisionless Large-Amplitude Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-amplitude turbulence -- characterized by a fluctuating magnetic field component, $\delta B$, that is stronger than the mean component, $B_0$ -- is generically intermittent, populated with intense localized structures such as sharp field-line bends and rapid field reversals. Recent MHD simulations suggest that these structures play an important role in particle transport and acceleration; however, MHD is inapplicable in most of our Universe, where the plasma is so hot or diffuse that Coulomb collisions are negligible. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the intermittent properties of collisionless large-amplitude turbulence in electron-positron plasmas via fully kinetic 3D simulations, exploring a wide range of $\delta B / B_0$ and scale separations between the turbulence driving scale, $L$, and kinetic scales, $c/\omega_{\rm p}$. The steady-state collisionless turbulence in our simulations broadly resembles that of MHD, but the development of pressure anisotropy steepens the scaling between magnetic field strength, $B$, and scalar field-line curvature, $K_\parallel$ -- yielding $B \propto K_\parallel^{-3/4}$ -- and consequently modifies the power-law slope of the probability density function of $K_\parallel$; this slope hardens from $K_\parallel^{-2.5}$ to $K_\parallel^{-2.0}$ as $\delta B / B_0$ increases from 4 to 140. Pressure anisotropy also triggers mirror and firehose instabilities, with the volume-filling fractions of these fluctuations increasing with $\delta B / B_0$; for our largest $\delta B / B_0$, $20\%$ of the volume is mirror-unstable and $6\%$ is firehose-unstable. Both the curvature and the Larmor-scale fluctuations in collisionless large-amplitude turbulence are expected to significantly influence cosmic ray transport and acceleration in the interstellar medium of our Galaxy and the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Constraints on Charged Black Holes in Scalar--Tensor--Vector Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore charged black holes in Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity (STVG), unveiling their distinctive features across multiple physical domains. Our topological analysis reveals that the STVG coupling parameter $\alpha$ bolsters thermal stability while electromagnetic charge $Q$ weakens it. Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we find that $\alpha$ amplifies light deflection and enlarges shadow silhouettes, with $Q$ generating opposite effects. Our quantum-corrected models with exponential entropy terms pinpoint phase transitions in the microscopic regime, modifying conventional thermodynamic relationships. Calculations of strong gravitational lensing, shadow geometry, and Hawking emission show clear STVG signatures that diverge from Einstein's predictions. Notably, our accretion disk analysis uncovers an intriguing phenomenon: specific combinations of $\alpha$ and $Q$ can produce radiation patterns resembling spinning Kerr black holes, creating potential identification challenges for observers. These findings establish concrete observational tests for STVG theory through next generation astronomical imaging and lensing campaigns. By connecting theoretical predictions to measurable quantities, we outline specific pathways to confirm or constrain STVG using data from current and future space telescopes.</description>

      <title>Stellar Evolution with Radiative Feedback in AGN Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars embedded in the inner pc region of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) experience extreme accretion conditions that significantly alter their evolution. We present one-dimensional MESA simulations of stars growing and decaying within AGN disks, implementing radiative-feedback-regulated accretion which limits stellar growth near the Eddington luminosity, as well as wind-driven mass loss. Unlike stand-alone stars in the field, these embedded stars follow unique evolutionary tracks with well-determined mass evolution and chemical yields. We distinguish two regimes: ``immortal" stars that indefinitely remain on the main sequence due to efficient hydrogen mixing; and ``metamorphic" stars that evolves off the main sequence, ultimately enriching the disk with heavy elements upon hydrogen and helium exhaustion in their cores. Results indicate that embedded stars in AGN disks can attain large masses, but gas retention and limited mixing likely render the ``immortal" track unsustainable. We show radiative feedback plays a critical role in preventing runaway growth, since it regulates the inflow to at most of order-unity the Eddington-limited mass-loss rate. Embedded metamorphic stars significantly enrich AGN disks with helium and $\alpha$-elements, potentially explaining the observed high metallicity in broad-line regions (BLR) without excessive helium enrichment. This study underscores the critical interplay between stellar feedback and accretion physics in shaping the stellar populations and chemical evolution within AGN disks.</description>

      <title>Event Reconstruction for Radio-Based In-Ice Neutrino Detectors with Neural Posterior Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos in the EeV range is the goal of current and future in-ice radio arrays at the South Pole and in Greenland. Here, we present a deep neural network that can reconstruct the main neutrino properties of interest from the raw waveforms recorded by the radio antennas: the neutrino direction, the energy of the particle shower induced by the neutrino interaction, and the event topology, thereby estimating the neutrino flavor. For the first time, we predict the full posterior PDF for the energy and direction reconstruction via neural posterior estimation utilizing conditional normalizing flows, enabling event-by-event uncertainty prediction. We improve over previous reconstruction algorithms and obtain a median resolution of 0.30 log(E) and 18 square degrees for a 'shallow' detector component and 0.08 log(E) and 28 square degrees for a 'deep' detector component for neutral current (NC) events at a shower energy of 1 EeV. This deep learning approach also allows us to reconstruct the more stochastic $\nu_e$ - charged current (CC) events. We quantify the impact of different antenna types and systematic uncertainties on the reconstruction and derive a goodness-of-fit score to test the compatibility of measured neutrino signals with the Monte Carlo simulations used to train the neural network.</description>

This development enables efficient neutron tagging via the large capture cross section of gadolinium, greatly improving the identification of inverse beta decay events, the primary channel for detecting the diffuse supernova neutrino background [DSNB]. The upgrade also enhances sensitivity to galactic and pre-supernova neutrinos, as well as atmospheric neutrino interactions. To realize this capability, extensive work was performed, including the construction and operation of the EGADS demonstrator, the refurbishment of the SK tank, the development of radiopure gadolinium production methods, and the validation of the loading and uniformity of gadolinium in solution. Early SK-Gd operation has demonstrated high neutron-tagging efficiency, reduced backgrounds, and world-leading limits on the DSNB flux. With these advances, SK-Gd now stands at the threshold of discovering the DSNB and opens a wide range of new opportunities in astrophysics and neutrino physics.</description>

      <title>Limiting Eccentricity in Restricted Hierarchical Three-Body Systems with Short-Range Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hierarchical three-body model can be widely applied to diverse astrophysical settings, from satellite-planet-star systems to binaries around supermassive black holes. The octupole-order perturbation on the inner binary from the tertiary can induce extreme eccentricities and cause orbital flips of the binary, but short-range forces such as those due to General Relativity (GR) may suppress extreme eccentricity excitations. In this paper, we consider restricted hierarchical three-body systems, where the inner binary has a test-mass component. We investigate the maximum possible eccentricity (called "limiting eccentricity") attainable by the inner binary under the influence of the tertiary perturbations and GR effect. In systems with sufficiently high hierarchy, the double averaging (DA) model is a good approximation; we show that the orbits which can flip under the octupole-order perturbation reach the same limiting eccentricity, which can be calculated analytically using the quadrupole-order Hamiltonian. In systems with moderate hierarchy, DA breaks down and the so-called Brown Hamiltonian is often introduced as a correction term; we show that this does not change the limiting eccentricity. Finally, we employ the single averaging (SA) model and find that the limiting eccentricity in the SA model is higher than the one in the DA model. We derive an analytical scaling for the modified limiting eccentricity in the SA model.</description>

      <title>NANOGrav 15-year gravitational-wave signals from binary supermassive black-holes seeded by primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explain the recently reported a nHz-band gravitational-wave background from NANOGrav 15-year through the merger of binary super-massive black holes with masses of $10^9 M_{\odot}$ formed by the growth of primordial black holes. When a primordial black hole accretes at a high accretion rate, it emits a large number of high-energy photons. These heat the plasma, causing high-redshift cosmological 21cm line emission. Since this has not been detected, there is a strict upper bound on the accretion rate. We have found that with the primordial black hole abundance $10^{-14} \lesssim f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{-12}$ and the mass $1 M_{\odot} \lesssim m_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^3 M_{\odot}$, we successfully fit the nHz band gravitational wave background from NANOGrav 15-year while avoiding the 21 cm line emission. We propose that future observations of the gravitational wave background and the cosmological 21cm line can test this scenario.</description>

      <title>Massive stars exploding in a He-rich circumstellar medium XII. SN 2024acyl: A fast, linearly declining Type Ibn supernova with early flash-ionisation features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the Type Ibn supernova (SN) 2024acyl. It rises to an absolute magnitude peak of about -17.58 mag in 10.6 days, and displays a rapid linear post-peak light-curve decline in all bands, similar to most SNe Ibn. The optical pseudobolometric light curve peaks at ($3.5\pm0.8) \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, with a total radiated energy of $(5.0\pm0.4) \times 10^{48}$ erg. The spectra are dominated by a blue continuum at early stages, with narrow P-Cygni \Hei~lines and flash-ionisation emission lines of C {\sc iii}, N {\sc iii}, and He {\sc ii}. The P-Cygni \Hei~features gradually evolve and become emission-dominated in late-time spectra. The \Ha~line is detected throughout the entire spectral evolution, which indicates that the CSM is helium-rich with some residual amount of H. Our multiband light-curve modelling yields estimates of the ejecta mass of $M_{ej}$ = $0.98^{+0.30}_{-0.20} \, \msun$, with a kinetic energy of $E_{k} = 0.13^{+0.03}_{-0.02} \times 10^{51}$ erg, and a $^{56}Ni$ mass of $M_{\mathrm{Ni}} = 0.017 \, \msun$. The inferred CSM properties are characterised by a mass of $M_{\rm{CSM}} = 0.39^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$ \msun, an inner radius of $R_0$=$15.6^{+1.9}_{-2.0}$ AU, and a density $\rho_{CSM} = (1.32\pm0.22)\times10^{-11} \, \mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}}$. The multi-epoch spectra are well reproduced by the CMFGEN/ \texttt{he4p0} model, corresponding to a He-ZAMS mass of 4~M$_\odot$. These findings are consistent with a scenario of an SN powered by ejecta-CSM interaction, originating from a low-mass helium star that evolved within an interacting binary system where the CSM with some residual hydrogen may originate from the mass-transfer process. In addition, a channel of core-collapse explosion of a late-type Wolf-Rayet star with H, or an Ofpe/WN9 star with fallback accretion, cannot be entirely ruled out.</description>

      <title>On the Bondi accretion of a self-interacting complex scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar fields with a global U(1) symmetry often appear in cosmology and astrophysics. We study the spherically-symmetric, stationary accretion of such a classical field onto a Schwarzschild black hole in the test-field approximation. Thus, we consider the relativistic Bondi accretion beyond a simplified perfect-fluid setup. We focus on the complex scalar field with canonical kinetic term and with a generic quartic potential which either preserves the U(1) symmetry or exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is well known that in the lowest order in gradient expansion the dynamics of such a scalar field is well approximated by a perfect superfluid; we demonstrate that going beyond this approximation systematically reduces the accretion rate with respect to the perfect fluid case. Hence, black holes can provide a way to distinguish a perfect fluid from its ultraviolet completion in form of the complex scalar field.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating Agreement between Radio and Fluorescence Measurements of the Depth of Maximum of Extensive Air Showers at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show, for the first time, radio measurements of the depth of shower maximum ($X_\text{max}$) of air showers induced by cosmic rays that are compared to measurements of the established fluorescence method at the same location. Using measurements at the Pierre Auger Observatory we show full compatibility between our radio and the previously published fluorescence data set, and between a subset of air showers observed simultaneously with both radio and fluorescence techniques, a measurement setup unique to the Pierre Auger Observatory. Furthermore, we show radio $X_\text{max}$ resolution as a function of energy and demonstrate the ability to make competitive high-resolution $X_\text{max}$ measurements with even a sparse radio array. With this, we show that the radio technique is capable of cosmic-ray mass composition studies, both at Auger and at other experiments.</description>

      <title>Radio Measurements of the Depth of Air-Shower Maximum at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA), part of the Pierre Auger Observatory, is currently the largest array of radio antenna stations deployed for the detection of cosmic rays, spanning an area of $17$ km$^2$ with 153 radio stations. It detects the radio emission of extensive air showers produced by cosmic rays in the $30-80$ MHz band. Here, we report the AERA measurements of the depth of the shower maximum ($X_\text{max}$), a probe for mass composition, at cosmic-ray energies between $10^{17.5}$ to $10^{18.8}$ eV, which show agreement with earlier measurements with the fluorescence technique at the Pierre Auger Observatory. We show advancements in the method for radio $X_\text{max}$ reconstruction by comparison to dedicated sets of CORSIKA/CoREAS air-shower simulations, including steps of reconstruction-bias identification and correction, which is of particular importance for irregular or sparse radio arrays. Using the largest set of radio air-shower measurements to date, we show the radio $X_\text{max}$ resolution as a function of energy, reaching a resolution better than $15$ g cm$^{-2}$ at the highest energies, demonstrating that radio $X_\text{max}$ measurements are competitive with the established high-precision fluorescence technique. In addition, we developed a procedure for performing an extensive data-driven study of systematic uncertainties, including the effects of acceptance bias, reconstruction bias, and the investigation of possible residual biases. These results have been cross-checked with air showers measured independently with both the radio and fluorescence techniques, a setup unique to the Pierre Auger Observatory.</description>

      <title>The Most Energetic Transients: Tidal Disruptions of High-Mass Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the class of extreme nuclear transients (ENTs), including the most energetic single transient yet discovered, Gaia18cdj. Each ENT is coincident with its host-galaxy nucleus and exhibits a smooth ($&lt;$$10$% excess variability), luminous ($2\times$$10^{45}$ to $7\times$$10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$), and long-lived ($&gt;$$150$ days) flare. ENTs are extremely rare ($\geq$$1$$\times$$10^{-3}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$) compared to any other known class of transients. They are at least twice as energetic ($0.5\times10^{53}$ to $2.5\times10^{53}$ erg) as any other known transient, ruling out supernova origins. Instead, the high peak luminosities, long flare timescales, and immense radiated energies of the ENTs are most consistent with the tidal disruption of high-mass ($\gtrsim$$3$ M$_{\odot}$) stars by massive ($\gtrsim$$10^8$ M$_{\odot}$) supermassive black holes (SMBHs). ENTs will be visible to high redshifts ($z\sim4$ to $6$) in upcoming surveys, providing an avenue to study the high-mass end of the SMBH mass distribution, complementing recent studies of actively accreting SMBHs at high redshifts with the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical assumptions and equation of state framework have larger impact on equation of state inference than individual neutron star observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17326v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The wide range of nuclear densities achieved in neutron stars makes them probes of dense nuclear behavior in the form of the nuclear equation of state (EoS). Studying neutron stars both in isolation, with X-ray measurements and pulse profiling, and in dynamic events, such as neutron star mergers, have provided insight into these high nuclear densities. Though nominally congruent, here we highlight impact of implicit assumptions embedded in joint analysis of these messengers and their systematic impact on EoS inference. We show that astrophysical assumptions and EoS framework can have a larger effect on inferred EoS than individual contemporary neutron star observations. Performing a proof-of-concept demonstration using the chronologically first few observational constraints, after the application of 5 to 6 observational constraints, additional observations provided diminishing returns and modified the inferred EoS by shifting the radius of a 1.4 $\unit{M_\odot}$ NS by $\sim$ 0.1 km. By contrast, astrophysical priors, specifically the spin and mass ratio motivated by astrophysical source population uncertainties, and EoS framework tend to impact EoS inference much more substantially by shifting the 1.4 $\unit{M_\odot}$ NS radius by $\sim$ 0.5 km and by modifying shape of inferred mass-radius relationship. The inferred EoS depends strongly on the adopted choice of spectral parameterizations: when we employ a framework which explicitly enforces causality, we find a strong phase-transition-like feature at $\sim 10^{14.5}$ g cm$^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Non-minimal light-curvature couplings and black-hole imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-minimal couplings between the electromagnetic field strength and the spacetime curvature are part of the effective field theory of gravity and matter. They alter the local propagation of light in a significant way if the ratio of spacetime curvature to the non-minimal coupling is of order one. Spacetime curvature can become appreciable around black holes, and yet the effect of non-minimal couplings on electromagnetic observations of black holes remains underexplored. A particular feature of the non-minimal coupling between the electromagnetic field-strength and the Riemann tensor is that it generates two distinct photon rings for different polarizations. Working within the paradigm of lensing bands and focusing on the $n = 1$ lensing band, we illustrate by which diagnostics a modified light propagation may be distinguished from a modified spacetime geometry and how constraints on the value of the non-minimal coupling can be obtained</description>

      <title>Probing the accretion geometry of black hole X-ray binaries: A multi-mission spectro-polarimetric and timing study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive spectro-polarimetric and timing analysis of twelve black hole X-ray binaries, namely Cyg X-1, 4U 1630-47, Cyg X-3, LMC X-1, 4U 1957+115, LMC X-3, Swift J1727.8-1613, GX 339-4, Swift J151857.0-572147, IGR J17091-3624, MAXI J1744-294 and GRS 1915+105, using quasi-simultaneous observations from {\it{IXPE}}, {\it{NICER}}, {\it{NuSTAR}}, and {\it{AstroSat}}. Timing analyses reveal type-B and type-C Quasi-periodic Oscillations across different spectral states, often associated with episodic radio ejections. Broadband ($0.7-60$ keV) spectral modeling, employing disc, Comptonization, and reflection components, reveals degeneracies in constraining disc-corona geometries. Polarimetric measurements in $2-8$ keV band detect significant polarization degrees (PDs) ranging from $3-20.6\%$ ($1.2-21.4\%$) in harder (softer) states, with moderate to strong energy dependence, except for LMC X$-1$, Swift J$151857.0-572147$, and MAXI J1744$-$294, where no significant polarization is detected. We report polarization detections of Cyg X$-3$ (PD $\sim 21.4\%$, SIMS), LMC X$-3$ (PD $\sim 2.4\%$, HSS) and IGR J$17091-3624$ (PD $\sim 9\%$, LHS) using recent {\it IXPE} observations. A positive correlation is found between PD and Comptonized photon fraction ($cov_{\rm frac}$), while an anti-correlation is observed with disc-to-Comptonized flux ratio ($F_{\rm ratio}$) across spectral states. Combined timing, spectral, and polarimetric results, together with constraints from radio jet observations, suggest a radially extended corona within a truncated disc for Cyg X$-1$, Swift J$1727.8-1613$, IGR J$17091-3624$, and GX $339-4$, whereas the disc-corona geometry remains poorly constrained for 4U $1957+115$, LMC X$-3$, and 4U $1630-47$. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding accretion geometries and highlight prospects for future X-ray polarimetric studies.</description>

      <title>An investigation into correlations between FRB and host galaxy properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Impulsive radio signals such as fast radio bursts (FRBs) are imprinted with the signatures of multi-path propagation through ionised media in the form of frequency-dependent temporal broadening of the pulse profile (scattering). The dominant source of scattering for most FRBs is expected to be within their host galaxies, an assumption which can be tested by examining potential correlations between properties of the FRBs and global properties of their hosts. Using results from the CRAFT survey, we investigate correlations across a range of host galaxy properties against attributes of the FRB that encode propagation effects: scattering timescale tau, polarisation fractions, and absolute Faraday rotation measure. From 21 host galaxy properties considered, we find three correlated with tau, including the stellar surface density (or compactness; Pearson p-value p = 0.002 and Spearman p = 0.010), mass-weighted age (Spearman p-value p = 0.009), and a weaker correlation with gas-phase metallicity (Spearman p = 0.017). Weakly significant correlations are also found with Halpha equivalent widths and gravitational potential. From 10,000 trials of reshuffled datasets, we expect 2 strong Spearman correlations only 2% of the time, and three weaker correlations in 6.6% of cases. Compact host galaxies may have more ionised content which scatters the FRB further. No correlation is seen with host galaxy inclination, which weakens the case for an inclination bias, as previously suggested for samples of localised FRBs. A strong (p = 0.002) correlation is found for absolute rotation measure with optical disc axis ratio b/a; greater rotation measures are seen for edge-on host galaxies. Further high-time resolution FRB detections, coupled with localisation and detailed follow-up on their host galaxies, are necessary to corroborate these initial findings and shed further light into the FRB mechanism.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Search for AGN Flares in ZTF Data Release 23</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to exhibit stochastic variability across a wide range of timescales and wavelengths. AGN flares are extreme outbursts that deviate from this typical behavior and may trace a range of energetic physical processes. Using six years of data from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Data Release 23, we conduct a systematic search for AGN flares among a sample of well-sampled AGNs and AGN candidates. We construct two catalogs: the AGN Flare Coarse Catalog (AGNFCC), containing 28,504 flares identified via Bayesian blocks and Gaussian Processes, and the AGN Flare Refined Catalog (AGNFRC), comprising 1,984 high-confidence flares selected using stricter criteria. We analyze their spatial distribution, temporal characteristics, host AGN type and potential origins. Some flares can be associated with known supernovae, tidal disruption events, or blazars, and a few may be linked to binary black hole mergers or microlensing events. These catalogs provide a valuable resource for studying transient phenomena in AGNs and are publicly available at https://github.com/Lyle0831/AGN-Flares.</description>

      <title>Optical/infrared observations of the extraordinary GRB 250702B: a highly obscured afterglow in a massive galaxy consistent with multiple possible progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GRB 250702B was the longest gamma-ray burst ever detected, with a duration that challenges standard collapsar models and suggests an exotic progenitor. We collected a rich set of optical and infrared follow-up observations of its rapidly fading afterglow using a suite of telescopes including the W. M. Keck Observatory, the Gemini telescopes, the Magellan Baade Telescope, the Victor M. Blanco 4-meter telescope, and the Fraunhofer Telescope at Wendelstein Observatory. Our analysis reveals that the afterglow emission is well described by forward shock emission from a highly obscured relativistic jet. Deep photometric observations of the host galaxy reveal a massive (10^10.66 solar masses), dusty, and extremely asymmetric system that is consistent with two galaxies undergoing a major merger. The galactocentric offset, host galaxy properties, and jet characteristics disfavor a jetted TDE around a supermassive black hole but do not definitively distinguish between competing progenitor scenarios. We find that the afterglow and host are consistent with a range of progenitors including an atypical collapsar, a merger between a helium star and a stellar mass black hole, the disruption of a star by a stellar mass compact object (micro-TDE), and the tidal disruption of a star by an off-nuclear intermediate mass black hole.</description>

      <title>Study of Four nulling pulsars with FAST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of 4 nulling pulsars with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). For PSR J1649+2533, our results suggest mode changing rather than subpulse drifting as previously reported at lower frequencies. For PSR J1752+2359, we confirm its quasi-periodic switching between distinct emission states, but further show that the so-called "quasi-null" or "RRAT-like" state actually consists of persistent low-level emission superposed with occasional bright pulses. For PSR J1819+1305, our data confirm the modulation reported earlier, while additional weaker features are also seen. For PSR J1916+1023, we detect both nulling and subpulse drifting, but find no clear evidence of direct interaction between them. These results provide new insights into the diverse manifestations of pulsar nulling, highlight the capability of FAST to detect subtle emission states, and add to the growing body of work on pulsar emission variability.</description>

      <title>First Associated Neutrino Search for a Failed Supernova Candidate with Super-Kamiokande</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2024, a failed supernova candidate, M31-2014-DS1, was reported in the Andromeda galaxy (M31), located at a distance of approximately 770 kpc. In this paper, we search for neutrinos from this failed supernova using data from Super-Kamiokande (SK). Based on the estimated time of black hole formation inferred from optical and infrared observations, we define a search window for neutrino events in the SK data. Using this window, we develop a dedicated analysis method for failed supernovae and apply it to M31-2014-DS1, by conducting a cluster search using the timing and energy information of candidate events. No significant neutrino excess is observed within the search region. Consequently, we place an upper limit on the electron antineutrino luminosity from M31-2014-DS1 and discuss its implications for various failed SN models and their neutrino emission characteristics. Despite the 18 MeV threshold adopted to suppress backgrounds, the search remains sufficiently sensitive to constrain the Shen-TM1 EOS, yielding a 90% confidence level upper limit of 1.76 \times 10^{53} erg on the electron antineutrino luminosity, slightly above the expected value of 1.35 \times 10^{53} erg.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Survival Guide: Searching for Stars in the Galactic Center That Endure Partial Tidal Disruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Once per 10,000-100,000 years, an unlucky star may experience a close encounter with a supermassive black hole (SMBH), partially or fully tearing apart the star in an exceedingly brief, bright interaction called a tidal disruption event (TDE). Remnants of partial TDEs are expected to be plentiful in our Galactic center, where at least six unexplained, diffuse, star-like "G objects" have already been detected which may have formed via interactions between stars and the SMBH. Using numerical simulations, this work aims to identify the characteristics of TDE remnants. We take 3D hydrodynamic FLASH models of partially disrupted stars and map them into the 1D stellar evolution code MESA to examine the properties of these remnants from tens to billions of years after the TDE. The remnants initially exhibit a brief, highly luminous phase, followed by an extended cooling period as they return to stable hydrogen burning. During the initial stage (&lt; 100,000 yr) their luminosities increase by orders of magnitude, making them intriguing candidates to explain a fraction of the mysterious G objects. Notably, mild TDEs are the most common and result in the brightest remnants during this initial phase. However, most remnants exist in a long-lived stage where they are only modestly offset in temperature and luminosity compared to main-sequence stars of equivalent mass. Nonetheless, our results indicate remnants will sustain abnormal, metal-enriched envelopes that may be discernible through spectroscopic analysis. Identifying TDE survivors within the Milky Way could further illuminate some of the most gravitationally intense encounters in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Probing Sub-GeV Leptophilic Dark Matter with the Future VLAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proposed Very Large Area Space Telescope (VLAST), with its expected unprecedented sensitivity in the MeV-GeV range, can also address the longstanding "MeV Gap" in gamma-ray observations. We explore the capability of VLAST to detect sub-GeV leptophilic dark matter (DM) annihilation, focusing on scalar and vector mediators and emphasizing the resonance region where the mediator mass is approximately twice the DM mass. While $s$-wave annihilation is tightly constrained by relic density and cosmic microwave background observations, $p$-wave and mixed $(s+p)$-wave scenarios remain viable, particularly near resonance. Additionally, direct detection experiments, especially those probing DM-electron scattering, significantly constrain nonresonance parameter space but are less effective in the resonance regime. VLAST can uniquely probe this surviving region, outperforming existing and planned instruments, and establishing itself as a crucial tool for indirect detection of thermal relic DM.</description>

      <title>Hubble constant constraint using 117 FRBs with a more accurate probability density function for ${\rm DM}_{\rm diff}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are among the most mysterious astronomical transients. Due to their short durations and cosmological distances, their dispersion measure (DM) - redshift ($z$) relation is useful for constraining cosmological parameters and detecting the baryons in the Universe. The increasing number of localized FRBs in recent years has provided more precise constraints on these parameters. However, the larger dataset reveals limitations in the widely used probability density function ($p_{\rm diff}$) for ${\rm DM}_{\rm diff}$, which refers to the diffuse electron term of FRB DM. In this project, we collect 117 of the latest, localized FRBs, discuss the effect of a more accurate $\sigma_{\rm diff}$, which is a parameter in $p_{\rm diff}$ and once thoughts as ``effective standard deviation'', and more clearly rewrite their likelihood to better constrain the parameters above. We find that the widely used approximation $\sigma_{\rm diff} \sim F/\sqrt{z}$ only works under contrived assumptions and shows the greatest deviation from the true standard deviation in low redshift. In general, one should use an accurate method to derive this parameter from $p_{\rm diff}$. Our method yields better constraints on $H_0\Omega_b f_{\rm diff} = 2.813_{-0.258}^{+0.250}\;{\rm km/s/Mpc}$ or $H_0 = 66.889_{-5.459}^{+6.754} \;{\rm km/s/Mpc}$ when combining the FRB data with CMB measurements and taking $f_{\rm diff} = 0.84$. This fully analytical correction helps us better constrain cosmological parameters with the increasing number of localized FRBs available today.</description>

      <title>Nuclear chiral density wave in neutron stars?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anisotropic phases potentially play a role in the internal composition of neutron stars, the main laboratory for the phase structure of QCD at high baryon densities. We review the study of such a phase, the chiral density wave, within a phenomenological nucleon-meson model, including nucleonic vacuum fluctuations within a renormalization scheme recently developed. Neutron stars in this model and within our approximations either do not contain a chiral density wave core or they are too light to agree with observations.</description>

      <title>Equation of state for hyperonic neutron-star matter in SU(3) flavor symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a relativistic mean-field model calibrated to finite-nucleus observables and bulk properties of dense nuclear matter, we investigate hyperonic neutron-star matter within an SU(3) flavor-symmetry scheme. To retain SU(6)-based couplings within SU(3) flavor symmetry, we add a quartic $\phi$ self-interaction and $\phi$-$\rho$ mixing. We demonstrate the roles of $\alpha_{v}$ ($F/(F+D)$ ratio), $\theta_{v}$ (mixing angle), and $z_{v}$ (singlet-to-octet coupling ratio) in SU(3)-invariant vector-meson couplings. It is found that $z_{v}$ predominantly controls the maximum mass of a neutron star, and $2M_{\odot}$ neutron stars can be supported for $z_{v}\le0.15$. The $\alpha_{v}$ also helps sustain large masses, whereas $\theta_{v}$ has a smaller effect on neutron-star properties. This SU(3) framework reconciles nuclear and astrophysical constraints, and offers a plausible resolution to the hyperon puzzle.</description>

      <title>The first year of LISA Galactic foreground</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galactic white-dwarf binaries play a central role in the inference model for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. In this manuscript, we employ the $\texttt{bahamas}$ codebase to characterize, in a global-fit fashion, the reconstruction of the Galactic foreground during the first year of observation. To account for its statistical properties, we represent the data in time--frequency domain, and characterize the effectiveness of multiple approaches, e.g. statistically viable likelihoods, sampling schemes, segmentation widths, and gaps density. Our analysis yields consistent results across, with overwhelming evidence in favor of a non-stationary model in less than a month of data. Moreover, we show robustness against the presence of additional extragalactic foregrounds, and test the suitability of our approximations on the more complex simulated data in the $\textit{Yorsh}$ data challenge.</description>
