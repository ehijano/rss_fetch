      <title>Simultaneous Optimized Mechanical Stiffness and Cell Growth on Scaffold by Morphology Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The morphology of microstructures in scaffolds is a critical factor influencing both mechanical properties and biological performance, such as cell growth, in bone tissue engineering. While metamaterials with optimized mechanical properties, such as hyperelasticity, thermal efficiency, or energy absorption, have been designed through complex microstructural geometry with the help of numerical simulation of multi-physics, optimizing biological performance alongside these physical traits remains a significant challenge. This is primarily because biological performance must be evaluated through laboratory experiments. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that simultaneously optimizes mechanical stiffness and cell growth effectiveness through a data-driven morphology learning method. Our approach effectively extracts and learns shape patterns from a specifically selected dataset of microstructures recognized for their superior cell growth performance. We then integrate these patterns into a computational framework based on topology optimization, enabling the generation of new microstructures that maintain high levels of cell growth while enhancing mechanical stiffness. Using this morphology learning-based method, we identified a scaffold design for bone tissue engineering that demonstrates a significant improvement in both mechanical stiffness (by 29.69%) and cell proliferation (by 37.05% on Day 7 and 33.30% on Day 14).</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal pattern formation of membranes induced by surface molecular binding/unbinding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium membrane pattern formation is studied using meshless membrane simulation. We consider that molecules bind to either surface of a bilayer membrane and move to the opposite leaflet by flip-flop. When binding does not modify the membrane properties and the transfer rates among the three states are cyclically symmetric, the membrane exhibits spiral-wave and homogeneous-cycling modes at high and low binding rates, respectively, as in an off-lattice cyclic Potts model. When binding changes the membrane spontaneous curvature, these spatiotemporal dynamics are coupled with microphase separation. When two symmetric membrane surfaces are in thermal equilibrium, the membrane domains form 4.8.8 tiling patterns in addition to stripe and spot patterns. In nonequilibrium conditions, moving biphasic domains and time-irreversible fluctuating patterns appear. The domains move ballistically or diffusively depending on the conditions.</description>

      <title>Designed self-assembly of programmable colloidal atom-electron equivalents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To unlock the potential for assembling complex colloidal "molecules", we investigate a minimal binary system of programmable colloidal atom-electron equivalents (PAE-EE), where electron equivalents (EEs) are multivalent linkers with two distinct types of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) ends complementary to those ssDNAs on binary programmable atom equivalents (PAEs). We derive a statistical mechanical framework for calculating the effective interaction between PAEs mediated by EEs with arbitrary valency, which quantitatively agrees with simulations that explicitly include EEs. Our analysis reveals an anomalous dependence of PAE-PAE interactions on the EE valency, showing that EE-mediated interactions converge at the large valency limit. Moreover, we identify an optimal EE valency that maximizes the interaction difference between targeted and non-targeted binding pairs of PAEs. These findings offer design principles for targeted self-assembly in PAE-EE systems.</description>

      <title>Gardner transition coincides with the emergence of jamming scalings in hard spheres and disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gardner transition in structural glasses is characterized by full-replica symmetry breaking of the free-energy landscape and the onset of anomalous aging dynamics due to marginal stability. Here we show that this transition also has a structural signature in finite-dimensional glasses consisting of hard spheres and disks. By analyzing the distribution of inter-particle gaps in the simulated static configurations at different pressures, we find that the Gardner transition coincides with the emergence of two well-known jamming scalings in the gap distribution, which enables the extraction of a structural order parameter. The jamming scalings reflect a compressible effective force network formed by contact and quasi-contact gaps, while non-contact gaps that do not participate in the effective force network are incompressible. Our results suggest that the Gardner transition in hard-particle glasses is a precursor of the jamming transition. The proposed structural signature and order parameter provide a convenient approach to detecting the Gardner transition in future granular experiments.</description>

      <title>Lever rule violation and pressure imbalance in a driven granular system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a monolayer of metal balls under periodic chiral driving in the horizontal plane. Energy dissipation occurs in this system via (i) inelastic collisions and (ii) frictional interaction with the substrate. We show that below a density-dependent critical drive, the system phase separates into a fluid phase coexisting with a solid phase. Unlike ordinary coexistence, however, the system does not obey the lever rule, as the fluid-phase density depends on the overall particle density. Additionally, the pressure is discontinuous across the fluid-solid interface, accompanied by a chiral edge current at the interface.</description>

      <title>Surface polarization strongly influences electrostatics in a nonlocal medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrostatics in the solution phase is governed by free electrical charges such as ions, as well as by bound charges that arise when a polarizable medium responds to an applied field. In a local medium, described by a constant dielectric permittivity, the sign of the far-field electrostatic potential distribution around an object is governed by its electrical charge. We demonstrate significant departures from this expectation in a nonlocal medium characterized by a wave vector-dependent dielectric function. Here, surface polarization due to the solvent, or indeed non-solvent dipoles, may wield significant influence at large distances. The polarization correlation length may not only significantly augment the effective screening length, but we show that the electrical contribution from polarization can compete with and even invert the sign of the electrical potential and the field arising from charge alone. These results hold ramifications for a range of apparently anomalous electrically governed observations such as underscreening, electrophoretic mobilities of charge-neutral objects, and long-ranged attraction between like-charged entities in water and other solvents.</description>

      <title>Transient Elasticity -- A Unifying Framework for Thixotropy, Polymers, and Granular Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Having the elastic strain relax while observing energy conservation and entropy production yields a model called hydrodynamics of transient elasticity (HoTE). It interpolates between solid- and fluid-dynamics and provides a broad framework for many systems such as polymers, granular media, thixotropic and yield-stress fluids. Focusing on the last two systems, this paper shows that, with little efforts at model sculpting, HoTE easily accounts for many effects, including: static and dynamic yield stress, over- and under-shoot of stresses at rate jumps, hysteresis at rate ramps and rate inversion, "viscosity bifurcation", acceleration on a tilted plane, shear band, elastic shear waves, aging and rejuvenation.</description>

      <title>Solving the Kinetic Ising Model with Non-Reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions are a generic feature of non-equilibrium systems. We define a non-reciprocal generalization of the kinetic Ising model in one spatial dimension. We solve the model exactly using two different approaches for infinite, semi-infinite and finite systems with either periodic or open boundary conditions. The exact solution allows us to explore a range of novel phenomena tied to non-reciprocity like non-reciprocity induced frustration and wave phenomena with interesting parity-dependence for finite systems of size $N$.
  We study dynamical questions like the approach to equilibrium with various boundary conditions. We find new regimes, separated by $N^{th}$-order exceptional points, which can be classified as overdamped, underdamped and critically damped phases. Despite these new regimes, long-time order is only present at zero temperature. Additionally, we explore the low-energy behavior of the system in various limits, including the ageing and spatio-temporal Porod regimes, demonstrating that non-reciprocity induces unique scaling behavior at zero temperature. Lastly, we present general results for systems where spins interact with no more than two spins, outlining the conditions under which long-time order may exist.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric terpolymer films with enhanced cooling efficiency: An integrated approach considering electrocaloric response and dielectric losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In response to the growing demand for more efficient and compact refrigeration and energy conversion devices, electrocaloric poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene-chlorofluoroethylene) is among the most promising active substances. However, despite its high electrocaloric response, the maximum efficiency achievable over a cooling cycle is hampered by losses. To overcome this major limitation, losses have been reduced by using an electrothermal poling treatment as well as by controlling the surface roughness. The upper bound of the efficiency computed over a thermodynamic cycle mimicking the working conditions of an actual cooling device is increased from 1% to 10% of the Carnot efficiency. This represents a major improvement in enhancing ferroelectric materials for advanced energy applications.</description>

      <title>Generic theory of interacting, spinning, active polar particles: a model for cell aggregates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a generic framework for describing interacting, spinning, active polar particles, aimed at modelling dense cell aggregates, where cells are treated as polar, rotating objects that interact mechanically with one another and their surrounding environment. Using principles from non-equilibrium thermodynamics, we derive constitutive equations for interaction forces, torques, and polarity dynamics. We subsequently use this framework to analyse the spontaneous motion of cell doublets, uncovering a rich phase diagram of collective behaviours, including steady rotation driven by flow-polarity coupling or interactions between polarity and cell position.</description>

      <title>Role of symmetry in the orientationally disordered crystals of hard convex polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The crystalline solids with lack of orientational ordering of anisotropic particles serve the purpose of studying the disordered systems with many fundamental applications in contemporary research. Despite the orientational disorder, multiple unique orientations with fixed angular differences exist in the crystal structures giving rise of "discrete plastic crystal" phase where the particles jump discretely within the unique orientations. We report the computational evidence of the role of symmetries between polyhedral particles and respective crystalline structures in controlling the existence of such phase at comparatively higher range of packing fractions beyond the freely rotating plastic crystals. The point groups of the particle and crystal structure were found to be directly connected in terms of the parallel alignment between the highest order rotational symmetry axes of the particle point group and any rotational axes of crystallographic point group, as a characteristic feature of this phase giving rise of discrete orientations. Based on our previous research [Kundu \textit{et al.}, arXiv:2311.06799, 2023] and new findings reported here, this symmetry relationship appeared to occur at the unit cells of the crystal structures which acted as the source of correlation, where as, all previously reported conserved orientational attributes i.e., number of unique orientations with fixed angular differences, equal population densities within the unique orientations, could be thought as the signatures of correlation present in the entire system. This relationship appeared to control all the aspects of phase which might be useful to draw fundamental insights about the disordered phases with orientational correlation as well as designing the disorder in the crystals.</description>

      <title>Complete mathematical theory of the jamming transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The jamming transition of frictionless athermal particles is a paradigm to understand the mechanics of amorphous materials at the atomic scale. Concepts related to the jamming transition and the mechanical response of jammed packings have cross-fertilized into other areas such as atomistic descriptions of the elasticity and plasticity of glasses. In this perspective article, the microscopic mathematical theory of the jamming transition is reviewed from first-principles. The starting point of the derivation is a microscopically-reversible particle-bath Hamiltonian from which the governing equation of motion for the grains under an external deformation is derived. From this equation of motion, microscopic expressions are obtained for both the shear modulus and the viscosity as a function of the distance from the jamming transition (respectively, above and below the transition). Regarding the vanishing of the shear modulus at the unjamming transition, this theory, as originally demonstrated in [Zaccone \&amp; Scossa-Romano, Phys. Rev. B 83, 184205 (2011)], is currently the only quantitative microscopic theory in parameter-free agreement with numerical simulations of [O'Hern et al. Phys. Rev. E 68, 011306 (2003)] for jammed packings. The divergence of the viscosity upon approaching the jamming transition from below is derived here, for the first time, from the same microscopic Hamiltonian. The quantitative microscopic prediction of the diverging viscosity is shown to be in fair agreement with numerical results of sheared 2D soft disks from [Olsson \&amp; Teitel, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 178001 (2007)].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A stretched DNA molecule which is also under- or overwound, undergoes a buckling transition forming intertwined looped domains called plectonemes. Here we develop a simple theory that extends the two-phase model of stretched supercoiled DNA, allowing for the coexistence of multiple plectonemic domains by including positional and length distribution entropies. Such a multiplectoneme phase is favored in long DNA molecules in which the gain of positional entropy compensates for the cost of nucleating a plectoneme along a stretched DNA segment. Despite its simplicity, the developed theory is shown to be in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations of the twistable wormlike chain model. The theory predicts more plectonemes than experimentally observed, which we attribute to the limited resolution of experimental data. Since plectonemes are detected through fluorescence signals, those shorter than the observable threshold are likely missed.</description>

      <title>Changing the flow profile and resulting drying pattern of dispersion droplets via contact angle modification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.00464v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spilling tea or coffee leads to a tell-tale circular stain after the droplet dries, known as the "coffee ring effect". The evaporation of suspension droplets is a complex physical process, and predicting and controlling the particle deposit patterns from sessile droplet evaporation are essential for many industrial processes, such as ink-jet printing and crop-care applications. In this article, we systematically investigate the effect of surface wettability on the evaporation dynamics of a particle-laden droplet, focussing on the contact line stick-slip behaviour, the hydrodynamic flow of the suspended particles, and the resulting particle deposit after evaporation. We use substrates with different wettabilities, ranging from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, and quantify the internal flow during the evaporation by tracking (fluorescent) tracer particles. We find that the internal flow shifts from a predominantly outward flow towards the contact line for low contact angles to an inward flow for large contact angles. Correspondingly, the particle deposit transitions from the typical coffee-ring pattern to a central stain as the substrates's hydrophobicity increases. Finally, we corroborate these experimental findings with dynamic density functional theory, modelling the droplet evaporation process and stick-slip behaviour of the contact line. Our investigation suggests that the wettability of the substrate can significantly alter hydrodynamic flow within drying droplets, thereby affecting the resulting particle deposit.</description>

      <title>Role of surfactants on droplet formation in piezoacoustic inkjet printing across microsecond-to-second timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In piezo acoustic drop-on-demand inkjet printing a single droplet is produced for each piezo driving pulse. This droplet is typically multicomponent, including surfactants to control the spreading and drying of the droplet on the substrate. However, the role of these surfactants on the droplet formation process remains rather elusive. Surfactant concentration gradients may manifest across microsecond-to-second timescales, spanning both the rapid ejection of ink from the nozzle exit and the comparatively slower idling timescale governing the firing of successive droplets. In the present work, we study the influence of surfactants on droplet formation across 6 orders of magnitude in time. To this end, we visualize the microsecond droplet formation process using stroboscopic laser-induced fluorescence microscopy while we vary the nozzle idle time. Our results show that increasing the idle time up to O(1) s affects only the break-up dynamics of the inkjet but not its velocity. By contrast, for idle times $&gt;$ O(1) s, both the break-up dynamics are altered and the velocity of the inkjet increases. We show that the increased velocity results from a decreased surface tension of the ejected droplet, which we extracted from the observed shape oscillations of the jetted droplets in flight. The measured decrease in surface tension is surprising as the $\mu$s timescale of droplet formation is much faster than the typical ms-to-s timescale of surfactant adsorption. By varying the bulk surfactant concentration, we show that the fast decrease in surface tension results from a local surfactant concentration increase to more than 200 times the CMC. Our results suggest that a local high concentration of surfactant allows for surfactant adsorption to the interface of an inkjet at the $\mu$s-to-ms timescale, which is much faster than the typical ms-to-s timescale of surfactant adsorption.</description>
