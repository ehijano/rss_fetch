      <title>ApproxPilot: A GNN-based Accelerator Approximation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A typical optimization of customized accelerators for error-tolerant applications such as multimedia, recognition, and classification is to replace traditional arithmetic units like multipliers and adders with the approximate ones to enhance energy efficiency while adhering to accuracy requirements. However, the plethora of arithmetic units and diverse approximate unit options result in an exceedingly large design space. Therefore, there is a pressing need for an end-to-end design framework capable of navigating this intricate design space for approximation optimization. Traditional methods relying on simulation-based or blackbox model evaluations suffer from either high computational costs or limitations in accuracy and scalability, posing significant challenges to the optimization process. In this paper, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model that leverages the physical connections of arithmetic units to capture their influence on the performance, power, area (PPA), and accuracy of the accelerator. Particularly, we notice that critical path plays a key role in node feature of the GNN model and having it embedded in the feature vector greatly enhances the prediction quality of the models. On top of the models that allow rapid and efficient PPA and accuracy prediction of various approximate accelerator configurations, we can further explore the large design space effectively and build an end-to-end accelerator approximation framework named ApproxPilot to optimize the accelerator approximation. Our experimental results demonstrate that ApproxPilot outperforms state-of-the-art approximation optimization frameworks in both performance and hardware overhead with the same accuracy constraints.</description>

      <title>MonoSparse-CAM: Harnessing Monotonicity and Sparsity for Enhanced Tree Model Processing on CAMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in AI driven by neural networks, tree-based machine learning (TBML) models excel on tabular data. These models exhibit promising energy efficiency, and high performance, particularly when accelerated on analog content-addressable memory (aCAM) arrays. However, optimizing their hardware deployment, especially in leveraging TBML model structure and aCAM circuitry, remains challenging.
  In this paper, we introduce MonoSparse-CAM, a novel content-addressable memory (CAM) based computing optimization technique. MonoSparse-CAM efficiently leverages TBML model sparsity and CAM array circuits, enhancing processing performance. Our experiments show that MonoSparse-CAM reduces energy consumption by up to 28.56x compared to raw processing and 18.51x compared to existing deployment optimization techniques. Additionally, it consistently achieves at least 1.68x computational efficiency over current methods.
  By enabling energy-efficient CAM-based computing while preserving performance regardless of the array sparsity, MonoSparse-CAM addresses the high energy consumption problem of CAM which hinders processing of large arrays. Our contributions are twofold: we propose MonoSparse-CAM as an effective deployment optimization solution for CAM-based computing, and we investigate the impact of TBML model structure on array sparsity. This work provides crucial insights for energy-efficient TBML on hardware, highlighting a significant advancement in sustainable AI technologies.</description>

      <title>Characterizing and Understanding HGNN Training on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Owing to their remarkable representation capabilities for heterogeneous graph data, Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have been widely adopted in many critical real-world domains such as recommendation systems and medical analysis. Prior to their practical application, identifying the optimal HGNN model parameters tailored to specific tasks through extensive training is a time-consuming and costly process. To enhance the efficiency of HGNN training, it is essential to characterize and analyze the execution semantics and patterns within the training process to identify performance bottlenecks. In this study, we conduct an in-depth quantification and analysis of two mainstream HGNN training scenarios, including single-GPU and multi-GPU distributed training. Based on the characterization results, we disclose the performance bottlenecks and their underlying causes in different HGNN training scenarios and provide optimization guidelines from both software and hardware perspectives.</description>

      <title>DaCapo: Accelerating Continuous Learning in Autonomous Systems for Video Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) video analytics is crucial for autonomous systems such as self-driving vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and security robots. However, real-world deployment faces challenges due to their limited computational resources and battery power. To tackle these challenges, continuous learning exploits a lightweight "student" model at deployment (inference), leverages a larger "teacher" model for labeling sampled data (labeling), and continuously retrains the student model to adapt to changing scenarios (retraining). This paper highlights the limitations in state-of-the-art continuous learning systems: (1) they focus on computations for retraining, while overlooking the compute needs for inference and labeling, (2) they rely on power-hungry GPUs, unsuitable for battery-operated autonomous systems, and (3) they are located on a remote centralized server, intended for multi-tenant scenarios, again unsuitable for autonomous systems due to privacy, network availability, and latency concerns. We propose a hardware-algorithm co-designed solution for continuous learning, DaCapo, that enables autonomous systems to perform concurrent executions of inference, labeling, and training in a performant and energy-efficient manner. DaCapo comprises (1) a spatially-partitionable and precision-flexible accelerator enabling parallel execution of kernels on sub-accelerators at their respective precisions, and (2) a spatiotemporal resource allocation algorithm that strategically navigates the resource-accuracy tradeoff space, facilitating optimal decisions for resource allocation to achieve maximal accuracy. Our evaluation shows that DaCapo achieves 6.5% and 5.5% higher accuracy than a state-of-the-art GPU-based continuous learning systems, Ekya and EOMU, respectively, while consuming 254x less power.</description>

      <title>Fixed and Movable Antenna Technology for 6G Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By deploying antenna arrays at the transmitter/receiver to provide additional spatial-domain degrees of freedom (DoFs), multi-antenna technology greatly improves the reliability and efficiency of wireless communication. Meanwhile, the application of multi-antenna technology in the radar field has achieved spatial angle resolution and improved sensing DoF, thus significantly enhancing wireless sensing performance. However, wireless communication and radar sensing have undergone independent development over the past few decades. As a result, although multi-antenna technology has dramatically advanced in these two fields separately, it has not been deeply integrated by exploiting their synergy. A new opportunity to fill up this gap arises as the integration of sensing and communication has been identified as one of the typical usage scenarios of the 6G communication network. Motivated by the above, this article aims to explore the multi-antenna technology for 6G ISAC, with the focus on its future development trends such as continuous expansion of antenna array scale, more diverse array architectures, and more flexible antenna designs. First, we introduce several new and promising antenna architectures, including the centralized antenna architectures based on traditional compact arrays or emerging sparse arrays, the distributed antenna architectures exemplified by the cell-free massive MIMO, and the movable/fluid antennas with flexible positions and/or orientations in a given 3D space. Next, for each antenna architecture mentioned above, we present the corresponding far-field/near-field channel models and analyze the communication and sensing performance. Finally, we summarize the characteristics of different antenna architectures and look forward to new ideas for solving the difficulties in acquiring CSI caused by the continuous expansion of antenna array scale and flexible antenna designs.</description>
