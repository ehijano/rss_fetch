      <title>Bound States at Semiconductor -- Mott Insulator Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08264v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing the hierarchy of correlations in the context of a Fermi-Hubbard model, we deduce the presence of quasi-particle bound states at the interface between a Mott insulator and a semiconductor, as well as within a semiconductor-Mott-semiconductor heterostructure forming a quantum well. In the case of the solitary interface, the existence of bound states necessitates the presence of an additional perturbation with a minimal strength depending on the spin background of the Mott insulator. Conversely, within the quantum well, this additional perturbation is still required to have bound states while standing-wave solutions even exist in its absence.</description>

      <title>Spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in the interacting Kane-Mele model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The essential properties of the half-filled interacting Kane-Mele model on a hexagon lattice is
  studied using the slave rotor approach. It is shown clearly that a long-range charge-order state with
  spontaneously broken chiral symmetry emerges in the weak and moderate interaction regimes, as
  well as a presumed site-selected topological Mott insulator state in the stronger interaction regime
  with U &lt; UMott, where UMott is the critical interaction strength, and in the case of U &gt; UMott,
  the system is transited into the usual topological Mott state. This new charge-order state has
  lower energy compared to the usual topological band insulator (TBI) state with chiral symmetry,
  and thus is named as non-chiral TBI state. More specifically, in this non-chiral TBI state without
  any long-range magnetic order, a long-range charge order with different electron occupation on
  two sublattices appears in the absence of external sublattice field. The spontaneously broken chiral
  symmetry gives rise to a special helical edge state, which has different spin accumulation on opposite
  edges of the cylinder with periodic boundary condition in the zigzag direction, and thus leads to
  a net spin current across the system. This net spin current would be further strengthened if the
  nearest neighbor electron Coulomb interaction is taken into account as well, because it is favorable
  for the long-range charge order with different electron occupation on sublattices.</description>

      <title>Exciton condensation from level repulsion: application to bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton condensation in semiconductors and semimetals has long been predicted but remains elusive. In a semiconductor, condensation occurs when the exciton binding energy matches the band gap. This binding energy results from a balance between Coulomb attraction, which enhances it, and kinetic energy, which suppresses it. However, reducing kinetic energy typically increases screening, weakening Coulomb attraction. Empirically, in most candidate materials, the binding energy remains below the band gap, with few external parameters capable of altering this balance. Here, we propose an in-plane electric field as a control parameter. This field induces hybridisation between even- and odd-parity excitons, and the resulting level repulsion effectively enhances binding energy. We argue that this mechanism is generic to excitons in semiconductors and illustrate it with a model of biased bilayer graphene. Bilayer graphene is chosen since it has a tunable band gap, making it an excitonic condensate candidate and moreover, the Zener tunnelling rate contains, in addition to the usual exponential decay, a non-standard oscillating component -- thanks to details of the electron dispersion. Analogous to quantum oscillations, we propose that Fourier spectrum of the current-voltage data allows for a novel test of exciton condensation. Finally, we show that the is a large excitonic gap to critical temperature ratio -- a clear prediction for STM studies.</description>

      <title>Gate Tunable Room-temperature Mott Insulator in Kagome compound Nb3Cl8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kagome lattice provides a playground to explore novel correlated quantum states due to the presence of flat bands in its electronic structure. Recently discovered layered kagome compound Nb3Cl8 has been proposed as a Mott insulator coming from the half-filled flat band. Here we have carried out systematic transport study to uncover the evidence of Mott insulator in Nb3Cl8 thin flakes. Bipolar semiconducting property with Fermi level close to conduction band has been revealed. We have further probed the chemical potential of Nb3Cl8 by tracing the charge neutrality point of the monolayer graphene proximate to Nb3Cl8. The gap of Nb3Cl8 flakes is approximately 1.10 eV at 100 K and shows pronounced temperature dependence, decreasing substantially with increasing temperature to ~0.63 eV at 300 K. The melting behavior of the gapped state is in consistent with theoretically proposed Mott insulator in Nb3Cl8. Our work has demonstrated Nb3Cl8 as a promising platform to study strongly correlated physics at relatively high temperature.</description>

      <title>Order-by-disorder in magnets with frustrated spin interactions -- classical and large-$S$ limits via the spin functional integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spin systems with extensive degeneracies in the classical ground states due to anisotropic frustrated spin interactions, where the degeneracy is not protected by symmetry. Using spin functional integration, we study the lifting of the degeneracies by fluctuations called order-by-disorder (ObD), and the associated gap in the spin-wave spectrum. It is shown that ObD corresponds to gradient-dependent anisotropic interactions of the pseudo-Goldstone modes, which vanish for a classical uniform spin configuration. Fluctuations generate a gradient-independent effective potential which determines the ground state and the pseudo-Goldstone gap. Furthermore, we recover previous predictions for the pseudo-Goldstone gap in type-I and II ObD with two-spin interactions in the large spin-$S$ limit or the classical small temperature limit, by computing the gap explicitly for the type-II cubic compass model and the type-I square compass model. We show that these two limits correspond to the one-loop approximation for the effective potential. We also discuss other types of order by disorder due to $m$-spin interactions where $m&gt;2$.</description>

      <title>Giant transverse magnetic fluctuations at the edge of re-entrant superconductivity in UTe$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: UTe$_{2}$ exhibits the remarkable phenomenon of re-entrant superconductivity, whereby the zero-resistance state reappears above 40 tesla after being suppressed with a field of around 10 tesla. One potential pairing mechanism, invoked in the related re-entrant superconductors UCoGe and URhGe, involves transverse fluctuations of a ferromagnetic order parameter. However, the requisite ferromagnetic order - present in both UCoGe and URhGe - is absent in UTe$_{2}$, and magnetization measurements show no sign of strong fluctuations. Here, we measure the magnetotropic susceptibility of UTe$_{2}$ across two field-angle planes. This quantity is sensitive to the magnetic susceptibility in a direction transverse to the applied magnetic field - a quantity that is not accessed in conventional magnetization measurements. We observe a very large decrease in the magnetotropic susceptibility over a broad range of field orientations, indicating a large increase in the transverse magnetic susceptibility. The three superconducting phases of UTe$_{2}$, including the high-field re-entrant phase, surround this region of enhanced susceptibility in the field-angle phase diagram. The strongest transverse susceptibility is found near the critical end point of the high-field metamagnetic transition, suggesting that quantum critical fluctuations of a field-induced magnetic order parameter may be responsible for the large transverse susceptibility, and may provide a pairing mechanism for field-induced superconductivity in UTe$_{2}$.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a 1D edge mode in a Magnetic Topological semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In rare-earth monopnictides like NdBi, the interplay between magnetism and topology results in an extremely unusual topological semimetal phase which simultaneously hosts Weyl points with Fermi arcs as well as massive and massless Dirac cones. A central question in this class of materials is whether ferromagnetic surfaces with gapped Dirac cones can also host robust well-defined chiral edge states. In this study, we use spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM) and spectroscopy to investigate the correlation between the magnetic and topological properties of NdBi. By combining SP-STM imaging with quasiparticle interference, we identify distinct signatures of both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic surface terminations and correlate them with their respective band structures. Crucially, we demonstrate that step edges on the ferromagnetic surface which serve as magnetic domain walls host well-defined one-dimensional (1D) edge modes that vanish above the N\'eel temperature. Our findings position NdBi as a promising platform for further explorations of 1D chiral edge modes and future realizations of Majorana states in proximitized rare-earth monopnictides.</description>

      <title>Emblems of pair density waves: dual identity of topological defects and their transport signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pair density wave (PDW) exemplifies intertwined orders in strongly correlated systems. A recent discovery of superconductivity in a quarter-metal state offers the first experimental system where a pure PDW without uniform superconductivity is suspected, offering a unique opportunity to examine the consequences of intertwined orders. A pure two-dimensional PDW supports an unusual fractional excitation as its topological defect (TD). A TD simultaneously winds the phase of the Cooper pair and distorts the amplitude modulation -- a dual role reflecting its intertwined character. As a vortex, a TD carries fractional vorticity of $\frac{1}{3} h/2e$, whose movement would cause resistance. As a crystalline defect, a TD can be sourced by charge disorder in the system. We show that experimentally observed resistive switching can originate from mobile TDs, while a small magnetic field will restore zero resistance by blocking their motion. The resulting resistive state exhibits extreme anisotropy and a Hall response, with the Hall angle determined by the angle between the current and the TD's Burgers vector. These features will serve as confirmation of the dual identity of topological defects as emblems of PDW order.</description>

      <title>Sharp spectroscopic fingerprints of disorder in an incompressible magnetic state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disorder significantly impacts the electronic properties of conducting quantum materials by inducing electron localization and thus altering the local density of states and electric transport. In insulating quantum magnetic materials the effects of disorder are less understood and can drastically impact fluctuating spin states like quantum spin liquids. In the absence of transport tools, disorder is typically characterized using chemical methods or by semi-classical modeling of spin dynamics. This requires high magnetic fields that may not always be accessible. Here, we show that magnetization plateaus -- incompressible states found in many quantum magnets -- provide an exquisite platform to uncover otherwise undetectable amounts of disorder, regardless of the origin of the plateau. Using optical magneto-spectroscopy on the Ising-Heisenberg triangular-lattice antiferromagnet K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$ exhibiting a 1/3 magnetization plateau, we identify sharp spectroscopic lines, the fine structure of which serves as a hallmark signature of disorder. Through analytical and numerical modeling, we show that these fingerprints not only enable us to quantify minute amounts of disorder but also reveal its nature -- as dilute vacancies. Remarkably, this model explains all details of the thermomagnetic response of our system, including the existence of multiple plateaus. Our findings provide a new approach to identifying disorder in quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>Visualizing a Terahertz Superfluid Plasmon in a Two-Dimensional Superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superconducting gap defines the fundamental energy scale for the emergence of dissipationless transport and collective phenomena in a superconductor. In layered high-temperature cuprate superconductors, where the Cooper pairs are confined to weakly coupled two-dimensional copper-oxygen planes, terahertz (THz) spectroscopy at sub-gap millielectronvolt energies has provided crucial insights into the collective superfluid response perpendicular to the superconducting layers. However, within the copper-oxygen planes the collective superfluid response manifests as plasmonic charge oscillations at energies far exceeding the superconducting gap, obscured by strong dissipation. Here, we present spectroscopic evidence of a below-gap, two-dimensional superfluid plasmon in few-layer Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x and spatially resolve its deeply sub-diffractive THz electrodynamics. By placing the superconductor in the near-field of a spintronic THz emitter, we reveal this distinct resonance-absent in bulk samples and observed only in the superconducting phase-and determine its plasmonic nature by mapping the geometric anisotropy and dispersion. Crucially, these measurements offer a direct view of the momentum- and frequency dependent superconducting transition in two dimensions. These results establish a new platform for investigating superfluid phenomena at finite momenta and THz frequencies, highlighting the potential to engineer and visualize superconducting devices operating at ultrafast THz rates.</description>

      <title>Precise control of the phase-transition temperature of VO2 from 70 to -35 {\deg}C for tunable optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the combination of metal doping and ion bombardment as a hybrid technique to precisely engineer the insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) properties of vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$) films. This approach enables (i) setting the phase-transition temperature ($T_c$) from $-35$ to $70$ {\deg}C, (ii) near-zero hysteresis in highly doped and irradiated films, and (iii) robust optical contrast across a broad range of doping and irradiation conditions, down to $T_c = -35$ {\deg}C. While previous work has focused on engineering the IMT via one of metal doping or ion irradiation, our hybrid method utilizes both. In doing so, we address several lingering challenges in VO$_2$ engineering, including the trade-off between $T_c$ reduction and optical contrast, and limitations in the achievable value of T$_c$. Strain$-T_c$ correlation from XRD and Raman measurements suggests a common mechanism behind doping- and irradiation-induced $T_c$ reduction. The ability to reduce the $T_c$ and hysteresis of VO$_2$ while maintaining large optical contrast will extend the functionality of VO$_2$-based optical and optoelectronic devices, including detectors, limiters, and modulators.</description>

      <title>Neuralized Fermionic Tensor Networks for Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a class of neuralized fermionic tensor network states (NN-fTNS) that introduce non-linearity into fermionic tensor networks through configuration-dependent neural network transformations of the local tensors. The construction uses the fTNS algebra to implement a natural fermionic sign structure and is compatible with standard tensor network algorithms, but gains enhanced expressivity through the neural network parametrization. Using the 1D and 2D Fermi-Hubbard models as benchmarks, we demonstrate that NN-fTNS achieve order of magnitude improvements in the ground-state energy compared to pure fTNS with the same bond dimension, and can be systematically improved through both the tensor network bond dimension and the neural network parametrization. Compared to existing fermionic neural quantum states (NQS) based on Slater determinants and Pfaffians, NN-fTNS offer a physically motivated alternative fermionic structure. Furthermore, compared to such states, NN-fTNS naturally exhibit improved computational scaling and we demonstrate a construction that achieves linear scaling with the lattice size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a tight-binding model that hosts both a quasi-periodic nature and marcoscopically-dengenerate zero-energy modes. The model can be regarded as a counterpart of the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper (AAH) model, which is a paradigmatic example of the quasi-periodic tight-binding model. Our main focus is on the many-body state where the flat-band-like degenerate zero-energy modes are fully occupied. We find a characteristic sublattice dependence of the particle density distribution. Further, by analyzing the hyperuniformity of the particle density distribution, we find that it belongs to the class-I hyperuniform distribution, regardless of the model parameter. We also show that, upon changing the parameter, the finite-energy modes exhibit the same extended-to-localized transition as that for the original AAH model.</description>

Abstract: We report the first observation of a momentum-resolved superconducting gap in the Hg-based trilayer cuprate, which holds the highest record of superconducting transition temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$) at ambient pressure. By angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy utilizing a micro-focused beam, clear quasiparticle dispersions originating from the inner and outer CuO$_2$ planes (IP and OP, respectively) were separately identified. The magnitude of the superconducting gap for the IP was comparable to that of the Bi-based trilayer cuprate with a lower $T_\mathrm{c}$. In contrast, the superconducting gap for the OP was significantly larger than that of the Bi-based one. While strong pairing in the IP has been highlighted as the key element of trilayer cuprates, the present results suggest that the enhanced pairing energy in the OP is essential for the highest $T_\mathrm{c}$ at ambient pressure realized in the Hg-based trilayer cuprate.</description>

Abstract: The search for new quantum spin liquid materials relies on systems with strong frustration such as spins on an ideal kagome lattice. However, lattice imperfections can have substantial effects which are as yet not well understood. In recent work the 2D kagome system YCu$_3$(OH)$_6$[(Cl$_x$Br$_{(1-x)}$)$_{3-y}$(OH)$_y$] (YCOB-Cl) has emerged as a leading candidate hosting a Dirac spin liquid which appears to survive at least for x&lt;0.4, associated with alternating-bond hexagon (ABH) disorder. Here in samples with x=0.58, y=0.1 we report unusual in-plane ferromagnetic canting (FM) of the in-plane antiferromagnet with moreover an expanded regime of short-ranged order, and propose a theoretical model to explain this behavior. We show that Kitaev type exchanges naturally arise on the kagome lattice to second order in the known Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchanges, and that these interactions can produce the unusual in-plane FM moments. We propose a spin cluster phenomenological model to describe the short-ranged regime and analyze quantum fluctuations in a toy model to show how ABH disorder helps stabilize this regime. The combination of experimental observation and theory suggests that kagome-Kitaev interactions and ABH disorder are necessary for describing the magnetic fluctuations in this family of materials, with potential implications for the proposed proximate spin liquid phase.</description>

      <title>Anti-symmetric Chiral currents at zero magnetic field in some two-dimensional superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal critical currents without applying an external magnetic field have been observed recently in several superconductors, in various forms of Graphene, a Kagome compound and in an under-doped cuprate. A necessary requirement for this is that the usual supercurrent be accompanied by an anti-symmetric chiral super-current, i.e. with the symmetry of a hall current; equivalently that the superfluid density tensor have an anti-symmetric chiral component. It also requires inversion breaking. The conditions for this phenomena are derived to find that their normal states must break time-reversal and chirality and that the superconducting states must in addition be non-unitary. Each of the superconductors where spontaneous non-reciprocal critical currents are observed have shown some evidence for such broken symmetries in the normal state. The superconducting state of such materials have topological edge currents, but their projected electro-magnetic part is in general not an integer. The edge states are protected in the superconductor due to a gap. The normal state should show a Kerr effect and, under ideal conditions, an anomalous Hall effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a universal framework for classifying quantum states based on their scale-resolved correlation structure. Using the recently introduced information lattice, which provides an operational definition of the total amount of correlations at each scale, we define intrinsic characteristic length scales of quantum states. We analyze ground and midspectrum eigenstates of the disordered interacting Kitaev chain, showing that our framework provides a novel unbiased approach to quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Hall Angle of a Spatially Random Vector Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07792v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strange metals exhibit linear resistivity and anomalous Hall transport, yet a comprehensive theory that accounts for both phenomena is still lacking. Recent studies have shown SYK-like spatially random couplings between a Fermi surface and a bosonic field, either scalar or vector type, can yield linear-$T$ resistivity. In this paper, we continue the investigation on a vector coupling in the presence of a magnetic field. We compute the fermion and boson propagators, along with the self-energy and polarization functions, and determine their dependence on the magnetic field. Although the Hall angle does not exhibit the signature of strange-metal, the linear-in-temperature resistivity remains at low temperatures. Results indicate that random interactions can robustly support linear transport, though additional ingredients may be required to capture the full phenomenology of strange metals.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle interference on the surface of Bi$_{\mathbf{2}}$Se$_{\mathbf{3}}$ terminated (PbSe)$_{\mathbf 5}$(Bi$_{\mathbf 2}$Se$_{\mathbf 3}$)$_{\mathbf 6}$</title>

Abstract: Among the family of topological superconductors derived from {\BiSe}, $\mathrm{Cu}_x(\mathrm{PbSe})_{5}(\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3})_{6}$ is unique in its surface termination of a single quintuple layer (QL) of the topological insulator (TI) \BiSe{} on an ordinary insulator PbSe. Here, we report a combined scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT) characterization of the cleaved surface of the parent compound $(\mathrm{PbSe})_{5}(\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3})_{6}$ (PSBS). Interestingly, the potential disorder due to the random distribution of native defects is only $\Gamma \sim 4~\mathrm{meV}$, comparable to the smallest reported for TIs. Performing high-resolution quasiparticle interference imaging (QPI) near the Fermi energy ($E-E_\mathrm{F} = -1~\mathrm{eV}~\mathrm{to}~0.6~\mathrm{eV}$) we reconstruct the dispersion relation of the dominant spectral feature and our ab initio calculations show that this surface feature originates from two bands with Rashba-like splitting due to strong spin-orbit coupling and inversion symmetry breaking. Moreover, only a small hexagonal distortion of the calculated Fermi surface is seen in the full momentum space distribution of the measured scattering data. Nevertheless, the scattering pattern at lower energies transforms into a flower-like shape with suppressed intensity along the $\overline{\Gamma \mathrm{K}}$ direction. We show that this effect is not due to the forbidden backscattering in the spin-momentum locked surface state in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ but reflects the threefold symmetry of the scattering potential.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Tensor Coupling in Holographic Mean-Field Theory: Deformed Dirac Cones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the holographic mean-field theory to rank-two symmetric tensor order parameter field coupled with fermion. We classify the roles of symmetric tensor order according to the effect on the spectral density: cone-angle change, squashing, and tilting of the spectral light cones. The over-tilted light cone is also achieved in a generalized prescription, which consistently preserves the causality condition. Our results provide agreements between the holographic spectra with those observed in real materials, such as type-II Dirac cones and strained graphene.</description>

      <title>Superconducting gaps revealed by STM measurements on La2PrNi2O7 thin films at ambient pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in nickelate systems has generated tremendous interests in the field of superconductivity. The superconducting transition temperature above 80 K in La3Ni2O7 under pressure and the coexisting spin excitations certainly categorize the nickelate superconductors as unconventional. The core issue to understand the superconductivity mechanism is about the superconducting gap and its symmetry. By using the substrate of SrLaAlO4(00l), we have successfully synthesized the superconducting thin film of La2PrNi2O7 with Tc(onset) = 41.5 K. Superconducting tunneling spectra are successfully measured on the terraces after we remove the surface layer and expose the superconducting layer by using the tip-excavation technique. The spectrum shows a two-gap structure with Delta1 = 19 meV, Delta2 = 6 meV, and fittings based on the Dynes model indicate that the dominant gap should have an anisotropic s-wave structure, and the pure d-wave model fails to fit the data. Thus, our data put the priority in selecting the s+- among the two arguable pairing models: s+- and d-wave. Assuming the dominant interlayer superconducting gap, we obtain its magnitude to be Delta(perp) = 13 meV, while the intralayer gap Delta(para) is about 6 meV. Our results shed new light in understanding the mystery of superconductivity in bilayer nickelate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Gor'kov-Hedin Equations for Quantum Many-Body Systems with Spin-Dependent Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Driven by the need to understand and determine the presence of non-trivial superconductivity in real candidate materials, we present a generalized set of self-consistent Gor'kov-Hedin equations in a vibrating lattice with spin dependent electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions. This extends Hedin's original equations to treat quantum many-body systems where electronic and lattice correlations along with relativistic effects coexist on the same footing. Upon iterating this set of equations, the corresponding spin-dependent GW approximation and generalized ladder approximations are constructed.</description>
