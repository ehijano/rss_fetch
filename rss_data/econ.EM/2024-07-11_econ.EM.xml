      <title>Reduced-Rank Matrix Autoregressive Models: A Medium $N$ Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduced-rank regressions are powerful tools used to identify co-movements within economic time series. However, this task becomes challenging when we observe matrix-valued time series, where each dimension may have a different co-movement structure. We propose reduced-rank regressions with a tensor structure for the coefficient matrix to provide new insights into co-movements within and between the dimensions of matrix-valued time series. Moreover, we relate the co-movement structures to two commonly used reduced-rank models, namely the serial correlation common feature and the index model. Two empirical applications involving U.S.\ states and economic indicators for the Eurozone and North American countries illustrate how our new tools identify co-movements.</description>

      <title>Production function estimation using subjective expectations data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard methods for estimating production functions in the Olley and Pakes (1996) tradition require assumptions on input choices. We introduce a new method that exploits (increasingly available) data on a firm's expectations of its future output and inputs that allows us to obtain consistent production function parameter estimates while relaxing these input demand assumptions. In contrast to dynamic panel methods, our proposed estimator can be implemented on very short panels (including a single cross-section), and Monte Carlo simulations show it outperforms alternative estimators when firms' material input choices are subject to optimization error. Implementing a range of production function estimators on UK data, we find our proposed estimator yields results that are either similar to or more credible than commonly-used alternatives. These differences are larger in industries where material inputs appear harder to optimize. We show that TFP implied by our proposed estimator is more strongly associated with future jobs growth than existing methods, suggesting that failing to adequately account for input endogeneity may underestimate the degree of dynamic reallocation in the economy.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of Mixed-Data Sampling (MIDAS) model compared to Lag-Llama model for inflation nowcasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inflation is one of the most important economic indicators closely watched by both public institutions and private agents. This study compares the performance of a traditional econometric model, Mixed Data Sampling regression, with one of the newest developments from the field of Artificial Intelligence, a foundational time series forecasting model based on a Long short-term memory neural network called Lag-Llama, in their ability to nowcast the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices in the Euro area. Two models were compared and assessed whether the Lag-Llama can outperform the MIDAS regression, ensuring that the MIDAS regression is evaluated under the best-case scenario using a dataset spanning from 2010 to 2022. The following metrics were used to evaluate the models: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), correlation with the target, R-squared and adjusted R-squared. The results show better performance of the pre-trained Lag-Llama across all metrics.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Causal Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In social sciences and economics, causal inference traditionally focuses on assessing the impact of predefined treatments (or interventions) on predefined outcomes, such as the effect of education programs on earnings. Causal discovery, in contrast, aims to uncover causal relationships among multiple variables in a data-driven manner, by investigating statistical associations rather than relying on predefined causal structures. This approach, more common in computer science, seeks to understand causality in an entire system of variables, which can be visualized by causal graphs. This survey provides an introduction to key concepts, algorithms, and applications of causal discovery from the perspectives of economics and social sciences. It covers fundamental concepts like d-separation, causal faithfulness, and Markov equivalence, sketches various algorithms for causal discovery, and discusses the back-door and front-door criteria for identifying causal effects. The survey concludes with more specific examples of causal discovery, e.g. for learning all variables that directly affect an outcome of interest and/or testing identification of causal effects in observational data.</description>

      <title>Individualized Treatment Allocation in Sequential Network Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05747v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing individualized allocation of treatments so as to maximize the equilibrium welfare of interacting agents has many policy-relevant applications. Focusing on sequential decision games of interacting agents, this paper develops a method to obtain optimal treatment assignment rules that maximize a social welfare criterion by evaluating stationary distributions of outcomes. Stationary distributions in sequential decision games are given by Gibbs distributions, which are difficult to optimize with respect to a treatment allocation due to analytical and computational complexity. We apply a variational approximation to the stationary distribution and optimize the approximated equilibrium welfare with respect to treatment allocation using a greedy optimization algorithm. We characterize the performance of the variational approximation, deriving a performance guarantee for the greedy optimization algorithm via a welfare regret bound. We implement our proposed method in simulation exercises and an empirical application using the Indian microfinance data (Banerjee et al., 2013), and show it delivers significant welfare gains.</description>
