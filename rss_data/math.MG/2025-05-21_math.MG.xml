      <title>Bounding the density of binary sphere packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides the currently best known upper bound on the density of a packing in three-dimensional Euclidean space of two types of spheres whose size ratio is the largest one that allows the insertion of a small sphere in each octahedral hole of a hexagonal compact packing of large spheres. This upper bound is obtained by bounding from above the density of the tetrahedra which can appear in the additively-weighted Delaunay decomposition of the sphere centers of such packings. The proof relies on challenging computer calculations in interval arithmetic and may be of interest by their own.</description>

      <title>Subshifts on groups and computable analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of subshifts on groups different from $\mathbb{Z}$, such as $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\geq 2$, has been a subject of intense research in recent years. These investigations have unveiled aremarkable connection between dynamics and recursion theory. Different questions about the dynamics of these systems have been answered in recursion-theoretical terms. In this work we further explore this connection. We use the framework of computable analysis to explore the class of effective dynamical systems on metric spaces, and relate these systems to subshifts of finite type (SFTs) on groups. We prove that every effective dynamical system on a general metric space is the topological factor of an effective dynamical system with topological dimension zero. We combine this result with existing simulation results to obtain new examples of systems that are factors of SFTsWe also study a conjugacy invariant for subshifts on groups called Medvedev degree. This invariant is a complexity measure of algorithmic nature. We develop the basic theory of these degrees for subshifts on arbitrary finitely generated groups. Using these tools we are able to classify the values that this invariant attains for SFTs and other classes of subshifts on several groups. Furthermore, we establish a connection between these degrees and the distribution of isolated points in the space of all subshifts. Motivated by the study of Medvedev degrees of subshifts, we also consider translation-like actions of groups on graphs. We prove that every connected, locally finite, and infinite graph admits a translation by $\mathbb{Z}$, and that this action can be chosen transitive exactly when the graph has one or two ends. This generalizes a result of Seward about translation-like actions of $\mathbb{Z}$ on finitely generated groups.</description>
