      <title>Invariants of almost embeddings of graphs in the plane: results and problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph drawing in the plane is called an almost embedding if images of any two non-adjacent simplices (i.e. vertices or edges) are disjoint. We introduce integer invariants of almost embeddings: winding number, cyclic and triodic Wu numbers. We construct almost embeddings realizing some values of these invariants. We prove some relations between the invariants. We study values realizable as invariants of some almost embedding, but not of any embedding.
  This paper is expository and is accessible to mathematicians not specialized in the area (and to students). However elementary, this paper is motivated by frontline of research.</description>

      <title>Towards an optimal hypergraph container lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hypergraph container lemma is a powerful tool in probabilistic combinatorics that has found many applications since it was first proved a decade ago. Roughly speaking, it asserts that the family of independent sets of every uniform hypergraph can be covered by a small number of almost-independent sets, called containers. In this article, we formulate and prove two new versions of the lemma that display the following three attractive features. First, they both admit short and simple proofs that have surprising connections to other well-studied topics in probabilistic combinatorics. Second, they use alternative notions of almost-independence in order to describe the containers. Third, they yield improved dependence of the number of containers on the uniformity of the hypergraph, hitting a natural barrier for second-moment-type approaches.</description>

      <title>New Families of tripartite graphs with local antimagic chromatic number 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G(V,E)$ of size $q$, a bijection $f : E(G) \to [1,q]$ is a local antimagc labeling if it induces a vertex labeling $f^+ : V(G) \to \mathbb{N}$ such that $f^+(u) \ne f^+(v)$, where $f^+(u)$ is the sum of all the incident edge label(s) of $u$, for every edge $uv \in E(G)$. In this paper, we make use of matrices of fixed sizes to construct several families of infinitely many tripartite graphs with local antimagic chromatic number 3.</description>

      <title>Saturation Numbers for Linear Forests $P_7+tP_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a fixed graph, a graph G is $H$-saturated if it has no copy of $H$ in $G$, but the addition of any edge in $E(\overline G)$ to $G$ results in an $H$-subgraph. The saturation number sat$(n,H)$ is the minimum number of edges in an $H$-saturated graph on $n$ vertices. In this paper, we determine the saturation number sat$(n,P_7+tP_2)$ for $n\geq \frac {14}{5}t+27$ and characterize the extremal graphs for $n\geq \frac{14}{13}(3t+25)$.</description>

      <title>On the locating-chromatic number of corona product of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be a finite, simple, and connected graph. The locating-chromatic number of a graph $G$ can be defined as the cardinality of a minimum resolving partition of the vertex set $V(G)$ such that all vertices have different coordinates and every two adjacent vertices in $G$ is not contained in the same partition class. In this case, the coordinate of a vertex in $G$ is expressed in terms of the distances of this vertex to all partition classes. The corona product of a graph $G$ of order $n$ and a graph $H,$ denoted by $G \odot H,$ is the graph obtained by taking one copy of $G$ and $n$ copies of $H$ and joining the $i^{th}$-vertex of $G$ to every vertex in the $i^{th}$-copy of $H$. In this paper, we determine the sharp general bound of the locating-chromatic number of $G \odot H$ for $G$ is a connected graph and $H$ is an arbitrary graph, or $G$ is a tree graph and $H$ is a complement of complete graph.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonicity of Cartesian products of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A path factor in a graph $G$ is a factor of $G$ in which every component is a path on at least two vertices. Let $T\Box P_n$ be the Cartesian product of a tree $T$ and a path on $n$ vertices. Kao and Weng proved that $T\Box P_n$ is hamiltonian if $T$ has a path factor, $n$ is an even integer and $n\geq 4\Delta (T)-2$. They conjectured that for every $\Delta \geq 3$ there exists a graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$ which has a path factor, such that for every even $n&lt; 4\Delta-2$ the product $G\Box P_n$ is not hamiltonian. In this article we prove this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Most $q$-matroids are not representable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $q$-matroid is the analogue of a matroid which arises by replacing the finite ground set of a matroid with a finite-dimensional vector space over a finite field. These $q$-matroids are motivated by coding theory as the representable $q$-matroids are the ones that stem from rank-metric codes. In this note, we establish a $q$-analogue of Nelson's theorem in matroid theory by proving that asymptotically almost all $q$-matroids are not representable. This answers a question about representable $q$-matroids by Jurrius and Pellikaan strongly in the negative.</description>

      <title>Three applications of coverings to difference patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a conceptually simple covering technique has surprisingly rich applications to density theorems and conjectures on patterns in sets involving set differences. These applications fall into three categories: (i) analogues of these statements to distance $2$ versions of the pattern, (ii) reduction of these statements to relative versions, and (iii) reductions of these statements to a quasirandom case with respect to some quantities that affect the number of realisations of the pattern.</description>

      <title>On the Lottery Problem: Tracing Stefan Mandel's Combinatorial Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stephan Mandel is the man who won the lottery 14 times. He never disclosed the recipe he called combinatorial condensation, which enabled him to hit the Romanian lottery jackpot in the early phase of his betting career. Combinatorial condensation is frequently mixed up with another strategy known as buying the pot, which Stefan Mandel was pursuing later on. On occasion, he dropped a few hints on combinatorial condensation. The hints are applied in this work to narrow down and assess his initial recipe. The underlying theory resembles what a weekend mathematician, as he once referred to himself, may have encountered in the 1960s. Calculations indicate that he took residual risks that his method might fail. Residual risks explain why he changed his strategy from combinatorial condensation to buying the pot. The cardinality of the (15, 6, 6, 5)- and the (49, 6, 6, 5)-lottery scheme shows that Stefan Mandel probably wasn't aware of lottery designs. First concepts on such topics had been available at that time, but coherent theories on combinatorial designs took off only in later decades, triggered by growing computing power, and eventually triggered by Stefan Mandel's publicity and successes in the field. But, as the comparison with actual covering designs reveals, Stefan Mandel probably constructed a (15, 6, 5)-covering design years before others published about it, which he applied in the Romanian lottery.</description>

      <title>Higher $q$-Continued Fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a $q$-analog of the higher continued fractions introduced by the last three authors in a previous work (together with Gregg Musiker), which are simultaneously a generalization of the $q$-rational numbers of Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko. They are defined as ratios of generating functions for $P$-partitions on certain posets. We give matrix formulas for computing them, which generalize previous results in the $q=1$ case. We also show that certain properties enjoyed by the $q$-rationals are also satisfied by our higher versions.</description>

      <title>New refinements of Narayana polynomials and Motzkin polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chen, Deutsch and Elizalde introduced a refinement of the Narayana polynomials by distinguishing between old (leftmost child) and young leaves of plane trees. They also provided a refinement of Coker's formula by constructing a bijection. In fact, Coker's formula establishes a connection between the Narayana polynomials and the Motzkin polynomials, which implies the $\gamma$-positivity of the Narayana polynomials. In this paper, we introduce the polynomial $G_{n}(x_{11},x_{12},x_2;y_{11},y_{12},y_2)$, which further refine the Narayana polynomials by considering leaves of plane trees that have no siblings. We obtain the generating function for $G_n(x_{11},x_{12},x_2;y_{11},y_{12},y_2)$. To achieve further refinement of Coker's formula based on the polynomial $G_n(x_{11},x_{12},x_2;y_{11},y_{12},y_2)$, we consider a refinement $M_n(u_1,u_2,u_3;v_1,v_2)$ of the Motzkin polynomials by classifying the old leaves of a tip-augmented plane tree into three categories and the young leaves into two categories. The generating function for $M_n(u_1,u_2,u_3;v_1,v_2)$ is also established, and the refinement of Coker's formula is immediately derived by combining the generating function for $G_n(x_{11},x_{12},x_2;y_{11},y_{12},y_2)$ and the generating function for $M_n(u_1,u_2,u_3;v_1,v_2)$. We derive several interesting consequences from this refinement of Coker's formula. The method used in this paper is the grammatical approach introduced by Chen. We develop a unified grammatical approach to exploring polynomials associated with the statistics defined on plane trees. As you will see, the derivations of the generating functions for $G_n(x_{11},x_{12},x_2;{y}_{11},{{y}}_{12},y_2)$ and $M_n(u_1,u_2,u_3;v_1,v_2)$ become quite simple once their grammars are established.</description>

      <title>Skeletal generalizations of Dyck paths, parking functions, and chip-firing games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $0\leq k\leq n-1$, we introduce a family of $k$-skeletal paths which are counted by the $n$-th Catalan number for each $k$, and specialize to Dyck paths when $k=n-1$. We similarly introduce $k$-skeletal parking functions which are equinumerous with the spanning trees on $n+1$ vertices for each $k$, and specialize to classical parking functions for $k=n-1$. The preceding constructions are generalized to paths lying in a trapezoid with base $c &gt; 0$ and southeastern diagonal of slope $1/m$; $c$ and $m$ need not be integers. We give bijections among these families when $k$ varies with $m$ and $c$ fixed. Our constructions are motivated by chip firing and have connections to combinatorial representation theory and tropical geometry.</description>

      <title>Constructing reflection-symmetric flexible realisations of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study reflection-symmetric realisations of symmetric graphs in the plane that allow a continuous symmetry and edge-length preserving deformation. To do so, we identify a necessary combinatorial condition on graphs with reflection-symmetric flexible realisations. This condition is based on a specific type of edge colouring, where edges are assigned one of three colours in a symmetric way. From some of these colourings we also construct concrete reflection-symmetric realisations with their corresponding symmetry preserving motion. We study also a specific class of reflection-symmetric realisations consisting of triangles and parallelograms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ascent sequences play a key role in the combinatorics of Fishburn structures. Difference ascent sequences are a natural generalization obtained by replacing ascents with $d$-ascents. We have recently extended the so-called hat map to difference ascent sequences, and self-modified difference ascent sequences are the fixed points under this map. We characterize self-modified difference ascent sequences and enumerate them in terms of certain generalized Fibonacci polynomials. Furthermore, we describe the corresponding subset of $d$-Fishburn permutations.</description>

      <title>On determinants of tournaments and $\mathcal{D}_k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a tournament with $n$ vertices $v_1,\ldots,v_n$. The skew-adjacency matrix of $T$ is the $n\times n$ zero-diagonal matrix $S_T = [s_{ij}]$ in which $s_{ij}=-s_{ji}=1$ if $ v_i $ dominates $ v_j $. We define the determinant $\det(T)$ of $ T $ as the determinant of $ S_T $. It is well-known that $\det(T)=0$ if $n$ is odd and $\det(T)$ is the square of an odd integer if $n$ is even. Let $\mathcal{D}_k$ be the set of tournaments whose all subtournaments have determinant at most $ k^{2} $, where $k$ is a positive odd integer. The necessary and sufficient condition for $T\in \mathcal{D}_1$ or $T\in \mathcal{D}_3$ has been characterized in $2023$. In this paper, we characterize the set $\mathcal{D}_5$, obtain some properties of $\mathcal{D}_k$. Moreover, for any positive odd integer $k$, we give a construction of a tournament $T$ satisfying that $\det(T)=k^2$, and $T\in \mathcal{D}_k\backslash\mathcal{D}_{k-2}$ if $k\geq 3$, which implies $\mathcal{D}_k\backslash\mathcal{D}_{k-2}$ is not an empty set for $k\geq 3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defining distances over finite fields formally by $||x-y||:=(x_1-y_1)^2+\cdots + (x_d-y_d)^2$ for $x,y\in \mathbb{F}_q^d$, distance problems naturally arise in analogy to those studied by Erd\H{o}s and Falconer in Euclidean space. Given a graph $G$ and a set $E\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^2$, let $\Delta_G(E)$ be the generalized distance set corresponding to $G$. In the case when $G$ is the complete graph on $k+1$ vertices, Bennett, Hart, Iosevich, Pakianathan, and Rudnev showed that when $|E|\geq q^{d-\frac{d-1}{k+1}}$, it follows that $|\Delta_G(E)|\geq cq^{\binom{k+1}{2}}$. In the case when $k=d=2$, the threshold can be improved to $|E|\geq q^{\frac{8}{5}}$.
  Moreover, Jardine, Iosevich, and McDonald showed that in the case when $G$ is a tree with $k+1$ vertices, then whenever $E\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^d$, $d\geq 2$ satisfies $|E|\geq C_kq^{\frac{d+1}{2}}$, it follows that $\Delta_G(E)=\mathbb{F}_q^k$. In this paper, we present a technique which enables us to study certain graphs with both rigid and non-rigid components. In particular, we show that for $E\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^2$, $q=p^n$, $n$ odd, $p\equiv 3 \ \text{mod} \ 4$, and $G$ is the graph consisting of two triangles joined at a vertex, then whenever $|E|\geq q^{\frac{12}{7}}$, it follows that $|\Delta_G(E)|\geq cq^6$.</description>

      <title>A short note on spanning even trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We call a tree $T$ is \emph{even} if every pair of its leaves is joined by a path of even length. Jackson and Yoshimoto\cite{jacksonspanning}~[J. Graph Theory, 2024] conjectured that every $r$-regular nonbipartite connected graph $G$ has a spanning even tree. They verified this conjecture for the case when $G$ has a $2$-factor. In this paper, we prove that the conjecture holds when $r$ is odd, thereby resolving the only remaining unsolved case for this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Clustering and Degree Index in Random Graphs and Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the degree index and clustering index in random graphs. The degree index in our setup is a certain measure of degree irregularity whose basic properties are well studied in the literature, and the corresponding theoretical analysis in a random graph setup turns out to be tractable. On the other hand, the clustering index, based on a similar reasoning, is first introduced in this manuscript. Computing exact expressions for the expected clustering index turns out to be more challenging even in the case of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, and our results are on obtaining relevant upper bounds. These are also complemented with observations based on Monte Carlo simulations. Besides the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi case, we also do simulation-based analysis for random regular graphs, the Barab\'asi-Albert model and the Watts-Strogatz model.</description>

Abstract: Let $G_{k,n}$ be a group of permutations of $kn$ objects which permutes things independently in disjoint blocks of size $k$ and then permutes the blocks. We investigate the probabilistic and/or enumerative aspects of random elements of $G_{k,n}$. This includes novel limit theorems for fixed points, cycles of various lengths, number of cycles and inversions. The limits are compound Poisson distributions with interesting dependence structure.</description>

      <title>From Maximum Cut to Maximum Independent Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Maximum Cut (Max-Cut) problem could be naturally expressed either in a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation, or as an Ising model. It has long been known that the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem could also be related to a specific Ising model. Therefore, it would be natural to attack MIS with various Max-Cut/Ising solvers. It turns out that this strategy greatly improves the approximation for the independence number of random Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graphs. It also exhibits perfect performance on a benchmark arising from coding theory. These results pave the way for further development of approximate quantum algorithms on MIS, and specifically on the corresponding coding problems.</description>

      <title>Periodic minimum in the count of binomial coefficients not divisible by a prime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The summatory function of the number of binomial coefficients not divisible by a prime is known to exhibit regular periodic oscillations, yet identifying the less regularly behaved minimum of the underlying periodic functions has been open for almost all cases. We propose an approach to identify such minimum in some generality, solving particularly a previous conjecture of B. Wilson [Asymptotic behavior of Pascal's triangle modulo a prime, Acta Arith. 83 (1998), pp. 105-116].</description>

      <title>A complete characterization of pairs of binary phylogenetic trees with identical $A_k$-alignments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees play a key role in the reconstruction of evolutionary relationships. Typically, they are derived from aligned sequence data (like DNA, RNA, or proteins) by using optimization criteria like, e.g., maximum parsimony (MP). It is believed that the latter is able to reconstruct the \enquote{true} tree, i.e., the tree that generated the data, whenever the number of substitutions required to explain the data with that tree is relatively small compared to the size of the tree (measured in the number $n$ of leaves of the tree, which represent the species under investigation). However, reconstructing the correct tree from any alignment first and foremost requires the given alignment to perform differently on the \enquote{correct} tree than on others.
  A special type of alignments, namely so-called $A_k$-alignments, has gained considerable interest in recent literature. These alignments consist of all binary characters (\enquote{sites}) which require precisely $k$ substitutions on a given tree. It has been found that whenever $k$ is small enough (in comparison to $n$), $A_k$-alignments uniquely characterize the trees that generated them. However, recent literature has left a significant gap between $k\leq 2k+2$ -- namely the cases in which no such characterization is possible -- and $k\geq 4k$ -- namely the cases in which this characterization works. It is the main aim of the present manuscript to close this gap, i.e., to present a full characterization of all pairs of trees that share the same $A_k$-alignment. In particular, we show that indeed every binary phylogenetic tree with $n$ leaves is uniquely defined by its $A_k$-alignments if $n\geq 2k+3$. By closing said gap, we also ensure that our result is optimal.</description>

Abstract: We study a collection of Hessenberg varieties in the type A flag variety associated to a nonzero semisimple matrix whose conjugacy class has minimal dimension. We prove each such minimal semisimple Hessenberg variety is a union Richardson varieties and compute this set of Richardson varieties explicitly. Our methods leverage the notion of matrix Hessenberg schemes to answer questions about the geometry of minimal semisimple Hessenberg varieties using commutative algebra and known results on Schubert determinantal ideals. In particular, we show that all type A minimal semisimple matrix Hessenberg schemes are reduced.</description>

      <title>A $5/4$ Approximation for Two-Edge-Connectivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $2$-Edge Connected Spanning Subgraph problem (2ECSS) is among the most basic survivable network design problems: given an undirected unweighted graph, find a subgraph with the minimum number of edges which is 2-edge-connected (i.e., it remains connected after the removal of any single edge). This NP-hard problem is well-studied in terms of approximation algorithms. The current-best approximation factor for 2ECSS is $1.3+\varepsilon$ for any constant $\varepsilon &gt;0$ [Garg, Grandoni, Jabal-Ameli'23; Kobayashi,Noguchi'23]. In this paper we present a much simpler $9/7$ approximation algorithm, and a more complex $5/4$ one. Our algorithms are also faster: their running time is $n^{O(1)}$ instead of $n^{O(1/\varepsilon)}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalized Ramsey number $f(n, p, q)$ is the smallest number of colors needed to color the edges of the complete graph $K_n$ so that every $p$-clique spans at least $q$ colors. Erd\H{o}s and Gy\'arf\'as showed that $f(n, p, q)$ grows linearly in $n$ when $p$ is fixed and $q=q_{\text{lin}}(p):=\binom p2-p+3$. Similarly they showed that $f(n, p, q)$ is quadratic in $n$ when $p$ is fixed and $q=q_{\text{quad}}(p):=\binom p2-\frac p2+2$. In this note we improve on the known estimates for $f(n, p, q_{\text{lin}})$ and $f(n, p, q_{\text{quad}})$. Our proofs involve establishing a significant strengthening of a previously known connection between $f(n, p, q)$ and another extremal problem first studied by Brown, Erd\H{o}s and S\'os, as well as building on some recent progress on this extremal problem by Delcourt and Postle and by Shangguan. Also, our upper bound on $f(n, p, q_{\text{lin}})$ follows from an application of the recent forbidden submatchings method of Delcourt and Postle.</description>

Abstract: A clique transversal in a graph is a set of vertices intersecting all maximal cliques. The problem of determining the minimum size of a clique transversal has received considerable attention in the literature. In this paper, we initiate the study of the ''upper'' variant of this parameter, the upper clique transversal number, defined as the maximum size of a minimal clique transversal. We investigate this parameter from the algorithmic and complexity points of view, with a focus on various graph classes. We show that the corresponding decision problem is NP-complete in the classes of chordal graphs, chordal bipartite graphs, cubic planar bipartite graphs, and line graphs of bipartite graphs, but solvable in linear time in the classes of split graphs, proper interval graphs, and cographs, and in polynomial time for graphs of bounded cliquewidth. We conclude the paper with a number of open questions.</description>

      <title>Nontrivial $t$-designs in polar spaces exist for all $t$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A finite classical polar space of rank $n$ consists of the totally isotropic subspaces of a finite vector space over $\mathbb{F}_q$ equipped with a nondegenerate form such that $n$ is the maximal dimension of such a subspace. A $t$-$(n,k,\lambda)$ design in a finite classical polar space of rank $n$ is a collection $Y$ of totally isotropic $k$-spaces such that each totally isotropic $t$-space is contained in exactly $\lambda$ members of $Y$. Nontrivial examples are currently only known for $t\leq 2$. We show that $t$-$(n,k,\lambda)$ designs in polar spaces exist for all $t$ and $q$ provided that $k&gt;\frac{21}{2}t$ and $n$ is sufficiently large enough. The proof is based on a probabilistic method by Kuperberg, Lovett, and Peled, and it is thus nonconstructive.</description>

Abstract: A graph $G=(V,E)$ is called a \textit{$k$-threshold graph} with \textit{thresholds} $\theta_1&lt;\theta_2&lt;...&lt;\theta_k$ if we can assign a real number $r(v)$ to each vertex $v\in V$, such that for any $u,v\in V$, we have $uv\in E$ if and only if $r(u)+r(v)\ge \theta_i$ holds true for an odd number of elements in $\{\theta_1,\theta_2,...,\theta_k\}$. The smallest integer $k$ such that $G$ is a $k$-threshold graph is called the \textit{threshold number} of $G$. For the complete multipartite graphs and the cluster graphs, Kittipassorn and Sumalroj determined the exact threshold numbers of $K_{n\times 3}$ and $nK_3$. On the basis of Kittipassorn and Sumalroj's results, we determine the exact threshold numbers of $K_{n_1\times 1, n_2\times 2, n_3\times 3}$ and $n_1 K_1\cup n_2 K_2\cup n_3 K_3$, which solve a problem proposed by Sumalroj.</description>

      <title>Root polytopes, flow polytopes, and order polytopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the class of polytopes which can be obtained by taking the convex hull of some subset of the points $\{e_i-e_j \ \vert \ i \neq j\} \cup \{\pm e_i\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, where $e_1,\dots,e_n$ is the standard basis of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Such a polytope can be encoded by a quiver $Q$ with vertices $V \subseteq \{v_1,\dots,v_n\} \cup \{\star\}$, where each edge $v_j\to v_i$ or $\star \to v_i$ or $v_i\to \star$ gives rise to the point $e_i-e_j$ or $e_i$ or $-e_i$, respectively; we denote the corresponding polytope as $\operatorname{Root}(Q)$. These polytopes have been studied extensively under names such as edge polytope and root polytope. We show that if the quiver $Q$ is strongly-connected then the root polytope $\operatorname{Root}(Q)$ is reflexive and terminal; we moreover give a combinatorial description of the facets of $\operatorname{Root}(Q)$. We also show that if $Q$ is planar, then $\operatorname{Root}(Q)$ is (integrally equivalent to the) polar dual of the flow polytope of the dual quiver. Finally we consider the case that $Q$ comes from a ranked poset $P$, and show that $\operatorname{Root}(Q)$ is polar dual to (a translation of) a marked poset polytope. We then study the toric variety $Y(\mathcal{F}_Q)$ associated to the face fan $\mathcal{F}_Q$ of $\operatorname{Root}(Q)$. If $Q$ comes from a ranked poset $P$ we give a combinatorial description of the Picard group of $Y(\mathcal{F}_Q)$, and we show that $Y(\mathcal{F}_Q)$ is a small partial desingularisation of the Hibi toric variety $Y_{\mathcal{O}(P)}$ of the order polytope $\mathcal{O}(P)$. We show that $Y(\mathcal{F}_Q)$ has a small crepant toric resolution of singularities $Y(\widehat{\mathcal{F}}_Q)$, and as a consequence that the Hibi toric variety $Y_{\mathcal{O}(P)}$ has a small resolution of singularities for any ranked poset $P$. These results have applications to mirror symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define various notions of energy of a set of vertices in a graph, which generalize two of the most widely studied graphical indices: the Wiener index and the Harary index. We prove several theorems indicating that these notions of energy can be used to measure how evenly spread out a set of vertices is. For example, in one setting, a set of vertices of a cycle has minimal energy among all sets of vertices of equal size if and only if it is maximally even, as defined in Clough and Douthett's work on music theory. Generalizing a theorem of Clough and Douthett, we prove that a finite, simple, connected graph is distance degree regular if and only if whenever a set of vertices has minimal energy, its complement also has minimal energy. We provide several characterizations of sets of vertices in finite paths and cycles which have maximal Wiener index. For both finite paths and cycles, we prove that a set $A$ of vertices has maximal Wiener index, among all sets of the same size, if and only if swapping out any member of $A$ with some adjacent vertex not in $A$ never leads to a set with a strictly larger Wiener index; as a consequence, on paths and cycles, the usual gradient ascent algorithm provably produces a global maximizer. Furthermore, generalizing a theorem of Jiang, we prove that a set of vertices in a cycle has maximal Wiener index if and only if it satisfies a certain balanced condition.</description>

Abstract: We establish the dimension version of Falconer's distance set conjecture for sets of equal Hausdorff and packing dimension (in particular, for Ahlfors-regular sets) in all ambient dimensions. In dimensions $d=2$ or $3$, we obtain the first explicit estimates for the dimensions of distance sets of general Borel sets of dimension $d/2$; for example, we show that the set of distances spanned by a planar Borel set of Hausdorff dimension $1$ has Hausdorff dimension at least $(\sqrt{5}-1)/2\approx 0.618$. In higher dimensions we obtain explicit estimates for the lower Minkowski dimension of the distance sets of sets of dimension $d/2$. These results rely on new estimates for the dimensions of radial projections that may have independent interest.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that the lattice structure of a set of clusters in a cluster algebra of finite type is anti-isomorphic to the torsion lattice of a certain Geiss-Leclerc-Schr\"oer (GLS) path algebra and to the $c$-Cambrian lattice. We prove this by explicitly describing the exchange quivers of cluster algebras of finite type. Specifically, we prove that these quivers are anti-isomorphic to those formed by support $\tau$-tilting modules in GLS path algebras and to those formed by $c$-clusters consisting of almost positive roots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00046v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of enumerating maps $f$ of degree $d$ from a fixed general curve $C$ of genus $g$ to $\mathbb{P}^r$ satisfying incidence conditions of the form $f(p_i)\in X_i$, where $p_i\in C$ are general points and $X_i\subset\mathbb{P}^r$ are general linear spaces. We give a complete answer in the case where the $X_i$ are points, where the counts, the ``Tevelev degrees'' of $\mathbb{P}^r$, were previously known only when $r=1$, when $d$ is large compared to $r,g$, or virtually in Gromov-Witten theory. We also give a complete answer in the case $r=2$ with arbitrary incidence conditions. Our main approach studies the behavior of complete collineations under various degenerations. We expect the technique to have further applications.</description>

      <title>Efficient Equidistribution of Nilsequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10772v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give improved bounds for the equidistribution of (multiparameter) nilsequences subject to any degree filtration. The bounds we obtain are single exponential in dimension, improving on double exponential bounds of Green and Tao. To obtain these bounds, we overcome "induction of dimension'' which is ubiquitous throughout higher order Fourier analysis.
  The improved equidistribution theory is a crucial ingredient in the quasi-polynomial $U^4[N]$ inverse theorem of the author and its extension to the quasi-polynomial $U^{s + 1}[N]$ inverse theorem in joint work with Sah and Sawhney. These results lead to further applications in combinatorial number theory such as bounds for linear equations in the primes which save an arbitrary power of logarithm, which match the bounds Vinogradov obtained for the odd Goldbach conjecture.</description>

      <title>An approximation of the Collatz map and a lower bound for the average total stopping time</title>

Abstract: Define the map $\mathsf{T}$ on the positive integers by $\mathsf{T}(m)=\frac{m}{2}$ if $m$ is even and by $\mathsf{T}(m)=\frac{3m+1}{2}$ if $m$ is odd. Results of Terras and Everett imply that, given any $\epsilon&gt;0$, almost all $m\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ (in the sense of natural density) fulfill $(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})^km^{1-\epsilon}\leq \mathsf{T}^k(m)\leq (\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})^km^{1+\epsilon}$ simultaneously for all $0\leq k\leq \alpha\log m$ with $\alpha=(\log 2)^{-1}\approx 1.443$. We extend this result to $\alpha=2(\log\frac{4}{3})^{-1}\approx 6.952$, which is the maximally possible value. Set $\mathsf{T}_{\min}(m):=\min_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\mathsf{T}^n(m)$. As an immediate consequence, one has $\mathsf{T}_{\min}(m)\leq\mathsf{T}^{\left\lfloor2(\log\frac{4}{3})^{-1}\log m\right\rfloor}(m)\leq m^{\epsilon}$ for almost all $m\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ for any given $\epsilon&gt;0$. Previously, Korec has shown that $\mathsf{T}_{\min}(m)\leq m^\epsilon$ for almost all $m\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ if $\epsilon&gt;\frac{\log3}{\log4}$, and recently Tao proved that $\mathsf{T}_{\min}(m)\leq f(m)$ for almost all $m\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ (in the sense of logarithmic density) for all functions $f$ diverging to $\infty$. Denote by $\tau(m)$ the minimal $n\in\mathbb{N}$ for which $\mathsf{T}^n(m)=1$ if there exists such an $n$ and set $\tau(m)=\infty$ otherwise. As another application, we show that $\liminf_{x\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{x\log x}\sum_{m=1}^{\lfloor x\rfloor}\tau(m)\geq 2(\log\frac{4}{3})^{-1}$, partially answering a question of Crandall and Shanks. Under the assumption that the Collatz Conjecture is true in the strong sense that $\tau(m)$ is in $O(\log m)$, we show that $\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{x\log x}\sum_{m=1}^{\lfloor x\rfloor}\tau(m)= 2(\log\frac{4}{3})^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>A Gaussian integral that counts regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent article J. Phys. Compl. 4 (2023) 035005, Kawamoto evoked statistical physics methods for the problem of counting graphs with a prescribed degree sequence. This treatment involved truncating a particular Taylor expansion at the first two terms, which resulted in the Bender-Canfield estimate for the graph counts. This is surprisingly successful since the Bender-Canfield formula is asymptotically accurate for large graphs, while the series truncation does not a priori suggest a similar level of accuracy.
  We upgrade the above treatment in three directions. First, we derive an exact formula for counting d-regular graphs in terms of a d-dimensional Gaussian integral. Second, we show how to convert this formula into an integral representation for the generating function of d-regular graph counts. Third, we perform explicit saddle point analysis for large graph sizes and identify the saddle point configurations responsible for graph count estimates. In these saddle point configurations, only two of the integration variables condense to significant values, while the remaining ones approach zero for large graphs. This provides an underlying picture that justifies Kawamoto's earlier findings.</description>

      <title>Unmixed polymatroidal ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $R=K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ denote the polynomial ring in $n$ variables over a field $K$ and $I$ be a polymatroidal ideal of $R$. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive classification of all unmixed polymatroidal ideals. This work addresses a question raised by Herzog and Hibi in [10]</description>
