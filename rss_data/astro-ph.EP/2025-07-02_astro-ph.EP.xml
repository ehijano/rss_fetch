      <title>Orbit and atmosphere of HIP 99770 b through the eyes of VLTI/GRAVITY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Inferring the likely formation channel of giant exoplanets and brown dwarf companions from orbital and atmospheric observables remains a formidable challenge. Further and more precise directly measured dynamical masses of these companions are required to inform and gauge formation, evolutionary, and atmospheric models. We present an updated study of HIP 99770 b based on observations conducted with VLTI/GRAVITY. Aims: Combining the new data with previous observations from the literature, we characterise HIP 99770 b to better constrain its orbit, dynamical mass, and atmospheric properties, as well as to shed light on its likely formation channel. Methods: We ran a renewed orbit fit to further constrain the dynamical mass of the companion and the orbit solution. We also analysed the GRAVITY K-band spectrum, placing it into context with literature data, and extracting magnitude, age, spectral type, bulk properties and atmospheric characteristics of HIP 99770 b. Results: We detected the companion at a radial separation of $417\,\mathrm{mas}$ from its host. The new orbit fit yields a dynamical mass of $17_{-5}^{+6}\,\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{Jup}$ and an eccentricity of $0.31_{-0.12}^{+0.06}$. We also find that additional relative astrometry epochs in the future will not enable further constraints on the dynamical mass due to the dominating relative uncertainty on the Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion anomaly. The publication of Gaia DR4 will likely ease this predicament. We find that the companion is consistent with spectral type L8 and exhibits a potential metal enrichment in its atmosphere. Conclusions: These results do not yet allow for a definite inference of the companion's formation channel. Nevertheless, the new constraints on its bulk properties and the additional GRAVITY spectrum presented here will aid future efforts to determine the formation history of HIP 99770 b.</description>

      <title>SMA and NOEMA reveal asymmetric sub-structure in the protoplanetary disk of IRAS23077+6707</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-resolution data of IRAS 23077+6707 (`Dracula's Chivito') with the Submillimeter Array (SMA at 1.33 mm/225.5 GHz) and the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA at 2.7 mm/111.7 GHz and 3.1 mm/96.2 GHz). IRAS 23077+6707 is a highly-inclined and newly discovered protoplanetary disk, first reported in 2024. We combine SMA baselines from the Compact, Extended and Very Extended arrays, and NOEMA baselines from its A and C configurations, and present continuum images with resolution ${\lesssim}0.8''$, which constitute the first sub-arcsecond resolution maps of IRAS 23077+6707. The images show extended linear emission that spans $5.6{-}6.1''$ as expected for a radially extended, highly-inclined protoplanetary disk. Accompanied with lower resolution data, we show that the disk has a steep spectral index, ranging from $\alpha=3.2{-}3.9$. We present evidence of multiple radial emission peaks and troughs in emission, which may originate in disk rings and a central cavity. We further present evidence that these radial structures are asymmetric; hosting a a significant brightness asymmetry, with emission enhanced by up to 50% in the north versus the south. We discuss hypotheses about the potential origins of these features, including the possibility that IRAS 23077+6707 hosts a rare example of an eccentric protoplanetary disk, which can induce these radially asymmetric structures. We present a simple eccentric continuum model of IRAS 23077+6707, and show for an eccentricity of $e \approx 0.26$, that this can reproduce the bulk morphology of the emission.</description>

      <title>Diversity of rocky planet atmospheres in the C-H-O-N-S-Cl system with interior dissolution, non-ideality, and condensation: Application to TRAPPIST-1e and sub-Neptunes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantitative understanding of the nature and composition of low-mass rocky exo(planet) atmospheres during their evolution is needed to interpret observations. The magma ocean stage of terrestrial- and sub-Neptune planets permits mass exchange between their interiors and atmospheres, during which the mass and speciation of the atmosphere is dictated by the planet's volatile budget, chemical equilibria, and gas/fluid solubility in molten rock. As the atmosphere cools, it is modified by gas-phase reactions and condensation. We combine these processes into an open-source Python package built using JAX called Atmodeller, and perform calculations for planet sizes and conditions analogous to TRAPPIST-1e and K2-18b. For TRAPPIST-1e-like planets, our simulations indicate that CO-dominated atmospheres are prevalent during the magma ocean stage, which, upon isochemical cooling, predominantly evolve into CO2-rich atmospheres of a few hundred bar at 280 K. Around 40% of our simulations predict the coexistence of liquid water, graphite, sulfur, and ammonium chloride-key ingredients for surface habitability. For sub-Neptune gas dwarfs, pressures are sufficiently high (few GPa) to deviate the fugacities of gases from ideality, thereby drastically enhancing their solubilities. This buffers the total atmospheric pressure to lower values than for the ideal case. These effects conspire to produce CH4-rich sub-Neptune atmospheres for total pressures exceeding around 3.5 GPa, provided H/C is approximately 100x solar and fO2 moderately reducing (3 log10 units below the iron-w\"ustite buffer). Otherwise, molecular hydrogen remains the predominant species at lower total pressures and/or higher H/C. For all planets at high temperature, solubility enriches C/H in the atmosphere relative to the initial composition.</description>

      <title>Asteroids fail to retain cometary impact signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A bombardment of comets is thought to have occurred in the inner solar system as a result of a dynamical instability among the giant planets after gas disk dispersal. Vesta, the second largest asteroid in the main asteroid belt, likely differentiated before gas disk dispersal, implying its crust witnessed the cometary bombardment. The composition of HED meteorites, which represent fragments of Vesta's crust, could therefore have been altered by cometary impacts. Here we combine noble gas mass spectrometry measurements, N-body simulations, collision rate calculations, and impact simulations to estimate the cometary contribution to Vesta. While our dynamical simulations indicate that Vesta likely underwent a significant number of collisions with large comets, we find no xenon cometary signature in HED meteorites. This apparent contradiction arises due to the fact that cometary impacts were at high speeds and Vesta's weak gravitational attraction made it incapable of retaining cometary material. Smaller asteroids are even less likely to retain such material. Therefore, if a cometary xenon signature is ever detected in an asteroid belt object, it must have been acquired during formation, within the same source region as comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and have been implanted later into the asteroid belt.</description>

      <title>Sub-Neptunes Are Drier Than They Seem: Rethinking the Origins of Water-Rich Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent claims of biosignature gases in sub-Neptune atmospheres have renewed interest in water-rich sub-Neptunes with surface oceans, often referred to as Hycean planets. These planets are hypothesized to form beyond the snow line, accreting large amounts of H$_2$O &gt;10 wt%) before migrating inward. However, current interior models often neglect chemical equilibration between primordial atmospheres and molten interiors. Here, we compute global chemical equilibrium states for a synthetic population of sub-Neptunes with magma oceans. Although many initially accrete 5-30 wt% water, interior-atmosphere interactions destroy most of it, reducing final H$_2$O mass fractions to below 1.5 wt%. As a result, none meet the threshold for Hycean planets. Despite that, we find H$_2$O-dominated atmospheres exclusively on planets that accreted the least ice. These planets form inside the snow line, are depleted in carbon and hydrogen, and develop small envelopes with envelope mass fractions below 1%, dominated by endogenic water. In contrast, planets formed beyond the snow line accrete more volatiles, but their water is largely converted to H$_2$ gas or sequestered into the interior, resulting in low atmospheric H$_2$O mass fractions. Most H$_2$O-rich envelopes are also fully miscible with H$_2$, making a separate water layer unlikely. Our results topple the conventional link between ice accretion and water-rich atmospheres, showing instead that H$_2$O-dominated envelopes emerge through chemical equilibration in hydrogen-poor planets formed inside the snow line.</description>

      <title>Close-in planet induces flares on its host star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decade, hundreds of exoplanets have been discovered in extremely short orbits below 10 days. Unlike in the Solar System, planets in these systems orbit their host stars close enough to disturb the stellar magnetic field lines. The interaction can enhance the star's magnetic activity, such as its chromospheric and radio emission, or flaring. So far, the search for magnetic star-planet interactions has remained inconclusive. Here, we report the first detection of planet-induced flares on HIP 67522, a 17 million-year-old G dwarf star with two known close-in planets. Combining space-borne photometry from TESS and dedicated CHEOPS observations over a span of 5 years, we find that the 15 flares in HIP 67522 cluster near the innermost planet's transit phase, indicating persistent magnetic star-planet interaction in the system. The stability of interaction implies that the innermost planet is continuously self-inflicting a six time higher flare rate than it would experience without interaction. The subsequent flux of energetic radiation and particles bombarding HIP 67522 b may explain the planet's remarkably extended atmosphere, recently detected with the James Webb Space Telescope. HIP 67522 is therefore an archetype to understand the impact of magnetic star-planet interaction on the atmospheres of nascent exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Searching for planet-induced radio signal from the young close-in planet host star HIP 67522</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HIP 67522 is a 17 Myr old 1.2$M_\odot$ dwarf, and the only such young star known to host two close-in gas giant planets. The inner planet likely orbits close enough to its host to power magnetic star-planet interactions. In the radio domain, magnetic star-planet interaction is expected to produce a unique signature: electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME), beamed in phase with the orbit of the close-in planet.
  We conducted the longest radio monitoring campaign of a G dwarf host star to date to search for ECME, totaling $135\,$h on HIP 67522 over a period of five months with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) between $1.1-3.1$GHz.
  We find that HIP 67522 is active in the radio, with emission that varies stochastically, with a duty cycle of $69\%$ above $0.24$mJy, and frequent bursts. Both the bursts and the quiescent emission are consistent with the canonical G\"udel-Benz relation, and show a positive spectral index and brightness temperatures $\geq 10^{10}$K, indicating likely a flaring origin. Our observations cover $61\%$ of the innermost planet's orbit, including multiple visits of the quadrature where planet-induced ECME detection is most likely for this system. However, no orbital modulation or persistent polarization of the radio emission was detected. Our upper limit on circularly polarized emission from HIP 67522 suggests a $&lt;0.7\%$ conversion efficiency of the magnetic power generated in the star-planet interaction into radio waves, unless the emission was missed by our phase or frequency coverage, or was absorbed in the circumstellar plasma. HIP 67522 is a system with one of the highest expected powers of star-planet interaction among known systems and shows strong indication of planet-induced flaring, motivating observations at other wavelengths to probe for further dissipation pathways.</description>

      <title>Extreme Forward Scattering Observed in Disk-Averaged Near-Infrared Phase Curves of Titan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Titan, with its thick and hazy atmosphere, is a key world in our solar system for understanding light scattering processes. NASA's Cassini mission monitored Titan between 2004 and 2017, where the derived dataset includes a large number of whole disk observations. Once spatially integrated, these whole disk observations reveal Titan's phase-dependent brightness which can serve as an analog for how hazy worlds might appear around other stars. To explore Titan's phase curve, we present a pipeline for whole disk Titan observations acquired by the Cassini Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) spanning 0.9--5.1 $\mu$m. Application of the pipeline finds over 4,400 quality spatially- and spectrally-resolved datacubes that were then integrated over Titan's disk to yield phase curves spanning 2--165\degree{} in phase angle. Spectra at near-full phase provide a useful approximation for Titan's geometric albedo, thus extending the spectral coverage of previous work. Crescent phase brightness enhancements in the Cassini VIMS phase curves are often more extreme than analogous results seen at optical wavelengths, which can be explained by atmospheric transparency and haze scattering processes. These results provide validation opportunities for exoplanet-focused spectral models and also shed light on how extreme aerosol forward scattering could influence exoplanet observations and interpretations.</description>

      <title>A first look at rocky exoplanets with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rocky exoplanet characterization has been a top priority for early James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) science operations. Several milestones have been achieved, including the most precise rocky planet transmission spectra measured to date, and the first detection of thermal emission for rocky worlds below 800 Kelvin. Despite these advances, no atmospheres have been definitively detected. Several transmission spectra show tentative evidence for molecular absorption features, but these hints are marginally significant and the spectra may be affected by stellar contamination. Features from many plausible atmospheres, including those dominated by oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide, are below the current noise level. Meanwhile, the emerging picture from thermal emission spectra is that the planets have hot daysides, consistent with either a bare rock composition or low surface pressure atmospheres (&lt; 10 bar). Higher surface pressures and high carbon dioxide abundances are generally ruled out, assuming cloud-free atmosphere models. The absence of strong CO$_2$ features hints at a limited initial volatile inventory or rapid atmospheric escape during the planets' early lifetimes. Taken together, these results motivate a push towards higher precision data, as well as observations of cooler planets that may be more likely to retain atmospheres. As a goal for future transmission spectroscopy, we suggest a "five scale height challenge," to achieve the precision necessary to detect CO$_2$ features in nitrogen-rich atmospheres. Detecting rocky planet atmospheres remains challenging, but with JWST's excellent performance and a continuing investment of telescope time, we are optimistic these uncharted atmospheres will be detected in coming years.</description>

      <title>Differentiation, the exception not the rule -- Evidence for full miscibility in sub-Neptune interiors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the consequences of non-ideal mixing between silicate, iron metal, and hydrogen for the structures of the cores of sub-Neptunes with implications for super-Earths, warm Neptunes, and ice giants. A method of extrapolating what we know about the miscibility in the three bounding binary systems MgSiO$_3$-H$_2$, MgSiO$_3$-Fe, and Fe-H$_2$ to the ternary composition space is used to deduce the phase equilibria of this system at relevant temperature and pressure conditions. We find that while separate silicate and metal phases can exist at shallow depths, the phases become entirely miscible deeper in the cores, thus altering the density structure of the cores. The assumption that the interiors of large rocky planets, either with extant magma oceans beneath H$_2$-rich envelopes, or evolved from such bodies, are composed of a differentiated metal core overlain by a silicate mantle is inconsistent with our understanding of the phase equilibria of these bodies.</description>

      <title>Challenge-Based Funding to Spark Origins Breakthroughs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Origins of life research is marred by ambiguous questions and goals, creating uncertainty about when research objectives have been achieved. Because of numerous unknowns and disagreements about definitions and theories, the field lacks clear markers of progress. We argue that the origins community should focus on goals that have agreed-upon meaning and can be consensually categorized as achieved or unachieved. The origins community needs these goals to maintain coherence amongst a federation of problems with the shared, but nebulous aspiration of understanding the origins of life. We propose a list of challenges with clear 'Finish Lines'--explicit descriptions of what will be achieved if each goal is reached--similar to the X-prize model. The intent is not to impose top-down research directions, but to compel the community to coalesce around explicit problems of the highest priority, as physics, astronomy, and planetary science communities do when setting science objectives for missions and megaprojects. Even if the generated phenomena are not unequivocally life-like, demonstrating systems that achieve these goals will sharpen the distinction between life itself and the constellation of phenomena that co-occur with life.

Abstract: The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) aims to telescopically constrain the frequency and abundance of biospheres in the solar neighborhood. Origin-of-life theories vary in their predictions for the environmental requirements and the expected frequency of abiogenesis, meaning that constraints on the frequency and distribution of life on exoplanets from HWO can in principle directly test theories of abiogenesis. We categorize origin-of-life theories into three broad classes and discuss how HWO could potentially test them. Nondetection of biology on a large sample of habitable planets would provide prior-independent evidence in favor of the class of abiogenesis theory which holds that the origin of life is a contingent, vanishingly unlikely event, whereas detection of event a single biosphere would falsify this class of theories. Correlations of candidate biospheres with planetary parameters such as UV irradiation, the presence of oceans, and the presence of continents can test specific origin-of-life theories. Simulated surveys with Bayesian analysis are required to quantify the ability of HWO to execute this science case. However, a clear theme from the limited such studies that have already been conducted is the need for large sample sizes ($\gtrsim50$ planets characterized) to provide meaningful constraints on abiogenesis theories, favoring a larger design sample for HWO.</description>

      <title>Prebiosignatures with the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO)</title>

Abstract: The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) aims to characterize habitable exoplanets in search of signs of life. However, detectable life may be rare, either because abiogenesis is intrinsically contingent and unlikely, or because biospheres may efficiently recycle their products. Here, we explore the potential of HWO to test theories of life in the universe even if detectable life is rare by searching for "prebiosignature gases". Prebiosignatures gases are gases whose detection constrains theories of the evolution of prebiotic (habitable but uninhabited) planets, thereby testing theories of abiogenesis and guiding laboratory investigations of the origin of life. We catalog 5 theories of prebiotic environments that are potentially testable by HWO, identify their observational tests, and rank them by perceived detection plausibility. The prebiosignature paradigm is novel and potentially compelling, but considerable work is required to mature it and assess its practical relevance for HWO, especially simulated spectral observation and retrieval studies. However, consideration of the absorption properties of prebiosignature observables alone reveals that coverage at NUV wavelengths (200-400 nm) will be required to effectively realize a prebiosignature science case for HWO, supporting the argument for UV capabilities for HWO.</description>

      <title>Preliminary analysis of the annual component of the polar motion over 180-year data interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents preliminary results of studying variations in the annual component in the Earth's polar motion. For this purpose, a signal with an annual period was extracted, firstly, from the series of pole coordinates of the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), and secondly, from the combined series of Pulkovo latitude variations for 1840--2017. For this purpose, one-dimensional and multidimensional singular spectrum analysis was used. The Hilbert transform was used to calculate the change in the amplitude and phase of the annual oscillation over time. As a result, it turned out that over an interval of about 180 years, an almost monotonic increase in the amplitude of the annual oscillation from $\approx$60~mas to $\approx$90~mas and an almost monotonic phase shift of $\approx$45$^\circ$ are observed. A correlation was also found between the amplitude of the annual component and the difference in average temperatures from November to March in the northern and southern hemispheres.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the Cherenkov Photon Background for Low-Noise Silicon Detectors in Space</title>

Abstract: Future space observatories that seek to perform imaging and spectroscopy of faint astronomical sources will require ultra-low-noise detectors that are sensitive over a broad wavelength range. Silicon charge-coupled devices (CCDs), such as EMCCDs, skipper CCDs, multi-amplifier sensing (MAS) CCDs, and single-electron sensitive read out (SiSeRO) CCDs have demonstrated the ability to detect and measure single photons from X-ray energies to near the silicon band gap (~1.1 $\mu$m), making them candidate technologies for this application. In this context, we study a relatively unexplored source of low-energy background coming from Cherenkov radiation produced by energetic cosmic rays traversing a silicon detector. We present a model for Cherenkov photon production and absorption that is calibrated to laboratory data, and we use this model to characterize the residual background rate for ultra-low-noise silicon detectors in space. We study how the Cherenkov background rate depends on detector thickness, variations in solar activity, and the contribution of heavy cosmic ray species (Z &gt; 2). We find that for thick silicon detectors, such as those required to achieve high quantum efficiency at long wavelengths, the rate of cosmic-ray-induced Cherenkov photon production is comparable to other detector and astrophysical backgrounds. We apply our Cherenkov background model to simulated spectroscopic observations of extra-solar planets, and we find that thick detectors continue to outperform their thinner counterparts at longer wavelengths despite a larger Cherenkov background rate. Furthermore, we find that minimal masking of cosmic-ray tracks continues to maximize the signal-to-noise of very faint sources despite the existence of extended halos of Cherenkov photons.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric model-trained machine learning selection and classification of ultracool TY dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The T and Y spectral classes represent the coolest and lowest-mass population of brown dwarfs, yet their census remains incomplete due to limited statistics. Existing detection frameworks are often constrained to identifying M, L, and early T dwarfs, owing to the sparse observational sample of ultracool dwarfs (UCDs) at later types. This paper presents a novel machine learning framework capable of detecting and classifying late-T and Y dwarfs, trained entirely on synthetic photometry from atmospheric models. Utilizing grids from the ATMO 2020 and Sonora Bobcat models, I produce a training dataset over two orders of magnitude larger than any empirical set of &gt;T6 UCDs. Polynomial color relations fitted to the model photometry are used to assign spectral types to these synthetic models, which in turn train an ensemble of classifiers to identify and classify the spectral type of late UCDs. The model is highly performant when validating on both synthetic and empirical datasets, verifying catalogs of known UCDs with object classification metrics &gt;99% and an average spectral type precision within 0.35 +/- 0.37 subtypes. Application of the model to a 1.5 degree region around Pisces and the UKIDSS UDS field results in the discovery of one previously uncatalogued T8.2 candidate, demonstrating the ability of this model-trained approach in discovering faint, late-type UCDs from photometric catalogs.</description>

      <title>Planetesimal Scattering Efficiency of Cold Giant Planet Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of many exoplanets has revealed an incredible diversity of orbital architectures. These orbital configurations are intrinsically linked to the potential for habitable environments within the system, since the gravitational influence of the planets governs the angular momentum distribution within the system. This angular momentum distribution, in turn, alters the planetary orbits and rotational obliquities. In the case of giant planets, their gravitational influence can also produce significant redistribution of volatiles, particularly those that lie beyond the snow line. Here, we present the results of dynamical simulations that investigate the role of cold giant planets in scattering material to inner terrestrial planets. We highlight 10 exoplanetary systems with 2 or more known giant planets beyond the snow line, and adopt a solar system analog template that investigates the scattering of material within the range 3-8~AU. We show that increasing the eccentricity of a Jupiter analog from its present, near-circular, value to a moderate range (0.2-0.3) results in an order of magnitude increase in scattered material to the inner part of the system. The inclusion of a Saturn analog to the dynamical model produces a similar increase, highlighting the importance of multiple giant planets beyond the snow line. However, the addition of analogs to Uranus and Neptune can have a minor negative effect on scattering efficiency through the transfer of angular momentum from the inner giant planets.</description>
