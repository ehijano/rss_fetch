      <title>Recursive decoding of binary rank Reed-Muller codes and Plotkin construction for matrix codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2021, Augot, Couvreur, Lavauzelle and Neri introduced a new class of rank metric codes which can be regarded as rank metric counterparts of Reed-Muller codes. Given a finite Galois extension $\mathbb{L} / \mathbb{K}$, these codes are defined as some specific $\mathbb{L}$-subspaces of the twisted group algebra $\mathbb{L} [\textrm{G}]$. We investigate the decoding of such codes in the "binary" case, \emph{i.e.,} when $\textrm{G} = (\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^m$. Our approach takes its inspiration from the decoding of Hamming metric binary Reed-Muller codes using their recursive Plotkin "$(u ~|~ u+v)$" structure. If our recursive algorithm restricts to a specific subclass of rank metric Reed-Muller codes, its asymptotic complexity beats that of the recently proposed decoding algorithm for arbitrary rank metric Reed-Muller codes based on Dickson matrices. Also, this decoder is of completely different nature and leads a natural rank metric counterpart of the Plotkin construction. To illustrate this, we also propose a generic Plotkin-like construction for matrix rank metric codes with an associate decoder, which can be applied to any pair of codes equipped with an efficient decoder.</description>

      <title>Weighted Sum Rate Optimization for Movable Antenna Enabled Near-Field ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been recognized as one of the key technologies capable of simultaneously improving communication and sensing services in future wireless networks. Moreover, the introduction of recently developed movable antennas (MAs) has the potential to further increase the performance gains of ISAC systems. Achieving these gains can pose a significant challenge for MA-enabled ISAC systems operating in the near-field due to the corresponding spherical wave propagation. Motivated by this, in this paper we maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) for communication users while maintaining a minimal sensing requirement in an MA-enabled near-field ISAC system. To achieve this goal, we propose an algorithm that optimizes the sensing receive combiner, the communication precoding matrices, the sensing transmit beamformer and the positions of the users' MAs in an alternating manner. Simulation results show that using MAs in near-field ISAC systems provides a substantial performance advantage compared to near-field ISAC systems with only fixed antennas. Additionally, we demonstrate that the highest WSR is obtained when larger weights are allocated to the users placed closer to the BS, and that the sensing performance is significantly more affected by the minimum sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold compared to the communication performance.</description>

      <title>Category learning in deep neural networks: Information content and geometry of internal representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In animals, category learning enhances discrimination between stimuli close to the category boundary. This phenomenon, called categorical perception, was also empirically observed in artificial neural networks trained on classification tasks. In previous modeling works based on neuroscience data, we show that this expansion/compression is a necessary outcome of efficient learning. Here we extend our theoretical framework to artificial networks. We show that minimizing the Bayes cost (mean of the cross-entropy loss) implies maximizing the mutual information between the set of categories and the neural activities prior to the decision layer. Considering structured data with an underlying feature space of small dimension, we show that maximizing the mutual information implies (i) finding an appropriate projection space, and, (ii) building a neural representation with the appropriate metric. The latter is based on a Fisher information matrix measuring the sensitivity of the neural activity to changes in the projection space. Optimal learning makes this neural Fisher information follow a category-specific Fisher information, measuring the sensitivity of the category membership. Category learning thus induces an expansion of neural space near decision boundaries. We characterize the properties of the categorical Fisher information, showing that its eigenvectors give the most discriminant directions at each point of the projection space. We find that, unexpectedly, its maxima are in general not exactly at, but near, the class boundaries. Considering toy models and the MNIST dataset, we numerically illustrate how after learning the two Fisher information matrices match, and essentially align with the category boundaries. Finally, we relate our approach to the Information Bottleneck one, and we exhibit a bias-variance decomposition of the Bayes cost, of interest on its own.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Conditional Entropy for Diffusion Dynamics on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modeling of diffusion processes on graphs is the basis for many network science and machine learning approaches. Entropic measures of network-based diffusion have recently been employed to investigate the reversibility of these processes and the diversity of the modeled systems. While results about their steady state are well-known, very few exact results about their time evolution exist. Here, we introduce the conditional entropy of heat diffusion in graphs. We demonstrate that this entropic measure satisfies the first and second laws of thermodynamics, thereby providing a physical interpretation of diffusion dynamics on networks. We outline a mathematical framework that contextualizes diffusion and conditional entropy within the theories of continuous-time Markov chains and information theory. Furthermore, we obtain explicit results for its evolution on complete, path, and circulant graphs, as well as a mean-field approximation for Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs. We also obtain asymptotic results for general networks. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate several properties of conditional entropy for diffusion over random graphs, such as the Watts-Strogatz model.</description>

      <title>On the maximum purity of absolutely separable bipartite states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the problem of determining the maximum purity for absolutely separable and absolutely PPT quantum states. From the geometric viewpoint, this problem is equivalent to asking for the exact Euclidean radius of the smallest ball around the maximally mixed state that encompasses the set of all absolutely separable or absolutely PPT states. Our results provide an analytic solution for two qubit states. Based on numerical computation, we propose a conjectured maximum purity for absolutely separable qubit-qudit states and absolutely PPT qutrit-qudit states.</description>

      <title>The maximal hard-core model as a recoverable system: Gibbs measures and phase coexistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recoverable systems provide coarse models of data storage on the two-dimensional square lattice, where each site reconstructs its value from neighboring sites according to a specified local rule. To study the typical behavior of recoverable patterns, this work introduces an interaction potential on the local recovery regions of the lattice, which defines a corresponding interaction model. We establish uniqueness of the Gibbs measure at high temperature and derive bounds on the entropy in the zero- and low-temperature regimes.
  For the recovery rule under consideration, exactly recoverable configurations coincide with maximal independent sets of the grid. Relying on methods developed for the standard hard-core model, we show phase coexistence at high activity in the maximal case. Unlike the standard hard-core model, however, the maximal version admits nontrivial ground states even at low activity, and we manage to classify them explicitly. We further verify the Peierls condition for the associated contour model. Combined with the Pirogov-Sinai theory, this shows that each ground state gives rise to an extremal Gibbs measure, proving phase coexistence at low activity.</description>

      <title>Good quantum codes with addressable and parallelizable non-Clifford gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit a family of good quantum error-correcting codes presented in He $\textit{et al.}$ (2025), and we show that various sets of addressable and transversal non-Clifford multi-control-$Z$ gates can be performed in parallel. The construction relies on the good classical codes of Stichtenoth (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2006), which were previously instantiated in He $\textit{et al.}$ (2025), to yield quantum CSS codes over which addressable logical $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gates can be performed at least one at a time. Here, we show that for any $m$, there exists a family of good quantum error-correcting codes over qudits for which logical $\mathsf{C}^{m}\mathsf{Z}$ gates can address specific logical qudits and be performed in parallel. This leads to a significant advantage in the depth overhead of multi-control-$Z$ circuits.</description>

      <title>On Scaling LT-Coded Blockchains in Heterogeneous Networks and their Vulnerabilities to DoS Threats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05620v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coded blockchains have acquired prominence as a promising solution to reduce storage costs and facilitate scalability. Within this class, Luby Transform (LT) coded blockchains are an appealing choice for scalability owing to the availability of a wide range of low-complexity decoders. In the first part of this work, we identify that traditional LT decoders like Belief Propagation and On-the-Fly Gaussian Elimination may not be optimal for heterogeneous networks with nodes that have varying computational and download capabilities. To address this, we introduce a family of hybrid decoders for LT codes and propose optimal operating regimes for them to recover the blockchain at the lowest decoding cost. While LT coded blockchain architecture has been studied from the aspects of storage savings and scalability, not much is known in terms of its security vulnerabilities. Pointing at this research gap, in the second part, we present novel denial-of-service threats on LT coded blockchains that target nodes with specific decoding capabilities, preventing them from joining the network. Our proposed threats are non-oblivious in nature, wherein adversaries gain access to the archived blocks, and choose to execute their attack on a subset of them based on underlying coding scheme. We show that our optimized threats can achieve the same level of damage as that of blind attacks, however, with limited amount of resources. Overall, this is the first work of its kind that opens up new questions on designing coded blockchains to jointly provide storage savings, scalability and also resilience to optimized threats.</description>

      <title>Maximally Extendable Product Codes are Good Coboundary Expanders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the coboundary expansion property of tensor product codes, known as product expansion, which plays an important role in recent constructions of good quantum LDPC codes and classical locally testable codes. Prior research has shown that this property is equivalent to agreement testability and robust testability for products of two codes with linear distance. However, for products of more than two codes, product expansion is a strictly stronger property. In this paper, we prove that a collection of an arbitrary number of random codes over a sufficiently large field has good product expansion. We believe that, in the case of four codes, the same ideas can be used to construct good quantum locally testable codes, in a way similar to the current constructions that use only products of two codes.</description>

      <title>Criss-Cross Deletion Correcting Codes: Optimal Constructions with Efficient Decoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses fundamental challenges in two-dimensional error correction by constructing optimal codes for \emph{criss-cross deletions}. We consider an $ n \times n $ array $\boldsymbol{X}$ over a $ q $-ary alphabet $\Sigma_q := \{0, 1, \ldots, q-1\}$ that is subject to a \emph{$(t_r, t_c)$-criss-cross deletion}, which involves the simultaneous removal of $ t_r $ rows and $ t_c $ columns. A code $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \Sigma_q^{n \times n}$ is defined as a \emph{$(t_r,t_c)$-criss-cross deletion correcting code} if it can successfully correct these deletions.
  We derive a sphere-packing type lower bound and a Gilbert-Varshamov type upper bound on the redundancy of optimal codes. Our results indicate that the optimal redundancy for a $(t_r, t_c)$-criss-cross deletion correcting code lies between $(t_r + t_c)n\log q + (t_r + t_c)\log n + O_{q,t_r,t_c}(1)$ and $(t_r + t_c)n\log q + 2(t_r + t_c)\log n + O_{q,t_r,t_c}(1)$, where the logarithm is on base two, and $O_{q,t_r,t_c}(1)$ is a constant that depends solely on $q$, $t_r$, and $t_c$. For the case of $(1,1)$-criss-cross deletions, we propose two families of constructions that achieve $2n\log q + 2\log n + O_q(1)$ bits of redundancy. This redundancy is optimal up to an additive constant term $O_q(1)$, which depends solely on $q$. One family is designed for non-binary alphabets, while the other addresses arbitrary alphabets. For the case of $(t_r, t_c)$-criss-cross deletions, we provide a strategy to derive optimal codes when both unidirectional deletions occur consecutively. We propose decoding algorithms with a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ for our codes, which are optimal for two-dimensional scenarios.</description>

      <title>Optimal and Suboptimal Decoders under Finite-Alphabet Interference: A Mismatched Decoding Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interference widely exists in communication systems and is often not optimally treated at the receivers due to limited knowledge and/or computational burden. Evolutions of receivers have been proposed to balance complexity and spectral efficiency, for example, for 6G, while commonly used performance metrics, such as capacity and mutual information (MI), fail to capture the suboptimal treatment of interference, leading to potentially inaccurate performance evaluations. Mismatched decoding is an information-theoretic tool for analyzing communications with suboptimal decoders. In this work, we use mismatched decoding to analyze communications with decoders that treat interference suboptimally, aiming at more accurate performance metrics. Specifically, we consider a finite-alphabet input Gaussian channel under interference, representative of modern systems, where the decoder can be matched (optimal) or mismatched (suboptimal) to the channel. The matched capacity is derived using MI, while a lower bound on the mismatched capacity under various decoding metrics is derived using generalized mutual information (GMI). We show that the decoding metric in the proposed channel model is closely related to the behavior of the demodulator in bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) systems. Simulations illustrate that GMI/MI accurately predicts the throughput of BICM-type systems {with various demodulators}. Finally, we extend the channel model and the GMI to multiple antenna cases, with an example of multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) precoder optimization problem considering GMI under different decoding strategies. In short, this work discovers new insights about the impact of interference, proposes novel receivers, and introduces a new design and performance evaluation framework that more accurately captures the effect of interference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thanks to the application of metamaterials, holographic multiple-input multiple-output (H-MIMO) is expected to achieve a higher spatial diversity gain with lower hardware complexity. With the aid of a circular antenna arrangement of H-MIMO, integrated data and energy multicast (IDEM) can fully exploit the near-field channel to realize wider range of energy focusing and higher achievable rate. In this paper, we derive the closed-form near-field resolution function in 3D space and show the asymptotic spatial orthogonality of near-field channel for circular antenna array. We then investigate the beamforming designs for IDEM systems, where the minimum rate of data users (DUs) are maximized while guaranteeing the energy harvesting requirements for energy users (EUs). Specifically, the asymptotically optimal fully-digital beamformer is first obtained based on the spatial orthogonality. Then, the alternating optimization is adopted for the H-MIMO beamforming, where the digital beamformer is obtained in closed form and the analog beamformers of three different control modes are then obtained, respectively. Scaling schemes are also investigated to further improve the IDEM performance. Numerical results verify the correctness of the resolution function and asymptotic orthogonality. Moreover, the proposed beamforming schemes with very low complexity outperform benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Decentralized Secure Aggregation with Collusion Resilience</title>

Abstract: In decentralized federated learning (FL), multiple clients collaboratively learn a shared machine learning (ML) model by leveraging their privately held datasets distributed across the network, through interactive exchange of the intermediate model updates. To ensure data security, cryptographic techniques are commonly employed to protect model updates during aggregation. Despite growing interest in secure aggregation, existing works predominantly focus on protocol design and computational guarantees, with limited understanding of the fundamental information-theoretic limits of such systems. Moreover, optimal bounds on communication and key usage remain unknown in decentralized settings, where no central aggregator is available. Motivated by these gaps, we study the problem of decentralized secure aggregation (DSA) from an information-theoretic perspective. Specifically, we consider a network of $K$ fully-connected users, each holding a private input -- an abstraction of local training data -- who aim to securely compute the sum of all inputs. The security constraint requires that no user learns anything beyond the input sum, even when colluding with up to $T$ other users. We characterize the optimal rate region, which specifies the minimum achievable communication and secret key rates for DSA. In particular, we show that to securely compute one symbol of the desired input sum, each user must (i) transmit at least one symbol to others, (ii) hold at least one symbol of secret key, and (iii) all users must collectively hold no fewer than $K - 1$ independent key symbols. Our results establish the fundamental performance limits of DSA, providing insights for the design of provably secure and communication-efficient protocols in distributed learning systems.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Antenna-Enhanced Beamforming: Signal Enhancement and Interference Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional beamforming with fixed-orientation antenna (FOA) arrays may struggle to effectively enhance signal and/or suppress interference due to significant variations in antenna directive gains over different steering angles. To break this limitation, we investigate in this paper the rotatable antenna (RA)-enhanced single/multi-beam forming by exploiting the new spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) via antennas' rotation optimization. Specifically, the antenna rotation angle vector (ARAV) and antenna weight vector (AWV) are jointly optimized to maximize the minimum array gain over signal directions, subject to a given constraint on the maximum array gain over interference directions. For the special case of single-beam forming without interference, the optimal ARAV is derived in closed-form with the maximum ratio combining (MRC) beamformer applied to the AWV. For the general case of multi-beam forming, we propose an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to find a high-quality suboptimal solution by iteratively optimizing one of the ARAV and AWV with the other being fixed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RA-based scheme can significantly outperform the traditional FOA-based and isotropic antenna (IA)-based schemes in terms of array gain.</description>

      <title>The Whole Is Less than the Sum of Parts: Subsystem Inconsistency in Partial Information Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partial Information Decomposition (PID) was proposed by Williams and Beer in 2010 as a tool for analyzing fine-grained interactions between multiple random variables, and has since found numerous applications ranging from neuroscience to privacy. However, a unified theoretical framework remains elusive due to key conceptual and technical challenges. We identify and illustrate a crucial problem: PID violates the set-theoretic principle that the whole equals the sum of its parts (WESP). Through a counterexample in a three-variable system, we demonstrate how such violations naturally arise, revealing a fundamental limitation of current lattice-based PID frameworks. To address this issue, we introduce a new axiomatic framework, termed System Information Decomposition (SID), specifically tailored for three-variable systems. SID resolves the WESP violation by redefining the summation rules of decomposed information atoms based on synergistic relationships. However, we further show that for systems with four or more variables, no partial summation approach within the existing lattice-based structures can fully eliminate WESP inconsistencies. Our results thus highlight the inherent inadequacy of (antichain) lattice-based decompositions for general multivariate systems.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Information in Interactive Decision Making: A Case Study for Multi-Armed Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of information in interactive decision making through the lens of a stochastic multi-armed bandit problem. Focusing on a fundamental example where a unique optimal arm outperforms the rest by a fixed margin, we characterize the optimal success probability and mutual information over time. Our findings reveal distinct growth phases in mutual information -- initially linear, transitioning to quadratic, and finally returning to linear -- highlighting curious behavioral differences between interactive and non-interactive environments. In particular, we show that optimal success probability and mutual information can be decoupled, where achieving optimal learning does not necessarily require maximizing information gain. These findings shed new light on the intricate interplay between information and learning in interactive decision making.</description>

      <title>Memorization-Compression Cycles Improve Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove theoretically that generalization improves not only through data scaling but also by compressing internal representations. To operationalize this insight, we introduce the Information Bottleneck Language Modeling (IBLM) objective, which reframes language modeling as a constrained optimization problem: minimizing representation entropy subject to optimal prediction performance. Empirically, we observe an emergent memorization-compression cycle during LLM pretraining, evidenced by oscillation positive/negative gradient alignment between cross-entropy and Matrix-Based Entropy (MBE), a measure of representation entropy. This pattern closely mirrors the predictive-compressive trade-off prescribed by IBLM and also parallels the biological alternation between awake learning and sleep consolidation. Motivated by this observation, we propose Gated Phase Transition (GAPT), a training algorithm that adaptively switches between memorization and compression phases. When applied to GPT-2 pretraining on FineWeb dataset, GAPT reduces MBE by 50% and improves cross-entropy by 4.8%. GAPT improves OOD generalizatino by 35% in a pretraining task on arithmetic multiplication. In a setting designed to simulate catastrophic forgetting, GAPT reduces interference by compressing and separating representations, achieving a 97% improvement in separation - paralleling the functional role of sleep consolidation.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Task Foundation Model for Wireless Channel Representation Using Contrastive and Masked Autoencoder Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current applications of self-supervised learning to wireless channel representation often borrow paradigms developed for text and image processing, without fully addressing the unique characteristics and constraints of wireless communications. To bridge this gap, we introduce ContraWiMAE, Wireless Contrastive Masked Autoencoder, a transformer-based foundation model that unifies masked reconstruction and masked contrastive learning for wireless channel representation. Our key innovation is a new wireless-inspired contrastive objective that exploits the inherent characteristics of wireless environment, including noise, fading, and partial observability, as natural augmentation. Through extensive evaluation on unseen scenarios and conditions, we demonstrate our method's effectiveness in multiple downstream tasks, including cross-frequency beam selection, line-of-sight detection, and channel estimation. ContraWiMAE exhibits superior linear separability and adaptability in diverse wireless environments, demonstrating exceptional data efficiency and competitive performance compared with supervised baselines under challenging conditions. Comparative evaluations against a state-of-the-art wireless channel foundation model confirm the superior performance and data efficiency of our approach, highlighting its potential as a powerful baseline for future research in self-supervised wireless channel representation learning. To foster further work in this direction, we release the model weights and training pipeline for ContraWiMAE.</description>

      <title>Representation of Symmetric Shift Registers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The objective of this work is to establish a mathematical framework for the study of symmetric shift registers over the field GF(2). The present paper gives a new approach where the symmetric shift registers are represented by associated systems of nonlinear difference equations. Arithmetical progressions will play a central part. This approach clarifies the underlying structures and makes it easier to determine the minimal periods of the sequences generated by the symmetric shift registers. Key words: Shift registers, nonlinear difference equations, periods, arithmetical progressions, GF(2).</description>

      <title>Hierarchical filtrations of line bundles and optimal algebraic geometry codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01859v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce \emph{hierarchical depth}, a new invariant of line bundles and divisors, defined via maximal chains of effective sub-line bundles. This notion gives rise to \emph{hierarchical filtrations}, refining the structure of the Picard group and providing new insights into the geometry of algebraic surfaces. We establish fundamental properties of hierarchical depth, derive inequalities through intersection theory and the Hodge index theorem, and characterize filtrations that are Hodge-tight.
  Using this framework, we develop a theory of \emph{hierarchical algebraic geometry codes}, constructed from evaluation spaces along these filtrations. This approach produces nested families of codes with controlled growth of parameters and identifies an optimal intermediate code maximizing a utility function balancing rate and minimum distance. Hierarchical depth thus provides a systematic method to construct AG codes with favorable asymptotic behavior, linking geometric and coding-theoretic perspectives.
  Our results establish new connections between line bundle theory, surface geometry, and coding theory, and suggest applications to generalized Goppa codes and higher-dimensional evaluation codes.</description>

      <title>On the Walsh spectra of quadratic APN functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: APN functions play a central role as building blocks in the design of many block ciphers, serving as optimal functions to resist differential attacks. One of the most important properties of APN functions is their linearity, which is directly related to the Walsh spectrum of the function. In this paper, we establish two novel connections that allow us to derive strong conditions on the Walsh spectra of quadratic APN functions. We prove that the Walsh transform of a quadratic APN function $F$ operating on $n=2k$ bits is uniquely associated with a vector space partition of $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ and a specific blocking set in the corresponding projective space $PG(n-1,2)$. These connections allow us to prove a variety of results on the Walsh spectrum of $F$. We prove for instance that $F$ can have at most one component function of amplitude larger than $2^{3n/4}$. We also find the first nontrivial upper bound on the number of bent component functions of a quadratic APN function, and provide conditions for a function to be CCZ-equivalent to a permutation based on its number of bent components.</description>

      <title>Resilient Full-Duplex ISAC in the Face of Imperfect SI Cancellation: Globally Optimal Timeslot Allocation and Beam Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the radio resource management (RRM) design in downlink full-duplex integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, jointly optimizing timeslot allocation and beam selection under imperfect self-interference cancellation. Timeslot allocation governs the distribution of discrete channel uses between sensing and communication tasks, while beam selection determines transmit and receive directions along with adaptive beamwidths. The joint design leads to a semi-infinite, nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is difficult to solve. To overcome this, we develop a tailored reformulation strategy that transforms the problem into a tractable mixed-integer linear program (MILP), enabling globally optimal solutions. Our approach provides insights into the coordinated optimization of timeslot allocation and beam selection, enhancing the efficiency of full-duplex ISAC systems while ensuring resilience against residual self-interference.</description>
