      <title>AdaNovo: Adaptive \emph{De Novo} Peptide Sequencing with Conditional Mutual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tandem mass spectrometry has played a pivotal role in advancing proteomics, enabling the analysis of protein composition in biological samples. Despite the development of various deep learning methods for identifying amino acid sequences (peptides) responsible for observed spectra, challenges persist in \emph{de novo} peptide sequencing. Firstly, prior methods struggle to identify amino acids with post-translational modifications (PTMs) due to their lower frequency in training data compared to canonical amino acids, further resulting in decreased peptide-level identification precision. Secondly, diverse types of noise and missing peaks in mass spectra reduce the reliability of training data (peptide-spectrum matches, PSMs). To address these challenges, we propose AdaNovo, a novel framework that calculates conditional mutual information (CMI) between the spectrum and each amino acid/peptide, using CMI for adaptive model training. Extensive experiments demonstrate AdaNovo's state-of-the-art performance on a 9-species benchmark, where the peptides in the training set are almost completely disjoint from the peptides of the test sets. Moreover, AdaNovo excels in identifying amino acids with PTMs and exhibits robustness against data noise. The supplementary materials contain the official code.</description>

      <title>Optical detection of bacterial cells on stainless-steel surface with a low-magnification light microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Rapid and cost-effective method for detecting bacterial cells on surfaces is critical to protect public health from various aspects, including food safety, clinical hygiene, and pharmacy quality. Herein, we first established an optical detection method based on a gold chip coating with 3-mercaptophenylboronic acid (3-MPBA) to capture bacterial cells, which allows for the detection and quantification of bacterial cells with a standard light microscope under low-magnification (10 fold) objective lens. Then, integrating the developed optical detection method with swab sampling to achieve to detect bacterial cells loading on stainless-steel surfaces. Using Salmonella enterica (SE1045) and Escherichia coli as model bacterial cells, we achieved a capture efficiency of up to 76.0 % for SE1045 cells and 81.1 % for E. coli cells at Log 3 CFU/mL upon the optimized conditions. Our assay showed good linear relationship between the concentrations of bacterial cells with the cell counting in images with the limit of detection (LOD) of Log 3 CFU/mL for both SE1045 and E. coli cells. A further increase in sensitivity in detecting E. coli cells was achieved through a heat treatment, enabling the LOD to be pushed as low as Log 2 CFU/mL. Furthermore, successful application was observed in assessing bacterial contamination on stainless-steel surface following integrating with swab collection, achieving a recovery rate of approximately 70 % suggests future prospects for evaluating the cleanliness of surfaces. The entire process was completed within around 2 hours, with a cost of merely 2 dollars per sample. Given a standard light microscope cost around 250 dollars, our developed method has shown great potential in practical industrial applications for bacterial contamination control on surfaces in low-resource settings.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Risk of Ischemic Stroke in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation using Heterogeneous Drug-protein-disease Network-based Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a deep learning model, ABioSPATH, to predict the one-year risk of ischemic stroke (IS) in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. The model integrates drug-protein-disease pathways and real-world clinical data of AF patients to generate the IS risk and potential pathways for each patient. The model uses a multilayer network to identify the mechanism of drug action and disease comorbidity propagation pathways. The model is tested on the Electronic Health Record (EHR) data of 7859 AF patients from 43 hospitals in Hong Kong. The model outperforms all baselines across all metrics and provides valuable molecular-level insights for clinical use. The model also highlights key proteins in common pathways and potential IS risks tied to less-studied drugs. The model only requires routinely collected data, without requiring expensive biomarkers to be tested.</description>

      <title>Str2Str: A Score-based Framework for Zero-shot Protein Conformation Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03117v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamic nature of proteins is crucial for determining their biological functions and properties, for which Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations stand as predominant tools to study such phenomena. By utilizing empirically derived force fields, MC or MD simulations explore the conformational space through numerically evolving the system via Markov chain or Newtonian mechanics. However, the high-energy barrier of the force fields can hamper the exploration of both methods by the rare event, resulting in inadequately sampled ensemble without exhaustive running. Existing learning-based approaches perform direct sampling yet heavily rely on target-specific simulation data for training, which suffers from high data acquisition cost and poor generalizability. Inspired by simulated annealing, we propose Str2Str, a novel structure-to-structure translation framework capable of zero-shot conformation sampling with roto-translation equivariant property. Our method leverages an amortized denoising score matching objective trained on general crystal structures and has no reliance on simulation data during both training and inference. Experimental results across several benchmarking protein systems demonstrate that Str2Str outperforms previous state-of-the-art generative structure prediction models and can be orders of magnitude faster compared to long MD simulations. Our open-source implementation is available at https://github.com/lujiarui/Str2Str</description>

      <title>CAFA-evaluator: A Python Tool for Benchmarking Ontological Classification Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present CAFA-evaluator, a powerful Python program designed to evaluate the performance of prediction methods on targets with hierarchical concept dependencies. It generalizes multi-label evaluation to modern ontologies where the prediction targets are drawn from a directed acyclic graph and achieves high efficiency by leveraging matrix computation and topological sorting. The program requirements include a small number of standard Python libraries, making CAFA-evaluator easy to maintain. The code replicates the Critical Assessment of protein Function Annotation (CAFA) benchmarking, which evaluates predictions of the consistent subgraphs in Gene Ontology. Owing to its reliability and accuracy, the organizers have selected CAFA-evaluator as the official CAFA evaluation software.</description>

      <title>Nondestructive, quantitative viability analysis of 3D tissue cultures using machine learning image segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09354v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ascertaining the collective viability of cells in different cell culture conditions has typically relied on averaging colorimetric indicators and is often reported out in simple binary readouts. Recent research has combined viability assessment techniques with image-based deep-learning models to automate the characterization of cellular properties. However, further development of viability measurements to assess the continuity of possible cellular states and responses to perturbation across cell culture conditions is needed. In this work, we demonstrate an image processing algorithm for quantifying cellular viability in 3D cultures without the need for assay-based indicators. We show that our algorithm performs similarly to a pair of human experts in whole-well images over a range of days and culture matrix compositions. To demonstrate potential utility, we perform a longitudinal study investigating the impact of a known therapeutic on pancreatic cancer spheroids. Using images taken with a high content imaging system, the algorithm successfully tracks viability at the individual spheroid and whole-well level. The method we propose reduces analysis time by 97% in comparison to the experts. Because the method is independent of the microscope or imaging system used, this approach lays the foundation for accelerating progress in and for improving the robustness and reproducibility of 3D culture analysis across biological and clinical research.</description>

      <title>Alignment of Density Maps in Wasserstein Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose an algorithm for aligning three-dimensional objects when represented as density maps, motivated by applications in cryogenic electron microscopy. The algorithm is based on minimizing the 1-Wasserstein distance between the density maps after a rigid transformation. The induced loss function enjoys a more benign landscape than its Euclidean counterpart and Bayesian optimization is employed for computation. Numerical experiments show improved accuracy and efficiency over existing algorithms on the alignment of real protein molecules. In the context of aligning heterogeneous pairs, we illustrate a potential need for new distance functions.</description>

      <title>Fusing Neural and Physical: Augment Protein Conformation Sampling with Tractable Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The protein dynamics are common and important for their biological functions and properties, the study of which usually involves time-consuming molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in silico. Recently, generative models has been leveraged as a surrogate sampler to obtain conformation ensembles with orders of magnitude faster and without requiring any simulation data (a "zero-shot" inference). However, being agnostic of the underlying energy landscape, the accuracy of such generative model may still be limited. In this work, we explore the few-shot setting of such pre-trained generative sampler which incorporates MD simulations in a tractable manner. Specifically, given a target protein of interest, we first acquire some seeding conformations from the pre-trained sampler followed by a number of physical simulations in parallel starting from these seeding samples. Then we fine-tuned the generative model using the simulation trajectories above to become a target-specific sampler. Experimental results demonstrated the superior performance of such few-shot conformation sampler at a tractable computational cost.</description>

      <title>PR-NET: Leveraging Pathway Refined Network Structures for Prostate Cancer Patient Condition Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diagnosis and monitoring of Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) are crucial for cancer patients, but the current models (such as P-NET) have limitations in terms of parameter count, generalization, and cost. To address the issue, we develop a more accurate and efficient Prostate Cancer patient condition prediction model, named PR-NET. By compressing and optimizing the network structure of P-NET, the model complexity is reduced while maintaining high accuracy and interpretability. The PR-NET demonstrated superior performance in predicting prostate cancer patient outcomes, outshining P-NET and six other traditional models with a significant margin. In our rigorous evaluation, PR-NET not only achieved impressive average AUC and Recall scores of 0.94 and 0.83, respectively, on known data but also maintained robust generalizability on five unknown datasets with a higher average AUC of 0.73 and Recall of 0.72, compared to P-NET's 0.68 and 0.5. PR-NET's efficiency was evidenced by its shorter average training and inference times, and its gene-level analysis revealed 46 key genes, demonstrating its enhanced predictive power and efficiency in identifying critical biomarkers for prostate cancer. Future research can further expand its application domains and optimize the model's performance and reliability.</description>
