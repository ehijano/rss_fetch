      <title>Conditional Non-Soficity of p-adic Deligne Extensions: on a Theorem of Gohla and Thom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long standing problem asks whether every group is sofic, i.e., can be separated by almost-homomorphisms to the symmetric group $Sym(n)$. Similar problems have been asked with respect to almost-homomorphisms to the unitary group $U(n)$, equipped with various norms. One of these problems has been solved for the first time in [De Chiffre, Gelbsky, Lubotzky, Thom, 2020]: some central extensions $\widetilde{\Gamma}$ of arithmetic lattices $\Gamma$ of $Sp(2g,\mathbb{Q}_p)$ were shown to be non-Frobenius approximated by almost homomorphisms to $U(n)$. Right after, it was shown that similar results hold with respect to the $p$-Schatten norms in [Lubotzky, Oppenheim, 2020]. It is natural, and has already been suggested in [Chapman, Lubotzky, 2024] and [Gohla, Thom, 2024], to check whether the $\widetilde{\Gamma}$ are also non-sofic. In order to show that they are (also) non-sofic, it suffices:
  (a) To prove that the permutation Cheeger constant of the simplicial complex underlying $\Gamma$ is positive, generalizing [Evra, Kaufman, 2016]. This would imply that $\Gamma$ is stable.
  (b) To prove that the (flexible) stability of $\Gamma$ implies the non-soficity of $\widetilde{\Gamma}$.
  Clause (b) was proved by Gohla and Thom. Here we offer a more algebraic/combinatorial treatment to their theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and investigate a new three-parameter family of graphs that further generalizes the Fibonacci and metallic cubes. Namely, the number of vertices in this family of graphs satisfies Horadam recurrence, a linear recurrence of second order with constant coefficients. It is shown that the new family preserves many appealing and useful properties of the Fibonacci and metallic cubes. In particular, we present recursive decomposition and decomposition into grids. Furthermore, we explore metric and enumerative properties such as the number of edges, distribution of degrees, and cube polynomials. We also investigate the existence of Hamiltonian paths and cycles.</description>

      <title>Canon Permutation Posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A permutation of the multiset $\{1^m,2^m,\dots,n^m\}$ is a canon permutation if the subsequence formed by the $j$th copy of each element of $[n]:=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ is identical for all $j\in[m]$. Canon permutations were introduced by Elizalde and are motivated by pattern-avoiding concepts such as (quasi-)Stirling permutations. He proved that the descent polynomial of canon permutations exhibits a surprising product structure; as a further consequence, it is palindromic. Our goal is to understand canon permutations from the viewpoint of Stanley's $(P,w)$-partitions, along the way generalizing Elizalde's definition and results. We start with a labeled poset $P$ and extend it in a natural way to a canon labeling of the product poset $P \times [n]$. The resulting descent polynomial has a product structure which arises naturally from the theory of $(P,w)$-partitions. When $P$ is graded, this theory also implies palindromicity. We include results on weak descent polynomials, an amphibian construction between canon permutations and multiset permutations as well as $\gamma$-positivity and interpretations of descent polynomials of canon permutations.</description>

      <title>Constructing three completely independent spanning trees in hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2013, Tapolcai demonstrated that a network with two completely independent spanning trees (CISTs) is sufficient for implementing protection routing. In a graph \( G \) with \( k \geq 2 \) spanning trees, denoted as \( T = \{T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_k\} \), these trees are termed completely independent spanning trees (CISTs) if the paths connecting any two vertices \( x \) and \( y \) across different trees do not overlap in vertices or edges, other than \( x \) and \( y \) themselves. Specifically, when \( k = 2 \), the trees form a dual-CIST, and when \( k = 3 \), they constitute a tri-CIST. The problem of determining whether a dual-CIST exists in a graph is NP-complete, as noted by Hasunuma (2002). In data networks, dual-CISTs facilitate fault-tolerant routing, while tri-CISTs enhance both reliability and secure message distribution.
  Recent advancements have focused on constructing CISTs within hypercube variant networks. Pai and Chang proposed a technique to generate two CISTs in hypercubes variant networks and called for the development of algorithms to extend this to more CISTs. Methods for constructing three CISTs have been established for various hypercube variants, including crossed cubes, Mobius cubes, and shuffle cubes.
  In 2017, Darties et al. asked if the 6-dimensional hypercube \( Q_6 \) can have three completely independent spanning trees, a question that remains unanswered. In this paper, we show how to construct three completely independent spanning trees in \( Q_n \) for \( n \geq 7 \). Two of these trees have diameters of at most \(2n+1\) and \(2n+3\), respectively, and the third tree has a diameter of at most \(2n+4\).</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for Book Ramsey Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove new bounds for Ramsey numbers for book graphs $B_n$. In particular, we show that $R(B_{n-1},B_n) = 4n-1$ for an infinite family of $n$ using a block-circulant construction similar to Paley graphs. We obtain improved bounds for several other values of $R(B_r,B_s)$ using different block-circulant graphs from SAT and integer programming (IP) solvers. Finally, we enumerate the number of critical graphs for $R(B_r,B_s)$ for small $r$ and $s$ using SAT modulo symmetries (SMS).</description>

      <title>Fault tolerance of metric basis can be expensive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set of vertices S is a resolving set of a graph G; if for every pair of vertices x and y in G, there exists a vertex s in S such that x and y differ in distance to s. A smallest resolving set of G is called a metric basis. The metric dimension dim(G) is the cardinality of a metric basis of G. The notion of a metric basis is applied to the problem of placing sensors in a network, where the problem of sensor faults can arise. The fault-tolerant metric dimension ftdim(G) is the cardinality of a smallest resolving set S such that S\{s} remains a resolving set of G for every s in S. A natural question is how much more sensors need to be used to achieve a fault-tolerant metric basis. It is known in literature that there exists an upper bound on ftdim(G) which is exponential in terms of dim(G); i.e. ftdim(G) &lt;= dim(G)(1+2^(5dim(G)-1)). In this paper, we construct graphs G with ftdim(G) = dim(G)+2^(dim(G)-1) for any value of dim(G), so the exponential upper bound is necessary. We also extend these results to the k-metric dimension which is a generalization of the fault-tolerant metric dimension. First, we establish a similar exponential upper bound on dim(k+1)(G) in terms of dim(k)(G); and then we show that there exists a graph for which dim(k+1)(G) is indeed exponential. For a possible further work, we leave the gap between the bounds to be reduced.</description>

      <title>Geometric Combinatorics of Polynomials II: Polynomials and Cell Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a finite piecewise Euclidean cell complex homeomorphic to the space of monic centered complex polynomials of degree $d$ whose critical values lie in a fixed closed rectangular region. We call this the branched rectangle complex since its points are indexed by marked $d$-sheeted planar branched covers of the fixed rectangle. The vertices of the cell structure are indexed by the combinatorial "basketballs" studied by Martin, Savitt and Singer. Structurally, the branched rectangle complex is a full subcomplex of a direct product of two copies of the order complex of the noncrossing partition lattice. Topologically, it is homeomorphic to the closed $2n$-dimensional ball where $n=d-1$. Metrically, the simplices in each factor are orthoschemes. It can also be viewed as a compactification of the space of all monic centered complex polynomials of degree $d$.
  We also introduce a finite piecewise Euclidean cell complex homeomorphic to the space of monic centered complex polynomials of degree $d$ whose critical values lie in a fixed closed annular region. We call this the branched annulus complex since its points are indexed by marked $d$-sheeted planar branched covers of the fixed annulus.It can be constructed from the branched rectangle complex as a cellular quotient by isometric face identifications. And it can be viewed as a compactification of the space of all monic centered complex polynomials of degree $d$ with distinct roots.
  Finally, the branched annulus complex deformation retracts to the branched circle complex, which we identify with the dual braid complex. Our explicit embedding of the dual braid complex as a spine for the space of polynomials with distinct roots provides a direct proof that these two classifying spaces for the braid group are homotopy equivalent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show factorization formulas for a class of partition functions of rational six vertex model. First we show factorization formulas for partition functions under triangular boundary. Further, by combining the factorization formulas with the explicit forms of the generalized domain wall boundary partition functions by Belliard-Pimenta-Slavnov, we derive factorization formulas for partition functions under trapezoid boundary which can be viewed as a generalization of triangular boundary. We also discuss an application to emptiness formation probabilities under trapezoid boundary which admit determinant representations.</description>

Abstract: We study scattering equations of hyperplane arrangements from the perspective of combinatorial commutative algebra and numerical algebraic geometry. We formulate the problem as linear equations on a reciprocal linear space and develop a degeneration-based homotopy algorithm for solving them. We investigate the Hilbert regularity of the corresponding homogeneous ideal and apply our methods to CHY scattering equations.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial proofs on the joint distribution of descents and inverse descents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05307v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A_{n,i,j}$ be the number of permutations on $[n]$ with $(i-1)$ descents and $(j-1)$ inverse descents.Carlitz, Roselle and Scoville in 1966 first revealed some combinatorial and arithmetic properties of $A_{n,i,j}$,which contain a recurrence of $A_{n,i,j}$.Using the idea of balls in boxes,Petersen gave a combinatorial interpretation for the generating function of $A_{n,i,j}$,and obtained the same recurrence of $A_{n,i,j}$ from its generating function.Subsequently, Petersen asked whether there is a visual way to understand this recurrence.In this paper,after observing the internal structures of permutation grids,we present a combinatorial proof for the recurrence of $A_{n,i,j}$.Let $I_{n,k}$ and $J_{n,k}$ be the number of involutions and fixed-point free involutions on $[n]$ with $k$ descents,respectively.With the help of algebraic method on generating functions,Guo and Zeng derived two recurrences of $I_{n,k}$ and $J_{2n,k}$ that play an essential role in the proof of their unimodal properties.Surprisingly,the constructive approach to the recurrence of $A_{n,i,j}$ is found to fuel the combinatorial interpretations of these two recurrences of $I_{n,k}$ and $J_{2n,k}$.</description>

      <title>Six Permutation Patterns Force Quasirandomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04776v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A sequence $\pi_1,\pi_2,\dots$ of permutations is said to be "quasirandom" if the induced density of every permutation $\sigma$ in $\pi_n$ converges to $1/|\sigma|!$ as $n\to\infty$. We prove that $\pi_1,\pi_2,\dots$ is quasirandom if and only if the density of each permutation $\sigma$ in the set $$\{123,321,2143,3412,2413,3142\}$$ converges to $1/|\sigma|!$. Previously, the smallest cardinality of a set with this property, called a "quasirandom-forcing" set, was known to be between four and eight. In fact, we show that there is a single linear expression of the densities of the six permutations in this set which forces quasirandomness and show that this is best possible in the sense that there is no shorter linear expression of permutation densities with positive coefficients with this property. In the language of theoretical statistics, this expression provides a new nonparametric independence test for bivariate continuous distributions related to Spearman's $\rho$.</description>

      <title>Cohen-Lenstra distribution for sparse matrices with determinantal biasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let us consider the following matrix $B_n$. The columns of $B_n$ are indexed with $[n]=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ and the rows are indexed with $[n]^3$. The row corresponding to $(x_1,x_2,x_3)\in [n]^3$ is given by $\sum_{i=1}^3 e_{x_i}$, where $e_1,e_2,\dots,e_n$ is the standard basis of $\mathbb{R}^{[n]}$. Let $A_n$ be random $n\times n$ submatrix of $B_n$, where the probability that we choose a submatrix $C$ is proportional to $|\det(C)|^2$.
  Let $p\ge 5$ be a prime. We prove that the asymptotic distribution of the $p$-Sylow subgroup of the cokernel of $A_n$ is given by the Cohen-Lenstra heuristics.
  Our result is motivated by the conjecture that the first homology group of a random two dimensional hypertree is also Cohen-Lenstra distributed.</description>

      <title>Heights of one- and two-sided congruence lattices of semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08229v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The height of a poset $P$ is the supremum of the cardinalities of chains in $P$. The exact formula for the height of the subgroup lattice of the symmetric group $\mathcal{S}_n$ is known, as is an accurate asymptotic formula for the height of the subsemigroup lattice of the full transformation monoid $\mathcal{T}_n$. Motivated by the related question of determining the heights of the lattices of left- and right congruences of $\mathcal{T}_n$, we develop a general method for computing the heights of lattices of both one- and two-sided congruences for semigroups. We apply this theory to obtain exact height formulae for several monoids of transformations, matrices and partitions, including: the full transformation monoid $\mathcal{T}_n$, the partial transformation monoid $\mathcal{PT}_n$, the symmetric inverse monoid $\mathcal{I}_n$, the monoid of order-preserving transformations $\mathcal{O}_n$, the full matrix monoid $\mathcal{M}(n,q)$, the partition monoid $\mathcal{P}_n$, the Brauer monoid $\mathcal{B}_n$ and the Temperley-Lieb monoid $\mathcal{TL}_n$.</description>

      <title>The 1/3-conjectures for domination in cubic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A set S of vertices in a graph G is a dominating set of G if every vertex not in S is adjacent to a vertex in S . The domination number of G, denoted by $\gamma$(G), is the minimum cardinality of a dominating set in G. In a breakthrough paper in 2008, L{\"o}wenstein and Rautenbach proved that if G is a cubic graph of order n and girth at least 83, then $\gamma$(G) $\le$ n/3. A natural question is if this girth condition can be lowered. The question gave birth to two 1/3-conjectures for domination in cubic graphs. The first conjecture, posed by Verstraete in 2010, states that if G is a cubic graph on n vertices with girth at least 6, then $\gamma$(G) $\le$ n/3. The second conjecture, first posed as a question by Kostochka in 2009, states that if G is a cubic, bipartite graph of order n, then $\gamma$(G) $\le$n/3. In this paper, we prove Verstraete's conjecture when there is no 7-cycle and no 8-cycle, and we prove the Kostochka's related conjecture for bipartite graphs when there is no 4-cycle and no 8-cycle.</description>

      <title>On the topology of the moduli of tropical unramified p-covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the topology of the moduli space of unramified $\mathbb{Z}/p$-covers of tropical curves of genus $g \geq 2$, where $p$ is a prime number. We use recent techniques by Chan--Galatius--Payne to identify contractible subcomplexes of the moduli space. We then use this contractibility result to show that this moduli space is simply connected. In the case of genus 2, we determine the homotopy type of this moduli space for all primes $p$. This work is motivated by prospective applications to the top-weight cohomology of the space of prime cyclic \'etale covers of smooth algebraic curves.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Grassmannians and Cyclic Quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to extend the quiver Grassmannian description of certain degenerations of Grassmann varieties to the symplectic case. We introduce a symplectic version of quiver Grassmannians studied in our previous papers and prove a number of results on these projective algebraic varieties. First, we construct a cellular decomposition of the symplectic quiver Grassmannians in question and develop combinatorics needed to compute Euler characteristics and Poincar\'e polynomials. Second, we show that the number of irreducible components of our varieties coincides with the Euler characteristic of the classical symplectic Grassmannians. Third, we describe the automorphism groups of the underlying symplectic quiver representations and show that the cells are the orbits of this group. Lastly, we provide an embedding into the affine flag varieties for the affine symplectic group.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for complementary sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05844v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding the n-th positive square number is easy, as it is simply $n^2$. But how do we find the complementary sequence, i.e. the n-th positive nonsquare number? For this case there is an explicit formula. However, for general constraints on a number, this is harder to find. In this paper, we study how to compute the n-th integer that does (or does not) satisfy a certain condition. In particular, we consider it as a fixed point problem, relate it to the iterative method of Lambek and Moser, study a bisection approach to this problem and provide formulas for various complementary sequences such as the non-k-gonal numbers, non-k-gonal pyramidal numbers, non-k-simplex numbers, non-sum-of-k-th powers and non-k-th powers.</description>
