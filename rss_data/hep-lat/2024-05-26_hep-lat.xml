      <title>Near-threshold states in coupled $DD^{\ast}-D^{\ast}D^{\ast}$ scattering from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first determination of doubly-charmed isospin-0 coupled-channel $DD^\ast-D^\ast D^\ast$ scattering amplitudes from lattice QCD is presented. The finite-volume spectrum is computed for three lattice volumes with a light-quark mass corresponding to $m_\pi\approx 391$ MeV and is used to extract the scattering amplitudes in $J^P = 1^+$ via the L\"{u}scher quantization condition. By analytically continuing the scattering amplitudes to complex energies, a $T_{cc}$ pole corresponding to a virtual bound state is found below $DD^\ast$ threshold. We also find a second pole, $T_{cc}^\prime$, corresponding to a resonance pole below the kinematically closed $D^\ast D^\ast$ channel, to which it has a strong coupling. A non-zero coupling is robustly found between the $S$-wave $D D^\ast$ and $D^\ast D^\ast$ channels producing a clear cusp in the $D D^\ast$ amplitude at the $D^\ast D^\ast$ threshold energy. This suggests that the experimental $T_{cc}^\prime$ should be observable in $D D^\ast$ and $D^\ast D^\ast$ final states at ongoing experiments.</description>

      <title>Radiative Transitions in Charmonium from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coupling of various charmonium mesons to a photon is studied using lattice QCD, giving access to radiative form factors and transitions, and probing the mesons' structure. Methods are developed which allow the robust determination of amplitudes, including those involving an excited state as well as multiple form factors, for a range of kinematics. These are applied in dynamical lattice QCD calculations using the distillation technique to compute the underlying three-point correlation functions. Form factors and amplitudes involving the low-lying charmonia, $\eta_c$, $J/\psi$, $\chi_{c0}$ and $\eta_c'$, are calculated, demonstrating the methods and providing the first dynamical lattice QCD results for some quantities.</description>

      <title>HYPERTILING -- a high performance Python library for the generation and visualization of hyperbolic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: HYPERTILING is a high-performance Python library for the generation and visualization of regular hyperbolic lattices embedded in the Poincar\'e disk model. Using highly optimized, efficient algorithms, hyperbolic tilings with millions of vertices can be created in a matter of minutes on a single workstation computer. Facilities including computation of adjacent vertices, dynamic lattice manipulation, refinements, as well as powerful plotting and animation capabilities are provided to support advanced uses of hyperbolic graphs. In this manuscript, we present a comprehensive exploration of the package, encompassing its mathematical foundations, usage examples, applications, and a detailed description of its implementation.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic properties of vector doubly-charmed tetraquark states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct a systematic study of the electromagnetic properties of multiquark systems with undetermined internal structures. Motivated by the recent observation of the $T_{cc}^+$ state, we apply the light-cone version of the QCD sum rule method to extract the magnetic dipole moments of several possible doubly-charmed vector tetraquark states. When analyzing the magnetic dipole moment of these states, they are modeled to have the diquark-antidiquark configurations. The magnetic dipole moments for the members are extracted as $ \mu_{T_{cc \bar{u} \bar{d}}} = 1.17^{+0.44}_{-0.32} \, \mu_N$, $ \mu_{T_{cc \bar{u} \bar{s}}} = 1.35^{+0.50}_{-0.37} \, \mu_N$, $ \mu_{T_{cc \bar{d} \bar{s}}} = -2.69^{+1.02}_{-0.75} \, \mu_N$, $ \mu_{T_{cc \bar{u} \bar{u}}} = 1.33^{+0.56}_{-0.40} \, \mu_N$, $ \mu_{T_{cc \bar{d} \bar{d}}} = 1.41^{+0.57}_{-0.43} \, \mu_N$ and $ \mu_{T_{cc \bar{s} \bar{s}}} = 1.44^{+0.53}_{-0.41} \, \mu_N$. Comparing the results obtained for the magnetic dipole moments of the $T_{cc \bar{u} \bar{d}}$ state with the $T_{cc \bar{u} \bar{s}}$ state, the $U$-symmetry is seen to be broken at about $\%15$, while for the $T_{cc \bar{d} \bar{d}}$ and $T_{cc \bar{s} \bar{s}}$ states, this symmetry is minimally broken. The obtained results may be useful to determine the true nature of these new interesting states.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scarring in a Non-Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) is an intriguing mechanism of ergodicity breaking that has recently spurred significant attention. Particularly prominent in Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs), an open question is whether QMBS nontrivially arises in non-Abelian LGTs. Here, we present evidence of robust QMBS in a non-Abelian SU(2) LGT with dynamical matter. Starting in product states that require little experimental overhead, we show that prominent QMBS arises for certain quenches, facilitated through meson and baryon-antibaryon excitations, highlighting its non-Abelian nature. The uncovered scarred dynamics manifests as long-lived coherent oscillations in experimentally accessible local observables as well as prominent revivals in the state fidelity. Our findings bring QMBS to the realm of non-Abelian LGTs, highlighting the intimate connection between scarring and gauge symmetry, and are amenable for observation in a recently proposed trapped-ion qudit quantum computer.</description>
