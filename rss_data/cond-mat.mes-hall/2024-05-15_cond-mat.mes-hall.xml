      <title>Channeling Skyrmions: suppressing the skyrmion Hall effect in ferrimagnetic nanostripes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Skyrmion Hall Effect (SkHE) observed in ferromagnetic (FM) and ferrimagnetic (FI) skyrmions traveling due to a spin-polarized current can be a problematic issue when it comes to technological applications. By investigating the properties of FI skyrmions in racetracks through computational simulations, we have described the nature of their movement based on the relative values of the exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya, and anisotropy coupling constants. Beyond that, using a design strategy, a magnetic channel-like nano-device is proposed in which a spin-polarized current protocol is created to successfully control the channel on which the skyrmion will travel without the adverse SkHE. Additionally, a simple adjustment in the current strength can modify the skyrmion position sideways between different parallel channels in the nanostripe.</description>

      <title>Tunable moir\'e materials for probing Berry physics and topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Berry curvature physics and quantum geometric effects have been instrumental in advancing topological condensed matter physics in recent decades. Although Landau level-based flat bands and conventional 3D solids have been pivotal in exploring rich topological phenomena, they are constrained by their limited ability to undergo dynamic tuning. In stark contrast, moir\'e systems have risen as a versatile platform for engineering bands and manipulating the distribution of Berry curvature in momentum space. These moir\'e systems not only harbor tunable topological bands, modifiable through a plethora of parameters, but also provide unprecedented access to large length scales and low energy scales. Furthermore, they offer unique opportunities stemming from the symmetry-breaking mechanisms and electron correlations associated with the underlying flat bands that are beyond the reach of conventional crystalline solids. A diverse array of tools, encompassing quantum electron transport in both linear and non-linear response regimes and optical excitation techniques, provide direct avenues for investigating Berry physics. This review navigates the evolving landscape of tunable moir\'e materials, highlighting recent experimental breakthroughs in the field of topological physics. Additionally, we delineate several challenges and offer insights into promising avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Charge-Transfer Hyperbolic Polaritons in $\alpha$-MoO$_3$/graphene heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge transfer is a fundamental interface process that can be harnessed for light detection, photovoltaics, and photosynthesis. Recently, charge transfer was exploited in nanophotonics to alter plasmon polaritons by involving additional non-polaritonic materials to activate the charge transfer. Yet, direct charge transfer between polaritonic materials hasn't been demonstrated. We report the direct charge transfer in pure polaritonic van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$/graphene. We extracted the Fermi energy of 0.6 eV for graphene by infrared nano-imaging of charge transfer hyperbolic polaritons in the vdW heterostructure. This unusually high Fermi energy is attributed to the charge transfer between graphene and $\alpha$-MoO$_3$. Moreover, we have observed charge transfer hyperbolic polaritons in multiple energy-momentum dispersion branches with a wavelength elongation of up to 150%. With support from the DFT calculation, we find that the charge transfer between graphene and $\alpha$-MoO$_3$, absent in mechanically assembled vdW heterostructures, is attributed to the relatively pristine heterointerface preserved in the epitaxially grown vdW heterostructure. The direct charge transfer and charge transfer hyperbolic polaritons demonstrated in our work hold great promise for developing nano-optical circuits, computational devices, communication systems, and light and energy manipulation devices.</description>

      <title>Temperature Dependence of Electron Viscosity in Superballistic GaAs Point Contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron transport in suspended and non-suspended GaAs point contacts (PCs) of different widths is experimentally studied. The superballistic contribution to the conductance, that demonstrates a distinctive quadratic dependence on the PC width and temperature growth, is extracted from the experiment. The studied PCs are shown to be described in the framework of hydrodynamic electron flow a in wide temperature range. At low temperatures, $T$, the viscosity is found out to obey the law $1/T^2$ expected for 2D systems, while at higher temperatures it has the dependence $1/T$. Similar measurements performed after the suspension of PCs, i.e. their separation from substrate, show that the electron viscosity reduces in the whole temperature range, that indicates an enhanced electron-electron interaction in suspended structures.</description>

      <title>Dirac Fermions and Topological Phases in Magnetic Topological Insulator Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a Dirac fermion theory for topological phases in magnetic topological insulator films. The theory is based on exact solutions of the energies and the wave functions for an effective model of the three-dimensional topological insulator (TI) film. It is found that the TI film consists of a pair of massless or massive Dirac fermions for the surface states, and a series of massive Dirac fermions for the bulk states. The massive Dirac fermion always carries zero or integer quantum Hall conductance when the valence band is fully occupied while the massless Dirac fermion carries a one-half quantum Hall conductance when the chemical potential is located around the Dirac point for a finite range. The magnetic exchange interaction in the magnetic layers in the film can be used to manipulate either the masses or chirality of the Dirac fermions and gives rise to distinct topological phases, which cover the known topological insulating phases, such as quantum anomalous Hall effect, quantum spin Hall effect and axion effect, and also the novel topological metallic phases, such as half quantized Hall effect, half quantum mirror Hall effect, and metallic quantum anomalous Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Strain-Induced Intrinsic Antiferromagnetic Skyrmions in Two-Dimensional Janus Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic (AFM) skyrmions, which are resistant to both the skyrmion Hall effect and external magnetic perturbations, are expected to be promising candidates for next-generation spintronics devices. Despite being observed in bulk materials and synthetic AFM layered systems, the existence of intrinsic AFM skyrmions within single magnetic layers, which offer potential advantages for spintronic device fabrication, has remained elusive. In this work, taking monolayer CrSi(Te,Se)$_{3}$ as a representative system, we demonstrate the emergence of intrinsic AFM skyrmions in two-dimensional Janus magnets. It is found that under moderate compressive strain, the interplay between considerable Dyzaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and the strain-induced AFM Heisenberg exchange interaction in monolayer CrSi(Te,Se)$_{3}$ would give rise to the emergence of intrinsic AFM skyrmions assembled from AFM spin spirals. Moreover, the application of an external magnetic field could trigger the emergence of AFM merons as well as a canted AFM state. Our findings propose a feasible approach for achieving intrinsic AFM skyrmions in realistic systems, which paves the way for developments in AFM topological spintronics devices.</description>

      <title>Unconventional magnetism mediated by spin-phonon-photon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic order typically emerges due to the short-range exchange interaction between the constituent electronic spins. Recent discoveries have found a crucial role for spin-phonon coupling in various phenomena from optical ultrafast magnetization switching to dynamical control of the magnetic state. Here, we demonstrate theoretically the emergence of a biquadratic long-range interaction between spins mediated by their coupling to phonons hybridized with vacuum photons into polaritons. The resulting ordered state enabled by the exchange of virtual polaritons between spins is reminiscent of superconductivity mediated by the exchange of virtual phonons. The biquadratic nature of the spin-spin interaction promotes ordering without favoring ferro- or antiferromagnetism. It further makes the phase transition to magnetic order a first-order transition, unlike in conventional magnets. Consequently, a large magnetization develops abruptly on lowering the temperature which \aknew{could} enable magnetic memories admitting ultralow-power thermally-assisted writing while maintaining a high data stability. The role of photons in the phenomenon further enables an in-situ static control over the magnetism. These unique features make our predicted spin-spin interaction and magnetism highly unconventional paving the way for novel scientific and technological opportunities.</description>

      <title>Efficient motion of 90^{\circ} domain walls in Mn_{2}Au via pure optical torques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering alternative ways to drive domain wall (DW) dynamics is crucial for advancing spintronic applications. Here we demonstrate via atomistic spin dynamics simulations that optical torques can efficiently drive 90^{\circ} DWs in the Mn2Au antiferromagnet but their spatial symmetry forbids the motion of 180^{\circ} walls. In the steady-state regime, the kinematics display special relativity signatures accessed for low laser intensities. At velocities higher than the magnonic limit, the DW enters a proliferation regime in which part of its relativistic energy is invested into the nucleation of novel magnetic textures. Our investigation contributes towards the fundamental understanding of opto-magnetic effects, supporting the development of next generation, all-optically controlled antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>Strain effects on the electronic properties of a graphene wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the strain and curvature effects on the electronic properties of a curved graphene structure, called the graphene wormhole. The electron dynamics is described by a massless Dirac fermion containing position--dependent Fermi velocity. In addition, the strain produces a pseudo--magnetic vector potential to the geometric coupling. For an isotropic strain tensor, the decoupled components of the spinor field exhibit a supersymmetric (SUSY) potential, depending on the centrifugal term and the external magnetic field only. In the absence of a external magnetic field, the strain yields to an exponential damped amplitude, whereas the curvature leads to a power--law damping of the wave function. The spin--curvature coupling breaks the chiral symmetry between the upper and the lower spinor component, which leads to the increasing of the wave function on either upper or lower region of the wormhole, i.e., depending on the spin number. By adding an uniform magnetic field, the effective potential exhibits an asymptotic quadratic profile and a spin--curvature barrier near the throat. As a result, the bound states (Landau levels) are confined around the wormhole throat showing an asymmetric and spin--dependent profile.</description>

      <title>Ballistic-aggregated Carbon Nanofoam in Target-side of Pulsed Laser Deposition for Energy Storage Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In pulsed laser deposition, along conventional deposition on frontside of plasma-plume, target is getting coated on its surface too. For reproducibility, cleaning those residues is the most adopted approach. Herein, we investigate the target-side coated materials and employ them as a binder-free supercapacitor electrode. Ballistic aggregated target-side nanofoam is compact and contains higher sp2-carbon, higher nitrogen content with higher graphitic-N and lower oxygen content with lower COOH group than that of diffusive aggregated conventional nanofoams. They are highly hydrogenated graphite-like amorphous carbon and superhydrophilic. The symmetric microsupercapacitor delivers higher volumetric capacitance of 522 mF/cm3 at 100 mV/s and 104% retention after 10000 charge-discharge cycles over conventional nanofoam (215 mF/cm3 and 85% retention) with the areal capacitance of 134 {\mu}F/cm2 at 120 Hz and ultrafast frequency response. Utilizing those residue materials is of great importance towards sustainable development, zero-waste, and utilization of deposition techniques in full-phase, which is resource-efficient, energy competent and cost-effective.</description>

      <title>Formation of Beta-Indium Selenide Layers Grown via Selenium Passivation of InP(111)B Substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indium selenide, In2Se3, has recently attracted growing interest due to its novel properties, including room temperature ferroelectricity, outstanding photoresponsivity, and exotic in-plane ferroelectricity, which open up new regimes for next generation electronics. In2Se3 also provides the important advantage of tuning the electrical properties of ultra-thin layers with an external electrical and magnetic field, making it a potential platform to study novel two-dimensional physics. Yet, In2Se3 has many different polymorphs, and it has been challenging to synthesize single-phase material, especially using scalable growth methods, as needed for technological applications. In this paper, we use aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy to characterize the microstructure of twin-free single-phase ultra-thin layers of beta-In2Se3, prepared by a unique molecular beam epitaxy approach. We emphasize features of the In2Se3 layer and In2Se3/InP interface which provide evidence for understanding the growth mechanism of the single-phase In2Se3. This novel approach for forming high-quality twin-free single phase two-dimensional crystals on InP substrates is likely to be applicable to other technologically important substrates.</description>

      <title>Maxwell's demon across the quantum-to-classical transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In scenarios coined Maxwell's demon, information on microscopic degrees of freedom is used to seemingly violate the second law of thermodynamics. This has been studied in the classical as well as the quantum domain. In this paper, we study an implementation of Maxwell's demon that can operate in both domains. In particular, we investigate information-to-work conversion over the quantum-to-classical transition. The demon continuously measures the charge state of a double quantum dot, and uses this information to guide electrons against a voltage bias by tuning the on-site energies of the dots. Coherent tunneling between the dots allows for the buildup of quantum coherence in the system. Under strong measurements, the coherence is suppressed, and the system is well-described by a classical model. As the measurement strength is further increased, the Zeno effect prohibits interdot tunneling. A Zeno-like effect is also observed for weak measurements, where measurement errors lead to fluctuations in the on-site energies, dephasing the system. We anticipate similar behaviors in other quantum systems under continuous measurement and feedback control, making our results relevant for implementations in quantum technology and quantum control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geminate annihilation of two triplet excitons created by singlet exciton fission is affected by the dimensionality of transport as determined by typically anisotropic triplet exciton mobilities in organic molecular crystals. We analyze this process using a random-walk model where the time-dynamics of the geminate annihilation probability is determined by the average exciton hopping times along the crystallographic directions. The model is then applied to the geminate fluorescence dynamics in rubrene, where the main channel for triplet-triplet annihilation is via triplet fusion and subsequent photon emission, and we identify the transitions between transport in one, two, and three dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze a class of bound defect states in the continuum of bilayer graphene, which emerge independent of symmetry protection or additional degrees of freedom. A comparative analysis of AA- and AB-stacked bilayer graphene demonstrates that these states originate from the intrinsic algebraic structure of the Hamiltonian rather than any underlying symmetry. This discovery provides a pathway to previously unexplored approaches in defect and band-structure engineering. We conclude with a proposed protocol for observing these states in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments.</description>

      <title>Controllable suppression of Non-Hermitian skin effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a phenomenon where the bulk states tend to the boundary within a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian system, with broad applications across various fields. A comprehensive understanding of anomalies in skin modes associated with NHSEs is essential for practical applications. Recently, some innovative works reported the suppression and enhancement of NHSEs through the application of magnetic fields, respectively. In our work, we engineered onsite potential energy distribution and found non-monotonic and monotonic suppression patterns on skin modes similar to magnetic fields. These suppression patterns represent characteristic transitions as the onsite potential distribution shifts from order to disorder. Relying only on onsite potential energy engineering, we have not only deepened our insight into the relationship and distinctions between order and disorder, but also developed a general strategy to demonstrate both robustness and controllable adjustability of the skin modes. By integrating with the scaling theory of disorder, we have extended the concept of controllable suppression of NHSEs to higher-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring nonequilibrium Andreev resonances in ultraclean graphene Andreev interferometers</title>

Abstract: We study nonequilibrium Andreev resonances in a voltage-biased graphene three-terminal Josephson junction (JJ). We observe periodic oscillations of resistance with maxima at multiples of the magnetic flux quantum (noninversion regime). As we increase the bias voltage, we further observe a transition point beyond which oscillations exhibit a $\pi$ phase shift (inversion regime) with maxima of resistance occuring at multiples of half-flux quantum. At this transition point, the frequency of the oscillations is doubled. We develop a model based on the coupling of the static Andreev bound states (ABSs) to the nonequilibrium Fermi surface of graphene to explain the observed noninversion to inversion crossovers. Our model associates these crossovers to microscopic phase-sensitive Andreev reflections which couple the normal and superfluid components of the current. Our findings show that multiterminal JJs can be used to engineer unconventional energy-phase relations such as those expected in the $\pi$-shifted ABSs without relying on quartet and Floquet physics. These nonequilibrium ABSs could potentially find applications in superconducting $\pi$ qubits.</description>

      <title>Bi-Hamiltonian in Semiflexible Polymer as Strongly Coupled System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13655</link>

Abstract: When many body system in Classical Mechanics is described using bi-Hamiltonian for its group of particles which forms a coarse grained bead, the damping energy from the heat bath perturbs the motion of a particle which is along the trajectory of multiple Hamiltonian system simultaneously. As managing the coarse grained modeling of the suspended semiflexible polymer like single walled carbon nanotubes(SWCNT) in vacuum, the authors discovered that such interconnection between Hamiltonian systems as sharing a heat bath builds a strongly coupled system. The consequence of this interconnection is revealed to form certain form of cross correlated momentum in coarsed grained system as well as in the original atomic scales. In this paper, we adapt the framework of Stochastic Thermodynamics to describe the cross correlation of bi-Hamiltonian system which replicates the macroscopic behaviour of SWCNT under the Smoluchowski picture for cross correlation between Hamiltonian systems. The numerical experiments using collision between tubes confirms the derivation and the justification of the usage of the heat diffusion to compensate the abnormaly from cross correlated momentum.</description>

      <title>Magnon dispersion and spin transport in CrCl$_3$ bilayers under different strain-induced magnetic states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomically-thin van der Waals magnetic materials offer exceptional opportunities to mechanically and electrically manipulate magnetic states and spin textures. The possibility of efficient spin transport in these materials makes them promising for the development of novel nanospintronics technology. Using atomistic spin dynamics simulations, we investigate magnetic ground state, magnon dispersion, critical temperature, and magnon spin transport in CrCl$_3$ bilayers in the absence and presence of compressive and tensile strains. We show that in the presence of mechanical strain, the magnon band gap at the $\Gamma$ point and the critical temperature of the bilayer are increased. Furthermore, our simulations show that the magnon diffusion length is reduced in the presence of strain. Moreover, by exciting magnons through the spin Seebeck effect and spin Hall-induced torque, we illustrate distinctions between magnon spin transport in the antiferromagnetic state, under compressive strains, and ferromagnetic states, under tensile strains or in the unstrained case.</description>

      <title>Non-resonant electric quantum control of individual on-surface spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum control techniques play an important role in manipulating and harnessing the properties of different quantum systems, including isolated atoms. Here, we propose to achieve quantum control over a single on-surface atomic spin using Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) interferometry implemented with Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). Specifically, we model how the application of time-dependent, non-resonant AC electric fields across the STM tip-surface gap makes it possible to achieve precise quantum state manipulation in an isolated Fe atom on a MgO/Ag(100) surface. We propose a protocol to combine Landau Zener tunneling with LZSM interferometry that permits one to measure the quantum spin tunneling of an individual Fe atom. The proposed experiments can be implemented with ESR-STM instrumentation, opening a new venue in the research of on-surface single spin control.</description>
