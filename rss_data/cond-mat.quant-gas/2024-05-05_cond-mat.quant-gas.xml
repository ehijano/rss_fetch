      <title>Floquet dynamics of ultracold atoms in optical lattices with a parametrically modulated trapping potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments with ultracold atoms in optical lattices usually involve a weak parabolic trapping potential which merely serves to confine the atoms, but otherwise remains negligible. In contrast, we suggest a different class of experiments in which the presence of a stronger trap is an essential part of the set-up. Because the trap-modified on-site energies exhibit a slowly varying level spacing, similar to that of an anharmonic oscillator, an additional time-periodic trap modulation with judiciously chosen parameters creates nonlinear resonances which enable efficient Floquet engineering. We employ a Mathieu approximation for constructing the near-resonant Floquet states in an accurate manner and demonstrate the emergence of effective ground states from the resonant trap eigenstates. Moreover, we show that the population of the Floquet states is strongly affected by the phase of a sudden turn-on of the trap modulation, which leads to significantly modified and rich dynamics. As a guideline for further studies, we argue that the deliberate population of only the resonance-induced effective ground states will allow one to realize Floquet condensates which follow classical periodic orbits, thus providing challenging future perspectives for the investigation of the quantum-classical correspondence.</description>

      <title>Modulational instability in a quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the modulational instability of plane wave solutions within a modified Gross-Pitaevskii equation framework. The equation features cubic and quartic nonlinearity. It models the behaviour of quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates in symmetric Bose-Bose mixtures of ultra-dilute cold atoms. Our study demonstrates the pivotal role of the competition between mean-field attractions and quantum fluctuation-induced repulsions. This competition significantly affects the emergence and evolution of modulational instability. By employing linear stability analysis, we identify the essential conditions that lead to modulational instability. We find that the stability of plane wave solutions significantly depends on the interaction among system parameters. Further development of the instability leads to the fragmentation of the BEC into a chain of quantum droplets. We calculated the quantity of quantum droplets generated during the nonlinear phase of the instability. Our analytical results are corroborated by numerical simulations of the modified quasi-1D Gross-Pitaevskii equation. These simulations vividly depict the formation, interaction, and coalescence of droplets during the nonlinear phase of modulational instability. The investigation shows that linear stability analysis of the modified Gross-Pitaevskii equation, considering quantum fluctuations, precisely forecasts modulational instability phenomena across different domains of parameter spaces.</description>

      <title>Fractonic criticality in Rydberg atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractonic matter can undergo unconventional phase transitions driven by the condensation of particles that move along subdimensional manifolds. We propose that this type of quantum critical point can be realized in a bilayer of crossed Rydberg chains. This system exhibits a transition between a disordered phase and a charge-density-wave phase with subextensive ground state degeneracy. The transition is described by a stack of critical Ising conformal field theories that become decoupled in the low-energy limit due to emergent subsystem symmetries. We discuss the unusual scaling properties and derive anisotropic correlators that provide signatures of subdimensional criticality in a realistic setup.</description>

      <title>Phase separation of a repulsive two-component Fermi gas at the two- to three-dimensional crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical analysis of phase separations between two repulsively interacting components in an ultracold fermionic gas, occurring at the dimensional crossover in a harmonic trap with varying aspect ratios. A tailored kinetic energy functional is derived and combined with a density-potential functional approach to develop a framework that is benchmarked with the orbital-based method. We investigate the changes in the density profile of the phase-separated gas under different interaction strengths and geometries. The analysis reveals the existence of small, partially polarized domains in certain parameter regimes, which is similar to the purely two-dimensional limit. However, the density profile is further enriched by a shell structure found in anisotropic traps. We also track the transitions that can be driven by either a change in interaction strength or trap geometry. The developed framework is noted to have applications for other systems with repulsive interactions that combine continuous and discrete degrees of freedom.</description>
