      <title>Uncertainty Quantification of Super-Resolution Flow Mapping in Liquid Metals using Ultrasound Localization Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convection of liquid metals drives large natural processes and is important in technical processes. Model experiments are conducted for research purposes where simulations are expensive and the clarification of open questions requires novel flow mapping methods with an increased spatial resolution. In this work, the method of Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM) is investigated for this purpose. Known from microvasculature imaging, this method provides an increased spatial resolution beyond the diffraction limit. Its applicability in liquid metal flows is promising, however the realization and reliability is challenging, as artificial scattering particles or microbubbles cannot be utilized. To solve this issue an approach using nonlinear adaptive beamforming is proposed. This allowed the reliable tracking of particles of which super-resolved flow maps can be deduced. Furthermore, the application in fluid physics requires quantified results. Therefore, an uncertainty quantification model based on the spatial resolution, velocity gradient and measurement parameters is proposed, which allows to estimate the flow maps validity under experimental conditions. The proposed method is demonstrated in magnetohydrodynamic convection experiments. In some occasions, ULM was able to measure velocity vectors within the boundary layer of the flow, which will help for future in-depth flow studies. Furthermore, the proposed uncertainty model of ULM is of generic use in other applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of an oscillatory boundary layer over a sediment bed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms by which a particle bed modifies the oscillatory boundary layer. We perform Euler-Lagrange simulations of an OBL over a particle bed at Reynolds numbers $\mathrm{Re}_{\delta}= 200$, 400, and 800, density ratio $\rho_p/\rho_f = 2.65$, maximum Shields numbers ranging from $1.42 \times 10^{-2}$ to $7.40 \times 10^{-2}$, Galileo number $\mathrm{Ga} = 51.9$, Stokes number ranging from 3.99 to 15.97, and Kuelegan-Carpenter number ranging from $1.7 \times 10^3$ to $6.8 \times 10^3$, and showed large modulation to the underlying boundary layer. We show two mechanisms of modification to the oscillatory boundary layer: (I) the permeability of the bed allows fluid flow to penetrate into the bed, introducing a slip velocity at the bed-fluid interface, an inflection point and the expansion of the boundary layer, and (II) for $\mathrm{Re}_{\delta} = 400$, and 800, particle motion creates an evolving bedform. For $\mathrm{Re}_{\delta} = 200$, particles are nearly motionless and the permeability of the bed drives the alteration of the velocity profile. The initial bed form drives velocity fluctuations not seen for flow over a smooth, impermeable wall. For Reynolds 400 and 800 particle momentum is associated with the peak velocity fluctuations, indicating that the particle feedback force contributes to velocity fluctuations. We show that the coefficient of friction, computed using the bed shear stress, is decreased by nearly half for Reynolds 200 and 400, and nearly an eighth for Reynolds 800.</description>

      <title>Understanding the instability-wave selectivity of hypersonic compression ramp laminar flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hypersonic flow stability over a two-dimensional compression corner is studied using resolvent analysis, linear stability theory (LST) and parabolised stability equation (PSE) analysis. We find that the interaction between upstream convective-type disturbances and the laminar separation bubble can be divided into two regimes, whose behaviour can be well explained by comparative research. First, two-dimensional (2-D) high-frequency Mack modes neutrally oscillate with the presence of alternating stable and unstable regions inside the separation bubble. These discontinuous unstable regions are generated by repeated synchronisations between discrete modes with evolving branches. Through a modal sychronisation analysis, we report that the second modes upstream and downstream of the separation bubble can be essentially different from each other, since they originate from different branches of discrete modes due to flow separation. Second, the 2-D low-frequency `shear-layer mode' is found to be stable in the separation bubble by LST, whereas multiple unstable three-dimensional (3-D) eigenmodes are identified by LST. In general, three significant modes are dominant successively near the separation point, in the separation bubble and near the reattachment point. These modes are found to be sensitive to the streamline curvature effect. The locally dominant modes agree with the resolvent response in terms of the disturbance shape and the growth rate of energy. Thus, a combination of global and local analyses demonstrates that the separation bubble tends to selectively amplify low-frequency 3-D disturbances and `freeze' high-frequency Mack-mode disturbances in an explainable manner. These findings facilitate the understanding of the early evolution of low- and high-frequency instabilities in hypersonic separated flows.</description>

      <title>Experimentally informed, linear mean-field modelling of circular cylinder aeroacoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A noise modelling approach is proposed for bluff body wakes such as flow over a cylinder, where the primary noise source comprises large-scale coherent structures such as the vortex shedding flow feature. This phenomenon leads to Aeolian tones in the far-field, and is inherent in wake flows across a range of Reynolds numbers (Re), from low-Re to high-Re turbulent flows. The approach employs linear global stability analysis on the time-averaged mean flow, with amplitude calibration through two-point statistics, and far-field noise calculations from the global mode fluctuations by Curle analogy. The overall approach is tested for flow over a cylinder at Reynolds numbers Re=150 and 13300. For Re=150 flow, noise directivity calculations from the present approach agree with direct far-field computations. For Re=13300 flow, the mean flow is obtained by particle image velocimetry (PIV). The linear global mode for spanwise-homogeneous-type fluctuations is obtained at the main, lift fluctuation frequency. Calibration of this global mode involves Time-Resolved PIV data in the streamwise-spanwise plane, which is Fourier transformed in frequency-spanwise wavenumber space. The noise calculations for this global mode are then found to be less than 1 dB off from the microphone measurements.</description>

      <title>High-order meshless global stability analysis of Taylor-Couette flows in complex domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, meshless methods have become popular in numerically solving partial differential equations and have been employed to solve equations governing fluid flows, heat transfer, and species transport. In the present study, a numerical solver is developed employing the meshless framework to efficiently compute the hydrodynamic stability of fluid flows in complex geometries. The developed method is tested on two cases of Taylor-Couette flows. The concentric case represents the parallel flow assumption incorporated in the Orr-Sommerfeld model and the eccentric Taylor-Couette flow incorporates a non-parallel base flow with separation bubbles. The method was validated against earlier works by Marcus [1], Oikawa et al. [2], Leclercq et al. [3], and Mittal et al. [4]. The results for the two cases and the effectiveness of the method are discussed in detail. The method is then applied to Taylor-Couette flow in an elliptical enclosure and the stability of the flow is investigated.</description>

      <title>Vorticity and magnetic dynamo from subsonic expansion waves II: Dependence on magnetic Prandtl number, forcing scale, cooling time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The amplification of astrophysical magnetic fields takes place via dynamo instability in turbulent environments. The presence of vorticity is crucial for the dynamo to happen. However, the role of vorticity is not yet fully understood. This work is an extension of previous research on the effect of an irrotational subsonic forcing on a magnetized medium in the presence of rotation or a differential velocity profile, aimed at exploring a wider parameter space in terms of Reynolds numbers, magnetic Prandtl number, forcing scale, cooling timescale in a Newtonian cooling. We study the effect of imposing either the acceleration or the velocity forcing function to be curl-free and evaluate the terms responsible for the evolution vorticity. We use Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) to solve the fully compressible, resistive magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) equations with the Pencil Code. We study both isothermal and non-isothermal regimes and address the relative importance of different vorticity source terms.We report no small-scale dynamo for the models that do not include shear. We find a hydro instability, followed by a magnetic one, when a shearing velocity profile is applied. The vorticity production is found to be numerical in the purely irrotational case. Non-isothermality, rotation, shear or forcing in the form of a velocity curl-free, when included, contribute to increasing vorticity. Consistently with our previous study, we find that turbulence driven by subsonic expansion waves can amplify vorticity and magnetic field only in the presence of a background shearing profile. The presence of a cooling function make the instability happens on a shorter timescale. We estimate critical Reynolds and Magnetic Reynolds Numbes of 40 and 20, respectively.</description>

      <title>Wave-resolving Voronoi model of Rouse number for sediment entrainment equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To integrate wave and sediment transport modeling, a computationally extensive wave-resolving Voronoi mesh-based simulation has been developed, to improve upon heretofore separate sediment and spectral wave modeling. Orbital wave motion-dependent sediment transport and fine structures of the dynamic Rouse number distribution across the seabed were brought into focus. The entirely parallelized wave-resolving hydrodynamic model is demonstrated for nearshore beach waters adjacent to artificial islands in Doha Bay. The nested model was validated with tidal time series for three locations and two seasons.</description>

      <title>Turbulence revealed by wavelet transform: power spectrum and intermittency for the velocity field of the cosmic baryonic fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use continuous wavelet transform techniques to construct the global and environment-dependent wavelet statistics, such as energy spectrum and kurtosis, to study the fluctuation and intermittency of the turbulent motion in the cosmic fluid velocity field with the IllustrisTNG simulation data. We find that the peak scales of the energy spectrum and the spectral ratio define two characteristic scales, which can be regarded as the integral scale and the dissipation scale of turbulence, respectively, so that the energy spectrum can be divided into the energy-containing range, the inertial range and the dissipation range of turbulence. The wavelet kurtosis is an increasing function of the wavenumber $k$, first grows rapidly then slowly with $k$, indicating that the cosmic fluid becomes increasingly intermittent with $k$. In the energy-containing range, the energy spectrum increases significantly from $z = 2$ to $1$, but remains almost unchanged from $z = 1$ to $0$. We find that both the environment-dependent spectrum and kurtosis are similar to the global ones, and the magnitude of the spectrum is smallest in the lowest-density and largest in the highest-density environment, suggesting that the cosmic fluid is more turbulent in a high-density than in a low-density environment. In the inertial range, the exponent of the energy spectrum is steeper than not only the Kolmogorov but also the Burgers exponent, suggesting that there may be more complex mechanisms for energy transfer than Kolmogorov and Burgers turbulence.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Equation for Stochastic Vector Bundles</title>

Abstract: The kinetic equation is crucial for understanding the statistical properties of stochastic processes, yet current equations, such as the classical Fokker-Planck, are limited to local analysis. This paper derives a new kinetic equation for stochastic systems on vector bundles, addressing global scale randomness. The kinetic equation was derived by cumulant expansion of the ensemble-averaged local probability density function, which is a functional of state transition trajectories. The kinetic equation is the geodesic equation for the probability space. It captures global and historical influences, accounts for non-Markovianity, and can be reduced to the classical Fokker-Planck equation for Markovian processes. This paper also discusses relative issues concerning the kinetic equation, including non-Markovianity, Markov approximation, macroscopic conservation equations, gauge transformation, and truncation of the infinite-order kinetic equation, as well as limitations that require further attention.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an asymptotic theory for solving the dynamics of slender autophoretic loops and knots. Our formulation is valid for non-intersecting 3D centrelines, with arbitrary chemical patterning and varying (circular) cross-sectional radius, allowing a broad class of slender active loops and knots to be studied. The theory is amenable to closed-form solutions in simpler cases, allowing us to analytically derive the swimming speed of chemically patterned tori, and the pumping strength (stresslet) of a uniformly active slender torus. Using simple numerical solutions of our asymptotic equations, we then elucidate the behaviour of many exotic active particle geometries, such as a bumpy uniformly active torus that spins and a Janus trefoil knot, which rotates as it swims forwards.</description>

      <title>Insights into the mechanics of pure and bacteria-laden sessile whole blood droplet evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the mechanics of sessile blood drop evaporation using optical diagnostics, theoretical analysis, and micro/nano-characterization. The transient evaporation process has three major phases (A, B, and C) based on the evaporation rate. Phase A is the fastest, where edge evaporation dominates and forms a gelated three-phase contact line. Gelation results from sol-gel phase transition that occurs due to the accumulation of red blood cells, as they get transported due to outward capillary flow generated during drop evaporation. The intermediate phase B consists of a gelation front propagating radially inwards due to the combined effect of outward capillary flow and drop height reduction evaporating in pinned mode, forming a wet gel phase. We unearthed that the gelation of the entire droplet occurs in Phase B, and the gel formed contains trace amounts of water that are detectable in our experiments. Phase C is the final slowest stage of evaporation, where the wet gel transforms into a dry gel and leads to desiccation induced stress, forming diverse crack patterns in the dried blood drop precipitate. We observe radial and orthoradial cracks in the precipitate's thicker region, mud-flat cracks in the drop center, and the outer contact line where thickness and curvature are relatively small. We also study the evaporation of bacteria-laden droplets to simulate bacterial infection in human blood and show that the drop evaporation rate and final dried residue pattern do not change appreciably within the parameter variation of the bacterial concentration typically found in bacterial infection of living organisms.</description>

      <title>Interpreting and generalizing deep learning in physics-based problems with functional linear models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although deep learning has achieved remarkable success in various scientific machine learning applications, its opaque nature poses concerns regarding interpretability and generalization capabilities beyond the training data. Interpretability is crucial and often desired in modeling physical systems. Moreover, acquiring extensive datasets that encompass the entire range of input features is challenging in many physics-based learning tasks, leading to increased errors when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this work, motivated by the field of functional data analysis (FDA), we propose generalized functional linear models as an interpretable surrogate for a trained deep learning model. We demonstrate that our model could be trained either based on a trained neural network (post-hoc interpretation) or directly from training data (interpretable operator learning). A library of generalized functional linear models with different kernel functions is considered and sparse regression is used to discover an interpretable surrogate model that could be analytically presented. We present test cases in solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, and transport. Our results demonstrate that our model can achieve comparable accuracy to deep learning and can improve OOD generalization while providing more transparency and interpretability. Our study underscores the significance of interpretable representation in scientific machine learning and showcases the potential of functional linear models as a tool for interpreting and generalizing deep learning.</description>
