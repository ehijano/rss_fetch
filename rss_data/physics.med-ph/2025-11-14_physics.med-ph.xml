      <title>GPDM: Generation-Prior Diffusion Model for Accelerated Direct Attenuation and Scatter Correction of Whole-body 18F-FDG PET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate attenuation and scatter corrections are crucial in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging for accurate visual interpretation and quantitative analysis. Traditional methods relying on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have limitations in accuracy, radiation exposure, and applicability. Deep neural networks provide potential approaches to estimating attenuation and scatter-corrected (ASC) PET from non-attenuation and non-scatter-corrected (NASC) PET images based on VAE or CycleGAN. However, the limitations inherent to conventional GAN-based methods, such as unstable training and mode collapse, need further advancements. To address these limitations and achieve more accurate attenuation and scatter corrections, we propose a novel framework for generating high-quality ASC PET images from NASC PET images: Generation-Prior Diffusion Model (GPDM). Our GPDM framework is based on the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), but instead of starting sampling from an entirely different image distribution, it begins from a distribution similar to the target images we aim to generate. This similar distribution is referred to as the Generation-Prior. By leveraging this Generation-Prior, the GPDM framework effectively reduces the number of sampling steps and generates more refined ASC PET images. Our experimental results demonstrate that GPDM outperforms existing methods in generating ASC PET images, achieving superior accuracy while significantly reducing sampling time. These findings highlight the potential of GPDM to address the limitations of conventional methods and establish a new standard for efficient and accurate attenuation and scatter correction in PET imaging.</description>

      <title>Lanthanides-Based Nanoparticles Conjugated with Rose Bengal for FRET-Mediated X-Ray-Induced PDT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to find a good candidate for F{\"o}rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-mediated X-ray-induced photodynamic therapy (X-PDT) for the treatment of cancer, lanthanide (Ln)-based AGuIX nanoparticles (NPs) conjugated with Rose Bengal (RB) as a photosensitizer (PS) were synthesized. X-PDT overcomes the problem of the poor penetration of visible light into tissues, which limits the efficacy of PDT in the treatment of deep-seated tumors. It is essential to optimize FRET efficiency by maximizing the overlap integral between donor emission and acceptor absorption and lengthening the duration of the donor emission. In this study, we optimized energy transfer between a scintillator (Sc) as a donor and a PS as an acceptor. Terbium (Tb) and Gadolinium (Gd) as Scs and Rose RB as a PS were chosen. The study of energy transfer between Tb, Gd and RB in solution and chelated on AGuIX NPs proved to be FRET-like. RB was conjugated directly onto AGuIX NPs (i.e., AGuIX Ln@RB), and the use of a spacer arm (i.e., AGuIX Ln@spacer arm-RB) increased FRET efficiency. Singlet oxygen production by these NPs was observed under UV--visible illumination and X-ray irradiation. The in vitro bioassay demonstrated 52% cell death of U-251MG derived from human malignant glioblastoma multiforme at a concentration of 1 $\mu$M RB after illumination and irradiation (2 Gy, 320 kV, 10 mA, 3 Gy/min at 47 cm). In addition, the RB-coupled NRP-1-targeting peptide (i.e., K(RB)DKPPR) was conjugated onto AGuIX NPs by a thiol-maleimide click chemistry reaction, and an affinity in the nM range was observed.</description>

      <title>An Instrumented Hammer to Detect the Bone Transitions During an High Tibial Osteotomy: An Animal Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High tibial osteotomy is a common procedure for knee osteoarthritis during which the surgeon partially opens the tibia and must stop impacting when cortical bone is reached by the osteotome. Surgeons rely on their proprioception and fluoroscopy to conduct the surgery. Our group has developed an instrumented hammer to assess the mechanical properties of the material surrounding the osteotome tip. The aim of this ex vivo study is to determine whether this hammer can be used to detect the transition from cortical to trabecular bone and vice versa. Osteotomies were performed until rupture in pig tibia using the instrumented hammer. An algorithm was developed to detect both transitions based on the relative variation of an indicator derived from the time variation of the force. The detection by the algorithm of both transitions was compared with the position of the osteotome measured with a video camera and with surgeon proprioception. The difference between the detection of the video and the algorithm (respectively, the video and the surgeon; the surgeon and the algorithm) is 1.0$\pm$1.5 impacts (respectively, 0.5$\pm$0.6 impacts; 1.4$\pm$1.8 impacts), for the detection of the transition from the cortical to trabecular bone. For the transition from the trabecular to cortical bone, the difference is 3.6$\pm$2.6 impacts (respectively, 3.9$\pm$2.4 impacts; 0.8$\pm$0.9 impacts), and the detection by the algorithm was always done before the sample rupture. This ex vivo study demonstrates that this method could prevent impacts leading to hinge rupture.</description>

      <title>Estimation of the surface mechanical properties of soft tissues mimicking phantoms using impact analyses: a comparative study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Palpation is the most widely used approach to empirically assess the mechanical properties of superficial tissues. While elastography is used for volume measurements, it remains difficult to assess skin properties with non-invasive methods. This study aimed to compare the performances of an impact-based analysis method (IBAM) consisting in studying the dynamic response of a punch in contact with the tissue with other approaches available on the market.  Materials and Methods: IBAM consists in analyzing the time dependent force signal induced when a hammer instrumented with a force sensor impacts a cylindrical punch placed in contact with soft tissue. Sensitivities to stiffness changes and to spatial variations were compared between IBAM and four other mechanical surface characterization techniques: IndentoPro (macroindentation), Cutometer (suction), MyotonPro (damped oscillation) and Shore Durometer (durometry) using soft tissue phantoms based on polyurethane gel.  Results: For stiffness discrimination in homogeneous phantoms, IBAM was slightly better than IndentoPro and MyotonPro (by 20 % and 35 % respectively), and outperformed the Shore Durometer and Cutometer by a factor of 2 to 4. Furthermore, for stiffness and thickness variations in bilayer phantoms, the axial sensitivity of IBAM was between 2.5 and 4.5 times better than that of MyotonPro and IndentoPro. In addition, the Cutometer appeared to be severely limited by its measurement depth. Conclusion: IBAM seems to be a promising technique for characterizing the mechanical properties of soft tissue phantoms at relatively low depth after future ex vivo and in vivo validation studies with biological tissues (with both animal and in human experiments). This work could pave the way to the development of a decision support system in the field of dermatology and cosmetics.</description>

      <title>Using an instrumented hammer during Summers osteotomy: an animal model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Summers osteotomy is a technique used to increase bone height and to improve bone density in dental implant surgery. The two main risks of this surgery, which is done by impacting an osteotome in bone tissue, are i) to perforate the sinus membrane and ii) the occurrence of benign paroxysmal vertigo, which are both related to excessive impacts during the osteotomy. Therefore, impacts must be carefully modulated. The aim of this study is to determine whether an instrumented hammer can predict bone damage before the total osteotome protrusion.  35 osteotomies were performed in 9 lamb palate samples using a hammer instrumented with a force sensor to record the variation of the force as a function of time s(t). A signal processing was developed to determine the parameter $\tau$ corresponding to the time between the first two peaks of s(t). A camera was used to determine the impact number for damage: NVideo. The surgeon determined when damage occurred, leading to NSurg. An algorithm was developed to detect bone damage based on the variation of $\tau$ as a function of the impact number, leading to Ncrit. The algorithm was always able to detect bone damage before total protrusion of the osteotome.  We obtained NVideo -NCrit &gt; -2 (respectively NSurg -NCrit &gt; -2) for 97 % (respectively 94 %) of the cases, which indicates the algorithm was almost always able to detect bone damage at most one impact after the video (respectively the surgeon). Our results pave the way to safer Summers osteotomy.</description>

      <title>Impact of friction force and retrieval speed on in silico mechanical thrombectomies: a sensitivity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Mechanical Thrombectomy (MT) is a widely accepted first-line treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) and it has been studied using in vitro and in silico models. Thrombectomy outcomes have been performed for patient-specific cases using in silico models. However, until now, in vivo friction coefficients for stent-vessel, stent-clot, and clot-vessel interactions are unknown, but in vitro experiments have been attempted with significant standard deviations. These interactions and friction coefficients have been considered an important aspect of thrombectomy success. Objectives: In the current study, we explored the influence of variation in friction forces for stent-vessel, stent-clot, and clot-vessel interactions using virtual mechanical thrombectomy (VMT). We have performed three simulations for each interaction and varied friction coefficients around the standard deviation observed in the past in vitro studies. Results: (i) clot-vessel friction: higher friction leads to clot fragmentation and VMT failure. (ii) stent-clot friction: it is susceptible to VMT outcomes, with lower values showing the slippage of the clot while higher values lead to fragmentation. (iii) stent-vessel friction: higher friction shows compression of the stent in curved vessels and dislodgment of clot from stent retriever (SR) due to its compression, which leads to VMT failure. (iv) retrieval speed (RS): higher RS (&gt;30 mm/s) leads to significant stent compression and unrealistic behavior of the SR. Conclusions: Analysis of results proposes the necessity for calculating accurate friction factor values and their implementation into in silico models, due to their sensitivity towards thrombectomy outcomes. Such in silico models mimic in vivo thrombectomy more closely and can be used in mechanical thrombectomy planning, management, and decision-making.</description>
