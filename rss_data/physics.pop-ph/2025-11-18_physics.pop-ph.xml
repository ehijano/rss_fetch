      <title>On the brachistochrone problem for cycling ascents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: VAM (velocit\`a ascensionale media) is a measurement that quantifies a cyclist's climbing ability. We show that -- to minimize the time to attain a given height gain, which is tantamount to maximizing VAM -- a cyclist should climb as steep a constant-grade hill as possible. The limit of steepness is imposed, among others, by such factors as the efficiency of pedalling, which is related -- among others -- to feasible cadence, maintaining balance and preventing skidding of the rear wheel. This article, however, is focused on the primary issue of power available to the cyclist, which can be viewed as a necessary condition to examine other aspects of climbing strategy. We show that -- for given start and end points, and for any fixed average-power constraint -- the brachistochrone, which is the trajectory of minimum ascent time, is the straight line connecting these points, covered with a constant speed, which along such a line is equivalent to a constant power. This is in contrast to the classical solution of a descent brachistochrone under gravity, which is a cycloid along which the speed is not constant.</description>
