      <title>Investigating Strange Stars in Rastall Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the structural formation of various spherically symmetric anisotropic stars within the framework of Rastall theory. To achieve this, we derive modified field equations which are then resolved using the Finch-Skea ansatz, which involve unknown parameters $(A_1,A_2,A_3)$. These parameters are found by using appropriate constraints given by the junction conditions, in addition to observational data from some selected stars. The $\mathbb{EOS}$ given by the $\mathbb{MIT}$ bag model is employed to examine the interior structure and various physical properties of these compact objects. For calculated values of the bag constant $\mathcal{B}$ and two values of the Rastall parameter, $\xi = 0.3, 0.5$, we investigate the regularity and viability of the state variables. Additionally, we analyze stability of the developed model by employing three distinct criteria. We find that the obtained model is stable and provides an accurate approximation for the mass and radius of strange stars when the Rastall parameter $\xi = 0.3$ is considered.</description>

      <title>Cascade Relaxation of the Gravitating Vacuum as a Generator of the Evolving Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cascade relaxation of a polarized vacuum in the expanding Universe is a chain of evolutionary epochs of decreasing its density with the exit of dominant fields (each in its own time) from the initial zero states to nonzero values, from the dominant scalar field in the early Universe to subsequent ones, including the $\Lambda$-term in the modern Universe. The cascade vacuum relaxation creates the entire observable cosmology from the Friedmann model with small perturbations of the metric with non-power-law power spectra from which primordial black holes could have arisen, and gravitational waves over a wide wavenumber range to the formation of dark matter and energy, early galaxies, supermassive black holes, and the large-scale structure of the Universe. An observational model of cascade vacuum relaxation in the early Universe has been build, which contains two constants determined by observational data and does not require information on the potential of the fields. A solution has been obtained for the general relativity vacuum attractor, including, in addition to the two previously mentioned constants, the third constant (not yet limited by observations), which leads to an additional power of density perturbations on a small scale ($k&gt;10\,$Mpc$^{-1}$) in the form of a ``bump'', a two-power-law spectrum, etc.</description>

      <title>Could Planck Star Remnants be Dark Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the end state of gravitational collapse under quantum gravity effects and propose that Planck Star Remnants (PSR), formed via nonsingular bounces, could serve as viable dark matter candidates. Within the framework of Loop Quantum Cosmology, we model the collapse of a homogeneous matter distribution and show that the classical singularity is replaced by a quantum bounce at the Planck density. By analytically matching the Friedmann Lemaitre Robertson Walker (FLRW) interior to an exterior Schwarzschild spacetime using the Israel junction conditions, we demonstrate that the bounce remains causally hidden from external observers, avoiding any observable re-expansion. This naturally leads to the formation of stable, non-radiating PSR, whose radius coincides with the Schwarzschild radius when the black hole mass approaches the Planck mass as a result of Hawking evaporation. We suggest that such remnants may originate from evaporating primordial black holes in the early universe, and estimate the relic abundance needed for PSR to account for the observed dark matter density. We also discuss some crucial differences between PSR and previous proposals of Planck mass relics. The scenario is shown to be consistent with existing astrophysical and cosmological constraints, offering a unified framework connecting quantum gravitational collapse, and the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Eye of the vortex: bound spectra in tunable horizonless rotational analogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog gravity experiments are making remarkable strides in unveiling both the classical and quantum nature of black holes. By harnessing diverse states of matter, contemporary tabletop setups now replicate strong-field phenomena typically confined to the enigmatic regions surrounding black holes. Through these modern gravity simulators, physical processes once considered elusive may finally be brought into experimental reach. In this work, we investigate the bound spectrum of massless scalar excitations propagating within the effective geometry of a rotating acoustic metric. Specifically, we utilize an analog vortex endowed with a tunable parameter that emulates the spacetime of a rotating gravitational background. This model accommodates both the presence of a sonic horizon--characteristic of an acoustic black hole--for non-zero tuning parameters, and its absence when the parameter vanishes, yielding a horizonless, purely rotational vortex flow devoid of radial inflow. We focus on the latter case, where the vortex flow is purely rotational, and compute the spectral properties of the analog system. The resulting bound-state spectrum is found to be qualitatively consistent with that observed in recent experimental realizations of superfluid Helium giant quantum vortices featuring solid or hollow cores. This correspondence suggests that the analog spacetime geometry used here holds significant potential to replicate the phenomenology of cutting-edge laboratory experiments. In doing so, it offers new insight into the intricate landscape of analog black hole spectroscopy and, potentially, the physical topography of bounded, rotating astrophysical environments around black holes.</description>

      <title>Insights in $f(Q)$ cosmology: the relevance of the connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the role of the affine connection in $f(Q)$ gravity, a modified theory where gravity is governed by non-metricity within the symmetric teleparallel framework. Although the connection is constrained to be flat and torsionless, it is not uniquely determined by the metric, allowing for multiple physically distinct formulations. We analyze three such connections compatible with a homogeneous and isotropic universe to show that they yield markedly different cosmological dynamics, even under the same functional form of $f(Q)$. Using both analytical and numerical methods, including a Born-Infeld type model of $f(Q)$, we demonstrate that specific connections can resolve cosmological singularities like the Big Bang and Big Rip, replacing them with smooth de Sitter phases. Others retain singularities but with notable modifications in their behavior. These findings highlight the physical relevance of connection choice in $f(Q)$ gravity and its potential to address fundamental cosmological questions.</description>

      <title>Study of Complexity Factor and Stability of Dynamical Systems in $f(G)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the complexity of the non-static cylindrical geometry with anisotropic matter configuration in the framework of modified Gauss-Bonnet theory. In this perspective, we calculate modified field equations, the C energy formula, and the mass function that helps to understand the astrophysical structures in this modified gravity. Furthermore, we use the Weyl tensor and obtain different structure scalars by orthogonally splitting the Riemann tensor. One of these scalars, $YTF$ is referred to as the complexity factor. This parameter measures the system's complexity due to non-uniform energy density and non-isotropic pressure. We select the identical complexity factor for the structure as used in the non-static scenario while considering the analogous criterion for the most elementary pattern of development. This technique involves formulating structural scalars that illustrate the fundamental features of the system. A fluid distribution that satisfies the vanishing complexity requirement and evolves homologously is characterized as isotropic, geodesic, homogeneous, and shear-free. In the dissipative scenario, the fluid remains geodesic while exhibiting shear, resulting in an extensive array of solutions.</description>

      <title>Axial quasi-normal modes of slowly rotating black holes in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity to second-order in spin and coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the quasi-normal mode (QNM) frequencies of slowly rotating black holes in dynamical Chern-Simons (dCS) gravity, including corrections up to second order in the black hole's dimensionless spin parameter ($\chi$) and second order in the dCS coupling parameter ($\alpha$). Due to the complexities of constructing a Newman-Penrose tetrad at this order, we employ a metric perturbation approach. We derive a system of coupled ordinary differential equations for the primary axial $l$-mode and the polar $l\pm 1$ modes, which is then solved numerically with appropriate ingoing and outgoing wave boundary conditions. Our numerical framework is validated in the General Relativistic limit against known Schwarzschild QNMs and highly accurate Kerr QNM results for $\chi \leq 0.15$. For the fundamental $n=0, l=m=2$ axial mode, we present detailed numerical results illustrating the dependence of QNM frequencies on both $\chi$ and $\alpha$. We observe that while rotation generally increases the damping time, increasing the dCS coupling parameter significantly reduces the damping time of the axial mode. This finding contrasts with previous analytical work on polar modes, which suggested an increase in damping time due to dCS effects, highlighting a crucial parity-dependent difference in how dCS gravity impacts black hole ringdowns. Furthermore, we provide an analytical fitting formula for this mode. These results, incorporating coupled spin and dCS effects at second order, provide more accurate theoretical predictions for testing dCS gravity with gravitational wave observations of black hole ringdowns. The refined QNM calculations are particularly relevant for lower-mass black hole merger events, such as GW230529, where dCS corrections may be more prominent and their distinct damping signatures could be observable.

      <title>Experimental Exclusion of Planetary Mass Primordial Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-mode acoustic gravitational wave experiment (MAGE) is a high-frequency gravitational wave detection experiment featuring cryogenic quartz bulk acoustic wave resonators operating as sensitive strain antennas in the MHz regime. After 61 days of non-continuous data collection, we present bounds on the observable merger rate density of primordial black hole binary systems of chirp mass $1.2\times10^{-4}M_\odot&lt;\mathcal{M}&lt;1.7\times10^{-9}M_\odot$. The maximum achieved limit on the merger rate density is $\mathcal{R}&gt;1.3\times10^{18}~\mathrm{kpc}^{-3}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ which corresponds to constraining yearly mergers to a distance of reach on the order of the solar system, or $1.0\times10^{-6}$ kpc during the observational period. In addition, we exclude significantly rare and strong events similar to those observed in previous predecessor experiments as non-gravitational background signals, utilising coincident analysis between multiple detectors.</description>

      <title>External Attention Transformer: A Robust AI Model for Identifying Initial Eccentricity Signatures in Binary Black Hole Events in Simulated Advanced LIGO Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Initial orbital eccentricities of gravitational wave (GW) events associated with merging binary black holes (BBHs) should provide clues to their formation scenarios, mainly because various BBH formation channels predict distinct eccentricity distributions. However, searching for inspiral GWs from eccentric BBHs is computationally challenging due to sophisticated approaches to model such GW events. This ensures that Bayesian parameter estimation methods to characterize such events are computationally daunting. These considerations influenced us to propose a novel approach to identify and characterize eccentric BBH events in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration data sets that leverages external attention transformer models. Employing simulated data that mimic LIGO O4 run, eccentric inspiral events modeled by an effective-one-body numerical-relativity waveform family, we show the effectiveness of our approach. By integrating this transformer-based framework with a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, we provide efficient way to identify eccentric BBH GW events and accurately characterize their source properties.</description>

      <title>Universal thermodynamic topological classes of static black holes in Conformal Killing Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we develop a universal thermodynamic topological classes for the static black holes in the context of the Conformal Killing Gravity. Our findings indicate that the Conformal Killing Gravity significantly reconstructs the thermodynamic properties of both the smallest inner black hole state and the largest outer black hole state. Additionally, it considerably alters the thermodynamic stability of black holes across both high-temperature and low-temperature regimes. This analysis shows that different CKG parameter settings will lead to $W^{0+}$ $(\lambda&gt;0)$ and $W^{1+}$ $(\lambda&lt;0)$ classes of the charged AdS black hole, the Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m black hole in Conformal Killing Gravity is classified into the $W^{0+}$ and $W^{1+}$ categories. Furthermore, we examine the specific scenario where charge is neglected. The study reveals that within the framework of Conformal Killing Gravity, the Schwarzschild black hole similar to the Schwarzschild AdS black hole, can be classified into the $W^{1-}$ and $W^{0-}$ categories. This work provides key insights into the fundamental nature of quantum gravity theory.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Collapse: Generalizing Oppenheimer-Snyder and a Conjecture on Horizon Formation Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the Oppenheimer-Snyder model of gravitational collapse by considering a broader class of static, spherically symmetric exterior spacetimes, with an interior geometry described by a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) geometry. Using Painleve-Gullstrand (PG) coordinates for the spatially flat interior geometry (k=0) and a Novikov-like coordinate system for the spatially closed geometry (k=1), we ensured a smooth transition between the interior and exterior of the collapsing star. By providing general formulas, we analyzed how apparent and event horizons form during the collapse and checked whether the matter satisfies standard energy conditions. For both k=0 and k=1 cases, we studied explicit examples such as Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild-AdS/dS, and Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) black holes, taking into account the effects of the cosmological constant and electric charge. These factors significantly influence the collapse process and can impose constraints on the physical parameters. Our analysis leads to two important results: First, to form a black hole, there is a minimum or critical initial radius for the star to begin collapsing. Second, we propose a conjecture of an inequality regarding the event horizon formation time, starting from the critical radius, namely Delta T_eh &lt;= 19M/6. The upper bound is saturated by the Schwarzschild black hole.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Dynamics of Accelerating Model in $f(T)$ Gravity with Special Form of Deceleration Parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the dynamical behavior of the accelerated expansion of the universe is discussed within the framework of $f(T)$ gravity for a particular form of $ f(T)=\alpha (-T)^{n}$. Considering a redshift-dependent parameterization of the deceleration parameter as $q(z)=q_{0}+ q_{1}\left(\frac{ \ln(N+z)}{z+1}-\ln N \right)$. We have derived the Hubble parameter in terms of redshift and discussed its effect on other cosmological parameters. Using Bayesian statistical analysis and $\chi^2$-minimization, the median values of the model parameters for both the cosmic chronometer and the combined (CC + Pantheon) dataset have been determined. Further, energy density, pressure, the equation of state for Dark Energy and statefinder diagnostics are analyzed. The current age of the universe is also computed for this model.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss recent progress in the study of entanglement within cosmological frameworks, focusing on both momentum and position-space approaches and also reviewing the possibility to directly extract entanglement from quantum fields. Entanglement generation in expanding spacetimes can be traced back to the phenomenon of gravitational particle production, according to which the background gravitational field may transfer energy and momentum to quantum fields. The corresponding entanglement amount and its mode dependence are both sensitive to the field statistics and to the details of spacetime expansion, thus encoding information about the background. Gravitational production processes also play a key role in addressing the quantum-to-classical transition of cosmological perturbations. In order to directly extract entanglement from quantum fields, local interactions with additional quantum systems, working as detectors, have been suggested, leading to the formulation of the entanglement harvesting protocol. Despite harvesting procedures are currently unfeasible from an experimental point of view, various proposals for implementation exist and a proper modeling of detectors and local interactions is crucial to address entanglement extraction via realistic setups. In the final part of the work, we address entanglement characterization in position space, primarily focusing on black hole spacetimes. We first investigate a possible interpretation of Bekenstein-Hawking black hole entropy in terms of the entanglement entropy arising in discrete quantum field theories, on account of the area law. Then, we discuss the resolution of the black hole information paradox via the gravitational fine-grained entropy formula, which provides a new way to compute the entropy of Hawking radiation and allows to preserve unitarity in black hole evaporation processes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03843</link>

Abstract: We obtain the equations of motion for compact binary systems (black holes or neutron stars) in an alternative theory of gravity known as Einstein-AEther theory, which supplements the standard spacetime metric with a timelike four-vector (the AEther field) that is constrained to have unit norm. The equations make use of solutions obtained in Paper I for the gravitational and AEther field potentials within the near zone of the system, evaluated to 2.5 post-Newtonian (PN) order ($O(v/c)^5$ beyond Newtonian gravity), sufficient to obtain the effects of gravitational radiation reaction to the same order as the quadrupole approximation of general relativity. Those potentials were derived by applying the post-Minkowskian method to the field equations of the theory. Using a modified geodesic equation that is a consequence of the effects of the interaction between the AEther field and the internal strong-gravity fields of the compact bodies, we obtain explicit equations of motion in terms of the positions and velocities of the bodies, focussing on the radiation-reaction terms that contribute at 1.5PN and 2.5PN orders. We obtain the rate of energy loss by the system, including the effects of dipole gravitational radiation (conventionally denoted $-1$PN order) and the analogue of quadrupole radiation (denoted $0$PN order). We find significant disagreements with published results, based on calculating the energy flux in the far zone using a ``Noether current'' construction.</description>

      <title>Stochastic inflation as a superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out that inflationary superhorizon fluctuations can be effectively described by a set of equations analogous to those governing a superfluid. This is achieved through a functional Schr\"odinger approach to the evolution of the inflationary wavefunction, combined with a suitable coarse-graining procedure to capture large-scale dynamics. The irrotational fluid velocity is proportional to the gradient of the wavefunction phase. Marginalizing over short superhorizon modes introduces an external force acting on the fluid velocity. The quantum pressure characteristic of the superfluid plays a role in scenarios involving an ultra-slow-roll phase of inflation. Our superfluid framework is consistent with the standard Starobinsky approach to stochastic inflation while offering complementary insights, particularly by providing more precise information on the phase of the inflationary wavefunction. We also discuss a heuristic approach to include dissipative effects in this description.</description>

      <title>Affine connections for Galilean and Carrollian structures: a unified perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a classification of general Carrollian structures, permitting affine connections with both torsion and non-metricity. We compare with a recent classification of general Galilean structures in order to present a unified perspective on both. Moreover, we demonstrate how both sets of structures emerge from the most general possible Lorentzian structures in their respective limits, and we highlight the role of global hyperbolicity in constraining both structures. We then leverage this work in order to construct for the first time an ultra-relativistic geometric trinity of gravitational theories, and consider connections which are simultaneously compatible with Galilean and Carrollian structures. We close by outlining a number of open questions and future prospects.</description>

      <title>Parity violation in photon quasinormal modes of black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given that black holes are ubiquitous in the universe and axion-like scalar fields are potential candidates for dark energy and/or dark matter, it is natural to consider cosmological black holes endowed with axion hair. We investigate the photon quasinormal modes of a Schwarzschild black hole with axion hair where the electromagnetic field is coupled to the axion field via a Chern-Simons interaction. We derive the master equations for the electromagnetic field as a set of coupled equations for parity-even and parity-odd modes and numerically compute quasinormal modes by using Leaver's continued fraction method. We find parity violation in the polarization of photons within the quasinormal mode spectrum. This parity violation in electromagnetic signals could serve as a new probe to explore the nature of the dark sector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new coherent state expansion of the exponential representation of the S-matrix for the classical gravitational two-body problem. By combining the Kosower-Maybee-O'Connell (KMOC) formalism with the Dirac bracket structure emerging in the classical limit, we derive compact and gauge-invariant expressions for scattering observables in the presence of radiation. This causal formulation bypasses the calculation of KMOC cuts and provides a direct link between observables and a minimal set of classical matrix elements extracted from amplitudes. We illustrate our method with several examples, including the impulse, spin kick, angular momentum, waveform and the related radiative fluxes. Finally, using our formalism we evaluate for the first time the spin kick and the change in angular momentum of each particle up to $\mathcal{O}(G^2 s_1^{j_1} s_2^{j_2})$ with $j_1+ j_2 \leq 11$.</description>

      <title>Orbital angular momentum can take non-integer values in a closed universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the spectrum of orbital angular momentum in quantum mechanics consists of two parts when the underlying space has periodic boundaries. While the first part consists of the usual textbook integer quantized values, the second is a continuous band arising from regions at the `edge' of space with respect to the center of rotation. The spectrum thus contains not only half-integer values, previously thought impossible for orbital angular momentum, but even irrational ones. Remarkably, this effect is independent of the size of space. While these spectral components remain undetectable in laboratory experiments, they could still produce observable effects on cosmological scales, for instance in the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of quantum coherence and quantum correlations in a two-particle system with deformed symmetries arising from the quantum nature of spacetime. We demonstrate that the deformation of energy-momentum composition induces a momentum-dependent interaction that counteracts the decoherence effects described by the Lindblad equation in quantum spacetime. This interplay leads to the formation of coherence, entanglement and other correlations, which we quantify using concurrence, the $l_1$-norm of coherence, quantum discord and Local Quantum Fisher Information. Our analysis reveals that while the openness of quantum spacetime ultimately degrades entanglement, it also facilitates the creation and preservation of both classical and quantum correlations.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Baryon Fraction in the Intergalactic Medium with 92 localized Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are emerging as powerful cosmological probes for constraining the baryon fraction in the intergalactic medium (IGM), offering a promising avenue to address the missing baryon problem. In this paper, we analyze constraints on the IGM baryon fraction ($f_\mathrm{IGM}$) using 92 localized FRBs, incorporating a corrected probability distribution function for the IGM dispersion measure within three different cosmological models. We find that variations in the underlying cosmological model have a negligible impact on the inferred values of $f_\mathrm{IGM}$. While the NE2001 Galactic electron density model yields slightly higher $f_\mathrm{IGM}$ values compared to the YMW16 model, the results are consistent within the 1$\sigma$ confidence level. Additionally, there is no statistically significant evidence for redshift evolution in $f_\mathrm{IGM}$. Our analysis constrains $f_\mathrm{IGM}$ to the range $0.8 \sim 0.9$, providing strong support for the idea in which the majority of the missing baryons reside in the diffuse IGM.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae with no electromagnetic counterparts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are regularly observed electromagnetically, prompting targetted searches for their gravitational-wave emission. However, there are scenarios where these powerful explosions may not have any observable electromagnetic signal, but would still have strong detectable emission in gravitational waves and neutrinos. A regular CCSN explosion may be obscured by matter in the Galaxy. A star may undergo a failed CCSN explosion, where the stalled shockwave is not revived, and would eventually form a black hole. Higher mass progenitor stars may revive the shock, but form a black hole too quickly for the shockwave to reach the surface of the star and produce an electromagnetic signal. Previous work has shown that we can determine if a black hole forms from the CCSN neutrino emission if there are long duration sinusoidal modulations in the neutrino signal caused by the standing accretion shock instability (SASI). The SASI also produces an observable signature in the gravitational-wave emission. In this paper, we investigate if we can distinguish between different scenarios for electromagnetically dark CCSNe using the gravitational-wave emission alone. We find, using a reconstruction of the SASI mode, abrupt end times of the gravitational-wave emission, and the rate of change of frequency of the dominant mode, that we are able to accurately distinguish between an obscured CCSN, a failed CCSN, and an explosion with fast black hole formation.</description>

Abstract: We study the essential renormalization group equation, in which inessential couplings are removed via field redefinitions, for Einstein gravity coupled to a massive scalar field in the presence of a cosmological constant. Our results indicate that perturbatively nonrenormalizable terms can be eliminated due to the cosmological term, in contrast to the case of perturbation around flat spacetime. We find a nontrivial fixed point for the Newton coupling and the cosmological term.</description>

      <title>Test of conformal gravity as an alternative to dark matter from the observations of elliptical galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an alternative gravitational theory to General Relativity (GR), the Conformal Gravity (CG) has recently been successfully verified by observations of Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) and the rotation curves of spiral galaxies. The observations of galaxies only pertain to the non-relativistic form of gravity. In this context, within the framework of the Newtonian theory of gravity (the non-relativistic form of GR), dark matter is postulated to account for the observations. On the other hand, the non-relativistic form of CG predicts an additional potential: besides the Newtonian potential, there is a so-called linear potential term, characterized by the parameter $\gamma^*$, as an alternative to dark matter in Newtonian gravity. To test CG in its non-relativistic form, much work has been done by fitting the predictions to the observations of circular velocity (rotation curves) for spiral galaxies. In this paper, we test CG with the observations from elliptical galaxies. Instead of the circular velocities for spiral galaxies, we use the velocity dispersion for elliptical galaxies. By replacing the Newtonian potential with that predicted by non-relativistic form of CG in Hamiltonian, we directly extend the Jeans equation derived in Newtonian theory to that for CG. By comparing the results derived from the ellipticals with that from spirals, we find that the extra potential predicted by CG is not sufficient to account for the observations of ellipticals. Furthermore, we discover a strong correlation between $\gamma^*$ and the stellar mass $M^*$ in dwarf spheroidal galaxies. This finding implies that the variation in $\gamma^*$ violates a fundamental prediction of Conformal Gravity (CG), which posits that $\gamma^*$ should be a universal constant.</description>

      <title>Stability and quasinormal modes for black holes with time-dependent scalar hair</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate black hole solutions with time-dependent (scalar) hair in scalar-tensor theories. Known exact solutions exist for such theories at the background level, where the metric takes on a standard GR form (e.g. Schwarzschild-de Sitter), but these solutions are generically plagued by instabilities. Recently, a new such solution was identified in arXiv:2310.11919, in which the time-dependent scalar background profile is qualitatively different from previous known exact solutions - specifically, the canonical kinetic term for the background scalar $X$ is not constant in this solution. We investigate the stability of this new solution by analysing odd parity perturbations, identifying a bound placed by stability and the resulting surviving parameter space. We extract the quasinormal mode spectrum predicted by the theory, finding a generic positive shift of quasinormal mode frequencies and damping times compared to GR. We forecast constraints on these shifts (and the single effective parameter $\hat\beta$ controlling them) from current and future gravitational wave experiments, finding constraints at up to the ${\cal O}(10^{-2})$ and ${\cal O}(10^{-6})$ level for LVK and LISA/TianQin, respectively. All calculations performed in this paper are reproducible via a companion Mathematica notebook.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher-order gravitational wave modes from quasi-circular, spinning, non-precessing binary black hole mergers encode key information about these systems' nonlinear dynamics. We model these waveforms using transformer architectures, targeting the evolution from late inspiral through ringdown. Our data is derived from the \texttt{NRHybSur3dq8} surrogate model, which includes spherical harmonic modes up to $\ell \leq 4$ (excluding $(4,0)$, $(4,\pm1)$ and including $(5,5)$ modes). These waveforms span mass ratios $q \leq 8$, spin components $s^z_{{1,2}} \in [-0.8, 0.8]$, and inclination angles $\theta \in [0, \pi]$. The model processes input data over the time interval $t \in [-5000\textrm{M}, -100\textrm{M})$ and generates predictions for the plus and cross polarizations, $(h_{+}, h_{\times})$, over the interval $t \in [-100\textrm{M}, 130\textrm{M}]$. Utilizing 16 NVIDIA A100 GPUs on the Delta supercomputer, we trained the transformer model in 15 hours on over 14 million samples. The model's performance was evaluated on a test dataset of 840,000 samples, achieving mean and median overlap scores of 0.996 and 0.997, respectively, relative to the surrogate-based ground truth signals. We further benchmark the model on numerical relativity waveforms from the SXS catalog, finding that it generalizes well to out-of-distribution systems, capable of reproducing the dynamics of systems with mass ratios up to $q=15$ and spin magnitudes up to 0.998, with a median overlap of 0.969 across 521 NR waveforms and up to 0.998 in face-on/off configurations. These results demonstrate that transformer-based models can capture the nonlinear dynamics of binary black hole mergers with high accuracy, even outside the surrogate training domain, enabling fast sequence modeling of higher-order wave modes.</description>

      <title>Do maximally entangled states always have an advantage over non-maximally entangled states in Schwarzschild black hole?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is generally believed that quantum entanglement in the maximally entangled states is greater than quantum entanglement in the non-maximally entangled states under a relativistic setting. In this paper, we study quantum entanglement for four different types of Bell-like states of the fermionic modes near the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. It is interesting to find that quantum entanglement in the maximally entangled states is less than quantum entanglement in the non-maximally entangled states in Schwarzschild spacetime. From the perspective of quantum resources, the non-maximally entangled states may have more advantages in curved spacetime compared to the maximally entangled states. This is obviously different from the conclusions in previous paper. For two types of Bell-like states, quantum entanglement suffers sudden death under the Hawking effect of the black hole, and for the other two types of Bell-like states, quantum entanglement can exist forever regardless of the Hawking temperature. Therefore, we should choose appropriate types of Bell-like states to handle relativistic quantum information tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a canonical model of spherical gravity with covariant corrections motivated by loop quantum gravity. The effective Hamiltonian defines univocally a family of geometries that generalizes the Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi spacetimes, and they can be matched to the vacuum of the theory across a timelike hypersurface comoving with the flow of matter. Such is precisely the complete spacetime picture of a spherical star subject to its own gravitational pull. The singularity gets replaced with a spacelike boundary in the trapped region of spacetime, where the curvature remains finite, and the area of the orbits of the spherical symmetry group attains its infimum. Observers falling into the black hole are doomed to travel forever towards this boundary without ever reaching it. The theory also predicts the formation of stable black-hole remnants of Planckian mass.</description>

In the small mass ratio expansion, post-adiabatic inspirals have been modeled up to the separatrix, where first-principle modeling currently ends. In this paper, we derive the analytic late time solution to the adiabatic inspiral in terms of self-force coefficients at the separatrix. We identify the role of the Lambert $W_{-1}$ function as a key mathematical ingredient in the approach to the separatrix.</description>

      <title>Bekenstein bounds in maximally symmetric nonlinear electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore dynamical features of the maximally symmetric nonlinear extension of classical electromagnetism, recently proposed in the literature as ``ModMax'' electrodynamics. This family of theories is the only one that preserves all the symmetries of Maxwell's theory, having applications in the study of regular black hole solutions and supersymmetry. The purpose of this article is three-fold. Firstly, we study the initial-value problem of ModMax and show, by means of a simple geometric criterion, that such a theory admits a well-posed formulation. Secondly, we prove a series of geometric inequalities relating energy, charge, angular momentum, and size in ModMax. The validity of these bounds gives strong evidence of an universal inequality conjectured by Bekenstein for macroscopic systems. Finally, we perform the first stable numerical simulations of ModMax in the highly nonlinear regime. We apply our simulations for verifying an inequality between energy, size and angular momentum in bounded domains, and for showing birefringence as a function of the nonlinear parameter, comparing with other nonlinear nonlinear extensions.</description>

      <title>Global monopole in a Ricci-coupled Kalb-Ramond bumblebee gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17267v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate black hole solutions in Einstein-Kalb-Ramond (EKR) bumblebee gravity sourced by a global monopole characterized by the charge $\eta$. This modified theory of gravity possesses the notable feature of incorporating local Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) via a spontaneous symmetry-breaking mechanism. We solve the field equations for a static and spherically symmetric metric with the Kalb-Ramond (KR) field fixed at its VEV, thereby obtaining new black hole solutions. These solutions simultaneously exhibit the LSB effects, codified by the $\gamma$ parameter, and the global monopole effects, codified by the charge $\eta$. Next, we study the impact of the global monopole and LSB corrections on two classical tests, namely, the advance of Mercury's perihelion and the light deflection. Furthermore, we compute the Hawking temperature, black hole shadows, and greybody factors. Ultimately, we estimate an upper bound for $\eta$ by comparing the theoretical results provided by the EKR model with observational data from the advance of Mercury's perihelion and light deflection.</description>

      <title>Inverting no-hair theorems: How requiring General Relativity solutions restricts scalar-tensor theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black hole solutions in general scalar-tensor theories are known to permit hair, i.e. non-trivial scalar profiles and/or metric solutions different from the ones of General Relativity (GR). Imposing that some such solutions$\unicode{x2013}$e.g. Schwarzschild or de Sitter solutions motivated in the context of black hole physics or cosmology$\unicode{x2013}$should exist, the space of scalar-tensor theories is strongly restricted. Here we investigate precisely what these restrictions are within general quadratic/cubic higher-order scalar-tensor theories for stealth solutions, whose metric is given by that in GR, supporting time-dependent scalar hair with a constant kinetic term. We derive, in a fully covariant approach, the conditions under which the Euler-Lagrange equations admit all (or a specific set of) exact GR solutions, as the first step toward our understanding of a wider class of theories that admit approximately stealth solutions. Focusing on static and spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes, we study the dynamics of linear odd-parity perturbations and discuss possible deviations from GR. Importantly, we find that requiring the existence of all stealth solutions prevents any deviations from GR in the odd-parity sector. In less restrictive scenarios, in particular for theories only requiring the existence of Schwarzschild(-de Sitter) black holes, we identify allowed deviations from GR, derive the stability conditions for the odd modes, and investigate the generic deviation of a non-trivial speed of gravitational waves. All calculations performed in this paper are reproducible via companion $\texttt {Mathematica}$ notebooks.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes and excitation factors of Kerr black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical understanding of the characteristic oscillations of a perturbed black hole, also referred to as quasinormal modes (QNMs), is crucial to interpreting the late stage of binary black hole mergers that we now routinely observe in gravitational wave detectors. In this work, we introduce a new approach, based on the generalized Sasaki-Nakamura formalism, to compute the QNM spectra and their excitation factors (QNEFs), for scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations. Using this approach, QNM wavefunctions remain finite at the horizon and spatial infinity. Our results in general agree with previous calculations that were performed using different methods, though we further clarify that QNEFs and their scaling with the mass of the black hole depend on the spin-weight of the perturbation. We show that avoided crossing is not a general phenomenon: the real or the imaginary part of the eigenvalues can cross each other but not both simultaneously, and when crossing occurs in one part, repulsion follows in the another part. Eigenvalue repulsion, originating from branch point singularities, still plays an important role in the QNM spectra, despite the fact that the spectra depend only on the real-valued black hole angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Imprints of extra dimensions in eccentric extreme-mass-ratio inspirals gravitational waveforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09460v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studies regarding extra-dimensions have been of great interest in modern theoretical physics, including their observational consequences from future gravitational wave (GW) observatories. In this direction, extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), attracting considerable interest in GW astronomy and fundamental physics, can potentially provide a useful platform for the search of extra dimensions. In this paper, we examine a rotating braneworld black hole in the context of equatorial eccentric EMRI and attempt to provide an order of magnitude analysis for the extra-dimensional parameter termed "tidal charge". We estimate GW fluxes for the dominant mode and determine the impact of the tidal charge parameter on the orbital evolution. We further evaluate the prospects of detecting such a parameter through mismatch computation. We observe a significant enhancement in the mismatch as the value of orbital eccentricity or tidal charge parameter increases; the phenomenon becomes more obvious for rapidly rotating massive black holes. Thus, the study suggests that eccentric EMRI can potentially probe the existence of extra dimensions with future low-frequency detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).</description>

      <title>Torsional Regularization of Self-Energy and Bare Mass of Electron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.01612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the presence of spacetime torsion, the momentum components do not commute; therefore, in quantum field theory, summation over the momentum eigenvalues will replace integration over the momentum. In the Einstein--Cartan theory of gravity, in which torsion is coupled to spin, the separation between the eigenvalues increases with the magnitude of the momentum. Consequently, this replacement regularizes divergent integrals in Feynman diagrams with loops by turning them into convergent sums. In this article, we apply torsional regularization to the self-energy of a charged lepton in quantum electrodynamics. We show that torsion eliminates the ultraviolet divergence of the standard self-energy. We also show that the infrared divergence is absent. In the end, we calculate the finite bare masses of the electron, muon, and tau lepton: $0.4329\,\mbox{MeV}$, $90.95\,\mbox{MeV}$, and $1543\,\mbox{MeV}$, respectively. These values constitute about $85\%$ of the observed, re-normalized masses.</description>

      <title>Stability of domain walls with inflationary fluctuations under potential bias, and gravitational wave signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent study has shown that domain walls with inflationary initial fluctuations exhibit remarkable stability against population bias due to long-range correlations, challenging the claims of prior research. In this paper, we study the dynamics of these domain walls in the presence of potential bias and show that they collapse with a lifetime several times longer than that due to thermal fluctuations. This is interpreted as a difference in the average distance between domain walls, leading us to derive a new formula for the domain wall lifetime which depends on the area parameter in a qualitatively different way from previous studies. In addition, we compute the spectrum of gravitational waves generated by such domain walls and find that both the peak frequency and the peak abundance are lowered in a manner that depends on the area parameter. Based on these findings, we also determine the necessary degree of vacuum degeneracy for axion domain walls to explain the isotropic cosmic birefringence.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity from Weyl conformal geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review recent developments in physical implications of Weyl conformal geometry. The associated Weyl quadratic gravity action is a gauge theory of the Weyl group of dilatations and Poincar\'e symmetry. Weyl conformal geometry is defined by equivalence classes of the metric and Weyl gauge field ($\omega_\mu$), related by Weyl gauge transformations. Weyl geometry can be seen as a covariantised version of Riemannian geometry with respect to Weyl gauge symmetry (of dilatations). This Weyl gauge-covariant formulation of Weyl geometry is metric, which avoids century-old criticisms on the physical relevance of this geometry, that ignored its gauge symmetry. Weyl quadratic gravity and its geometry have interesting properties: a) Weyl gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken and Einstein-Hilbert gravity and Riemannian geometry are recovered, with $\Lambda&gt;0$; b) this is the only true gauge theory of a space-time symmetry i.e. with a physical (Weyl) gauge boson ($\omega_\mu$); c) all fields and masses have geometric origin (with no added scalar fields); d) the theory has a Weyl gauge invariant geometric regularisation (by $\hat R$) in $d$ dimensions and it is Weyl-anomaly free; this anomaly is recovered in the broken phase after massive $\omega_\mu$ decouples; e) the theory is the leading order of the general Weyl gauge invariant Dirac-Born-Infeld (WDBI) action of Weyl conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions; f) in the limit of vanishing Weyl gauge current, one obtains conformal gravity; g) finally, Standard Model (SM) has a natural embedding in conformal geometry with no new degrees of freedom, with successful Starobinsky-Higgs inflation. Briefly, Weyl conformal geometry generates a (quantum) gauge theory of gravity, given by Weyl quadratic gravity, and leads to a unified description, by the gauge principle, of Einstein-Hilbert gravity and SM interactions.</description>

      <title>Extended $\delta N$ formalism: Nonspatially Flat Separate Universe Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\delta N$ formalism is a powerful approach to compute non-linearly the large-scale evolution of the comoving curvature perturbation $\zeta$. It assumes a set of FLRW patches that evolve independently, but in doing so, all the gradient terms are discarded, which are not negligibly small in models beyond slow-roll. In this Letter, we extend the formalism to capture these gradient corrections by encoding them in a homogeneous-spatial-curvature contribution assigned to each FLRW patch. For a concrete example, we apply this formalism to the ultra-slow-roll inflation, and find that it can correctly describe the large-scale evolution of the comoving curvature perturbation from the horizon exit. We also briefly discuss non-Gaussianities in this context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03612v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the presence of primordial gravitational vector modes (V-modes) and their sourcing of primordial magnetic fields (PMF), i.e. magnetogenesis. As the adiabatic vector mode generically decays with expansion, we consider exotic initial conditions which circumvent this issue and lead to observational imprints. The first initial condition is an isocurvature mode between photons and neutrinos vorticities, and the second one is a non-trivial initial condition on the neutrino octupole. Both types of conditions sustain a constant vector mode on super Hubble scales at early times. We also consider a third scenario in which the adiabatic vector modes are rapidly sourced, at a given early but finite time, by an exotic component which develops an anisotropic stress. We find the best fitting parameters in these three cases to CMB and BAO data. We compare the resulting $B$-mode spectra of the CMB to data from BICEP/Keck and SPTpol. We find that none of the proposed initial conditions can produce large enough PMFs to seed every type of magnetic fields observed. However, V-modes are still consistent with the data and ought to be constrained for a better understanding of the primordial Universe before its hot big-bang phase.</description>

      <title>Inferring jet physics from neutron star - black hole mergers with gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron star - black hole (NSBH) mergers that undergo tidal disruption may launch jets that could power a gamma-ray burst. We use a population of simulated NSBH systems to measure jet parameters from the gravitational waves emitted by these systems. The conditions during the tidal disruption and merger phase required to power a gamma-ray burst are uncertain. It is likely that the system must achieve some minimum remnant baryonic mass after the merger before a jet can be launched to power a gamma-ray burst. Assuming a fiducial neutron star equation of state, we show how Bayesian hierarchical inference can be used to infer the minimum remnant mass required to launch a gamma-ray burst jet as well as the maximum gamma-ray burst viewing angle to detect a gamma-ray burst. We find that with 200 NSBH observations, we can measure the minimum disk mass to within 0.01 solar masses at 90% credibility. We simultaneously infer the maximum gamma-ray burst viewing angle to within 13 degrees at 90% credibility. We conclude that upcoming upgrades to the LIGO observatories may provide important new insights into the physics of NSBH jets.</description>

      <title>Galaxy infall models for arbitrary velocity directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13149v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For most galaxies in the cosmos, our knowledge of their motion is limited to line-of-sight velocities from redshift observations. To determine the radial velocity between two galaxies the minor and major infall models were established by Karachentsev &amp; Kashibadze (2006). Regardless of the background cosmology, our derivations reveal that these infall models approximate the total radial velocity between two galaxies by two different projections employing different information about the system. For galaxies having small angular separations $\theta$, all infall models agree that the radial velocity is the difference of their line-of-sight components. Applying these models to ca. $500$ halos of the Illustris-3 simulation, we find the perpendicular and tangential velocity parts to be non-negligible for more than 90% of all, more than 5000 infalling subhalos. Thus, even for $\theta &lt; 10$ deg, the infall-model velocities deviate from the true radial velocity. Only for 30% we found the true one lay between the minor and major infall velocity. However, the infall models yield robust upper and lower bounds to the true radial velocity dispersion. Observed under $\theta &lt; 10$ deg the velocity dispersion inferred from the sole difference of line-of-sight velocity components even coincides with the true one, justifying this approach for high-redshift groups and clusters. Based on these findings, we predict the radial velocity dispersion of the M81-group from the minor infall model (upper bound) $\sigma_{\mathrm{r,min}} = (180 \pm 42)~\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}$, from the major infall model (lower bound) $\sigma_{\mathrm{r,maj}} = (142 \pm 64) ~\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}$ and $\sigma_\mathrm{r,\Delta v} = (99 \pm 36)~\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}$ from the line-of-sight-velocity difference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the null geodesic equation for photons is modified in the presence of a charged scalar field, with quantum fluctuations acting as an effective mass term that changes the null paths to timelike curves. This effect can be interpreted as a vacuum polarization phenomenon in curved spacetime. The resulting contribution to the Sachs-Wolfe effect varies with photon frequency, leading to frequency-dependent corrections to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) blackbody spectrum in the form of a $\mu$-distortion, as well as modifications to the CMB power spectrum. We estimate these within a standard inflationary scenario and find that while the correction to the CMB power spectrum is significant when the scalar field is light, the magnitude of the $\mu$-distortion depends strongly on the regularization prescription.</description>

Abstract: Primordial power spectra with low power at long wavelengths can alleviate lensing anomaly. However the extent to which data favours such a primordial spectra is not clear. In this work, we investigate power suppression and related mitigation of lensing anomaly with the help of phenomenological models which are valid over scales of interest. We consider simple extensions to nearly scale invariant power spectra such as those which includes running and running of running of spectral index. We perform Bayesian analysis of these models, which are agnostic about power suppression, with Planck legacy data and show that data tend to choose parameters which leads to power suppression at low multipoles. We then investigate the connection between power suppression and alleviation of lensing anomaly and show that lensing anomaly is mitigated the most in models with maximum suppression of power at low multipoles. We also analyse the significance of these findings using information criteria. These results are further analyzed in the light of Planck Release 4 data using \texttt{CamSpec}, \texttt{HiLLiPoP} and \texttt{LoLLiPoP} likelihoods in which departure of lensing parameter from one is significantly reduced. Furthermore, we investigate the ability of near-ultimate future CMB missions such as ECHO to put tighter constraints on these models and to settle the issue. We conclude that we can make stronger conclusions about the presence of power suppression in the future by studying such simple phenomenological models.</description>
