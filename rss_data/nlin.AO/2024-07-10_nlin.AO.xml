      <title>Bounded confidence modeling predicts how group work affects student math anxiety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Math anxiety is ubiquitous. It not only affects student performance and confidence, but also can lead to avoidance of further math/STEM classes and careers. Cooperative learning (i.e., group work) is a proven strategy that can reduce math anxiety and has additional social and pedagogical benefits. However, depending on the individuals involved, some peer interactions may mitigate anxiety while others exacerbate it. Mathematical modeling is one approach to help untangle this complex dynamic. In this work we introduce a bounded confidence model to evaluate how math anxiety levels are affected by student group work. Although the model is quite simple, it captures non-obvious phenomena including how varying group sizes and frequency of switching groups can affect anxiety levels. The model is easily adaptable to incorporate additional personal and societal factors making it ripe for future research.</description>

      <title>Structural dynamics of plant-pollinator mutualistic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.09191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discourse surrounding the structural organization of mutualistic interactions mostly revolves around modularity and nestedness. The former is known to enhance the stability of communities, while the latter is related to their feasibility, albeit compromising the stability. However, it has recently been shown that the joint emergence of these structures poses challenges that can eventually lead to limitations in the dynamic properties of mutualistic communities. We hypothesize that considering compound arrangements -- modules with internal nested organization -- can offer valuable insights in this debate. We analyze the temporal structural dynamics of 20 plant-pollinator interaction networks and observe large structural variability throughout the year. Compound structures are particularly prevalent during the peak of the pollination season, often coexisting with nested and modular arrangements in varying degrees. Motivated by these empirical findings, we synthetically investigate the dynamics of the structural patterns across two control parameters -- community size and connectance levels -- mimicking the progression of the pollination season. Our analysis reveals contrasting impacts on the stability and feasibility of these mutualistic communities. We characterize the consistent relationship between network structure and stability, which follows a monotonic pattern. But, in terms of feasibility, we observe non-linear relationships. Compound structures exhibit a favorable balance between stability and feasibility, particularly in mid-sized ecological communities, suggesting they may effectively navigate the simultaneous requirements of stability and feasibility. These findings may indicate that the assembly process of mutualistic communities is driven by a delicate balance among multiple properties, rather than the dominance of a single one.</description>
