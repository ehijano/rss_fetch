      <title>A Markov approach to credit rating migration conditional on economic states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a model for credit rating migration that accounts for the impact of economic state fluctuations on default probabilities. The joint process for the economic state and the rating is modelled as a time-homogeneous Markov chain. While the rating process itself possesses the Markov property only under restrictive conditions, methods from Markov theory can be used to derive the rating process' asymptotic behaviour. We use the mathematical framework to formalise and analyse different rating philosophies, such as point-in-time (PIT) and through-the-cycle (TTC) ratings. Furthermore, we introduce stochastic orders on the bivariate process' transition matrix to establish a consistent notion of "better" and "worse" ratings. Finally, the construction of PIT and TTC ratings is illustrated on a Merton-type firm-value process.</description>

      <title>Stochastic PDEs for large portfolios with general mean-reverting volatility processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05898</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.05898v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a structural stochastic volatility model for the loss from a large portfolio of credit risky assets. Both the asset value and the volatility processes are correlated through systemic Brownian motions, with default determined by the asset value reaching a lower boundary. We prove that if our volatility models are picked from a class of mean-reverting diffusions, the system converges as the portfolio becomes large and, when the vol-of-vol function satisfies certain regularity and boundedness conditions, the limit of the empirical measure process has a density given in terms of a solution to a stochastic initial-boundary value problem on a half-space. The problem is defined in a special weighted Sobolev space. Regularity results are established for solutions to this problem, and then we show that there exists a unique solution. In contrast to the CIR volatility setting covered by the existing literature, our results hold even when the systemic Brownian motions are taken to be correlated.</description>
