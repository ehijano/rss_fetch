      <title>Synthesis with Privacy Against an Observer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study automatic synthesis of systems that interact with their environment and maintain privacy against an observer to the interaction. The system and the environment interact via sets $I$ and $O$ of input and output signals. The input to the synthesis problem contains, in addition to a specification, also a list of secrets, a function $cost: I\cup O\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$, which maps each signal to the cost of hiding it, and a bound $b\in\mathbb{N}$ on the budget that the system may use for hiding of signals. The desired output is an $(I/O)$-transducer $T$ and a set $H\subseteq I\cup O$ of signals that respects the bound on the budget, thus $\sum_{s\in H} cost(s)\leq b$, such that for every possible interaction of $T$, the generated computation satisfies the specification, yet an observer, from whom the signals in $H$ are hidden, cannot evaluate the secrets.
  We first show that the problem's complexity is 2EXPTIME-complete for specifications and secrets in LTL, making it no harder than synthesis without privacy requirements. We then analyze the complexity further, isolating the two aspects that do not exist in traditional synthesis: the need to hide secret values and the need to choose the set $H$. We do this by studying settings in which traditional synthesis is solvable in polynomial time -- when the specification formalism is deterministic automata and when the system is closed -- and show that each of these aspects adds an exponential blow-up in complexity. We continue and study bounded synthesis with privacy, where the input includes a bound on the synthesized transducer size, as well as a variant of the problem in which the observer has knowledge, either about the specification or about the system, which can be helpful in evaluating the secrets. Additionally, we study certified privacy, where the synthesis algorithm provides certification that the secrets remain hidden.</description>

      <title>On Kleisli liftings and decorated trace semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that Kleisli categories provide a natural language to model side effects. For instance, in the theory of coalgebras, behavioural equivalence coincides with language equivalence (instead of bisimilarity) when nondeterministic automata are modelled as coalgebras living in the Kleisli category of the powerset monad. In this paper, our aim is to establish decorated trace semantics based on language and ready equivalences for conditional transition systems (CTSs) with/without upgrades. To this end, we model CTSs as coalgebras living in the Kleisli category of a relative monad. Our results are twofold. First, we reduce the problem of defining a Kleisli lifting for the machine endofunctor in the context of a relative monad to the classical notion of Kleisli lifting. Second, we provide a recipe based on indexed categories to construct a Kleisli lifting for general endofunctors.</description>

      <title>Proof Nets for the {\pi}-Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the foundations of a novel logical framework for the {\pi}-calculus, based on the deduction-as-computation paradigm. Following the standard proof-theoretic interpretation of logic programming, we represent processes as formulas, and we interpret proofs as computations.
  For this purpose, we define a cut-free sequent calculus for an extension of first-order multiplicative and additive linear logic. This extension includes a non-commutative and non-associative connective to faithfully model the prefix operator, and nominal quantifiers to represent name restriction. Finally, we design proof nets providing canonical representatives of derivations up to local rule permutations.</description>

      <title>The Universal PDDL Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In AI planning, it is common to distinguish between planning domains and problem instances, where a "domain" is generally understood as a set of related problem instances. This distinction is important, for example, in generalised planning, which aims to find a single, general plan or policy that solves all instances of a given domain. In PDDL, domains and problem instances are clearly separated: the domain defines the types, predicate symbols, and action schemata, while the problem instance specifies the concrete set of (typed) objects, the initial state, and the goal condition. In this paper, we show that it is quite easy to define a PDDL domain such that any propositional planning problem instance, from any domain, becomes an instance of this (lifted) "universal" domain. We construct different formulations of the universal domain, and discuss their implications for the complexity of lifted domain-dependent or generalised planning.</description>

      <title>Modest Sets are Equivalent to PERs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to give an expository account of the equivalence between modest sets and partial equivalence relations. Our proof is entirely self-contained in that we do not assume any knowledge of categorical realizability. At the heart of the equivalence lies the subquotient construction on a partial equivalence relation. The subquotient construction embeds the category of partial equivalence relations into the category of modest sets. We show that this embedding is a split essentially surjective functor, and thereby, an equivalence of categories. Our development is both constructive and predicative, and employs the language of homotopy type theory. All the mathematics presented in this article has been mechanised in Cubical Agda.</description>

      <title>Orbit-finite linear programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00802v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An infinite set is orbit-finite if, up to permutations of the underlying structure of atoms, it has only finitely many elements. We study a generalisation of linear programming where constraints are expressed by an orbit-finite system of linear inequalities. As our principal contribution we provide a decision procedure for checking if such a system has a real solution, and for computing the minimal/maximal value of a linear objective function over the solution set. We also show undecidability of these problems in case when only integer solutions are considered. Therefore orbit-finite linear programming is decidable, while orbit-finite integer linear programming is not.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new encoding of the Battle of Hercules and Hydra as a rewrite system with AC symbols. Unlike earlier term rewriting encodings, it faithfully models any strategy of Hercules to beat Hydra. To prove the termination of our encoding, we employ type introduction in connection with many-sorted semantic labeling for AC rewriting and AC-MPO, a new AC compatible reduction order that can be seen as a much weakened version of AC-RPO.</description>

Abstract: We consider the two-pronged fork frame $F$ and the variety $\mathbf{Eq}(B_F)$ generated by its dual closure algebra $B_F$. We describe the finite projective algebras in $\mathbf{Eq}(B_F)$ and give a purely semantic proof that unification in $\mathbf{Eq}(B_F)$ is finitary and not unitary.</description>

      <title>On Propositional Dynamic Logic and Concurrency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic logic in the setting of concurrency has proved problematic because of the challenge of capturing interleaving. This challenge stems from the fact that the operational semantics for programs considered in these logics is tailored on trace reasoning for sequential programs. In this work, we generalise propositional dynamic logic (PDL) to a logic framework we call operational propositional dynamic logic (OPDL) in which we are able to reason on sets of programs provided with arbitrary operational semantics. We prove cut-elimination and adequacy of a sequent calculus for PDL and we extend these results to OPDL. We conclude by discussing OPDL for Milner's CCS and Choreographic Programming.</description>

      <title>The complexity of deciding characteristic formulae in van Glabbeek's branching-time spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13697v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characteristic formulae give a complete logical description of the behaviour of processes modulo some chosen notion of behavioural semantics. They allow one to reduce equivalence or preorder checking to model checking, and are exactly the formulae in the modal logics characterizing classic behavioural equivalences and preorders for which model checking can be reduced to equivalence or preorder checking.
  This paper studies the complexity of determining whether a formula is characteristic for some finite, loop-free process in each of the logics providing modal characterizations of the simulation-based semantics in van Glabbeek's branching-time spectrum. Since characteristic formulae in each of those logics are exactly the consistent and prime ones, it presents complexity results for the satisfiability and primality problems, and investigates the boundary between modal logics for which those problems can be solved in polynomial time and those for which they become computationally hard.
  Amongst other contributions, this article also studies the complexity of constructing characteristic formulae in the modal logics characterizing simulation-based semantics, both when such formulae are presented in explicit form and via systems of equations.</description>

      <title>Fine-grained Meta-Theorems for Vertex Integrity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.10333v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vertex Integrity is a graph measure which sits squarely between two more well-studied notions, namely vertex cover and tree-depth, and that has recently gained attention as a structural graph parameter. In this paper we investigate the algorithmic trade-offs involved with this parameter from the point of view of algorithmic meta-theorems for First-Order (FO) and Monadic Second Order (MSO) logic. Our positive results are the following: (i) given a graph $G$ of vertex integrity $k$ and an FO formula $\phi$ with $q$ quantifiers, deciding if $G$ satisfies $\phi$ can be done in time $2^{O(k^2q+q\log q)}+n^{O(1)}$; (ii) for MSO formulas with $q$ quantifiers, the same can be done in time $2^{2^{O(k^2+kq)}}+n^{O(1)}$. Both results are obtained using kernelization arguments, which pre-process the input to sizes $2^{O(k^2)}q$ and $2^{O(k^2+kq)}$ respectively.
  The complexities of our meta-theorems are significantly better than the corresponding meta-theorems for tree-depth, which involve towers of exponentials. However, they are worse than the roughly $2^{O(kq)}$ and $2^{2^{O(k+q)}}$ complexities known for corresponding meta-theorems for vertex cover. To explain this deterioration we present two formula constructions which lead to fine-grained complexity lower bounds and establish that the dependence of our meta-theorems on $k$ is the best possible. More precisely, we show that it is not possible to decide FO formulas with $q$ quantifiers in time $2^{o(k^2q)}$, and that there exists a constant-size MSO formula which cannot be decided in time $2^{2^{o(k^2)}}$, both under the ETH. Hence, the quadratic blow-up in the dependence on $k$ is unavoidable and vertex integrity has a complexity for FO and MSO logic which is truly intermediate between vertex cover and tree-depth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01611v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a new description of the hom functor on weak $\omega$-categories, and we show that it admits a left adjoint that we call the suspension functor. We then show that the hom functor preserves the property of being free on a computad, in contrast to the hom functor for strict $\omega$-categories. Using the same technique, we define the opposite of an $\omega$-category with respect to a set of dimensions, and we show that this construction also preserves the property of being free on a computad. Finally, we show that the constructions of opposites and homs commute.</description>

      <title>Unification in the description logic $\mathcal{FL}_\bot$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00912v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Description Logics are a formalism used in the knowledge representation, where the knowledge is captured in the form of concepts constructed in a controlled way from a restricted vocabulary. This allows one to test effectively for consistency of and the subsumption between the concepts. Unification of concepts may likewise become a useful tool in analysing the relations between concepts. The unification problem has been solved for the description logics $\mathcal{FL}_0$ and $\mathcal{EL}$. These small logics do not provide any means to express negation. Here we show an algorithm solving unification in $\mathcal{FL}_\bot$, the logic that extends $\mathcal{FL}_0$ with the bottom concept. Bottom allows one to express that two concepts are disjoint. Our algorithm runs in exponential time, with respect to the size of the problem.</description>

      <title>An Axiomatic Study of the Evaluation of Enthymeme Decoding in Weighted Structured Argumentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An argument can be seen as a pair consisting of a set of premises and a claim supported by them. Arguments used by humans are often enthymemes, i.e., some premises are implicit. To better understand, evaluate, and compare enthymemes, it is essential to decode them, i.e., to find the missing premisses. Many enthymeme decodings are possible. We need to distinguish between reasonable decodings and unreasonable ones. However, there is currently no research in the literature on "How to evaluate decodings?". To pave the way and achieve this goal, we introduce seven criteria related to decoding, based on different research areas. Then, we introduce the notion of criterion measure, the objective of which is to evaluate a decoding with regard to a certain criterion. Since such measures need to be validated, we introduce several desirable properties for them, called axioms. Another main contribution of the paper is the construction of certain criterion measures that are validated by our axioms. Such measures can be used to identify the best enthymemes decodings.</description>
