      <title>Agent Mars: Multi-Agent Simulation for Multi-Planetary Life Exploration and Settlement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed robotics, healthcare, industry, and scientific discovery, yet a major frontier may lie beyond Earth. Space exploration and settlement offer vast environments and resources, but impose constraints unmatched on Earth: delayed/intermittent communications, extreme resource scarcity, heterogeneous expertise, and strict safety, accountability, and command authority. The key challenge is auditable coordination among specialised humans, robots, and digital services in a safety-critical system-of-systems. We introduce Agent Mars, an open, end-to-end multi-agent simulation framework for Mars base operations. Agent Mars formalises a realistic organisation with a 93-agent roster across seven layers of command and execution (human roles and physical assets), enabling base-scale studies beyond toy settings. It implements hierarchical and cross-layer coordination that preserves chain-of-command while allowing vetted cross-layer exchanges with audit trails; supports dynamic role handover with automatic failover under outages; and enables phase-dependent leadership for routine operations, emergencies, and science campaigns. Agent Mars further models mission-critical mechanisms-scenario-aware short/long-horizon memory, configurable propose-vote consensus, and translator-mediated heterogeneous protocols-to capture how teams align under stress. To quantify behaviour, we propose the Agent Mars Performance Index (AMPI), an interpretable composite score with diagnostic sub-metrics. Across 13 reproducible Mars-relevant operational scripts, Agent Mars reveals coordination trade-offs and identifies regimes where curated cross-layer collaboration and functional leadership reduce overhead without sacrificing reliability. Agent Mars provides a benchmarkable, auditable foundation for Space AI.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Value Decomposition: Coordinating a Varying Number of Agents in Urban Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) provides a promising paradigm for coordinating multi-agent systems (MAS). However, most existing methods rely on restrictive assumptions, such as a fixed number of agents and fully synchronous action execution. These assumptions are often violated in urban systems, where the number of active agents varies over time, and actions may have heterogeneous durations, resulting in a semi-MARL setting. Moreover, while sharing policy parameters among agents is commonly adopted to improve learning efficiency, it can lead to highly homogeneous actions when a subset of agents make decisions concurrently under similar observations, potentially degrading coordination quality. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Value Decomposition (AVD), a cooperative MARL framework that adapts to a dynamically changing agent population. AVD further incorporates a lightweight mechanism to mitigate action homogenization induced by shared policies, thereby encouraging behavioral diversity and maintaining effective cooperation among agents. In addition, we design a training-execution strategy tailored to the semi-MARL setting that accommodates asynchronous decision-making when some agents act at different times. Experiments on real-world bike-sharing redistribution tasks in two major cities, London and Washington, D.C., demonstrate that AVD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its effectiveness and generalizability.</description>

      <title>PeroMAS: A Multi-agent System of Perovskite Material Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a pioneer of the third-generation photovoltaic revolution, Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs) are renowned for their superior optoelectronic performance and cost potential. The development process of PSCs is precise and complex, involving a series of closed-loop workflows such as literature retrieval, data integration, experimental design, and synthesis. However, existing AI perovskite approaches focus predominantly on discrete models, including material design, process optimization,and property prediction. These models fail to propagate physical constraints across the workflow, hindering end-to-end optimization. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system for perovskite material discovery, named PeroMAS. We first encapsulated a series of perovskite-specific tools into Model Context Protocols (MCPs). By planning and invoking these tools, PeroMAS can design perovskite materials under multi-objective constraints, covering the entire process from literature retrieval and data extraction to property prediction and mechanism analysis. Furthermore, we construct an evaluation benchmark by perovskite human experts to assess this multi-agent system. Results demonstrate that, compared to single Large Language Model (LLM) or traditional search strategies, our system significantly enhances discovery efficiency. It successfully identified candidate materials satisfying multi-objective constraints. Notably, we verify PeroMAS's effectiveness in the physical world through real synthesis experiments.</description>

      <title>Robust Mean-Field Games with Risk Aversion and Bounded Rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in mean-field game literature enable the reduction of large-scale multi-agent problems to tractable interactions between a representative agent and a population distribution. However, existing approaches typically assume a fixed initial population distribution and fully rational agents, limiting robustness under distributional uncertainty and cognitive constraints. We address these limitations by introducing risk aversion with respect to the initial population distribution and by incorporating bounded rationality to model deviations from fully rational decision-making agents. The combination of these two elements yields a new and more general equilibrium concept, which we term the mean-field risk-averse quantal response equilibrium (MF-RQE). We establish existence results and prove convergence of fixed-point iteration and fictitious play to MF-RQE. Building on these insights, we develop a scalable reinforcement learning algorithm for scenarios with large state-action spaces. Numerical experiments demonstrate that MF-RQE policies achieve improved robustness relative to classical mean-field approaches that optimize expected cumulative rewards under a fixed initial distribution and are restricted to entropy-based regularizers.</description>

      <title>G2CP: A Graph-Grounded Communication Protocol for Verifiable and Efficient Multi-Agent Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models face a critical challenge: agents communicate through natural language, leading to semantic drift, hallucination propagation, and inefficient token consumption. We propose G2CP (Graph-Grounded Communication Protocol), a structured agent communication language where messages are graph operations rather than free text. Agents exchange explicit traversal commands, subgraph fragments, and update operations over a shared knowledge graph, enabling verifiable reasoning traces and eliminating ambiguity. We validate G2CP within an industrial knowledge management system where specialized agents (Diagnostic, Procedural, Synthesis, and Ingestion) coordinate to answer complex queries. Experimental results on 500 industrial scenarios and 21 real-world maintenance cases show that G2CP reduces inter-agent communication tokens by 73%, improves task completion accuracy by 34% over free-text baselines, eliminates cascading hallucinations, and produces fully auditable reasoning chains. G2CP represents a fundamental shift from linguistic to structural communication in multi-agent systems, with implications for any domain requiring precise agent coordination. Code, data, and evaluation scripts are publicly available.</description>

      <title>MAS-on-the-Fly: Dynamic Adaptation of LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems at Test Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a promising paradigm for solving complex tasks. However, existing works often rely on manual designs or "one-size-fits-all" automation, lacking dynamic adaptability after deployment. Inspired by how biological systems adapt, we introduce MASFly, a novel multi-agent framework enabling dynamic adaptation at test time. To adapt system generation, MASFly employs a retrieval-augmented SOP instantiation mechanism that leverages a self-constructed repository of successful collaboration patterns, enabling the LLM to assemble customized MASs for new queries. For adaptive execution, MASFly incorporates an experience-guided supervision mechanism, where a dedicated Watcher agent monitors system behaviors with reference to a personalized experience pool and provides real-time interventions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MASFly achieves state-of-the-art performance, most notably a 61.7% success rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, while exhibiting strong task adaptability and robustness.</description>

      <title>Testing BDI-based Multi-Agent Systems using Discrete Event Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems are designed to deal with open, distributed systems with unpredictable dynamics, which makes them inherently hard to test. The value of using simulation for this purpose is recognized in the literature, although achieving sufficient fidelity (i.e., the degree of similarity between the simulation and the real-world system) remains a challenging task. This is exacerbated when dealing with cognitive agent models, such as the Belief Desire Intention (BDI) model, where the agent codebase is not suitable to run unchanged in simulation environments, thus increasing the reality gap between the deployed and simulated systems. We argue that BDI developers should be able to test in simulation the same specification that will be later deployed, with no surrogate representations. Thus, in this paper, we discuss how the control flow of BDI agents can be mapped onto a Discrete Event Simulation (DES), showing that such integration is possible at different degrees of granularity. We substantiate our claims by producing an open-source prototype integration between two pre-existing tools (JaKtA and Alchemist), showing that it is possible to produce a simulation-based testing environment for distributed BDI} agents, and that different granularities in mapping BDI agents over DESs may lead to different degrees of fidelity.</description>

      <title>Socially-Weighted Alignment: A Game-Theoretic Framework for Multi-Agent LLM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying large language model (LLM) agents in shared environments introduces a fundamental tension between individual alignment and collective stability: locally rational decisions can impose negative externalities that degrade system-level performance. We propose Socially-Weighted Alignment (SWA), a game-theoretic framework that modifies inference-time decision making by interpolating between an agent's private objective and an estimate of group welfare via a social weight $\lambda\in[0,1]$. In a shared-resource congestion game with $n$ agents and congestion severity $\beta$, we show that SWA induces a critical threshold $\lambda^*=(n-\beta)/(n-1)$ above which agents no longer have marginal incentive to increase demand under overload, yielding a phase transition from persistent congestion to stable operation near capacity. We further provide an inference-time algorithmic instantiation of SWA that does not require parameter updates or multi-agent reinforcement learning, and use a multi-agent simulation to empirically validate the predicted threshold behavior.</description>

      <title>Towards Selection as Power: Bounding Decision Authority in Autonomous Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous agentic systems are increasingly deployed in regulated, high-stakes domains where decisions may be irreversible and institutionally constrained. Existing safety approaches emphasize alignment, interpretability, or action-level filtering. We argue that these mechanisms are necessary but insufficient because they do not directly govern selection power: the authority to determine which options are generated, surfaced, and framed for decision. We propose a governance architecture that separates cognition, selection, and action into distinct domains and models autonomy as a vector of sovereignty. Cognitive autonomy remains unconstrained, while selection and action autonomy are bounded through mechanically enforced primitives operating outside the agent's optimization space. The architecture integrates external candidate generation (CEFL), a governed reducer, commit-reveal entropy isolation, rationale validation, and fail-loud circuit breakers. We evaluate the system across multiple regulated financial scenarios under adversarial stress targeting variance manipulation, threshold gaming, framing skew, ordering effects, and entropy probing. Metrics quantify selection concentration, narrative diversity, governance activation cost, and failure visibility. Results show that mechanical selection governance is implementable, auditable, and prevents deterministic outcome capture while preserving reasoning capacity. Although probabilistic concentration remains, the architecture measurably bounds selection authority relative to conventional scalar pipelines. This work reframes governance as bounded causal power rather than internal intent alignment, offering a foundation for deploying autonomous agents where silent failure is unacceptable.</description>

      <title>ST-EVO: Towards Generative Spatio-Temporal Evolution of Multi-Agent Communication Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-powered Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have emerged as an effective approach towards collaborative intelligence, and have attracted wide research interests. Among them, ``self-evolving'' MAS, treated as a more flexible and powerful technical route, can construct task-adaptive workflows or communication topologies, instead of relying on a predefined static structue template. Current self-evolving MAS mainly focus on Spatial Evolving or Temporal Evolving paradigm, which only considers the single dimension of evolution and does not fully incentivize LLMs' collaborative capability. In this work, we start from a novel Spatio-Temporal perspective by proposing ST-EVO, which supports dialogue-wise communication scheduling with a compact yet powerful flow-matching based Scheduler. To make precise Spatio-Temporal scheduling, ST-EVO can also perceive the uncertainty of MAS, and possesses self-feedback ability to learn from accumulated experience. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ST-EVO, achieving about 5%--25% accuracy improvement.</description>

      <title>ROSA: Roundabout Optimized Speed Advisory with Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction in Multimodal Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ROSA -- Roundabout Optimized Speed Advisory -- a system that combines multi-agent trajectory prediction with coordinated speed guidance for multimodal, mixed traffic at roundabouts. Using a Transformer-based model, ROSA jointly predicts the future trajectories of vehicles and Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) at roundabouts. Trained for single-step prediction and deployed autoregressively, it generates deterministic outputs, enabling actionable speed advisories. Incorporating motion dynamics, the model achieves high accuracy (ADE: 1.29m, FDE: 2.99m at a five-second prediction horizon), surpassing prior work. Adding route intention further improves performance (ADE: 1.10m, FDE: 2.36m), demonstrating the value of connected vehicle data. Based on predicted conflicts with VRUs and circulating vehicles, ROSA provides real-time, proactive speed advisories for approaching and entering the roundabout. Despite prediction uncertainty, ROSA significantly improves vehicle efficiency and safety, with positive effects even on perceived safety from a VRU perspective. The source code of this work is available under: github.com/urbanAIthi/ROSA.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Gaussian Processes for Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are a powerful tool for probabilistic modeling, but their performance is often constrained in complex, largescale real-world domains due to the limited expressivity of classical kernels. Quantum computing offers the potential to overcome this limitation by embedding data into exponentially large Hilbert spaces, capturing complex correlations that remain inaccessible to classical computing approaches. In this paper, we propose a Distributed Quantum Gaussian Process (DQGP) method in a multiagent setting to enhance modeling capabilities and scalability. To address the challenging non-Euclidean optimization problem, we develop a Distributed consensus Riemannian Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (DR-ADMM) algorithm that aggregates local agent models into a global model. We evaluate the efficacy of our method through numerical experiments conducted on a quantum simulator in classical hardware. We use real-world, non-stationary elevation datasets of NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and synthetic datasets generated by Quantum Gaussian Processes. Beyond modeling advantages, our framework highlights potential computational speedups that quantum hardware may provide, particularly in Gaussian processes and distributed optimization.</description>

      <title>UAVGENT: A Language-Guided Distributed Control Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study language-in-the-loop control for multi-drone systems that execute evolving, high-level missions while retaining formal robustness guarantees at the physical layer. We propose a three-layer architecture in which (i) a human operator issues natural-language instructions, (ii) an LLM-based supervisor periodically interprets, verifies, and corrects the commanded task in the context of the latest state and target estimates, and (iii) a distributed inner-loop controller tracks the resulting reference using only local relative information. We derive a theoretical guarantee that characterizes tracking performance under bounded disturbances and piecewise-smooth references with discrete jumps induced by LLM updates. Overall, our results illustrate how centralized language-based task reasoning can be combined with distributed feedback control to achieve complex behaviors with provable robustness and stability.</description>

      <title>DPBench: Large Language Models Struggle with Simultaneous Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems, yet we lack benchmarks that test whether they can coordinate under resource contention. We introduce DPBench, a benchmark based on the Dining Philosophers problem that evaluates LLM coordination across eight conditions that vary decision timing, group size, and communication. Our experiments with GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, and Grok 4.1 reveal a striking asymmetry: LLMs coordinate effectively in sequential settings but fail when decisions must be made simultaneously, with deadlock rates exceeding 95\% under some conditions. We trace this failure to convergent reasoning, where agents independently arrive at identical strategies that, when executed simultaneously, guarantee deadlock. Contrary to expectations, enabling communication does not resolve this problem and can even increase deadlock rates. Our findings suggest that multi-agent LLM systems requiring concurrent resource access may need external coordination mechanisms rather than relying on emergent coordination. DPBench is released as an open-source benchmark. Code and benchmark are available at https://github.com/najmulhasan-code/dpbench.</description>

      <title>MAPLE: A Sub-Agent Architecture for Memory, Learning, and Personalization in Agentic AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have emerged as powerful tools for complex tasks, yet their ability to adapt to individual users remains fundamentally limited. We argue this limitation stems from a critical architectural conflation: current systems treat memory, learning, and personalization as a unified capability rather than three distinct mechanisms requiring different infrastructure, operating on different timescales, and benefiting from independent optimization. We propose MAPLE (Memory-Adaptive Personalized LEarning), a principled decomposition where Memory handles storage and retrieval infrastructure; Learning extracts intelligence from accumulated interactions asynchronously; and Personalization applies learned knowledge in real-time within finite context budgets. Each component operates as a dedicated sub-agent with specialized tooling and well-defined interfaces. Experimental evaluation on the MAPLE-Personas benchmark demonstrates that our decomposition achieves a 14.6% improvement in personalization score compared to a stateless baseline (p &lt; 0.01, Cohen's d = 0.95) and increases trait incorporation rate from 45% to 75% -- enabling agents that genuinely learn and adapt.</description>

      <title>Supercritical Mass and Condensation in Fokker--Planck Equations for Consensus Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recently developed Fokker--Planck models for Bose--Einstein statistics, we study a consensus formation model with condensation effects driven by a polynomial diffusion coefficient vanishing at the domain boundaries. For the underlying kinetic model, given by a nonlinear Fokker--Planck equation with superlinear drift, it was shown that if the initial mass exceeds a critical threshold, the solution may exhibit finite-time concentration in certain parameter regimes. Here, we show that this supercritical mass phenomenon persists for a broader class of diffusion functions and provide estimates of the critical mass required to induce finite-time loss of regularity.</description>

      <title>BLUEPRINT Rebuilding a Legacy: Multimodal Retrieval for Complex Engineering Drawings and Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decades of engineering drawings and technical records remain locked in legacy archives with inconsistent or missing metadata, making retrieval difficult and often manual. We present Blueprint, a layout-aware multimodal retrieval system designed for large-scale engineering repositories. Blueprint detects canonical drawing regions, applies region-restricted VLM-based OCR, normalizes identifiers (e.g., DWG, part, facility), and fuses lexical and dense retrieval with a lightweight region-level reranker. Deployed on ~770k unlabeled files, it automatically produces structured metadata suitable for cross-facility search.
  We evaluate Blueprint on a 5k-file benchmark with 350 expert-curated queries using pooled, graded (0/1/2) relevance judgments. Blueprint delivers a 10.1% absolute gain in Success@3 and an 18.9% relative improvement in nDCG@3 over the strongest vision-language baseline}, consistently outperforming across vision, text, and multimodal intents. Oracle ablations reveal substantial headroom under perfect region detection and OCR. We release all queries, runs, annotations, and code to facilitate reproducible evaluation on legacy engineering archives.</description>

      <title>Verification of Robust Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic multi-agent systems are a central modeling framework for autonomous controllers, communication protocols, and cyber-physical infrastructures. In many such systems, however, transition probabilities are only estimated from data and may therefore be partially unknown or subject to perturbations. In this paper, we study the verification of robust strategies in stochastic multi-agent systems with imperfect information, in which coalitions must satisfy a temporal specification while dealing with uncertain system transitions, partial observation, and adversarial agents. By focusing on bounded-memory strategies, we introduce a robust variant of the model-checking problem for a probabilistic, observation-based extension of Alternating-time Temporal Logic. We characterize the complexity of this problem under different notions of perturbation, thereby clarifying the computational cost of robustness in stochastic multi-agent verification and supporting the use of bounded-memory strategies in uncertain environments.</description>

      <title>A First Proof Sprint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This monograph reports a multi-agent proof sprint on ten research-level problems, combining rapid draft generation with adversarial verification, targeted repair, and explicit provenance. The workflow uses wiring-diagram decompositions of claim dependencies to localize gaps and coordinate reviewer-driven revisions. Final outcomes are heterogeneous but explicit: the manuscript distinguishes mathematical status from QC-validation status. Mathematically, Problem~3 has a validation-complete existence path under the scoped criterion used here (uniqueness/irreducibility treated as optional), Problem 5 is solved in a scope-limited form for $F_O$-local connective spectra, Problem 10 is conditional under clearly stated assumptions (with explicit necessity counterexamples when assumptions are dropped), and Problems 4 and 6 are partial with named remaining obligations in the general case (including an unconditional $K_n$ result for Problem 6 with $c_0 = 1/3$). Problem 7 is treated as provisionally closed via the rotation-route theorem chain, pending independent ledger re-check. At the QC layer, Problems~7 and~9 have node-level validation artifacts but still contain unresolved verifier gaps. The main methodological result is that structure-aware verification and layer-switching strategies improve reliability and calibration in compressed proof sprints.</description>

      <title>Guided Collaboration in Heterogeneous LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems via Entropy-Based Understanding Assessment and Experience Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) for reasoning, planning, and complex task generation, artificial intelligence systems are transitioning from isolated single-agent architectures to multi-agent systems with collaborative intelligence. However, in heterogeneous multi-agent systems (HMAS), capability differences among agents give rise to consistent cognitive problems, where strong and weak models fail to contribute effectively. We define the collaboration as a strong-weak system. Through comprehensive experiments, we disclose a counterintuitive phenomenon in the strong-weak system: a strong-weak collaboration may under-perform weak-weak combinations, revealing that cognitive mismatching are key bottlenecks limiting heterogeneous cooperation. To overcome these challenges, we propose an Entropy-Based Adaptive Guidance Framework that dynamically aligns the guidance with the cognitive state of each agent. The framework quantifies the understanding of weak agents through multi-dimensional entropy metrics - covering expression, uncertainty, structure, coherence, and relevance - and adaptively adjusts the intensity of the guidance at light, moderate and intensive levels. Furthermore, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism is incorporated to retain successful collaboration experiences, enabling both immediate adaptation and long-term learning. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, GSM8K, MBPP, and CVRP demonstrate that our approach consistently enhances the effectiveness and stability of heterogeneous collaboration. The results highlight that adaptive guidance not only mitigates cognitive imbalance but also establishes a scalable pathway toward more robust, cooperative multi-agent intelligence.</description>

      <title>ThunderAgent: A Simple, Fast and Program-Aware Agentic Inference System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models(LLMs) are now used to power complex multi-turn agentic workflows. Existing systems run agentic inference by loosely assembling isolated components: an LLM inference engine (e.g., vLLM) and a tool orchestrator (e.g., Kubernetes). Although agentic workflows involve multiple LLM and tool requests, these systems schedule and allocate resources separately on a per-request basis, without end-to-end knowledge of the workflow. This leads to sub-optimal management of KV cache and tool execution environments. To address the challenges, we propose ThunderAgent, a fast, simple, and program-aware agentic inference system. We first abstract agentic workflows as LLM Programs, enabling a unified view of heterogeneous resources, including KV caches, system states, and external tool assets such as disk memory and network ports. Built upon this abstraction, ThunderAgent introduces a program-aware scheduler and a tool resource manager designed to maximize KV cache hit rates, mitigate memory imbalances, and enable asynchronous environment preparation. Evaluations across coding, routing, and scientific discovery agents demonstrate that ThunderAgent achieves 1.5-3.6x throughput improvements in serving, 1.8-3.9x in RL rollout, and up to 4.2x disk memory savings compared to state-of-the-art inference systems. To facilitate reproducibility and support future development, we open-source the system implementations of the whole ThunderAgent at: https://github.com/Agentic-Kinetics/ThunderAgent.</description>

      <title>DTBench: A Synthetic Benchmark for Document-to-Table Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Document-to-table (Doc2Table) extraction derives structured tables from unstructured documents under a target schema, enabling reliable and verifiable SQL-based data analytics. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in flexible information extraction, their ability to produce precisely structured tables remains insufficiently understood, particularly for indirect extraction that requires complex capabilities such as reasoning and conflict resolution. Existing benchmarks neither explicitly distinguish nor comprehensively cover the diverse capabilities required in Doc2Table extraction.We argue that a capability-aware benchmark is essential for systematic evaluation. However, constructing such benchmarks using human-annotated document-table pairs is costly, difficult to scale, and limited in capability coverage. To address this, we adopt a reverse Table2Doc paradigm and design a multi-agent synthesis workflow to generate documents from ground-truth tables. Based on this approach, we present DTBench, a synthetic benchmark that adopts a proposed two-level taxonomy of Doc2Table capabilities, covering 5 major categories and 13 subcategories. We evaluate several mainstream LLMs on DTBench, and demonstrate substantial performance gaps across models, as well as persistent challenges in reasoning, faithfulness, and conflict resolution. DTBench provides a comprehensive testbed for data generation and evaluation, facilitating future research on Doc2Table extraction. The benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/ZJU-DAILY/DTBench.</description>

      <title>From Fluent to Verifiable: Claim-Level Auditability for Deep Research Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A deep research agent produces a fluent scientific report in minutes; a careful reader then tries to verify the main claims and discovers the real cost is not reading, but tracing: which sentence is supported by which passage, what was ignored, and where evidence conflicts. We argue that as research generation becomes cheap, auditability becomes the bottleneck, and the dominant risk shifts from isolated factual errors to scientifically styled outputs whose claim-evidence links are weak, missing, or misleading. This perspective proposes claim-level auditability as a first-class design and evaluation target for deep research agents, distills recurring long-horizon failure modes (objective drift, transient constraints, and unverifiable inference), and introduces the Auditable Autonomous Research (AAR) standard, a compact measurement framework that makes auditability testable via provenance coverage, provenance soundness, contradiction transparency, and audit effort. We then argue for semantic provenance with protocolized validation: persistent, queryable provenance graphs that encode claim--evidence relations (including conflicts) and integrate continuous validation during synthesis rather than after publication, with practical instrumentation patterns to support deployment at scale.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Optimizing the Provisioning of Exhaustible Capabilities for Simultaneous Task Allocation and Scheduling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying heterogeneous robot teams to accomplish multiple tasks over extended time horizons presents significant computational challenges for task allocation and planning. In this paper, we present a comprehensive, time-extended, offline heterogeneous multi-robot task allocation framework, TRAITS, which we believe to be the first that can cope with the provisioning of exhaustible traits under battery and temporal constraints. Specifically, we introduce a nonlinear programming-based trait distribution module that can optimize the trait-provisioning rate of coalitions to yield feasible and time-efficient solutions. TRAITS provides a more accurate feasibility assessment and estimation of task execution times and makespan by leveraging trait-provisioning rates while optimizing battery consumption -- an advantage that state-of-the-art frameworks lack. We evaluate TRAITS against two state-of-the-art frameworks, with results demonstrating its advantage in satisfying complex trait and battery requirements while remaining computationally tractable.</description>

      <title>Truthful Reporting of Competence with Minimal Verification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose you run a home exam, where students should report their own scores but can cheat freely. You can, if needed, call a limited number of students to class and verify their actual performance against their reported score. We consider the class of mechanisms where truthful reporting is a dominant strategy, and truthful agents are never penalized -- even off-equilibrium.
  How many students do we need to verify, in expectation, if we want to minimize the bias, i.e., the difference between agents' competence and their expected grade? When perfect verification is available, we characterize the best possible tradeoff between these requirements and provide a simple parametrized mechanism that is optimal in the class for any distribution of agents' types. When verification is noisy, the task becomes much more challenging. We show how proper scoring rules can be leveraged in different ways to construct truthful mechanisms with a good (though not necessarily optimal) tradeoff.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Agent Framework for Medical AI: Leveraging Fine-Tuned GPT, LLaMA, and DeepSeek R1 for Evidence-Based and Bias-Aware Clinical Query Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for healthcare question answering, but clinical use is limited by weak verification, insufficient evidence grounding, and unreliable confidence signalling. We propose a multi-agent medical QA framework that combines complementary LLMs with evidence retrieval, uncertainty estimation, and bias checks to improve answer reliability. Our approach has two phases. First, we fine-tune three representative LLM families (GPT, LLaMA, and DeepSeek R1) on MedQuAD-derived medical QA data (20k+ question-answer pairs across multiple NIH domains) and benchmark generation quality. DeepSeek R1 achieves the strongest scores (ROUGE-1 0.536 +- 0.04; ROUGE-2 0.226 +-0.03; BLEU 0.098 -+ 0.018) and substantially outperforms the specialised biomedical baseline BioGPT in zero-shot evaluation. Second, we implement a modular multi-agent pipeline in which a Clinical Reasoning agent (fine-tuned LLaMA) produces structured explanations, an Evidence Retrieval agent queries PubMed to ground responses in recent literature, and a Refinement agent (DeepSeek R1) improves clarity and factual consistency; an optional human validation path is triggered for high-risk or high-uncertainty cases. Safety mechanisms include Monte Carlo dropout and perplexity-based uncertainty scoring, plus lexical and sentiment-based bias detection supported by LIME/SHAP-based analyses. In evaluation, the full system achieves 87% accuracy with relevance around 0.80, and evidence augmentation reduces uncertainty (perplexity 4.13) compared to base responses, with mean end-to-end latency of 36.5 seconds under the reported configuration. Overall, the results indicate that agent specialisation and verification layers can mitigate key single-model limitations and provide a practical, extensible design for evidence-based and bias-aware medical AI.</description>

      <title>DeepFusion: Accelerating MoE Training via Federated Knowledge Distillation from Heterogeneous Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based large language models (LLMs) such as Qwen-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE are transforming generative AI in natural language processing. However, these models require vast and diverse training data. Federated learning (FL) addresses this challenge by leveraging private data from heterogeneous edge devices for privacy-preserving MoE training. Nonetheless, traditional FL approaches require devices to host local MoE models, which is impractical for resource-constrained devices due to large model sizes. To address this, we propose DeepFusion, the first scalable federated MoE training framework that enables the fusion of heterogeneous on-device LLM knowledge via federated knowledge distillation, yielding a knowledge-abundant global MoE model. Specifically, DeepFusion features each device to independently configure and train an on-device LLM tailored to its own needs and hardware limitations. Furthermore, we propose a novel View-Aligned Attention (VAA) module that integrates multi-stage feature representations from the global MoE model to construct a predictive perspective aligned with on-device LLMs, thereby enabling effective cross-architecture knowledge distillation. By explicitly aligning predictive perspectives, VAA resolves the view-mismatch problem in traditional federated knowledge distillation, which arises from heterogeneity in model architectures and prediction behaviors between on-device LLMs and the global MoE model. Experiments with industry-level MoE models (Qwen-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE) and real-world datasets (medical and finance) demonstrate that DeepFusion achieves performance close to centralized MoE training. Compared with key federated MoE baselines, DeepFusion reduces communication costs by up to 71% and improves token perplexity by up to 5.28%.</description>

      <title>Offline Learning of Nash Stable Coalition Structures with Possibly Overlapping Coalitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coalition formation concerns strategic collaborations of selfish agents that form coalitions based on their preferences. It is often assumed that coalitions are disjoint and preferences are fully known, which may not hold in practice. In this paper, we thus present a new model of coalition formation with possibly overlapping coalitions under partial information, where selfish agents may be part of multiple coalitions simultaneously and their full preferences are initially unknown. Instead, information about past interactions and associated utility feedback is stored in a fixed offline dataset, and we aim to efficiently infer the agents' preferences from this dataset. We analyze the impact of diverse dataset information constraints by studying two types of utility feedback that can be stored in the dataset: agent- and coalition-level utility feedback. For both feedback models, we identify assumptions under which the dataset covers sufficient information for an offline learning algorithm to infer preferences and use them to recover a partition that is (approximately) Nash stable, in which no agent can improve her utility by unilaterally deviating. Our additional goal is devising algorithms with low sample complexity, requiring only a small dataset to obtain a desired approximation to Nash stability. Under agent-level feedback, we provide a sample-efficient algorithm proven to obtain an approximately Nash stable partition under a sufficient and necessary assumption on the information covered by the dataset. However, under coalition-level feedback, we show that only under a stricter assumption is sufficient for sample-efficient learning. Still, in multiple cases, our algorithms' sample complexity bounds have optimality guarantees up to logarithmic factors. Finally, extensive experiments show that our algorithm converges to a low approximation level to Nash stability across diverse settings.</description>

      <title>LongCLI-Bench: A Preliminary Benchmark and Study for Long-horizon Agentic Programming in Command-Line Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in AI-assisted programming have empowered agents to execute complex workflows via command-line interfaces, however, existing benchmarks are limited by short task horizons, data contamination from GitHub scraping, and a lack of fine-grained evaluation metrics, fail to rigorously evaluate the long-horizon planning and execution capabilities essential for realistic software engineering. To address these gaps, we introduce LongCLI-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate agentic capabilities across long-horizon, realistic tasks. We curated 20 high-quality, long-horizon tasks from over 1,000 computer science assignments and real-world workflows, covering four engineering categories: from scratch, feature addition, bug fixing, and refactoring. We propose a dual-set testing protocol for LongCLI-Bench, which measures requirement fulfillment (fail-to-pass) and regression avoidance (pass-to-pass), and incorporates step-level scoring to pinpoint execution failures. Extensive experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art agents achieve pass rates below 20% in LongCLI-Bench. Step-level analysis further indicates that the majority of tasks stall at less than 30% completion, highlighting that critical failures often occur in the early stages. Although self-correction offers marginal gains, human-agent collaboration through plan injection and interactive guidance yields significantly higher improvements. These results highlight that future research must emphasize the development of synergistic human-agent workflows alongside advances in agents' planning and execution capabilities to overcome key challenges in long-horizon task performance.</description>

      <title>Noncooperative Virtual Queue Coordination via Uncertainty-Aware Correlated Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collaborative virtual queueing has been proposed as a mechanism to mitigate airport surface congestion while preserving airline autonomy over aircraft-level pushback decisions. A central coordinator can regulate aggregate pushback capacity but cannot directly control which specific aircraft are released, limiting its ability to steer system-level performance. We propose a noncooperative coordination mechanism for collaborative virtual queueing based on the correlated equilibrium concept, which enables the coordinator to provide incentive-compatible recommendations on aircraft-level pushback decisions without overriding airline autonomy. To account for uncertainty in airlines' internal cost assessments, we introduce chance constraints into the correlated equilibrium formulation. This formulation provides explicit probabilistic guarantees on incentive compatibility, allowing the coordinator to adjust the confidence level with which airlines are expected to follow the recommended actions. We further propose a scalable algorithm for computing chance-constrained correlated equilibria by exploiting a reduced-rank structure. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method scales to realistic traffic levels up to 210 eligible pushbacks per hour, reduces accumulated delay by up to approximately 8.9% compared to current first-come-first-served schemes, and reveals a trade-off between confidence level, deviation robustness, and achievable cost efficiency.</description>

      <title>RoboSolver: A Multi-Agent Large Language Model Framework for Solving Robotic Arm Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes an intelligent multi-agent framework built on LLMs and VLMs and specifically tailored to robotics. The goal is to integrate the strengths of LLMs and VLMs with computational tools to automatically analyze and solve problems related to robotic manipulators. Our developed framework accepts both textual and visual inputs and can automatically perform forward and inverse kinematics, compute velocities and accelerations of key points, generate 3D simulations of the robot, and ultimately execute motion control within the simulated environment, all according to the user's query. To evaluate the framework, three benchmark tests were designed, each consisting of ten questions. In the first benchmark test, the framework was evaluated while connected to GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3.2, and Claude-Sonnet-4.5, as well as their corresponding raw models. The objective was to extract the forward kinematics of robots directly from textual descriptions. The results showed that the framework integrated with GPT-4o achieved the highest accuracy, reaching 0.97 in computing the final solution, whereas the raw model alone attained an accuracy of only 0.30 for the same task. Similarly, for the other two models, the framework consistently outperformed the corresponding raw models in terms of accuracy. The second benchmark test was identical to the first, except that the input was provided in visual form. In this test, the GPT-4o LLM was used alongside the Gemini 2.5 Pro VLM. The results showed that the framework achieved an accuracy of 0.93 in obtaining the final answer, which is approximately 20% higher than that of the corresponding raw model. The third benchmark test encompassed a range of robotic tasks, including simulation, control, velocity and acceleration computation, as well as inverse kinematics and Jacobian calculation, for which the framework achieved an accuracy of 0.97.</description>

      <title>Fluid-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary focus of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been to study interactions among a fixed number of agents embedded in an environment. However, in the real world, the number of agents is neither fixed nor known a priori. Moreover, an agent can decide to create other agents (for example, a cell may divide, or a company may spin off a division). In this paper, we propose a framework that allows agents to create other agents; we call this a fluid-agent environment. We present game-theoretic solution concepts for fluid-agent games and empirically evaluate the performance of several MARL algorithms within this framework. Our experiments include fluid variants of established benchmarks such as Predator-Prey and Level-Based Foraging, where agents can dynamically spawn, as well as a new environment we introduce that highlights how fluidity can unlock novel solution strategies beyond those observed in fixed-population settings. We demonstrate that this framework yields agent teams that adjust their size dynamically to match environmental demands.</description>

      <title>FactorMiner: A Self-Evolving Agent with Skills and Experience Memory for Financial Alpha Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Formulaic alpha factor mining is a critical yet challenging task in quantitative investment, characterized by a vast search space and the need for domain-informed, interpretable signals. However, finding novel signals becomes increasingly difficult as the library grows due to high redundancy. We propose FactorMiner, a lightweight and flexible self-evolving agent framework designed to navigate this complex landscape through continuous knowledge accumulation. FactorMiner combines a Modular Skill Architecture that encapsulates systematic financial evaluation into executable tools with a structured Experience Memory that distills historical mining trials into actionable insights (successful patterns and failure constraints). By instantiating the Ralph Loop paradigm -- retrieve, generate, evaluate, and distill -- FactorMiner iteratively uses memory priors to guide exploration, reducing redundant search while focusing on promising directions. Experiments on multiple datasets across different assets and Markets show that FactorMiner constructs a diverse library of high-quality factors with competitive performance, while maintaining low redundancy among factors as the library scales. Overall, FactorMiner provides a practical approach to scalable discovery of interpretable formulaic alpha factors under the "Correlation Red Sea" constraint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM agents increasingly act on external systems, yet tool effects are immediate. Under failures, speculation, or contention, losing branches can leak unintended side effects with no safe rollback. We introduce Atomix, a runtime that provides progress-aware transactional semantics for agent tool calls. Atomix tags each call with an epoch, tracks per-resource frontiers, and commits only when progress predicates indicate safety; bufferable effects can be delayed, while externalized effects are tracked and compensated on abort. Across real workloads with fault injection, transactional retry improves task success, while frontier-gated commit strengthens isolation under speculation and contention.</description>

      <title>Picking the Right Specialist: Attentive Neural Process-based Selection of Task-Specialized Models as Tools for Agentic Healthcare Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Task-specialized models form the backbone of agentic healthcare systems, enabling the agents to answer clinical queries across tasks such as disease diagnosis, localization, and report generation. Yet, for a given task, a single "best" model rarely exists. In practice, each task is better served by multiple competing specialist models where different models excel on different data samples. As a result, for any given query, agents must reliably select the right specialist model from a heterogeneous pool of tool candidates. To this end, we introduce ToolSelect, which adaptively learns model selection for tools by minimizing a population risk over sampled specialist tool candidates using a consistent surrogate of the task-conditional selection loss. Concretely, we propose an Attentive Neural Process-based selector conditioned on the query and per-model behavioral summaries to choose among the specialist models. Motivated by the absence of any established testbed, we, for the first time, introduce an agentic Chest X-ray environment equipped with a diverse suite of task-specialized models (17 disease detection, 19 report generation, 6 visual grounding, and 13 VQA) and develop ToolSelectBench, a benchmark of 1448 queries. Our results demonstrate that ToolSelect consistently outperforms 10 SOTA methods across four different task families.</description>

      <title>QD-MAPPER: A Quality Diversity Framework to Automatically Evaluate Multi-Agent Path Finding Algorithms in Diverse Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06888v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Quality Diversity (QD) algorithm with Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) to automatically evaluate Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithms by generating diverse maps. Previously, researchers typically evaluate MAPF algorithms on a set of specific, human-designed maps at their initial stage of algorithm design. However, such fixed maps may not cover all scenarios, and algorithms may overfit to the small set of maps. To seek further improvements, systematic evaluations on a diverse suite of maps are needed. In this work, we propose Quality-Diversity Multi-Agent Path Finding Performance EvaluatoR (QD-MAPPER), a general framework that takes advantage of the QD algorithm to comprehensively understand the performance of MAPF algorithms by generating maps with patterns, be able to make fair comparisons between two MAPF algorithms, providing further information on the selection between two algorithms and on the design of the algorithms. Empirically, we employ this technique to evaluate and compare the behavior of different types of MAPF algorithms, including search-based, priority-based, rule-based, and learning-based algorithms. Through both single-algorithm experiments and comparisons between algorithms, researchers can identify patterns that each MAPF algorithm excels and detect disparities in runtime or success rates between different algorithms.</description>

      <title>Modeling AI-Human Collaboration as a Multi-Agent Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formalize AI-human collaboration through an agent-based simulation that distinguishes optimization-based AI search from satisficing-based human adaptation. Using an NK model, we examine how these distinct decision heuristics interact across modular and sequenced task structures. For modular tasks, AI typically substitutes for humans, yet complementarities emerge when AI explores a moderately broad search space and human task complexity remains low. In sequenced tasks, we uncover a counterintuitive result: when a high-performing human initiates search and AI subsequently refines it, joint performance is maximized, contradicting the dominant AI-first design principle. Conversely, when AI leads and human satisficing follows, complementarities attenuate as task interdependence increases. We further show that memory-less random AI, despite lacking structured adaptation, can improve outcomes when augmenting low-capability humans by enabling escape from local optima. Collectively, our findings reveal that effective AI-human collaboration depends less on industry context and more on task architecture: the division of labor, sequencing, and interdependence structure. By elevating task decomposition as the central design principle, we provide a generalizable framework for strategic decision-making involving agentic AI across diverse organizational settings.</description>

      <title>HEAS: Hierarchical Evolutionary Agent Simulation Framework for Cross-Scale Modeling and Multi-Objective Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hierarchical Evolutionary Agent Simulation (HEAS) is a Python framework that unifies layered agent-based modeling with evolutionary optimization and tournament evaluation in a single, reproducible workflow. HEAS represents models as hierarchies of lightweight processes ("streams") scheduled in deterministic layers that read and write a shared context, making cross-scale couplings explicit and auditable. A compact API and CLI-simulate, optimize, evaluate-expose single- and multi-objective evolution, PyTorch policy integration via parameter flattening/unflattening, and general tournament tooling with user-defined scoring and voting rules. The framework standardizes evaluation through uniform per-step and episode metrics, persists seeds, logbooks, and hall-of-fame archives, and provides plotting helpers for traces, Pareto fronts, and comparative outcomes, reducing glue code and improving comparability across studies. HEAS emphasizes separation of mechanism from orchestration, allowing exogenous drivers, endogenous agents, and aggregators to be composed and swapped without refactoring, while the same model can be used for forward simulation, optimization, or systematic comparison. We illustrate usage with two compact examples-an ecological system and an enterprise decision-making setting. HEAS offers a practical foundation for cross-disciplinary, multi-level inquiry, yielding reliable, reproducible results.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous RBCs via Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current macroeconomic models with agent heterogeneity can be broadly divided into two main groups. Heterogeneous-agent general equilibrium (GE) models, such as those based on Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) or Krusell-Smith (KS) approaches, rely on GE and 'rational expectations', somewhat unrealistic assumptions that make the models very computationally cumbersome, which in turn limits the amount of heterogeneity that can be modelled. In contrast, agent-based models (ABMs) can flexibly encompass a large number of arbitrarily heterogeneous agents, but typically require the specification of explicit behavioural rules, which can lead to a lengthy trial-and-error model-development process. To address these limitations, we introduce MARL-BC, a framework that integrates deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with real business cycle (RBC) models. We demonstrate that MARL-BC can: (1) recover textbook RBC results when using a single agent; (2) recover the results of the mean-field KS model using a large number of identical agents; and (3) effectively simulate rich heterogeneity among agents, a hard task for traditional GE approaches. Our framework can be thought of as an ABM if used with a variety of heterogeneous interacting agents, and can reproduce GE results in limit cases. As such, it is a step towards a synthesis of these often opposed modelling paradigms.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Emergent Extreme Events in Multi-Agent Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language model-powered multi-agent systems have emerged as powerful tools for simulating complex human-like systems. The interactions within these systems often lead to extreme events whose origins remain obscured by the black box of emergence. Interpreting these events is critical for system safety. This paper proposes the first framework for explaining emergent extreme events in multi-agent systems, aiming to answer three fundamental questions: When does the event originate? Who drives it? And what behaviors contribute to it? Specifically, we adapt the Shapley value to faithfully attribute the occurrence of extreme events to each action taken by agents at different time steps, i.e., assigning an attribution score to the action to measure its influence on the event. We then aggregate the attribution scores along the dimensions of time, agent, and behavior to quantify the risk contribution of each dimension. Finally, we design a set of metrics based on these contribution scores to characterize the features of extreme events. Experiments across diverse multi-agent system scenarios (economic, financial, and social) demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and provide general insights into the emergence of extreme phenomena.</description>

      <title>Agent Skills for Large Language Models: Architecture, Acquisition, Security, and the Path Forward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition from monolithic language models to modular, skill-equipped agents marks a defining shift in how large language models (LLMs) are deployed in practice. Rather than encoding all procedural knowledge within model weights, agent skills -- composable packages of instructions, code, and resources that agents load on demand -- enable dynamic capability extension without retraining. It is formalized in a paradigm of progressive disclosure, portable skill definitions, and integration with the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This survey provides a comprehensive treatment of the agent skills landscape, as it has rapidly evolved during the last few months. We organize the field along four axes: (i) architectural foundations, examining the {SKILL.md} specification, progressive context loading, and the complementary roles of skills and MCP; (ii) skill acquisition, covering reinforcement learning with skill libraries, autonomous skill discovery (SEAgent), and compositional skill synthesis; (iii) deployment at scale, including the computer-use agent (CUA) stack, GUI grounding advances, and benchmark progress on OSWorld and SWE-bench; and (iv) security, where recent empirical analyses reveal that 26.1% of community-contributed skills contain vulnerabilities, motivating our proposed Skill Trust and Lifecycle Governance Framework -- a four-tier, gate-based permission model that maps skill provenance to graduated deployment capabilities. We identify seven open challenges -- from cross-platform skill portability to capability-based permission models -- and propose a research agenda for realizing trustworthy, self-improving skill ecosystems. Unlike prior surveys that broadly cover LLM agents or tool use, this work focuses specifically on the emerging skill abstraction layer and its implications for the next generation of agentic systems.

      <title>Characterizations of voting rules based on majority margins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08595v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of voting with ranked ballots, an important class of voting rules is the class of margin-based rules (also called pairwise rules). A voting rule is margin-based if whenever two elections generate the same head-to-head margins of victory or loss between candidates, the voting rule yields the same outcome in both elections. Although this is a mathematically natural invariance property to consider, whether it should be regarded as a normative axiom on voting rules is less clear. In this paper, we address this question for voting rules with any kind of output, whether a set of candidates, a ranking, a probability distribution, etc. We prove that a voting rule is margin-based if and only if it satisfies some axioms with clearer normative content. A key axiom is what we call Preferential Equality, stating that if two voters both rank a candidate $x$ immediately above a candidate $y$, then either voter switching to rank $y$ immediately above $x$ will have the same effect on the election outcome as if the other voter made the switch, so each voter's preference for $y$ over $x$ is treated equally.</description>

      <title>An Agentic System for Rare Disease Diagnosis with Traceable Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rare diseases affect over 300 million individuals worldwide, yet timely and accurate diagnosis remains an urgent challenge. Patients often endure a prolonged diagnostic odyssey exceeding five years, marked by repeated referrals, misdiagnoses, and unnecessary interventions, leading to delayed treatment and substantial emotional and economic burdens. Here we present DeepRare, a multi-agent system for rare disease differential diagnosis decision support powered by large language models, integrating over 40 specialized tools and up-to-date knowledge sources. DeepRare processes heterogeneous clinical inputs, including free-text descriptions, structured Human Phenotype Ontology terms, and genetic testing results, to generate ranked diagnostic hypotheses with transparent reasoning linked to verifiable medical evidence. Evaluated across nine datasets from literature, case reports and clinical centres across Asia, North America and Europe spanning 14 medical specialties, DeepRare demonstrates exceptional performance on 3,134 diseases. In human-phenotype-ontology-based tasks, it achieves an average Recall@1 of 57.18%, outperforming the next-best method by 23.79%; in multi-modal tests, it reaches 69.1% compared with Exomiser's 55.9% on 168 cases. Expert review achieved 95.4% agreement on its reasoning chains, confirming their validity and traceability. Our work not only advances rare disease diagnosis but also demonstrates how the latest powerful large-language-model-driven agentic systems can reshape current clinical workflows.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Agents in Spatial Double-Auction Markets: Modeling the Emergence of Industrial Symbiosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Industrial symbiosis fosters circularity by enabling firms to repurpose residual resources, yet its emergence is constrained by socio-spatial frictions that shape costs, matching opportunities, and market efficiency. Existing models often overlook the interaction between spatial structure, market design, and adaptive firm behavior, limiting our understanding of where and how symbiosis arises. We develop an agent-based model where heterogeneous firms trade byproducts through a spatially embedded double-auction market, with prices and quantities emerging endogenously from local interactions. Leveraging reinforcement learning, firms adapt their bidding strategies to maximize profit while accounting for transport costs, disposal penalties, and resource scarcity. Simulation experiments reveal the economic and spatial conditions under which decentralized exchanges converge toward stable and efficient outcomes. Counterfactual regret analysis shows that sellers' strategies approach a near Nash equilibrium, while sensitivity analysis highlights how spatial structures and market parameters jointly govern circularity. Our model provides a basis for exploring policy interventions that seek to align firm incentives with sustainability goals, and more broadly demonstrates how decentralized coordination can emerge from adaptive agents in spatially constrained markets.</description>

      <title>Improved Bug Localization with AI Agents Leveraging Hypothesis and Dynamic Cognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Software bugs cost technology providers (e.g., AT&amp;T) billions annually and cause developers to spend roughly 50% of their time on bug resolution. Traditional methods for bug localization often analyze the suspiciousness of code components (e.g., methods, documents) in isolation, overlooking their connections with other components in the codebase. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI techniques have shown strong potential for code understanding, but still lack causal reasoning during code exploration and struggle to manage growing context effectively, limiting their capability. In this paper, we present a novel agentic technique for bug localization -- CogniGent -- that overcomes the limitations above by leveraging multiple AI agents capable of causal reasoning, call-graph-based root cause analysis and context engineering. It emulates developers-inspired debugging practices (a.k.a., dynamic cognitive debugging) and conducts hypothesis testing to support bug localization. We evaluate CogniGent on a curated dataset of 591 bug reports using three widely adopted performance metrics and compare it against six established baselines from the literature. Experimental results show that our technique consistently outperformed existing traditional and LLM-based techniques, achieving MAP improvements of 23.33-38.57% at the document and method levels. Similar gains were observed in MRR, with increases of 25.14-53.74% at both granularity levels. Statistical significance tests also confirm the superiority of our technique. By addressing the reasoning, dependency, and context limitations, CogniGent advances the state of bug localization, bridging human-like cognition with agentic automation for improved performance.</description>

      <title>An Agentic Operationalization of DISARM for FIMI Investigation on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interoperability of data and intelligence across allied partners and their respective end-user groups is considered a foundational enabler of the collective defense capability -- both conventional and hybrid -- of NATO countries. Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI) and related hybrid activities are conducted across various societal dimensions and infospheres, posing an ever greater challenge to threat characterization, sustained situational awareness, and response coordination. Recent advances in AI have further reduced the cost of AI-augmented trolling and interference activities, such as through the generation and amplification of manipulative content. Despite the introduction of the DISARM framework as a standardized metadata and analytical framework for FIMI, operationalizing it at the scale of social media remains a challenge. We propose a framework-agnostic, agent-based operationalization of DISARM to investigate FIMI on social media. We develop an agent coordination pipeline in which specialized agentic AI components collaboratively (1) detect candidate manipulative behaviors and (2) map these behaviors onto standard DISARM taxonomies in a transparent manner. We evaluate the approach on two real-world datasets annotated by domain practitioners. Our results show that the approach is effective in scaling the predominantly manual and heavily interpretive work of FIMI analysis -- including uncovering more than 30 previously undetected Russian bot accounts during manual analysis -- and provides a direct contribution to enhancing situational awareness and data interoperability in the context of operating in media- and information-rich settings.</description>

      <title>Learning Decentralized LLM Collaboration with Multi-Agent Actor Critic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work has explored optimizing LLM collaboration through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, most MARL fine-tuning approaches rely on predefined execution protocols, which often require centralized execution. Decentralized LLM collaboration is more appealing in practice, as agents can run inference in parallel with flexible deployments. Also, current approaches use Monte Carlo methods for fine-tuning, which suffer from high variance and thus require more samples to train effectively. Actor-critic methods are prevalent in MARL for dealing with these issues, so we developed Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration. In this paper, we analyze when and why these MAAC methods are beneficial. We propose 2 MAAC approaches, \textbf{CoLLM-CC} with a \textbf{C}entralized \textbf{C}ritic and \textbf{CoLLM-DC} with \textbf{D}ecentralized \textbf{C}ritics. Our experiments across writing, coding, and game-playing domains show that Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC can achieve performance comparable to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon and dense-reward settings. However, they both underperform CoLLM-CC on long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks, where Monte Carlo methods require substantially more samples and CoLLM-DC struggles to converge.

      <title>Persuasion Propagation in LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern AI agents increasingly combine conversational interaction with autonomous task execution, such as coding and web research, raising a natural question: what happens when an agent engaged in long-horizon tasks is subjected to user persuasion? We study how belief-level intervention can influence downstream task behavior, a phenomenon we name \emph{persuasion propagation}. We introduce a behavior-centered evaluation framework that distinguishes between persuasion applied during or prior to task execution. Across web research and coding tasks, we find that on-the-fly persuasion induces weak and inconsistent behavioral effects. In contrast, when the belief state is explicitly specified at task time, belief-prefilled agents conduct on average 26.9\% fewer searches and visit 16.9\% fewer unique sources than neutral-prefilled agents. These results suggest that persuasion, even in prior interaction, can affect the agent's behavior, motivating behavior-level evaluation in agentic systems.</description>

      <title>ROMA: Recursive Open Meta-Agent Framework for Long-Horizon Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current agentic frameworks underperform on long-horizon tasks. As reasoning depth increases, sequential orchestration becomes brittle, context windows impose hard limits that degrade performance, and opaque execution traces make failures difficult to localize or debug. We introduce ROMA (Recursive Open Meta-Agents), a domain-agnostic framework that addresses these limitations through recursive task decomposition and structured aggregation. ROMA decomposes goals into dependency-aware subtask trees that can be executed in parallel, while aggregation compresses and validates intermediate results to control context growth. Our framework standardizes agent construction around four modular roles --Atomizer (which decides whether a task should be decomposed), Planner, Executor, and Aggregator -- which cleanly separate orchestration from model selection and enable transparent, hierarchical execution traces. This design supports heterogeneous multi-agent systems that mix models and tools according to cost, latency, and capability. To adapt ROMA to specific tasks without fine-tuning, we further introduce GEPA$+$, an improved Genetic-Pareto prompt proposer that searches over prompts within ROMA's component hierarchy while preserving interface contracts. We show that ROMA, combined with GEPA+, delivers leading system-level performance on reasoning and long-form generation benchmarks. On SEAL-0, which evaluates reasoning over conflicting web evidence, ROMA instantiated with GLM-4.6 improves accuracy by 9.9\% over Kimi-Researcher. On EQ-Bench, a long-form writing benchmark, ROMA enables DeepSeek-V3 to match the performance of leading closed-source models such as Claude Sonnet 4.5. Our results demonstrate that recursive, modular agent architectures can scale reasoning depth while remaining interpretable, flexible, and model-agnostic.</description>
