      <title>Einstein-Cartan cosmology and the S8 problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurements of cluster abundances, gravitational lensings, redshift space distortions and peculiar velocities at lower redshifts point out to much smaller sigma_8 than its value deduced from the measurements of the CMB fluctuations assuming the standard LCDM cosmology. We examine and compare the sigma_8 redshift dependence calculated within the gauge invariant formalism in the LCDM and the Einstein-Cartan cosmology. It appears that the Einstein-Cartan cosmology provides systematically larger sigma_8(z) for higher redshifts compared to the LCDM. Because the CMB fluctuations comprise a cosmological data from the recombination era to the present, the S8 problem of the LCDM cosmology is not a surprise from the standpoint of the Einstein-Cartan cosmology.</description>

      <title>Cosmic acceleration as a gravitational bifurcation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an interpretation of the observed cosmic acceleration in Friedmann universes as a gravitational bifurcation. Mathematically this becomes possible due to the degenerate nature of the Friedmann equations leading to their versal unfolding that contains all possible stable perturbations in a generic way. Physically it corresponds to the tendency of Friedmann universes for non-equilibrium evolution leading to self-organization, and maintaining overall stability through local instabilities emerging as parameter-dependent states. In this way, we obtain a variety of accelerating solutions attracted by past Milne-like and future open states describing geometries with evolving entropy which are near the simplest Friedmann universes (in a precise sense), without a need for a cosmological constant or vacuum energy, quintessence, or modified gravity.</description>

      <title>Effective fields approach for the Maxwell's equations for a mechano-driven media system that moves without solid translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For engineering electromagnetism, one of a typical case is that a medium/object rotates possibly with a deformable time-dependent shape. The electrodynamic behavior of such a system is governed by the Maxwell's equations for a mechano-driven media system (MEs-f-MDMS). Here, by defining the effective electric and magnetic fields, the MEs-f-MDMS reduces to the standard form of the Maxwell's equations (MEs) if the medium has no translational motion. This means that the accelerated motion of a medium is a source for generating electromagnetic wave, while the propagation of the waves in the system follows the classical MEs. Therefore, the standard methods for solving the MEs can be adequately applied. We first present the theoretical derivation, then we will present the solutions of the MEs-f-MDMS in both time- and frequency space. Secondly, the shortcomings in classical approach regarding to the calculation of electromagnetic radiation from a rotating medium is analyzed. Thirdly, the theory about the impact of medium rotation on reflection and transmission of a plane wave at an interface is considered. Fourth, the theory for quantifying the output of triboelectric nanogenerator is given. Fifth, since the effective fields warrant the covariance of the MEs, the Lorentz transformation can be introduced for extrapolating the effective medium theory to a case there is a translation motion of the system. Finally, recent progresses about the experimental proofs in supporting the MEs-f-MDMS are covered.</description>

      <title>Kinematical breaking of symmetry : A physical interpretation of Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05495v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new interpretation of the Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) mechanism is proposed. According to the basic premise of relativistic quantum field theory, quantum vacuum before symmetry is broken is not a quiet state, but a relativistic many-body state of virtual massless fermion and antifermion taking both timelike and spacelike paths. In order for the many-body state to have a physical meaning independently of observers, virtual massless fermions and antifermions there should move along a common direction of time from the past to the future, even if they are observed from any inertial fame. As a lowest-energy-state satisfying this condition, the physical vacuum with broken symmetry is derived. Since it is a kinematical breaking of symmetry, whatever effective interaction acts on massless fermion, it generates fermion's mass, because it is freed from the role of causing symmetry breaking. In the physical vacuum, virtual massless pairs of fermion and antifermion behave as quasi bosons. Due to Bose statistics, their transverse excitations are suppressed by an energy gap, which explains the origin of the vacuum condensate in the BEH potential. As a response to the dynamic part of the above effective interaction, a Higgs-like excitation appears. This interpretation sheds a new light on the BEH mechanism.</description>
