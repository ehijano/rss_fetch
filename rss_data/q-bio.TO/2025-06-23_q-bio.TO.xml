      <title>Stumbling around uncharted regulatory structures: NAcrins, or the perspective of specialized sources of modulatory non-coding RNAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The revelation of the supreme authority of nucleic acids in the cellular landscape has precipitated the recognition of the versatility of RNAs in cells. The subsequent discovery of non-coding RNAs was a major breakthrough that revealed their extensive involvement in virtually all physiological processes within the cell. Beyond the barriers of the cell, the current perception seems to support the idea of their participation in intercellular regulation and cross-kingdom communication. However, the presence of non-coding RNAs in the extracellular environment remains essentially a mystery, and the understanding of the significance and the processes governing this presence faces several constraints. This has led us to forge an original and predictive idea that seems to allow an emancipation from the various constraints posed in the current perception of the cited phenomena. In this paper, we will attempt to explore the extent of the probable existence of cellular organizations specializing in the production and management of non-coding RNAs. We will try, through the development of this hypothesis, to draw a picture explaining the significance and logistics of extracellular non-coding RNAs, with an emphasis on microRNAs. This exercise will be realized while relying on and confronting purely theoretical points of view, as well as relevant experimental results. In this manuscript, we will address the presumed morphology, intracellular organization, selective export, transport, transfer, distribution, reception and intracellular function of non-coding RNAs, in the perspective of a regulation cycle orchestrated by NAcrins under normal or disturbed physiological contexts.</description>

      <title>The Sex-Dependent Effects of Psychedelics on Myelination in APOE4 Mice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several studies have linked myelin abnormalities with neuropsychiatric disorders; others have implicated psychedelics as a potential therapeutic for such conditions. One risk factor for these demyelinating disorders is a mutation in the Apolipoprotein E gene known as APOE4. This variant impedes the cholesterol regulation of oligodendrocytes responsible for the myelination, or insulation, of neurons when compared to the wild-type phenotype. In this work, I advance knowledge of cellular pathways involved in the progression of APOE4-related diseases and elucidate the effects of psychedelics on the brain. Myelin sheaths are vital for maintaining neural pathways, and healthy oligodendrocytes serve as a prerequisite for axonal integrity. Further, the Kaufer Lab has observed significant behavioral differences between male and female APOE4 mice following psychedelic treatment with 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine, or DOI, a serotonin receptor ligand. The sex-dependent mechanisms influencing symptom differences and treatment outcomes in AD are unclear, and could be key to developing successful therapeutics for myelin-related issues. I hypothesize that administration of DOI will increase the myelination activity of oligodendrocytes in female APOE4 mice compared with their male counterparts or controls. Preliminary results show a significant increase in MBP in the CA1, or short-term, and CA2, or long term, areas in only female APOE4 mice post-introduction of DOI to the system. This aligns with behavioral data indicating fewer anxiety-related behaviors in female APOE4 mice after DOI administration. These findings reveal distinct biological mechanisms in male and female brain degeneration and suggest potential for sex-specific therapeutics.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised risk factor identification across cancer types and data modalities via explainable artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Risk stratification is a key tool in clinical decision-making, yet current approaches often fail to translate sophisticated survival analysis into actionable clinical criteria. We present a novel method for unsupervised machine learning that directly optimizes for survival heterogeneity across patient clusters through a differentiable adaptation of the multivariate logrank statistic. Unlike most existing methods that rely on proxy metrics, our approach represents novel methodology for training any neural network architecture on any data modality to identify prognostically distinct patient groups. We thoroughly evaluate the method in simulation experiments and demonstrate its utility in practice by applying it to two distinct cancer types: analyzing laboratory parameters from multiple myeloma patients and computed tomography images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, identifying prognostically distinct patient subgroups with significantly different survival outcomes in both cases. Post-hoc explainability analyses uncover clinically meaningful features determining the group assignments which align well with established risk factors and thus lend strong weight to the methods utility. This pan-cancer, model-agnostic approach represents a valuable advancement in clinical risk stratification, enabling the discovery of novel prognostic signatures across diverse data types while providing interpretable results that promise to complement treatment personalization and clinical decision-making in oncology and beyond.</description>
