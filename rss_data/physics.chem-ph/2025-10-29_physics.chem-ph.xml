      <title>Benchmarking a foundation potential against quantum chemistry methods for predicting molecular redox potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational high-throughput virtual screening is essential for identifying redox-active molecules for sustainable applications such as electrochemical carbon capture. A primary challenge in this approach is the high computational cost associated with accurate quantum chemistry calculations. Machine learning foundation potentials (FPs) trained on extensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations offer a computationally efficient alternative. Here, we benchmark the MACE-OMol-0 FP against a hierarchy of DFT functionals for predicting experimental molecular redox potentials for both electron transfer (ET) and proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions. We find that MACE-OMol achieves exceptional accuracy for PCET processes, rivaling its target DFT method. However, its performance is diminished for ET reactions, particularly for multi-electron transfers involving reactive ions that are underrepresented in the OMol25 training data, revealing a key out-of-distribution limitation. To overcome this, we propose an optimal hybrid workflow that uses the FP for efficient geometry optimization and thermochemical analysis, followed by a crucial single-point DFT energy refinement and an implicit solvation correction. This pragmatic approach provides a robust and scalable strategy for accelerating high-throughput virtual screening in sustainable chemistry.</description>

      <title>Atomic and electronic structure of poly-[Ni(Salen)]: combined study by XPS, UV PES, NEXAFS and DFT methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A detailed study of poly-[Ni(Salen)] polymer in its oxidized (Ox) and reduced (Red) states was conducted using X-ray photoelectron (XPS) and ultraviolet photoemission (UV PES) spectroscopy, near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy, and quantum-chemical calculations. XPS analysis revealed significant energy shifts (-1.5 to -1.8 eV) and broadening of the PE lines for all atoms upon polymerization, indicating a major redistribution of valence electron density between the monomer fragments. In the oxidized polymer, new features in the Ni 2p and O 1s PE spectra were associated with the formation of polarons with weakened Ni-O bonds; this effect diminished upon reduction as the number of polarons decreased. Quantum-chemical calculations attributed the valence band broadening to enhanced C 2p contributions from $\pi$-conjugation between monomers. NEXAFS spectroscopy confirmed the stability of the ethylenediamine fragment and the direct involvement of the phenolic rings of the salen ligand in polymerization, also revealing a partial weakening and incomplete restoration of the $\pi$ bonding between O and Ni atoms upon reduction. Furthermore, it was shown that it is the $BF_{4}^-$ anions that weaken the Ni-O bonds during oxidation, which are partially preserved in the reduced state.</description>

      <title>eT 2.0: An efficient open-source molecular electronic structure program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eT program is an open-source electronic structure program with emphasis on performance and modularity. As its name suggests, the program features extensive coupled cluster capabilities, performing well compared to other electronic structure programs, and, in some cases, outperforming commercial alternatives. However, eT is more than a coupled cluster program; other models based on wave function theory (such as full and reduced space configuration interaction and a variety of self-consistent field models) and density functional theory are supported. The second major release of the program, eT 2.0, has In addition, it includes a wide range of optimizations and algorithmic improvements, as well as new capabilities for exploring potential energy surfaces and for modeling experiments in the UV and X-ray regimes. Molecular gradients are now available at the coupled cluster level, and high-accuracy spectroscopic simulations are available at reduced computational cost within the multilevel coupled cluster and multiscale frameworks. We present the modifications to the program since its first major release, eT 1.0, highlighting some notable new features and demonstrating the performance of the new version relative to the first release and to other established electronic structure programs.</description>

      <title>When bubbles matter: hydrogen transport governs apparent kinetics in 4-nitrophenol hydrogenation reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NiP) with sodium borohydride is widely used to benchmark heterogeneous catalysts, yet its kinetics are commonly oversimplified as pseudo-first-order. In reality, borohydride hydrolysis and hydrogenation by dissolved hydrogen proceed concurrently, making hydrogen transport a decisive factor in shaping apparent activity. Re-examining data on Pt-SiO2 supraparticles with different pore structures, we attribute contrasting kinetic behavior to distinct regimes of hydrogen transport: diffusive transport sustains pseudo-first-order kinetics, while bubble-mediated escape causes hydrogen loss and incomplete conversion. We propose a kinetic model that captures this transition and enables consistent interpretation of experimental data. More broadly, our analysis shows that apparent differences in activity during 4-NiP benchmarking can arise from hydrogen transport rather than intrinsic properties of the catalyst, underscoring the need to account for transport effects when comparing catalyst performance.</description>

      <title>TriDS: AI-native molecular docking framework unified with binding site identification, conformational sampling and scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular docking is a cornerstone of drug discovery to unveil the mechanism of ligand-receptor interactions. With the recent development of deep learning in the field of artificial intelligence, innovative methods were developed for molecular docking. However, the mainstream docking programs adopt a docking-then-rescoring streamline to increase the docking accuracy, which make the virtual screening process cumbersome. Moreover, there still lacks a unified framework to integrate binding site identification, conformational sampling and scoring, in a user-friendly manner. In our previous work of DSDP and its subsequent flexible version, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of guiding conformational sampling with the gradient of analytic scoring function. As the third generation of DSDP, here we expanded the similar strategy to ML-based differentiable scoring model to device a novel docking method named TriDS under the mainstream AI training framework, which unifies the sampling and scoring steps. To be user-friendly, TriDS also integrates ML-based model for binding site prediction and has compatibility with multiple input file formats. We show here that gradients of a suitable ML-based scoring function can lead to excellent docking accuracy in the benchmark datasets, especially for large ligands. Moreover, TriDS is implemented with enhanced computational efficiency in terms of both running speed and GPU memory requirement.</description>

      <title>From Nucleobases to DNA: Clustering-Triggered Emission and Pressure-Induced Emission Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photophysical properties of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) are fundamental to life sciences and biophotonics. While previous studies have generally been restricted to fluorescence, attributing it to pi-pi* transitions and charge transfer within nucleobases in dilute solution, these understandings fail to explain the pronounced visible emission in physiological and aggregated states, and moreover, ignore the possible phosphorescence. Addressing this critical gap, we systematically investigate native DNA across its structural hierarchy, from nucleobases to single-stranded chains, under varying states. We demonstrate that DNA exhibits excitation-dependent emission in aggregates and moreover room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in the solid state. These behaviors are rationalized by the clustering-triggered emission (CTE) mechanism, where nucleobases and electron-rich nonaromatic moieties like sugar and phosphate synergistically contribute to DNA photophysics. High-pressure experiments reveal a 207-fold luminescence enhancement for nucleotides at 26 GPa, largely retained after decompression, underscoring the precise control of emission by intermolecular interactions. This study not only elucidates the intrinsic luminescence mechanism of DNA and but also establishes pressure modulation as a versatile approach for developing new nucleic acid-inspired luminescent materials.</description>

      <title>Regularised density-potential inversion for periodic systems: application to exact exchange in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A detailed convex analysis-based formulation of density-functional theory for periodic systems in arbitrary dimensions is presented. The electron-electron interaction is taken to be of Yukawa type, harmonising with underlying function spaces for densities and wave functions. Moreau--Yosida regularisation of the underlying non-interacting density functionals is then considered, allowing us to recast the Hohenberg--Kohn mapping in a form that is insensitive to perturbations (non-expansiveness) and lends itself to numerical implementation. The general theory is exemplified with a numerical Hartree--Fock implementation for one-dimensional systems. We discuss in particular the challenge of self-consistent field optimisation in calculations related to the regularised noninteracting Hohenberg--Kohn map. The implementation is used to demonstrate that it is practically feasible to recover local Kohn--Sham potentials reproducing the effects of exact exchange within this scheme, which provides a proof-of-principle for recovering the exchange-correlation potential at more accurate levels of theory. Error analysis is performed for the regularised inverse Kohn--Sham algorithm by quantifying, both theoretically and numerically, how perturbations of the input ground-state density propagate through the regularised density-to-potential map.</description>

      <title>Electrochemical Electron Transfer: Key Concepts, Theories, and Parameterization via Atomistic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron transfer (ET) at electrochemical interfaces is central to energy conversion and storage, yet its theoretical and computational modeling remain active research areas. This review elucidates key concepts and theories of ET kinetics, focusing on coupling between classical solvent fluctuations and quantum electronic states of metallic electrodes and redox species. We begin with fundamental rate theories, reaction coordinates, and electrochemical timescales, then explore weak, strong, and intermediate electronic coupling regimes. Special attention is given to solvent dynamics and the structure of the electrical double layer (EDL), which critically impact ET kinetics. Atomistic simulations, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD), are highlighted for testing linear response and determining solvent reorganization energy, electronic coupling strengths, and solvent relaxation dynamics. A central theme is linear response enabling tractable treatments across Marcus theory, empirical valence bond (EVB) models, the Anderson-Newns-Schmickler framework, and generalized Langevin dynamics. While linear response offers useful simplifications, we assess its limitations, particularly for strong solvation changes or inner-sphere ET at catalytic interfaces. We discuss advances, including mapping Hamiltonian-based EVB-MD, constrained DFT, and non-Gaussian free energy formulations, enabling rigorous tests and access to diabatic and adiabatic free energy surfaces. We outline opportunities to advance multiscale, quantum-classical models that integrate EDL effects, multiple reaction coordinates, solvent-controlled dynamics, and transitions between adiabatic and nonadiabatic regimes. This review serves as a conceptual guide and practical resource for researchers integrating theory and simulation in studying electrochemical ET across diverse systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamical system analysis of quantum tunneling in an asymmetric double-well potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum tunneling in an asymmetric double-well potential using a dynamical systems--based approach rooted in the Ehrenfest formalism. In this framework, the time evolution of a Gaussian wave packet is governed by a hierarchy of coupled equations linking lower- and higher-order position moments. An approximate closure, required to render the system tractable, yields a reduced dynamical system for the mean and variance, with skewness entering explicitly due to the potential's asymmetry. Stability analysis of this system identifies energy thresholds for detectable tunneling across the barrier and reveals regimes where tunneling, though theoretically allowed, remains practically undetectable. Comparison with full numerical solutions of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation shows that, beyond reproducing key tunneling features, the dynamical systems approach provides an interpretable description of quantum transport through tunneling in an effective asymmetric two-level system.</description>

      <title>Multiscale, Techno-economic Evaluation of Isoreticular Series of CALF-20 for Biogas Upgrading using a Pressure/Vacuum Swing Adsorption (PVSA) Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cyclic swing adsorption processes, such as pressure/vacuum swing adsorption (PVSA), are a promising technology for upgrading biogas by separating carbon dioxide (CO2) from methane (CH4). The rational design of adsorbent materials with tailored properties is important for the deployment of high-performance PVSA technology. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), particularly the CALF-20 isoreticular series, have attracted interest due to their high CO2 selectivity, thermal, and water stability. In this study, we report a multiscale assessment of CALF-20 and its isoreticular five derivatives by integrating molecular simulations with PVSA process optimization and techno-economic analysis. Structural and adsorption characteristics were calculated and employed to assess how each material performs in terms of energy efficiency and cost. The analysis reveals distinct differences in cost performance among the CALF-20 series, with CALF-20 showing the most favorable economics with \gt97\% purity CH4 production cost at \$4.31 per kg of CH4 and energy consumption of 9.35 kWh per kg of CH4. This study demonstrates that the integrated molecular-process optimization framework can effectively guide the search for adsorbent materials for biogas upgrading.</description>

      <title>MolErr2Fix: Benchmarking LLM Trustworthiness in Chemistry via Modular Error Detection, Localization, Explanation, and Revision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00063v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown growing potential in molecular sciences, but they often produce chemically inaccurate descriptions and struggle to recognize or justify potential errors. This raises important concerns about their robustness and reliability in scientific applications. To support more rigorous evaluation of LLMs in chemical reasoning, we present the MolErr2Fix benchmark, designed to assess LLMs on error detection and correction in molecular descriptions. Unlike existing benchmarks focused on molecule-to-text generation or property prediction, MolErr2Fix emphasizes fine-grained chemical understanding. It tasks LLMs with identifying, localizing, explaining, and revising potential structural and semantic errors in molecular descriptions. Specifically, MolErr2Fix consists of 1,193 fine-grained annotated error instances. Each instance contains quadruple annotations, i.e,. (error type, span location, the explanation, and the correction). These tasks are intended to reflect the types of reasoning and verification required in real-world chemical communication. Evaluations of current state-of-the-art LLMs reveal notable performance gaps, underscoring the need for more robust chemical reasoning capabilities. MolErr2Fix provides a focused benchmark for evaluating such capabilities and aims to support progress toward more reliable and chemically informed language models. All annotations and an accompanying evaluation API will be publicly released to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>FragFM: Hierarchical Framework for Efficient Molecule Generation via Fragment-Level Discrete Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15805v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce FragFM, a novel hierarchical framework via fragment-level discrete flow matching for efficient molecular graph generation. FragFM generates molecules at the fragment level, leveraging a coarse-to-fine autoencoder to reconstruct details at the atom level. Together with a stochastic fragment bag strategy to effectively handle an extensive fragment space, our framework enables more efficient and scalable molecular generation. We demonstrate that our fragment-based approach achieves better property control than the atom-based method and additional flexibility through conditioning the fragment bag. We also propose a Natural Product Generation benchmark (NPGen) to evaluate modern molecular graph generative models' ability to generate natural product-like molecules. Since natural products are biologically prevalidated and differ from typical drug-like molecules, our benchmark provides a more challenging yet meaningful evaluation relevant to drug discovery. We conduct a FragFM comparative study against various models on diverse molecular generation benchmarks, including NPGen, demonstrating superior performance. The results highlight the potential of fragment-based generative modeling for large-scale, property-aware molecular design, paving the way for more efficient exploration of chemical space.</description>

      <title>Pre-trained knowledge elevates large language models beyond traditional chemical reaction optimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern optimization in experimental chemistry employs algorithmic search through black-box parameter spaces. Here we demonstrate that pre-trained knowledge in large language models (LLMs) fundamentally changes this paradigm. Using six fully enumerated categorical reaction datasets (768-5,684 experiments), we benchmark LLM-guided optimization (LLM-GO) against Bayesian optimization (BO) and random sampling. Frontier LLMs consistently match or exceed BO performance across five single-objective datasets, with advantages growing as parameter complexity increases and high-performing conditions become scarce (&lt;5% of space). BO retains superiority only for explicit multi-objective trade-offs. To understand these contrasting behaviors, we introduce a topology-agnostic information theory framework quantifying sampling diversity throughout optimization campaigns. This analysis reveals that LLMs maintain systematically higher exploration Shannon entropy than BO across all datasets while achieving superior performance, with advantages most pronounced in solution-scarce parameter spaces where high-entropy exploration typically fails-suggesting that pre-trained domain knowledge enables more effective navigation of chemical parameter space rather than replacing structured exploration strategies. To enable transparent benchmarking and community validation, we release Iron Mind (https://gomes.andrew.cmu.edu/iron-mind), a no-code platform for side-by-side evaluation of human, algorithmic, and LLM optimization campaigns with public leaderboards and complete trajectories. Our findings establish that LLM-GO excels precisely where traditional methods struggle: complex categorical spaces requiring domain understanding rather than mathematical optimization.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium mechanical motion of double-stranded DNA in a molecular junction under electronic current using Keldysh-Langevin molecular dynamics. Non-equilibrium electronic force reshapes the effective potential energy surface, and along with electronic viscosity force and stochastic force, governs voltage-dependent dynamics of DNA's collective mechanical coordinate. We compute mean first-passage times to quantify the non-equilibrium lifetime of the DNA junction. At low voltage biases, electron-mechanical motion coupling destabilises DNA by shifting the potential minimum towards critical displacement and suppressing barriers, shortening lifetimes by several orders of magnitude. Unexpectedly, at higher voltages the trend reverses: the potential minimum shifts away from instability and the barrier re-emerges, producing re-stabilisation of the junction. In addition, we demonstrate the Landauer blowtorch effect in this system: coordinate-dependent fluctuations generate a spatially varying effective temperature, changing current-induced dynamics of mechanical degrees of freedom. Apparent temperatures of DNA mechanical motion increase far above ambient due to current-induced heating, correlating with suppressed electronic current at stronger couplings. Our results reveal a non-equilibrium interplay between current-driven forces, dissipation, and fluctuations in DNA junctions, establishing mechanisms for both destabilisation and recovery of DNA stability under electronic current.</description>

      <title>Topological Control of Transition Metal Networks for Reversible High-Capacity Li-rich Cathodes</title>

Abstract: Developing high-energy-density batteries is essential for advancing sustainable energy technologies. However, leading cathode materials such as Li-rich oxides, including Li$_2$MnO$_3$, suffer from capacity loss due to irreversible oxygen release and structural degradation, both consequences of the oxygen redox activity that also enables their high capacity. The atomic-scale mechanisms behind this degradation, and whether it can be made reversible, remain open questions. Here, using submicrosecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations with first-principles accuracy, we directly visualize the entire charge-discharge cycle of Li$_2$MnO$_3$, uncovering the full lifecycle of the O$_2$-filled nanovoids responsible for degradation and identifying the critical size limit for voids to remain fully repairable upon discharge. Our results reveal that the topology of the Mn cation network is the key factor governing void growth, coalescence, and reparability. Based on a structural topology-informed design principle, we computationally develop a novel Li$_2$MnO$_3$ structure featuring a Mn lattice with a Kagome-like pattern, demonstrating full electrochemical reversibility even under extreme 80% delithiation. Our work establishes a new paradigm for designing high-energy cathodes, shifting the focus from mitigating damage to engineering inherent stability through atomic-level topological control of transition metal network.</description>
