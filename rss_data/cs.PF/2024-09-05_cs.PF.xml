      <title>Towards a Scalable and Efficient PGAS-based Distributed OpenMP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MPI+X has been the de facto standard for distributed memory parallel programming. It is widely used primarily as an explicit two-sided communication model, which often leads to complex and error-prone code. Alternatively, PGAS model utilizes efficient one-sided communication and more intuitive communication primitives. In this paper, we present a novel approach that integrates PGAS concepts into the OpenMP programming model, leveraging the LLVM compiler infrastructure and the GASNet-EX communication library. Our model addresses the complexity associated with traditional MPI+OpenMP programming models while ensuring excellent performance and scalability. We evaluate our approach using a set of micro-benchmarks and application kernels on two distinct platforms: Ookami from Stony Brook University and NERSC Perlmutter. The results demonstrate that DiOMP achieves superior bandwidth and lower latency compared to MPI+OpenMP, up to 25% higher bandwidth and down to 45% on latency. DiOMP offers a promising alternative to the traditional MPI+OpenMP hybrid programming model, towards providing a more productive and efficient way to develop high-performance parallel applications for distributed memory systems.</description>

      <title>Spatial Queues with Nearest Neighbour Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies queues in a Euclidean space. Consider $N$ servers that are distributed uniformly in $[0,1]^d$. Customers arrive at the servers according to independent stationary processes. Upon arrival, they probabilistically decide whether to join the queue they arrived at, or shift to one of the nearest neighbours. Such shifting strategies affect the load on the servers, and may cause some of the servers to become overloaded. We derive a law of large numbers and a central limit theorem for the fraction of overloaded servers in the system as the total number of servers $N \to \infty$. Additionally, in the one-dimensional case ($d=1$), we evaluate the expected fraction of overloaded servers for any finite $N$. Numerical experiments are provided to support our theoretical results. Typical applications of the results include electric vehicles queueing at charging stations, and queues in airports or supermarkets.</description>
