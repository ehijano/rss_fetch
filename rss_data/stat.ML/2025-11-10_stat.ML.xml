      <title>Prototype Selection Using Topological Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been an explosion in statistical learning literature to represent data using topological principles to capture structure and relationships. We propose a topological data analysis (TDA)-based framework, named Topological Prototype Selector (TPS), for selecting representative subsets (prototypes) from large datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TPS on simulated data under different data intrinsic characteristics, and compare TPS against other currently used prototype selection methods in real data settings. In all simulated and real data settings, TPS significantly preserves or improves classification performance while substantially reducing data size. These contributions advance both algorithmic and geometric aspects of prototype learning and offer practical tools for parallelized, interpretable, and efficient classification.</description>

      <title>Estimating Bidirectional Causal Effects with Large Scale Online Kernel Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, a scalable online kernel learning framework is proposed for estimating bidirectional causal effects in systems characterized by mutual dependence and heteroskedasticity. Traditional causal inference often focuses on unidirectional effects, overlooking the common bidirectional relationships in real-world phenomena. Building on heteroskedasticity-based identification, the proposed method integrates a quasi-maximum likelihood estimator for simultaneous equation models with large scale online kernel learning. It employs random Fourier feature approximations to flexibly model nonlinear conditional means and variances, while an adaptive online gradient descent algorithm ensures computational efficiency for streaming and high-dimensional data. Results from extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior accuracy and stability than single equation and polynomial approximation baselines, exhibiting lower bias and root mean squared error across various data-generating processes. These results confirm that the proposed approach effectively captures complex bidirectional causal effects with near-linear computational scaling. By combining econometric identification with modern machine learning techniques, the proposed framework offers a practical, scalable, and theoretically grounded solution for large scale causal inference in natural/social science, policy making, business, and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>A New Framework for Convex Clustering in Kernel Spaces: Finite Sample Bounds, Consistency and Performance Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convex clustering is a well-regarded clustering method, resembling the similar centroid-based approach of Lloyd's $k$-means, without requiring a predefined cluster count. It starts with each data point as its centroid and iteratively merges them. Despite its advantages, this method can fail when dealing with data exhibiting linearly non-separable or non-convex structures. To mitigate the limitations, we propose a kernelized extension of the convex clustering method. This approach projects the data points into a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) using a feature map, enabling convex clustering in this transformed space. This kernelization not only allows for better handling of complex data distributions but also produces an embedding in a finite-dimensional vector space. We provide a comprehensive theoretical underpinnings for our kernelized approach, proving algorithmic convergence and establishing finite sample bounds for our estimates. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art clustering techniques. This work marks a significant advancement in the field, offering an effective solution for clustering in non-linear and non-convex data scenarios.</description>

      <title>Self-adaptive weighting and sampling for physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed deep learning has emerged as a promising framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Nevertheless, training these models on complex problems remains challenging, often leading to limited accuracy and efficiency. In this work, we introduce a hybrid adaptive sampling and weighting method to enhance the performance of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The adaptive sampling component identifies training points in regions where the solution exhibits rapid variation, while the adaptive weighting component balances the convergence rate across training points. Numerical experiments show that applying only adaptive sampling or only adaptive weighting is insufficient to consistently achieve accurate predictions, particularly when training points are scarce. Since each method emphasizes different aspects of the solution, their effectiveness is problem dependent. By combining both strategies, the proposed framework consistently improves prediction accuracy and training efficiency, offering a more robust approach for solving PDEs with PINNs.</description>

      <title>QCircuitBench: A Large-Scale Dataset for Benchmarking Quantum Algorithm Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07961v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is an emerging field recognized for the significant speedup it offers over classical computing through quantum algorithms. However, designing and implementing quantum algorithms pose challenges due to the complex nature of quantum mechanics and the necessity for precise control over quantum states. Despite the significant advancements in AI, there has been a lack of datasets specifically tailored for this purpose. In this work, we introduce QCircuitBench, the first benchmark dataset designed to evaluate AI's capability in designing and implementing quantum algorithms using quantum programming languages. Unlike using AI for writing traditional codes, this task is fundamentally more complicated due to highly flexible design space. Our key contributions include: 1. A general framework which formulates the key features of quantum algorithm design for Large Language Models. 2. Implementations for quantum algorithms from basic primitives to advanced applications, spanning 3 task suites, 25 algorithms, and 120,290 data points. 3. Automatic validation and verification functions, allowing for iterative evaluation and interactive reasoning without human inspection. 4. Promising potential as a training dataset through preliminary fine-tuning results. We observed several interesting experimental phenomena: LLMs tend to exhibit consistent error patterns, and fine-tuning does not always outperform few-shot learning. In all, QCircuitBench is a comprehensive benchmark for LLM-driven quantum algorithm design, and it reveals limitations of LLMs in this domain.</description>

      <title>Generalization in Representation Models via Random Matrix Theory: Application to Recurrent Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We first study the generalization error of models that use a fixed feature representation (frozen intermediate layers) followed by a trainable readout layer. This setting encompasses a range of architectures, from deep random-feature models to echo-state networks (ESNs) with recurrent dynamics. Working in the high-dimensional regime, we apply Random Matrix Theory to derive a closed-form expression for the asymptotic generalization error. We then apply this analysis to recurrent representations and obtain concise formula that characterize their performance. Surprisingly, we show that a linear ESN is equivalent to ridge regression with an exponentially time-weighted (''memory'') input covariance, revealing a clear inductive bias toward recent inputs. Experiments match predictions: ESNs win in low-sample, short-memory regimes, while ridge prevails with more data or long-range dependencies. Our methodology provides a general framework for analyzing overparameterized models and offers insights into the behavior of deep learning networks.</description>

      <title>Causal Structure and Representation Learning with Biomedical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive data collection holds the promise of a better understanding of complex phenomena and, ultimately, better decisions. Representation learning has become a key driver of deep learning applications, as it allows learning latent spaces that capture important properties of the data without requiring any supervised annotations. Although representation learning has been hugely successful in predictive tasks, it can fail miserably in causal tasks including predicting the effect of a perturbation/intervention. This calls for a marriage between representation learning and causal inference. An exciting opportunity in this regard stems from the growing availability of multi-modal data (observational and perturbational, imaging-based and sequencing-based, at the single-cell level, tissue-level, and organism-level). We outline a statistical and computational framework for causal structure and representation learning motivated by fundamental biomedical questions: how to effectively use observational and perturbational data to perform causal discovery on observed causal variables; how to use multi-modal views of the system to learn causal variables; and how to design optimal perturbations.</description>

      <title>Trained on Tokens, Calibrated on Concepts: The Emergence of Semantic Calibration in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack meaningful confidence estimates for their outputs. While base LLMs are known to exhibit next-token calibration, it remains unclear whether they can assess confidence in the actual meaning of their responses beyond the token level. We find that, when using a certain sampling-based notion of semantic calibration, base LLMs are remarkably well-calibrated: they can meaningfully assess confidence in open-domain question-answering tasks, despite not being explicitly trained to do so. Our main theoretical contribution establishes a mechanism for why semantic calibration emerges as a byproduct of next-token prediction, leveraging a recent connection between calibration and local loss optimality. The theory relies on a general definition of "B-calibration," which is a notion of calibration parameterized by a choice of equivalence classes (semantic or otherwise). This theoretical mechanism leads to a testable prediction: base LLMs will be semantically calibrated when they can easily predict their own distribution over semantic answer classes before generating a response. We state three implications of this prediction, which we validate through experiments: (1) Base LLMs are semantically calibrated across question-answering tasks, (2) RL instruction-tuning systematically breaks this calibration, and (3) chain-of-thought reasoning breaks calibration. To our knowledge, our work provides the first principled explanation of when and why semantic calibration emerges in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Swap Multicalibration of Elicitable Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multicalibration [HJKRR18] is an algorithmic fairness perspective that demands that the predictions of a predictor are correct conditional on themselves and membership in a collection of potentially overlapping subgroups of a population. The work of [NR23] established a surprising connection between multicalibration for an arbitrary property $\Gamma$ (e.g., mean or median) and property elicitation: a property $\Gamma$ can be multicalibrated if and only if it is elicitable, where elicitability is the notion that the true property value of a distribution can be obtained by solving a regression problem over the distribution. In the online setting, [NR23] proposed an inefficient algorithm that achieves $\sqrt T$ $\ell_2$-multicalibration error for a hypothesis class of group membership functions and an elicitable property $\Gamma$, after $T$ rounds of interaction between a forecaster and adversary.
  In this paper, we generalize multicalibration for an elicitable property $\Gamma$ from group membership functions to arbitrary bounded hypothesis classes and introduce a stronger notion -- swap multicalibration, following [GKR23]. Subsequently, we propose an oracle-efficient algorithm which, when given access to an online agnostic learner, achieves $T^{1/(r+1)}$ $\ell_r$-swap multicalibration error with high probability (for $r\ge2$) for a hypothesis class with bounded sequential Rademacher complexity and an elicitable property $\Gamma$. For the special case of $r=2$, this implies an oracle-efficient algorithm that achieves $T^{1/3}$ $\ell_2$-swap multicalibration error, which significantly improves on the previously established bounds for the problem [NR23, GMS25, LSS25a], and completely resolves an open question raised in [GJRR24] on the possibility of an oracle-efficient algorithm that achieves $\sqrt{T}$ $\ell_2$-mean multicalibration error by answering it in a strongly affirmative sense.</description>

      <title>Training and Testing with Multiple Splits: A Central Limit Theorem for Split-Sample Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As predictive algorithms grow in popularity, using the same dataset to both train and test a new model has become routine across research, policy, and industry. Sample-splitting attains valid inference on model properties by using separate subsamples to estimate the model and to evaluate it. However, this approach has two drawbacks, since each task uses only part of the data, and different splits can lead to widely different estimates. Averaging across multiple splits, I develop an inference approach that uses more data for training, uses the entire sample for testing, and improves reproducibility. I address the statistical dependence from reusing observations across splits by proving a new central limit theorem for a large class of split-sample estimators under arguably mild and general conditions. Importantly, I make no restrictions on model complexity or convergence rates. I show that confidence intervals based on the normal approximation are valid for many applications, but may undercover in important cases of interest, such as comparing the performance between two models. I develop a new inference approach for such cases, explicitly accounting for the dependence across splits. Moreover, I provide a measure of reproducibility for p-values obtained from split-sample estimators. Finally, I apply my results to two important problems in development and public economics: predicting poverty and learning heterogeneous treatment effects in randomized experiments. I show that my inference approach with repeated cross-fitting achieves better power than previous alternatives, often enough to find statistical significance that would otherwise be missed.</description>

      <title>Scaling Up ROC-Optimizing Support Vector Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ROC-SVM, originally proposed by Rakotomamonjy, directly maximizes the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and has become an attractive alternative of the conventional binary classification under the presence of class imbalance. However, its practical use is limited by high computational cost, as training involves evaluating all $O(n^2)$. To overcome this limitation, we develop a scalable variant of the ROC-SVM that leverages incomplete U-statistics, thereby substantially reducing computational complexity. We further extend the framework to nonlinear classification through a low-rank kernel approximation, enabling efficient training in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Theoretical analysis establishes an error bound that justifies the proposed approximation, and empirical results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable AUC performance to the original ROC-SVM with drastically reduced training time.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new way of training neural networks, with the goal of reducing training cost. Our method uses approximate predicted gradients instead of the full gradients that require an expensive backward pass. We derive a control-variate-based technique that ensures our updates are unbiased estimates of the true gradient. Moreover, we propose a novel way to derive a predictor for the gradient inspired by the theory of the Neural Tangent Kernel. We empirically show the efficacy of the technique on a vision transformer classification task.</description>

      <title>A Latent-Variable Formulation of the Poisson Canonical Polyadic Tensor Model: Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Fisher Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish parameter inference for the Poisson canonical polyadic (PCP) tensor model through a latent-variable formulation. Our approach exploits the observation that any random PCP tensor can be derived by marginalizing an unobservable random tensor of one dimension larger. The loglikelihood of this larger dimensional tensor, referred to as the "complete" loglikelihood, is comprised of multiple rank one PCP loglikelihoods. Using this methodology, we first derive non-iterative maximum likelihood estimators for the PCP model and demonstrate that several existing algorithms for fitting non-negative matrix and tensor factorizations are Expectation-Maximization algorithms. Next, we derive the observed and expected Fisher information matrices for the PCP model. The Fisher information provides us crucial insights into the well-posedness of the tensor model, such as the role that tensor rank plays in identifiability and indeterminacy. For the special case of rank one PCP models, we demonstrate that these results are greatly simplified.</description>

      <title>Near-Efficient and Non-Asymptotic Multiway Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish non-asymptotic efficiency guarantees for tensor decomposition-based inference in count data models. Under a Poisson framework, we consider two related goals: (i) parametric inference, the estimation of the full distributional parameter tensor, and (ii) multiway analysis, the recovery of its canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition factors. Our main result shows that in the rank-one setting, a rank-constrained maximum-likelihood estimator achieves multiway analysis with variance matching the Cram\'{e}r-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) up to absolute constants and logarithmic factors. This provides a general framework for studying "near-efficient" multiway estimators in finite-sample settings. For higher ranks, we illustrate that our multiway estimator may not attain the CRLB; nevertheless, CP-based parametric inference remains nearly minimax optimal, with error bounds that improve on prior work by offering more favorable dependence on the CP rank. Numerical experiments corroborate near-efficiency in the rank-one case and highlight the efficiency gap in higher-rank scenarios.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity of Distributionally Robust Off-Dynamics Reinforcement Learning with Online Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Off-dynamics reinforcement learning (RL), where training and deployment transition dynamics are different, can be formulated as learning in a robust Markov decision process (RMDP) where uncertainties in transition dynamics are imposed. Existing literature mostly assumes access to generative models allowing arbitrary state-action queries or pre-collected datasets with a good state coverage of the deployment environment, bypassing the challenge of exploration. In this work, we study a more realistic and challenging setting where the agent is limited to online interaction with the training environment. To capture the intrinsic difficulty of exploration in online RMDPs, we introduce the supremal visitation ratio, a novel quantity that measures the mismatch between the training dynamics and the deployment dynamics. We show that if this ratio is unbounded, online learning becomes exponentially hard. We propose the first computationally efficient algorithm that achieves sublinear regret in online RMDPs with $f$-divergence based transition uncertainties. We also establish matching regret lower bounds, demonstrating that our algorithm achieves optimal dependence on both the supremal visitation ratio and the number of interaction episodes. Finally, we validate our theoretical results through comprehensive numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Synapse: Adaptive Arbitration of Complementary Expertise in Time Series Foundational Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained Time Series Foundational Models (TSFMs) represent a significant advance, capable of forecasting diverse time series with complex characteristics, including varied seasonalities, trends, and long-range dependencies. Despite their primary goal of universal time series forecasting, their efficacy is far from uniform; divergent training protocols and data sources cause individual TSFMs to exhibit highly variable performance across different forecasting tasks, domains, and horizons. Leveraging this complementary expertise by arbitrating existing TSFM outputs presents a compelling strategy, yet this remains a largely unexplored area of research. In this paper, we conduct a thorough examination of how different TSFMs exhibit specialized performance profiles across various forecasting settings, and how we can effectively leverage this behavior in arbitration between different time series models. We specifically analyze how factors such as model selection and forecast horizon distribution can influence the efficacy of arbitration strategies. Based on this analysis, we propose Synapse, a novel arbitration framework for TSFMs. Synapse is designed to dynamically leverage a pool of TSFMs, assign and adjust predictive weights based on their relative, context-dependent performance, and construct a robust forecast distribution by adaptively sampling from the output quantiles of constituent models. Experimental results demonstrate that Synapse consistently outperforms other popular ensembling techniques as well as individual TSFMs, demonstrating Synapse's efficacy in time series forecasting.</description>

      <title>On Flow Matching KL Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a deterministic, non-asymptotic upper bound on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of the flow-matching distribution approximation. In particular, if the $L_2$ flow-matching loss is bounded by $\epsilon^2 &gt; 0$, then the KL divergence between the true data distribution and the estimated distribution is bounded by $A_1 \epsilon + A_2 \epsilon^2$. Here, the constants $A_1$ and $A_2$ depend only on the regularities of the data and velocity fields. Consequently, this bound implies statistical convergence rates of Flow Matching Transformers under the Total Variation (TV) distance. We show that, flow matching achieves nearly minimax-optimal efficiency in estimating smooth distributions. Our results make the statistical efficiency of flow matching comparable to that of diffusion models under the TV distance. Numerical studies on synthetic and learned velocities corroborate our theory.</description>

      <title>Identifying Drift, Diffusion, and Causal Structure from Temporal Snapshots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22729v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are a fundamental tool for modelling dynamic processes, including gene regulatory networks (GRNs), contaminant transport, financial markets, and image generation. However, learning the underlying SDE from data is a challenging task, especially if individual trajectories are not observable. Motivated by burgeoning research in single-cell datasets, we present the first comprehensive approach for jointly identifying the drift and diffusion of an SDE from its temporal marginals. Assuming linear drift and additive diffusion, we prove that these parameters are identifiable from marginals if and only if the initial distribution lacks any generalized rotational symmetries. We further prove that the causal graph of any SDE with additive diffusion can be recovered from the SDE parameters. To complement this theory, we adapt entropy-regularized optimal transport to handle anisotropic diffusion, and introduce APPEX (Alternating Projection Parameter Estimation from $X_0$), an iterative algorithm designed to estimate the drift, diffusion, and causal graph of an additive noise SDE, solely from temporal marginals. We show that APPEX iteratively decreases Kullback-Leibler divergence to the true solution, and demonstrate its effectiveness on simulated data from linear additive noise SDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) is a powerful framework for enhancing statistical estimates by combining limited gold-standard data with machine learning (ML) predictions. While prior work has demonstrated PPI's benefits for individual statistical problems, modern applications require answering numerous parallel statistical questions. We introduce Prediction-Powered Adaptive Shrinkage (PAS), a method that bridges PPI with empirical Bayes shrinkage to improve the estimation of multiple means. PAS debiases noisy ML predictions within each task and then borrows strength across tasks by using those same predictions as a reference point for shrinkage. The amount of shrinkage is determined by minimizing an unbiased estimate of risk, and we prove that this tuning strategy is asymptotically optimal. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that PAS adapts to the reliability of the ML predictions and outperforms traditional and modern baselines in large-scale applications.</description>

      <title>Know What You Don't Know: Uncertainty Calibration of Process Reward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) play a central role in guiding inference-time scaling algorithms for large language models (LLMs). However, we observe that even state-of-the-art PRMs can be poorly calibrated. Specifically, they tend to overestimate the success probability that a partial reasoning step will lead to a correct final answer, particularly when smaller LLMs are used to complete the reasoning trajectory. To address this, we present a calibration approach -- performed via quantile regression -- that adjusts PRM outputs to better align with true success probabilities. Leveraging these calibrated success estimates and their associated confidence bounds, we introduce an \emph{instance-adaptive scaling} (IAS) framework that dynamically adjusts the compute budget based on the estimated likelihood that a partial reasoning trajectory will yield a correct final answer. Unlike conventional methods that allocate a fixed number of reasoning trajectories per query, this approach adapts to each instance and reasoning step when using our calibrated PRMs. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that (i) our PRM calibration method achieves small calibration error, outperforming the baseline methods, (ii) calibration is crucial for enabling effective IAS, and (iii) the proposed IAS strategy reduces inference costs while maintaining final answer accuracy, utilizing less compute on more confident problems as desired.</description>

      <title>Performative Validity of Recourse Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When applicants get rejected by an algorithmic decision system, recourse explanations provide actionable suggestions for how to change their input features to get a positive evaluation. A crucial yet overlooked phenomenon is that recourse explanations are performative: When many applicants act according to their recommendations, their collective behavior may change statistical regularities in the data and, once the model is refitted, also the decision boundary. Consequently, the recourse algorithm may render its own recommendations invalid, such that applicants who make the effort of implementing their recommendations may be rejected again when they reapply. In this work, we formally characterize the conditions under which recourse explanations remain valid under performativity. A key finding is that recourse actions may become invalid if they are influenced by or if they intervene on non-causal variables. Based on our analysis, we caution against the use of standard counterfactual explanations and causal recourse methods, and instead advocate for recourse methods that recommend actions exclusively on causal variables.</description>

      <title>Parsimonious Gaussian mixture models with piecewise-constant eigenvalue profiles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are ubiquitous in statistical learning, particularly for unsupervised problems. While full GMMs suffer from the overparameterization of their covariance matrices in high-dimensional spaces, spherical GMMs (with isotropic covariance matrices) certainly lack flexibility to fit certain anisotropic distributions. Connecting these two extremes, we introduce a new family of parsimonious GMMs with piecewise-constant covariance eigenvalue profiles. These extend several low-rank models like the celebrated mixtures of probabilistic principal component analyzers (MPPCA), by enabling any possible sequence of eigenvalue multiplicities. If the latter are prespecified, then we can naturally derive an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to learn the mixture parameters. Otherwise, to address the notoriously-challenging issue of jointly learning the mixture parameters and hyperparameters, we propose a componentwise penalized EM algorithm, whose monotonicity is proven. We show the superior likelihood-parsimony tradeoffs achieved by our models on a variety of unsupervised experiments: density fitting, clustering and single-image denoising.</description>

      <title>It's Hard to Be Normal: The Impact of Noise on Structure-agnostic Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02275v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structure-agnostic causal inference studies how well one can estimate a treatment effect given black-box machine learning estimates of nuisance functions (like the impact of confounders on treatment and outcomes). Here, we find that the answer depends in a surprising way on the distribution of the treatment noise. Focusing on the partially linear model of \citet{robinson1988root}, we first show that the widely adopted double machine learning (DML) estimator is minimax rate-optimal for Gaussian treatment noise, resolving an open problem of \citet{mackey2018orthogonal}. Meanwhile, for independent non-Gaussian treatment noise, we show that DML is always suboptimal by constructing new practical procedures with higher-order robustness to nuisance errors. These \emph{ACE} procedures use structure-agnostic cumulant estimators to achieve $r$-th order insensitivity to nuisance errors whenever the $(r+1)$-st treatment cumulant is non-zero. We complement these core results with novel minimax guarantees for binary treatments in the partially linear model. Finally, using synthetic demand estimation experiments, we demonstrate the practical benefits of our higher-order robust estimators.</description>

      <title>To Trust or Not to Trust: On Calibration in ML-based Resource Allocation for Wireless Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In next-generation communications and networks, machine learning (ML) models are expected to deliver not only accurate predictions but also well-calibrated confidence scores that reflect the true likelihood of correct decisions. This paper studies the calibration performance of an ML-based outage predictor within a single-user, multi-resource allocation framework. We first establish key theoretical properties of this system's outage probability (OP) under perfect calibration. Importantly, we show that as the number of resources grows, the OP of a perfectly calibrated predictor approaches the expected output conditioned on it being below the classification threshold. In contrast, when only one resource is available, the system's OP equals the model's overall expected output. We then derive the OP conditions for a perfectly calibrated predictor. These findings guide the choice of the classification threshold to achieve a desired OP, helping system designers meet specific reliability requirements. We also demonstrate that post-processing calibration cannot improve the system's minimum achievable OP, as it does not introduce new information about future channel states. Additionally, we show that well-calibrated models are part of a broader class of predictors that necessarily improve OP. In particular, we establish a monotonicity condition that the accuracy-confidence function must satisfy for such improvement to occur. To demonstrate these theoretical properties, we conduct a rigorous simulation-based analysis using post-processing calibration techniques: Platt scaling and isotonic regression. As part of this framework, the predictor is trained using an outage loss function specifically designed for this system. Furthermore, this analysis is performed on Rayleigh fading channels with temporal correlation captured by Clarke's 2D model, which accounts for receiver mobility.</description>

      <title>Closed-Form Beta Distribution Estimation from Sparse Statistics with Random Forest Implicit Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work advances distribution recovery from sparse data and ensemble classification through three main contributions. First, we introduce a closed-form estimator that reconstructs scaled beta distributions from limited statistics (minimum, maximum, mean, and median) via composite quantile and moment matching. The recovered parameters $(\alpha,\beta)$, when used as features in Random Forest classifiers, improve pairwise classification on time-series snapshots, validating the fidelity of the recovered distributions. Second, we establish a link between classification accuracy and distributional closeness by deriving error bounds that constrain total variation distance and Jensen-Shannon divergence, the latter exhibiting quadratic convergence. Third, we show that zero-variance features act as an implicit regularizer, increasing selection probability for mid-ranked predictors and producing deeper, more varied trees. A SeatGeek pricing dataset serves as the primary application, illustrating distributional recovery and event-level classification while situating these methods within the structure and dynamics of the secondary ticket marketplace. The UCI handwritten digits dataset confirms the broader regularization effect. Overall, the study outlines a practical route from sparse distributional snapshots to closed-form estimation and improved ensemble accuracy, with reliability enhanced through implicit regularization.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition for Stochastic Block Model with more than $\sqrt{n}$ Communities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predictions from statistical physics postulate that recovery of the communities in Stochastic Block Model (SBM) is possible in polynomial time above, and only above, the Kesten-Stigum (KS) threshold. This conjecture has given rise to a rich literature, proving that non-trivial community recovery is indeed possible in SBM above the KS threshold, as long as the number $K$ of communities remains smaller than $\sqrt{n}$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the observed graph. Failure of low-degree polynomials below the KS threshold was also proven when $K=o(\sqrt{n})$.
  When $K\geq \sqrt{n}$, Chin et al.(2025) recently prove that, in a sparse regime, community recovery in polynomial time is possible below the KS threshold by counting non-backtracking paths. This breakthrough result lead them to postulate a new threshold for the many communities regime $K\geq \sqrt{n}$. In this work, we provide evidences that confirm their conjecture for $K\geq \sqrt{n}$:
  1- We prove that, for any density of the graph, low-degree polynomials fail to recover communities below the threshold postulated by Chin et al.(2025);
  2- We prove that community recovery is possible in polynomial time above the postulated threshold, not only in the sparse regime of~Chin et al., but also in some (but not all) moderately sparse regimes by essentially by counting occurrences of cliques or self-avoiding paths of suitable size in the observed graph.
  In addition, we propose a detailed conjecture regarding the structure of motifs that are optimal in sparsity regimes not covered by cliques or self-avoiding paths counting. In particular, counting self-avoiding paths of length $\log(n)$--which is closely related to spectral algorithms based on the Non-Backtracking operator--is optimal only in the sparse regime. Other motif counts--unrelated to spectral properties--should be considered in denser regimes.</description>

      <title>Provable Separations between Memorization and Generalization in Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains, but they remain vulnerable to memorization -- reproducing training data rather than generating novel outputs. This not only limits their creative potential but also raises concerns about privacy and safety. While empirical studies have explored mitigation strategies, theoretical understanding of memorization remains limited. We address this gap through developing a dual-separation result via two complementary perspectives: statistical estimation and network approximation. From the estimation side, we show that the ground-truth score function does not minimize the empirical denoising loss, creating a separation that drives memorization. From the approximation side, we prove that implementing the empirical score function requires network size to scale with sample size, spelling a separation compared to the more compact network representation of the ground-truth score function. Guided by these insights, we develop a pruning-based method that reduces memorization while maintaining generation quality in diffusion transformers.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Neural Operators for Parametric PDEs: A Human-AI Collaborative Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PDEs arise ubiquitously in science and engineering, where solutions depend on parameters (physical properties, boundary conditions, geometry). Traditional numerical methods require re-solving the PDE for each parameter, making parameter space exploration prohibitively expensive. Recent machine learning advances, particularly physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators, have revolutionized parametric PDE solving by learning solution operators that generalize across parameter spaces. We critically analyze two main paradigms: (1) PINNs, which embed physical laws as soft constraints and excel at inverse problems with sparse data, and (2) neural operators (e.g., DeepONet, Fourier Neural Operator), which learn mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces and achieve unprecedented generalization. Through comparisons across fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, heat transfer, and electromagnetics, we show neural operators can achieve computational speedups of $10^3$ to $10^5$ times faster than traditional solvers for multi-query scenarios, while maintaining comparable accuracy. We provide practical guidance for method selection, discuss theoretical foundations (universal approximation, convergence), and identify critical open challenges: high-dimensional parameters, complex geometries, and out-of-distribution generalization. This work establishes a unified framework for understanding parametric PDE solvers via operator learning, offering a comprehensive, incrementally updated resource for this rapidly evolving field</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.05561v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating personalized treatment policies that are "externally valid" or "generalizable": they perform well in target populations that differ from the experimental (or training) population from which the data are sampled. We first show that welfare-maximizing policies for the experimental population are robust to a certain class of shifts in the distribution of potential outcomes between the experimental and target populations (holding characteristics fixed). We then develop methods for estimating policies that are robust to shifts in the joint distribution of outcomes and characteristics. In doing so, we highlight how treatment effect heterogeneity within the experimental population shapes external validity.</description>

      <title>Inference with Mondrian Random Forests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09702v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random forests are popular methods for regression and classification analysis, and many different variants have been proposed in recent years. One interesting example is the Mondrian random forest, in which the underlying constituent trees are constructed via a Mondrian process. We give precise bias and variance characterizations, along with a Berry-Esseen-type central limit theorem, for the Mondrian random forest regression estimator. By combining these results with a carefully crafted debiasing approach and an accurate variance estimator, we present valid statistical inference methods for the unknown regression function. These methods come with explicitly characterized error bounds in terms of the sample size, tree complexity parameter, and number of trees in the forest, and include coverage error rates for feasible confidence interval estimators. Our debiasing procedure for the Mondrian random forest also allows it to achieve the minimax-optimal point estimation convergence rate in mean squared error for multivariate $\beta$-H\"older regression functions, for all $\beta &gt; 0$, provided that the underlying tuning parameters are chosen appropriately. Efficient and implementable algorithms are devised for both batch and online learning settings, and we study the computational complexity of different Mondrian random forest implementations. Finally, simulations with synthetic data validate our theory and methodology, demonstrating their excellent finite-sample properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new random walk for uniformly sampling high-dimensional convex bodies. It achieves state-of-the-art runtime complexity with stronger guarantees on the output than previously known, namely in R\'enyi divergence (which implies TV, $\mathcal{W}_2$, KL, $\chi^2$). The proof departs from known approaches for polytime algorithms for the problem -- we utilize a stochastic diffusion perspective to show contraction to the target distribution with the rate of convergence determined by functional isoperimetric constants of the target distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03801v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) is proposed to approximate potentially irregular functions in high dimensions. We provide error bounds for this approximation, assuming that the Kolmogorov-Arnold expansion functions are sufficiently smooth. When the function is only continuous, we also provide universal approximation theorems. We show that it outperforms multilayer perceptrons in terms of accuracy and convergence speed. We also compare it with several proposed KAN networks: it outperforms all networks for irregular functions and achieves similar accuracy to the original spline-based KAN network for smooth functions. Finally, we compare some of the KAN networks in optimizing a French hydraulic valley.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Gaussian kernel density estimator with bandwidth $\beta^{-\frac12}$ of $n$ iid Gaussian samples. Using the Kac-Rice formula and an Edgeworth expansion, we prove that the expected number of modes on the real line scales as $\Theta(\sqrt{\beta\log\beta})$ as $\beta,n\to\infty$ provided $n^c\lesssim \beta\lesssim n^{2-c}$ for some constant $c&gt;0$. An impetus behind this investigation is to determine the number of clusters to which Transformers are drawn in a metastable state.</description>

      <title>Multiplayer Federated Learning: Reaching Equilibrium with Less Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional Federated Learning (FL) approaches assume collaborative clients with aligned objectives working towards a shared global model. However, in many real-world scenarios, clients act as rational players with individual objectives and strategic behaviors, a concept that existing FL frameworks are not equipped to adequately address. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multiplayer Federated Learning (MpFL), a novel framework that models the clients in the FL environment as players in a game-theoretic context, aiming to reach an equilibrium. In this scenario, each player tries to optimize their own utility function, which may not align with the collective goal. Within MpFL, we propose Per-Player Local Stochastic Gradient Descent (PEARL-SGD), an algorithm in which each player/client performs local updates independently and periodically communicates with other players. We theoretically analyze PEARL-SGD and prove that it reaches a neighborhood of equilibrium with less communication in the stochastic setup compared to its non-local counterpart. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Approximate Gaussian Inference in Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03366v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In classification tasks, softmax functions are ubiquitously used as output activations to produce predictive probabilities. Such outputs only capture aleatoric uncertainty. To capture epistemic uncertainty, approximate Gaussian inference methods have been proposed. We develop a common formalism to describe such methods, which we view as outputting Gaussian distributions over the logit space. Predictives are then obtained as the expectations of the Gaussian distributions pushed forward through the softmax. However, such softmax Gaussian integrals cannot be solved analytically, and Monte Carlo (MC) approximations can be costly and noisy. We propose to replace the softmax activation by element-wise normCDF or sigmoid, which allows for the accurate sampling-free approximation of predictives. This also enables the approximation of the Gaussian pushforwards by Dirichlet distributions with moment matching. This approach entirely eliminates the runtime and memory overhead associated with MC sampling. We evaluate it combined with several approximate Gaussian inference methods (Laplace, HET, SNGP) on large- and small-scale datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, CIFAR-10), demonstrating improved uncertainty quantification capabilities compared to softmax MC sampling.

      <title>Efficient and Unbiased Sampling from Boltzmann Distributions via Variance-Tuned Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models (SBDMs) are powerful amortized samplers for Boltzmann distributions; however, imperfect score estimates bias downstream Monte Carlo estimates. Classical importance sampling (IS) can correct this bias, but computing exact likelihoods requires solving the probability-flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE), a procedure that is prohibitively costly and scales poorly with dimensionality. We introduce Variance-Tuned Diffusion Importance Sampling (VT-DIS), a lightweight post-training method that adapts the per-step noise covariance of a pretrained SBDM by minimizing the $\alpha$-divergence ($\alpha=2$) between its forward diffusion and reverse denoising trajectories. VT-DIS assigns a single trajectory-wise importance weight to the joint forward-reverse process, yielding unbiased expectation estimates at test time with negligible overhead compared to standard sampling. On the DW-4, LJ-13, and alanine-dipeptide benchmarks, VT-DIS achieves effective sample sizes of approximately 80 %, 35 %, and 3.5 %, respectively, while using only a fraction of the computational budget required by vanilla diffusion + IS or PF-ODE-based IS.</description>

      <title>Learning of Population Dynamics: Inverse Optimization Meets JKO Scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning population dynamics involves recovering the underlying process that governs particle evolution, given evolutionary snapshots of samples at discrete time points. Recent methods frame this as an energy minimization problem in probability space and leverage the celebrated JKO scheme for efficient time discretization. In this work, we introduce $\texttt{iJKOnet}$, an approach that combines the JKO framework with inverse optimization techniques to learn population dynamics. Our method relies on a conventional $\textit{end-to-end}$ adversarial training procedure and does not require restrictive architectural choices, e.g., input-convex neural networks. We establish theoretical guarantees for our methodology and demonstrate improved performance over prior JKO-based methods.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction Adaptive to Unknown Subpopulation Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is widely used to equip black-box machine learning models with uncertainty quantification, offering formal coverage guarantees under exchangeable data. However, these guarantees fail when faced with subpopulation shifts, where the test environment contains a different mix of subpopulations than the calibration data. In this work, we focus on unknown subpopulation shifts where we are not given group-information i.e. the subpopulation labels of datapoints have to be inferred. We propose new methods that provably adapt conformal prediction to such shifts, ensuring valid coverage without explicit knowledge of subpopulation structure. While existing methods in similar setups assume perfect subpopulation labels, our framework explicitly relaxes this requirement and characterizes conditions where formal coverage guarantees remain feasible. Further, our algorithms scale to high-dimensional settings and remain practical in realistic machine learning tasks. Extensive experiments on vision (with vision transformers) and language (with large language models) benchmarks demonstrate that our methods reliably maintain coverage and effectively control risks in scenarios where standard conformal prediction fails.</description>

      <title>Less Greedy Equivalence Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) is a classic score-based algorithm for causal discovery from observational data. In the sample limit, it recovers the Markov equivalence class of graphs that describe the data. Still, it faces two challenges in practice: computational cost and finite-sample accuracy. In this paper, we develop Less Greedy Equivalence Search (LGES), a variant of GES that retains its theoretical guarantees while partially addressing these limitations. LGES modifies the greedy step; rather than always applying the highest-scoring insertion, it avoids edge insertions between variables for which the score implies some conditional independence. This more targeted search yields up to a \(10\)-fold speed-up and a substantial reduction in structural error relative to GES. Moreover, LGES can guide the search using prior knowledge, and can correct this knowledge when contradicted by data. Finally, LGES can use interventional data to refine the learned observational equivalence class. We prove that LGES recovers the true equivalence class in the sample limit, even with misspecified knowledge. Experiments demonstrate that LGES outperforms GES and other baselines in speed, accuracy, and robustness to misspecified knowledge.

      <title>Conformal Information Pursuit for Interactively Guiding Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A significant use case of instruction-finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs) is to solve question-answering tasks interactively. In this setting, an LLM agent is tasked with making a prediction by sequentially querying relevant information from the user, as opposed to a single-turn conversation. This paper explores sequential querying strategies that aim to minimize the expected number of queries. One such strategy is Information Pursuit (IP), a greedy algorithm that at each iteration selects the query that maximizes information gain or equivalently minimizes uncertainty. However, obtaining accurate estimates of mutual information or conditional entropy for LLMs is very difficult in practice due to over- or under-confident LLM proba- bilities, which leads to suboptimal query selection and predictive performance. To better estimate the uncertainty at each iteration, we propose Conformal Information Pursuit (C-IP), an alternative approach to sequential information gain based on conformal prediction sets. More specifically, C-IP leverages a relationship between prediction sets and conditional entropy at each iteration to estimate uncertainty based on the average size of conformal prediction sets. In contrast to conditional entropy, we find that conformal prediction sets are a distribution-free and robust method of measuring uncertainty. Experiments with 20 Questions show that C-IP obtains better predictive performance and shorter query-answer chains compared to previous approaches to IP and uncertainty-based chain-of-thought methods. Furthermore, extending to an interactive medical setting between a doctor and a patient on the MediQ dataset, C-IP achieves competitive performance with direct single-turn prediction while offering greater interpretability.</description>

      <title>Learning Latent Graph Geometry via Fixed-Point Schr\"odinger-Type Activation: A Theoretical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified theoretical framework for neural architectures whose internal representations evolve as stationary states of dissipative Schr\"odinger-type dynamics on learned latent graphs. Each layer is defined by a fixed-point Schr\"odinger-type equation depending on a weighted Laplacian encoding latent geometry and a convex local potential. We prove existence, uniqueness, and smooth dependence of equilibria, and show that the dynamics are equivalent under the Bloch map to norm-preserving Landau--Lifshitz flows. Training over graph weights and topology is formulated as stochastic optimization on a stratified moduli space of graphs equipped with a natural K\"{a}hler--Hessian metric, ensuring convergence and differentiability across strata. We derive generalization bounds -- PAC-Bayes, stability, and Rademacher complexity -- in terms of geometric quantities such as edge count, maximal degree, and Gromov--Hausdorff distortion, establishing that sparsity and geometric regularity control capacity. Feed-forward composition of stationary layers is proven equivalent to a single global stationary diffusion on a supra-graph; backpropagation is its adjoint stationary system. Finally, directed and vector-valued extensions are represented as sheaf Laplacians with unitary connections, unifying scalar graph, directed, and sheaf-based architectures. The resulting model class provides a compact, geometrically interpretable, and analytically tractable foundation for learning latent graph geometry via fixed-point Schr\"odinger-type activations.</description>

      <title>A Perfectly Truthful Calibration Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Calibration requires that predictions are conditionally unbiased and, therefore, reliably interpretable as probabilities. A calibration measure quantifies how far a predictor is from perfect calibration. As introduced by Haghtalab et al. (2024), a calibration measure is truthful if it is minimized in expectation when a predictor outputs the ground-truth probabilities. Predicting the true probabilities guarantees perfect calibration, but in reality, when calibration is evaluated on a random sample, all known calibration measures incentivize predictors to lie in order to appear more calibrated. Such lack of truthfulness motivated Haghtalab et al. (2024) and Qiao and Zhao (2025) to construct approximately truthful calibration measures in the sequential prediction setting, but no perfectly truthful calibration measure was known to exist even in the more basic batch setting.
  We design a simple, perfectly and strictly truthful, sound and complete calibration measure in the batch setting: averaged two-bin calibration error (ATB). ATB is quadratically related to two existing calibration measures: the smooth calibration error smCal and the lower distance to calibration distCal. The simplicity in our definition of ATB makes it efficient and straightforward to compute, allowing us to give the first linear-time calibration testing algorithm, improving a result of Hu et al. (2024). We also introduce a general recipe for constructing truthful measures based on the variance additivity of independent random variables, which proves the truthfulness of ATB as a special case and allows us to construct other truthful calibration measures such as quantile-binned l_2-ECE.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Inference with General Missingness Patterns and Machine Learning Imputation</title>

Abstract: Pre-trained machine learning (ML) predictions have been increasingly used to complement incomplete data to enable downstream scientific inquiries, but their naive integration risks biased inferences. Recently, multiple methods have been developed to provide valid inference with ML imputations regardless of prediction quality and to enhance efficiency relative to complete-case analyses. However, existing approaches are often limited to missing outcomes under a missing-completely-at-random (MCAR) assumption, failing to handle general missingness patterns (missing in both the outcome and exposures) under the more realistic missing-at-random (MAR) assumption. This paper develops a novel method that delivers a valid statistical inference framework for general Z-estimation problems using ML imputations under the MAR assumption and for general missingness patterns. The core technical idea is to stratify observations by distinct missingness patterns and construct an estimator by appropriately weighting and aggregating pattern-specific information through a masking-and-imputation procedure on the complete cases. We provide theoretical guarantees of asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator and efficiency dominance over weighted complete-case analyses. Practically, the method affords simple implementations by leveraging existing weighted complete-case analysis software. Extensive simulations are carried out to validate theoretical results. A real data example is provided to further illustrate the practical utility of the proposed method. The paper concludes with a brief discussion on practical implications, limitations, and potential future directions.</description>

      <title>On Joint Regularization and Calibration in Deep Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04160</link>

Abstract: Deep ensembles are a powerful tool in machine learning, improving both model performance and uncertainty calibration. While ensembles are typically formed by training and tuning models individually, evidence suggests that jointly tuning the ensemble can lead to better performance. This paper investigates the impact of jointly tuning weight decay, temperature scaling, and early stopping on both predictive performance and uncertainty quantification. Additionally, we propose a partially overlapping holdout strategy as a practical compromise between enabling joint evaluation and maximizing the use of data for training. Our results demonstrate that jointly tuning the ensemble generally matches or improves performance, with significant variation in effect size across different tasks and metrics. We highlight the trade-offs between individual and joint optimization in deep ensemble training, with the overlapping holdout strategy offering an attractive practical solution. We believe our findings provide valuable insights and guidance for practitioners looking to optimize deep ensemble models.
