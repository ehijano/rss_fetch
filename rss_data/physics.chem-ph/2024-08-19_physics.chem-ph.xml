      <title>The Joint Solvation Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solvent-induced interactions (SII) between flexible solutes can be separated into two distinct components: the solvation-induced conformational effect, and the joint solvation interaction (JSI). The JSI quantifies the thermodynamic effect of the solvent simultaneously accommodating the solutes, generalizing the typical notion of the hydrophobic interaction. We present a formal definition of the JSI within the framework of the mixture expansion, demonstrate that this definition is equivalent to the SII between rigid solutes, and propose a method, partially-connected molecular dynamics, which allows one to compute the interaction with existing free energy algorithms. We also compare the JSI to the more natural generalization of the hydrophobic interaction, the indirect solvent-mediated interaction, and argue that JSI is a more useful quantity for studying solute binding thermodynamics. Direct calculation of the JSI may prove useful in developing our understanding of solvent effects in self-assembly, protein aggregation, and protein folding, for which the isolation of the JSI from the conformational component of the SII becomes important due to the intra-species flexibility.</description>

      <title>Fractional Charges, Linear Conditions and Chemical Potentials for Excited States in $\Delta SCF$ Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To describe excited states, the electron density alone being insufficient, we use the noninteracting reference density matrix $\gamma_{s}({\bf x},{\bf x}')$ based on the recently established foundation for the $\Delta SCF$ theory, in which ground and excited state energies and densities are obtained from the minimum and stationary solutions of the same functional. We now extend the theory to fractional charges. Based on the exact properties of degeneracy and size consistency, we show that the exact energy functional for fractional charges, expressed as a linear combination of the $\gamma_{s}$ of an $N-$electron and that of an $\left(N+1\right)-$electron excited state, is a straight line interpolating the energies at integers. We introduce the concepts of excited-state chemical potentials to describe the slopes of these linear lines. Numerical calculations reveal the excited-state delocalization error with common approximate functionals but good performance of corrected functionals on the proven linear conditions.</description>

      <title>Meta-creatures: Developing an omnipotent hydrogel cell to construct bio-inspired systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to current technological challenges, including the complexity of precise control, low long-term survival and success rates, difficulty in maintaining function over extended periods, and high energy consumption, the construction of life-like creatures with multilevel structures and varied physiological characteristics is a goal that has yet to be achieved1-3. Here, to create a parallel entity termed a meta-creature with similar functions and characteristics to those of natural organisms, we introduce a process for the transformation of an omnipotent hydrogel cell (OHC), which is inspired by totipotent stem cells and carries bio-inspired bioelectricity, into a meta-creature. We captured the electrical signals transmitted between the meta-nerve fibres and rat sciatic nerves, the physicochemical signals perceived by the meta-mouth, and the information exchanged between the meta-skin and the external environment. Notably, the meta-cardiovascular system, which is capable of exchanging matter and energy with external environments, exhibited similar electrocardiogram signals during testing in rabbits; these results indicated feedback with a biological system and the potential for ex vivo bioelectric remodelling. Finally, a meta-creature was designed and exhibited bio-inspired bioelectricity signals during the simulated outdoor flight. This work reveals new possibilities for constructing bio-inspired systems, thereby improving our understanding of bioelectricity and biomimicry.</description>

      <title>Photoluminescence decay of mobile carriers influenced by imperfect quenching at particle surfaces with subdiffusive spread</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recently presented a quantitative model to explain the particle-size dependence of photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields and revealed that exciton quenching is not diffusion controlled, but limited by surface reactions. However, the exciton decay kinetics has not yet been analyzed using our theoretical model. Here, we study kinetic aspects of the model and show that it should be extended to take into account subdiffusion rather than normal diffusion to maintain consistency with the observed complex decay kinetics; we also show that the PL decay kinetics is nonexponential even when the PL quenching is limited by surface reactions under subdiffusion. Our theoretical analysis of the PL quantum yield and the PL decay kinetics provides a comprehensive picture of mobile charge carriers, immobile polarons, and self-trapped excitons.</description>

      <title>Differentiating Three-Dimensional Molecular Structures using Laser-induced Coulomb Explosion Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coulomb explosion imaging (CEI) with x-ray free electron lasers has recently been shown to be a powerful method for obtaining detailed structural information of gas-phase planar ring molecules [R. Boll et al. Nat. Phys. 18, 423-428 (2022)]. In this Letter, we investigate the potential of CEI driven by a tabletop laser and extend this approach to differentiating three-dimensional (3D) structures. We study the static CEI patterns of planar and nonplanar organic molecules that resemble the structures of typical products formed in ring-opening reactions. Our results reveal that each molecule exhibits a well-localized and distinctive pattern in 3D fragment-ion momentum space. We find that these patterns yield direct information about the molecular structures and can be qualitatively reproduced using a classical Coulomb explosion simulation. Our findings suggest that laser-induced CEI can serve as a robust method for differentiating molecular structures of organic ring and chain molecules. As such, it holds great promise as a method for following ultrafast structural changes, e.g., during ring-opening reactions, by tracking the motion of individual atoms in pump-probe experiments.</description>

      <title>Flat-plane based double-counting free and parameter free many-body DFT+U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Burgess et al. have recently introduced the BLOR corrective exchange-correlation functional that is, by construction, the unique simplified rotationally-invariant DFT+U functional that enforces the flat-plane condition separately on each effective orbital of a localized subspace. Detached from the Hubbard model, functionals of this type are both double-counting correction free and, when optimized in situ using appropriate error quantifiers, effectively parameter free. In this work, the extension of the BLOR functional to address many-body errors (mBLOR) is derived. The mBLOR functional is built to enforce the flat-plane condition on the entire subspace, rather than on each orbital individually. In this way inter-orbital errors are corrected on the same footing as the single-particle ones. Focusing on exact test cases with strong inter-orbital interactions, the BLOR and mBLOR functionals were benchmarked against contemporary DFT+U functionals using the total energy extensivity condition on stretched homo-nuclear p-block dimers that represent various self-interaction and static-correlation error regimes. The BLOR functional outperformed all other DFT+$U$ functionals tested, which often act to increase total-energy errors, yet it still yielded large errors in some systems. mBLOR instead yielded low energy errors across all four strongly-correlated dimers, while being constructed using only semi-local approximation ingredients. As mBLOR would not otherwise introduce a band-gap correction in the manner that is a desirable feature of DFT+U, we developed a cost-free technique to reintroduce it automatically by moving the functional's unusual explicit derivative discontinuity into the potential. With this in place, mBLOR is the only known DFT$+U$ functional that opens the bandgap of stretched neutral homo-nuclear dimers without the aid of unphysical spin-symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Modeling of Lipid Nanoparticle Formation for the Delivery of Nucleic Acid Therapeutics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nucleic acids such as mRNA have emerged as a promising therapeutic modality with the capability of addressing a wide range of diseases. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as a delivery platform for nucleic acids were used in the COVID-19 vaccines and have received much attention. While modern manufacturing processes which involve rapidly mixing an organic stream containing the lipids with an aqueous stream containing the nucleic acids are conceptually straightforward, detailed understanding of LNP formation and structure is still limited and scale-up can be challenging. Mathematical and computational methods are a promising avenue for deepening scientific understanding of the LNP formation process and facilitating improved process development and control. This article describes strategies for the mechanistic modeling of LNP formation, starting with strategies to estimate and predict important physicochemical properties of the various species such as diffusivities and solubilities. Subsequently, a framework is outlined for constructing mechanistic models of reactor- and particle-scale processes. Insights gained from the various models are mapped back to product quality attributes and process insights. Lastly, the use of the models to guide development of advanced process control and optimization strategies is discussed.</description>

      <title>NEAR: A Training-Free Pre-Estimator of Machine Learning Model Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks have been shown to be state-of-the-art machine learning models in a wide variety of applications, including natural language processing and image recognition. However, building a performant neural network is a laborious task and requires substantial computing power. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) addresses this issue by an automatic selection of the optimal network from a set of potential candidates. While many NAS methods still require training of (some) neural networks, zero-cost proxies promise to identify the optimal network without training. In this work, we propose the zero-cost proxy Network Expressivity by Activation Rank (NEAR). It is based on the effective rank of the pre- and post-activation matrix, i.e., the values of a neural network layer before and after applying its activation function. We demonstrate the cutting-edge correlation between this network score and the model accuracy on NAS-Bench-101 and NATS-Bench-SSS/TSS. In addition, we present a simple approach to estimate the optimal layer sizes in multi-layer perceptrons. Furthermore, we show that this score can be utilized to select hyperparameters such as the activation function and the neural network weight initialization scheme.</description>

      <title>Dissipative split-charge formalism: Ohm's law, Nyquist noise, and non-contact friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The split-charge equilibration method is extended to describe dissipative charge transfer similarly as the Drude model, whereby the generic frequency-dependent dielectric permitivitties or conductivities of dielectrics and metals can be mimicked. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, a resistor-capacitor circuit is simulated using an all-atom representation for resistor and capacitor. The simulated dynamics reproduce the expected charging process and Nyquist noise, the latter resulting from the thermal voltages acting on individual split charges. The method bears promise to model friction caused by the motion of charged particles past metallic or highly polarizable media.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of Spin-1/2 Heisenberg Antiferromagnetic Chains via Combined On-surface Synthesis and Reduction for Spinon Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chains are excellent one-dimensional platforms for exploring quantum magnetic states and quasiparticle fractionalization. Understanding its quantum magnetism and quasiparticle excitation at the atomic scale is crucial for manipulating the quantum spin systems. Here, we report the fabrication of spin-1/2 Heisenberg chains through on-surface synthesis and in-situ reduction. A closed-shell nanographene is employed as a precursor for Ullman coupling to avoid radical fusing, thus obtaining oligomer chains. Following exposure to atomic hydrogen and tip manipulation, closed-shell polymers are transformed into spin-1/2 chains with controlled lengths by reducing the ketone groups and subsequent hydrogen desorption. The spin excitation gaps are found to decrease in power-law as the chain lengths, suggesting its gapless feature. More interestingly, the spinon dispersion is extracted from the inelastic spectroscopic spectra, agreeing well with the calculations. Our results demonstrate the great potential of fabricating desired quantum systems through a combined on-surface synthesis and reduction approach.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Machine-Learned Exchange Functional for Molecules and Solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.00682v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design of better exchange-correlation functionals for Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a central challenge of modern electronic structure theory. However, current developments are limited by the mathematical form of the functional, with efficient semilocal functionals being inaccurate for many technologically important systems and the more accurate hybrid functionals being too expensive for large solid-state systems due to the use of the exact exchange operator. In this work, we use machine learning combined with exact physical constraints to design an exchange functional that is both orbital-dependent and nonlocal, but which can be evaluated at roughly the cost of semilocal functionals and is significantly faster than hybrid DFT in plane-wave codes. By training functionals with several different feature sets, we elucidate the roles of orbital-dependent and nonlocal features in learning the exchange energy and determine that both types of features provide vital and independently important information to the model. Having trained our new exchange functional with an expressive, nonlocal feature set, we substitute it into existing hybrid functionals to achieve hybrid-DFT accuracy on thermochemical benchmark sets and improve the accuracy of band gap predictions over semilocal DFT. To demonstrate the scalability of our approach as well as the practical benefits of improved band gap prediction, we compute charged defect transition levels in silicon using large supercells. Due to its transferability and computational efficiency for both molecular and extended systems, our model overcomes the cost-accuracy trade-off between semilocal and hybrid DFT, and our general approach provides a feasible path toward a universal exchange-correlation functional with post-hybrid DFT accuracy and semilocal DFT cost.</description>

      <title>PEPICO analysis of catalytic reactor effluents towards quantitative isomer discrimination: DME conversion over a ZSM-5 zeolite</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Methanol-To-Hydrocarbons (MTH) process involves the conversion of methanol, a C1 feedstock that can be produced from green sources, into hydrocarbons using shape-selective microporous acidic catalysts - zeolite and zeotypes \cite{olsbye2012}. This reaction yields a complex mixture of species, some of which are highly reactive and/or present in several isomeric forms, posing significant challenges for effluent analysis. Conventional gas-phase chromatography (GC) is typically employed for the analysis of reaction products in laboratory flow reactors. However, GC is not suitable for the detection of highly reactive intermediates such as ketene or formaldehyde and is not suitable for kinetic studies under well-defined low pressure conditions. Photoelectron-photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful analytical tool for unraveling complex compositions of catalytic effluents \cite{hemberger2020new}, but its availability is limited to a handful of facilities worldwide. Herein, PEPICO analysis of catalytic reactor effluents has been implemented at the FinEstBeAMS beamline of MAX IV Laboratory. The conversion of dimethyl ether (DME) on a zeolite catalyst (ZSM-5-MFI27) is used as a prototypical model reaction producing a wide distribution of hydrocarbon products. Since in zeolites methanol is quickly equilibrated with DME, this reaction can be used to probe vast sub-networks of the full MTH process, while eliminating or at least slowing down methanol-induced secondary reactions and catalyst deactivation. Quantitative discrimination of xylene isomers in the effluent stream is achieved by deconvoluting the coincidence photoelectron spectra.</description>

Abstract: The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are catalyzing transformative changes in atomic modeling, simulation, and design. AI-driven potential energy models have demonstrated the capability to conduct large-scale, long-duration simulations with the accuracy of ab initio electronic structure methods. However, the model generation process remains a bottleneck for large-scale applications. We propose a shift towards a model-centric ecosystem, wherein a large atomic model (LAM), pre-trained across multiple disciplines, can be efficiently fine-tuned and distilled for various downstream tasks, thereby establishing a new framework for molecular modeling. In this study, we introduce the DPA-2 architecture as a prototype for LAMs. Pre-trained on a diverse array of chemical and materials systems using a multi-task approach, DPA-2 demonstrates superior generalization capabilities across multiple downstream tasks compared to the traditional single-task pre-training and fine-tuning methodologies. Our approach sets the stage for the development and broad application of LAMs in molecular and materials simulation research.</description>

Abstract: The increasing availability of GPUs for scientific computing has prompted interest in accelerating quantum chemical calculations through their use. The complexity of integral kernels for high angular momentum basis functions however often limits the utility of GPU implementations with large basis sets or for metal containing systems. In this work, we report implementation of $f$ function support in the GPU-accelerated TeraChem software package through the development of efficient kernels for the evaluation of Hamiltonian integrals. The high efficiency of the resulting code is demonstrated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations on increasingly large organic molecules and transition metal complexes, as well as coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) calculations on water clusters. Preliminary investigations into Ni(I) catalysis with DFT and the photochemistry of MnH(CH$_3$) with complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) are also carried out. Overall, our GPU-accelerated software appears to be well-suited for fast simulation of large transition metal containing systems, as well as organic molecules.</description>

Abstract: Enhancing chemical reactions, such as $A+B \to [\textit{activated complex}]^\# \to C+D$, in gas phase through its coupling to quantum-electrodynamics (QED) modes in a dark cavity is investigated. The main result is that the enhancement of the reaction rate by a dark cavity is for asymmetric reactions (products different from reactants.) Notice that in addition to the cavity been dark, the reactants are in their ground electronic and vibrational states, i.e., it is indeed dark. Theoretical derivation, utilizing the non-Hermitian formalism of quantum mechanics (NHQM), provides conditions and guidelines for selecting the proper type of reactions that can be enhanced by a dark cavity. Nevertheless, the time-dependent simulations of such experiments can be carried out using the standard (Hermitian) scattering theory (but including the conditions derived via NHQM). We believe that this work opens a gate to new types of studies and hopefully helps to close the gap between theory and experiments in this fascinating, relatively new field of research. As an example, we demonstrate that the asymmetric reaction rates of $O+D_2\to [ODD]^{\#} \to OD+D$ and $H+ArCl \to [ArHCl]^{\#} \to H+Ar+Cl$ can be enhanced by a dark cavity. Contrary, the dark cavity effect on the symmetric reaction of hydrogen exchange in methane will be negligible.</description>
