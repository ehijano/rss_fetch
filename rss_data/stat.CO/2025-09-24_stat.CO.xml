      <title>Tensor Train Completion from Fiberwise Observations Along a Single Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor completion is an extension of matrix completion aimed at recovering a multiway data tensor by leveraging a given subset of its entries (observations) and the pattern of observation. The low-rank assumption is key in establishing a relationship between the observed and unobserved entries of the tensor. The low-rank tensor completion problem is typically solved using numerical optimization techniques, where the rank information is used either implicitly (in the rank minimization approach) or explicitly (in the error minimization approach). Current theories concerning these techniques often study probabilistic recovery guarantees under conditions such as random uniform observations and incoherence requirements. However, if an observation pattern exhibits some low-rank structure that can be exploited, more efficient algorithms with deterministic recovery guarantees can be designed by leveraging this structure. This work shows how to use only standard linear algebra operations to compute the tensor train decomposition of a specific type of ``fiber-wise" observed tensor, where some of the fibers of a tensor (along a single specific mode) are either fully observed or entirely missing, unlike the usual entry-wise observations. From an application viewpoint, this setting is relevant when it is easier to sample or collect a multiway data tensor along a specific mode (e.g., temporal). The proposed completion method is fast and is guaranteed to work under reasonable deterministic conditions on the observation pattern. Through numerical experiments, we showcase interesting applications and use cases that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Connecting Quantum Computing with Classical Stochastic Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This tutorial paper introduces quantum approaches to Monte Carlo computation with applications in computational finance. We outline the basics of quantum computing using Grover's algorithm for unstructured search to build intuition. We then move slowly to amplitude estimation problems and applications to counting and Monte Carlo integration, again using Grover-type iterations. A hands-on Python/Qiskit implementation illustrates these concepts applied to finance. The paper concludes with a discussion on current challenges in scaling quantum simulation techniques.</description>

      <title>Optimization-centric cutting feedback for semiparametric models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern statistics deals with complex models from which the joint model used for inference is built by coupling submodels, called modules. We consider modular inference where the modules may depend on parametric and nonparametric components. In such cases, a joint Bayesian inference is highly susceptible to misspecification across any module, and inappropriate priors for nonparametric components may deliver subpar inferences for parametric components, and vice versa. We propose a novel ``optimization-centric'' approach to cutting feedback for semiparametric modular inference, which can address misspecification and prior-data conflicts. The proposed generalized cut posteriors are defined through a variational optimization problem for generalized posteriors where regularization is based on R\'{e}nyi divergence, rather than Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD), and variational computational methods are developed. We show empirically that using R\'{e}nyi divergence to define the cut posterior delivers more robust inferences than KLD. We derive novel posterior concentration results that accommodate the R\'{e}nyi divergence and allow for semiparametric components, greatly extending existing results for cut posteriors that were derived for parametric models and KLD. We demonstrate these new methods in a benchmark toy example and two real examples: Gaussian process adjustments for confounding in causal inference and misspecified copula models with nonparametric marginals.</description>

      <title>A Gradient Flow Approach to Solving Inverse Problems with Latent Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving ill-posed inverse problems requires powerful and flexible priors. We propose leveraging pretrained latent diffusion models for this task through a new training-free approach, termed Diffusion-regularized Wasserstein Gradient Flow (DWGF). Specifically, we formulate the posterior sampling problem as a regularized Wasserstein gradient flow of the Kullback-Leibler divergence in the latent space. We demonstrate the performance of our method on standard benchmarks using StableDiffusion (Rombach et al., 2022) as the prior.</description>

      <title>Least squares variational inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18475v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational inference consists in finding the best approximation of a target distribution within a certain family, where `best' means (typically) smallest Kullback-Leiber divergence. We show that, when the approximation family is exponential, the best approximation is the solution of a fixed-point equation. We introduce LSVI (Least-Squares Variational Inference), a Monte Carlo variant of the corresponding fixed-point recursion, where each iteration boils down to ordinary least squares regression and does not require computing gradients. We show that LSVI is equivalent to stochastic mirror descent; we use this insight to derive convergence guarantees. We introduce various ideas to improve LSVI further when the approximation family is Gaussian, leading to a $O(d^3)$ complexity in the dimension $d$ of the target in the full-covariance case, and a $O(d)$ complexity in the mean-field case. We show that LSVI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in a range of examples, while remaining gradient-free, that is, it does not require computing gradients.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Multivariate Density-Density Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel and scalable Bayesian framework for multivariate-density-density regression (DDR), designed to model relationships between multivariate distributions. Our approach addresses the critical issue of distributions residing in spaces of differing dimensions. We utilize a generalized Bayes framework, circumventing the need for a fully specified likelihood by employing the sliced Wasserstein distance to measure the discrepancy between fitted and observed distributions. This choice not only handles high-dimensional data and varying sample sizes efficiently but also facilitates a Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) for posterior inference. Furthermore, we establish the posterior consistency of our generalized Bayesian approach, ensuring that the posterior distribution concentrates around the true parameters as the sample size increases. Through simulations and application to a population-scale single-cell dataset, we show that Bayesian DDR provides robust fits, superior predictive performance compared to traditional methods, and valuable insights into complex biological interactions.</description>
