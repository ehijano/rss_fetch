      <title>DrawSpeech: Expressive Speech Synthesis Using Prosodic Sketches as Control Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling text-to-speech (TTS) systems to synthesize speech with the prosodic characteristics expected by users has attracted much attention. To achieve controllability, current studies focus on two main directions: (1) using reference speech as prosody prompt to guide speech synthesis, and (2) using natural language descriptions to control the generation process. However, finding reference speech that exactly contains the prosody that users want to synthesize takes a lot of effort. Description-based guidance in TTS systems can only determine the overall prosody, which has difficulty in achieving fine-grained prosody control over the synthesized speech. In this paper, we propose DrawSpeech, a sketch-conditioned diffusion model capable of generating speech based on any prosody sketches drawn by users. Specifically, the prosody sketches are fed to DrawSpeech to provide a rough indication of the expected prosody trends. DrawSpeech then recovers the detailed pitch and energy contours based on the coarse sketches and synthesizes the desired speech. Experimental results show that DrawSpeech can generate speech with a wide variety of prosody and can precisely control the fine-grained prosody in a user-friendly manner. Our implementation and audio samples are publicly available.</description>

      <title>MAD-UV: The 1st INTERSPEECH Mice Autism Detection via Ultrasound Vocalization Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mice Autism Detection via Ultrasound Vocalization (MAD-UV) Challenge introduces the first INTERSPEECH challenge focused on detecting autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in mice through their vocalizations. Participants are tasked with developing models to automatically classify mice as either wild-type or ASD models based on recordings with a high sampling rate. Our baseline system employs a simple CNN-based classification using three different spectrogram features. Results demonstrate the feasibility of automated ASD detection, with the considered audible-range features achieving the best performance (UAR of 0.600 for segment-level and 0.625 for subject-level classification). This challenge bridges speech technology and biomedical research, offering opportunities to advance our understanding of ASD models through machine learning approaches. The findings suggest promising directions for vocalization analysis and highlight the potential value of audible and ultrasound vocalizations in ASD detection.</description>

      <title>Phone-purity Guided Discrete Tokens for Dysarthric Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete tokens extracted provide efficient and domain adaptable speech features. Their application to disordered speech that exhibits articulation imprecision and large mismatch against normal voice remains unexplored. To improve their phonetic discrimination that is weakened during unsupervised K-means or vector quantization of continuous features, this paper proposes novel phone-purity guided (PPG) discrete tokens for dysarthric speech recognition. Phonetic label supervision is used to regularize maximum likelihood and reconstruction error costs used in standard K-means and VAE-VQ based discrete token extraction. Experiments conducted on the UASpeech corpus suggest that the proposed PPG discrete token features extracted from HuBERT consistently outperform hybrid TDNN and End-to-End (E2E) Conformer systems using non-PPG based K-means or VAE-VQ tokens across varying codebook sizes by statistically significant word error rate (WER) reductions up to 0.99\% and 1.77\% absolute (3.21\% and 4.82\% relative) respectively on the UASpeech test set of 16 dysarthric speakers. The lowest WER of 23.25\% was obtained by combining systems using different token features. Consistent improvements on the phone purity metric were also achieved. T-SNE visualization further demonstrates sharper decision boundaries were produced between K-means/VAE-VQ clusters after introducing phone-purity guidance.</description>

      <title>Right Label Context in End-to-End Training of Time-Synchronous ASR Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04521v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current time-synchronous sequence-to-sequence automatic speech recognition (ASR) models are trained by using sequence level cross-entropy that sums over all alignments. Due to the discriminative formulation, incorporating the right label context into the training criterion's gradient causes normalization problems and is not mathematically well-defined. The classic hybrid neural network hidden Markov model (NN-HMM) with its inherent generative formulation enables conditioning on the right label context. However, due to the HMM state-tying the identity of the right label context is never modeled explicitly. In this work, we propose a factored loss with auxiliary left and right label contexts that sums over all alignments. We show that the inclusion of the right label context is particularly beneficial when training data resources are limited. Moreover, we also show that it is possible to build a factored hybrid HMM system by relying exclusively on the full-sum criterion. Experiments were conducted on Switchboard 300h and LibriSpeech 960h.</description>

      <title>Listening and Seeing Again: Generative Error Correction for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike traditional Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) takes audio and visual signals simultaneously to infer the transcription. Recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be effectively used for Generative Error Correction (GER) in ASR by predicting the best transcription from ASR-generated N-best hypotheses. However, these LLMs lack the ability to simultaneously understand audio and visual, making the GER approach challenging to apply in AVSR. In this work, we propose a novel GER paradigm for AVSR, termed AVGER, that follows the concept of ``listening and seeing again''. Specifically, we first use the powerful AVSR system to read the audio and visual signals to get the N-Best hypotheses, and then use the Q-former-based Multimodal Synchronous Encoder to read the audio and visual information again and convert them into an audio and video compression representation respectively that can be understood by LLM. Afterward, the audio-visual compression representation and the N-Best hypothesis together constitute a Cross-modal Prompt to guide the LLM in producing the best transcription. In addition, we also proposed a Multi-Level Consistency Constraint training criterion, including logits-level, utterance-level and representations-level, to improve the correction accuracy while enhancing the interpretability of audio and visual compression representations. The experimental results on the LRS3 dataset show that our method outperforms current mainstream AVSR systems. The proposed AVGER can reduce the Word Error Rate (WER) by 24% compared to them.

      <title>Artifact-free Sound Quality in DNN-based Closed-loop Systems for Audio Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) have significantly improved various audio processing applications, including speech enhancement, synthesis, and hearing aid algorithms. DNN-based closed-loop systems have gained popularity in these applications due to their robust performance and ability to adapt to diverse conditions. Despite their effectiveness, current DNN-based closed-loop systems often suffer from sound quality degradation caused by artifacts introduced by suboptimal sampling methods. To address this challenge, we introduce dCoNNear, a novel DNN architecture designed for seamless integration into closed-loop frameworks. This architecture specifically aims to prevent the generation of spurious artifacts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of dCoNNear through a proof-of-principle example within a closed-loop framework that employs biophysically realistic models of auditory processing for both normal and hearing-impaired profiles to design personalized hearing aid algorithms. Our results show that dCoNNear not only accurately simulates all processing stages of existing non-DNN biophysical models but also eliminates audible artifacts, thereby enhancing the sound quality of the resulting hearing aid algorithms. This study presents a novel, artifact-free closed-loop framework that improves the sound quality of audio processing systems, offering a promising solution for high-fidelity applications in audio and hearing technologies.</description>

      <title>Decoding EEG Speech Perception with Transformers and VAE-based Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoding speech from non-invasive brain signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG), has the potential to advance brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), with applications in silent communication and assistive technologies for individuals with speech impairments. However, EEG-based speech decoding faces major challenges, such as noisy data, limited datasets, and poor performance on complex tasks like speech perception. This study attempts to address these challenges by employing variational autoencoders (VAEs) for EEG data augmentation to improve data quality and applying a state-of-the-art (SOTA) sequence-to-sequence deep learning architecture, originally successful in electromyography (EMG) tasks, to EEG-based speech decoding. Additionally, we adapt this architecture for word classification tasks. Using the Brennan dataset, which contains EEG recordings of subjects listening to narrated speech, we preprocess the data and evaluate both classification and sequence-to-sequence models for EEG-to-words/sentences tasks. Our experiments show that VAEs have the potential to reconstruct artificial EEG data for augmentation. Meanwhile, our sequence-to-sequence model achieves more promising performance in generating sentences compared to our classification model, though both remain challenging tasks. These findings lay the groundwork for future research on EEG speech perception decoding, with possible extensions to speech production tasks such as silent or imagined speech.</description>

      <title>ZSVC: Zero-shot Style Voice Conversion with Disentangled Latent Diffusion Models and Adversarial Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Style voice conversion aims to transform the speaking style of source speech into a desired style while keeping the original speaker's identity. However, previous style voice conversion approaches primarily focus on well-defined domains such as emotional aspects, limiting their practical applications. In this study, we present ZSVC, a novel Zero-shot Style Voice Conversion approach that utilizes a speech codec and a latent diffusion model with speech prompting mechanism to facilitate in-context learning for speaking style conversion. To disentangle speaking style and speaker timbre, we introduce information bottleneck to filter speaking style in the source speech and employ Uncertainty Modeling Adaptive Instance Normalization (UMAdaIN) to perturb the speaker timbre in the style prompt. Moreover, we propose a novel adversarial training strategy to enhance in-context learning and improve style similarity. Experiments conducted on 44,000 hours of speech data demonstrate the superior performance of ZSVC in generating speech with diverse speaking styles in zero-shot scenarios.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Interval-based Tokenization for Pitch Representation in Symbolic Music Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbolic music analysis tasks are often performed by models originally developed for Natural Language Processing, such as Transformers. Such models require the input data to be represented as sequences, which is achieved through a process of tokenization. Tokenization strategies for symbolic music often rely on absolute MIDI values to represent pitch information. However, music research largely promotes the benefit of higher-level representations such as melodic contour and harmonic relations for which pitch intervals turn out to be more expressive than absolute pitches. In this work, we introduce a general framework for building interval-based tokenizations. By evaluating these tokenizations on three music analysis tasks, we show that such interval-based tokenizations improve model performances and facilitate their explainability.</description>

      <title>FleSpeech: Flexibly Controllable Speech Generation with Various Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controllable speech generation methods typically rely on single or fixed prompts, hindering creativity and flexibility. These limitations make it difficult to meet specific user needs in certain scenarios, such as adjusting the style while preserving a selected speaker's timbre, or choosing a style and generating a voice that matches a character's visual appearance. To overcome these challenges, we propose \textit{FleSpeech}, a novel multi-stage speech generation framework that allows for more flexible manipulation of speech attributes by integrating various forms of control. FleSpeech employs a multimodal prompt encoder that processes and unifies different text, audio, and visual prompts into a cohesive representation. This approach enhances the adaptability of speech synthesis and supports creative and precise control over the generated speech. Additionally, we develop a data collection pipeline for multimodal datasets to facilitate further research and applications in this field. Comprehensive subjective and objective experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FleSpeech. Audio samples are available at https://kkksuper.github.io/FleSpeech/</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06930v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-speech have made it possible to generate natural-sounding audio from text. However, audiobook narrations involve dramatic vocalizations and intonations by the reader, with greater reliance on emotions, dialogues, and descriptions in the narrative. Using our dataset of 93 aligned book-audiobook pairs, we present improved models for prosody prediction properties (pitch, volume, and rate of speech) from narrative text using language modeling. Our predicted prosody attributes correlate much better with human audiobook readings than results from a state-of-the-art commercial TTS system: our predicted pitch shows a higher correlation with human reading for 22 out of the 24 books, while our predicted volume attribute proves more similar to human reading for 23 out of the 24 books. Finally, we present a human evaluation study to quantify the extent that people prefer prosody-enhanced audiobook readings over commercial text-to-speech systems.</description>

      <title>Channel-Aware Domain-Adaptive Generative Adversarial Network for Robust Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems demonstrate impressive performance on matched domains, their performance often degrades when confronted with channel mismatch stemming from unseen recording environments and conditions. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel channel-aware data simulation method for robust ASR training. Our method harnesses the synergistic power of channel-extractive techniques and generative adversarial networks (GANs). We first train a channel encoder capable of extracting embeddings from arbitrary audio. On top of this, channel embeddings are extracted using a minimal amount of target-domain data and used to guide a GAN-based speech synthesizer. This synthesizer generates speech that faithfully preserves the phonetic content of the input while mimicking the channel characteristics of the target domain. We evaluate our method on the challenging Hakka Across Taiwan (HAT) and Taiwanese Across Taiwan (TAT) corpora, achieving relative character error rate (CER) reductions of 20.02% and 9.64%, respectively, compared to the baselines. These results highlight the efficacy of our channel-aware data simulation method for bridging the gap between source- and target-domain acoustics.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight and Real-Time Binaural Speech Enhancement Model with Spatial Cues Preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binaural speech enhancement (BSE) aims to jointly improve the speech quality and intelligibility of noisy signals received by hearing devices and preserve the spatial cues of the target for natural listening. Existing methods often suffer from the compromise between noise reduction (NR) capacity and spatial cues preservation (SCP) accuracy and a high computational demand in complex acoustic scenes. In this work, we present a learning-based lightweight binaural complex convolutional network (LBCCN), which excels in NR by filtering low-frequency bands and keeping the rest. Additionally, our approach explicitly incorporates the estimation of interchannel relative acoustic transfer function to ensure the spatial cues fidelity and speech clarity. Results show that the proposed LBCCN can achieve a comparable NR performance to state-of-the-art methods under fixed-speaker conditions, but with a much lower computational cost and a certain degree of SCP capability. The reproducible code and audio examples are available at https://github.com/jywanng/LBCCN.</description>

      <title>Improving Zero-Shot Chinese-English Code-Switching ASR with kNN-CTC and Gated Monolingual Datastores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03814v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The kNN-CTC model has proven to be effective for monolingual automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, its direct application to multilingual scenarios like code-switching, presents challenges. Although there is potential for performance improvement, a kNN-CTC model utilizing a single bilingual datastore can inadvertently introduce undesirable noise from the alternative language. To address this, we propose a novel kNN-CTC-based code-switching ASR (CS-ASR) framework that employs dual monolingual datastores and a gated datastore selection mechanism to reduce noise interference. Our method selects the appropriate datastore for decoding each frame, ensuring the injection of language-specific information into the ASR process. We apply this framework to cutting-edge CTC-based models, developing an advanced CS-ASR system. Extensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of our gated datastore mechanism in enhancing the performance of zero-shot Chinese-English CS-ASR.</description>

Abstract: Speech recognition is the technology that enables machines to interpret and process human speech, converting spoken language into text or commands. This technology is essential for applications such as virtual assistants, transcription services, and communication tools. The Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) model enhances traditional speech recognition, particularly in noisy environments, by incorporating visual modalities like lip movements and facial expressions. While traditional AVSR models trained on large-scale datasets with numerous parameters can achieve remarkable accuracy, often surpassing human performance, they also come with high training costs and deployment challenges. To address these issues, we introduce an efficient AVSR model that reduces the number of parameters through the integration of a Dual Conformer Interaction Module (DCIM). In addition, we propose a pre-training method that further optimizes model performance by selectively updating parameters, leading to significant improvements in efficiency. Unlike conventional models that require the system to independently learn the hierarchical relationship between audio and visual modalities, our approach incorporates this distinction directly into the model architecture. This design enhances both efficiency and performance, resulting in a more practical and effective solution for AVSR tasks.</description>

Abstract: We propose Samba ASR,the first state of the art Automatic Speech Recognition(ASR)model leveraging the novel Mamba architecture as both encoder and decoder,built on the foundation of state space models(SSMs).Unlike transformerbased ASR models,which rely on self-attention mechanisms to capture dependencies,Samba ASR effectively models both local and global temporal dependencies using efficient statespace dynamics,achieving remarkable performance gains.By addressing the limitations of transformers,such as quadratic scaling with input length and difficulty in handling longrange dependencies,Samba ASR achieves superior accuracy and efficiency.Experimental results demonstrate that Samba ASR surpasses existing opensource transformerbased ASR models across various standard benchmarks,establishing it as the new state of theart in ASR.Extensive evaluations on the benchmark dataset show significant improvements in Word Error Rate(WER),with competitive performance even in lowresource scenarios.Furthermore,the inherent computational efficiency and parameter optimization of the Mamba architecture make Samba ASR a scalable and robust solution for diverse ASR tasks.Our contributions include the development of a new Samba ASR architecture for automatic speech recognition(ASR),demonstrating the superiority of structured statespace models(SSMs)over transformer based models for speech sequence processing.We provide a comprehensive evaluation on public benchmarks,showcasing stateoftheart(SOTA)performance,and present an indepth analysis of computational efficiency,robustness to noise,and sequence generalization.This work highlights the viability of Mamba SSMs as a transformerfree alternative for efficient and accurate ASR.By leveraging the advancements of statespace modeling,Samba ASR redefines ASR performance standards and sets a new benchmark for future research in this field.</description>
