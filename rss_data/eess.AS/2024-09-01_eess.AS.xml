      <title>User-Driven Voice Generation and Editing through Latent Space Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a user-driven approach for synthesizing highly specific target voices based on user feedback, which is particularly beneficial for speech-impaired individuals who wish to recreate their lost voices but lack prior recordings. Specifically, we leverage the neural analysis and synthesis framework to construct a low-dimensional, yet sufficiently expressive latent speaker embedding space. Within this latent space, we implement a search algorithm that guides users to their desired voice through completing a sequence of straightforward comparison tasks. Both synthetic simulations and real-world user studies demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively approximate target voices. Moreover, by analyzing the mel-spectrogram generator's Jacobians, we identify a set of meaningful voice editing directions within the latent space. These directions enable users to further fine-tune specific attributes of the generated voice, including the pitch level, pitch range, volume, vocal tension, nasality, and tone color.

      <title>Recursive Attentive Pooling for Extracting Speaker Embeddings from Multi-Speaker Recordings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a method for extracting speaker embedding for each speaker from a variable-length recording containing multiple speakers. Speaker embeddings are crucial not only for speaker recognition but also for various multi-speaker speech applications such as speaker diarization and target-speaker speech processing. Despite the challenges of obtaining a single speaker's speech without pre-registration in multi-speaker scenarios, most studies on speaker embedding extraction focus on extracting embeddings only from single-speaker recordings. Some methods have been proposed for extracting speaker embeddings directly from multi-speaker recordings, but they typically require preparing a model for each possible number of speakers or involve complicated training procedures. The proposed method computes the embeddings of multiple speakers by focusing on different parts of the frame-wise embeddings extracted from the input multi-speaker audio. This is achieved by recursively computing attention weights for pooling the frame-wise embeddings. Additionally, we propose using the calculated attention weights to estimate the number of speakers in the recording, which allows the same model to be applied to various numbers of speakers. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in speaker verification and diarization tasks.</description>

      <title>Learning Multi-Target TDOA Features for Sound Event Localization and Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sound event localization and detection (SELD) systems using audio recordings from a microphone array rely on spatial cues for determining the location of sound events. As a consequence, the localization performance of such systems is to a large extent determined by the quality of the audio features that are used as inputs to the system. We propose a new feature, based on neural generalized cross-correlations with phase-transform (NGCC-PHAT), that learns audio representations suitable for localization. Using permutation invariant training for the time-difference of arrival (TDOA) estimation problem enables NGCC-PHAT to learn TDOA features for multiple overlapping sound events. These features can be used as a drop-in replacement for GCC-PHAT inputs to a SELD-network. We test our method on the STARSS23 dataset and demonstrate improved localization performance compared to using standard GCC-PHAT or SALSA-Lite input features.</description>

      <title>Codec Does Matter: Exploring the Semantic Shortcoming of Codec for Audio Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in audio generation have been significantly propelled by the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The existing research on audio LLM has primarily focused on enhancing the architecture and scale of audio language models, as well as leveraging larger datasets, and generally, acoustic codecs, such as EnCodec, are used for audio tokenization. However, these codecs were originally designed for audio compression, which may lead to suboptimal performance in the context of audio LLM. Our research aims to address the shortcomings of current audio LLM codecs, particularly their challenges in maintaining semantic integrity in generated audio. For instance, existing methods like VALL-E, which condition acoustic token generation on text transcriptions, often suffer from content inaccuracies and elevated word error rates (WER) due to semantic misinterpretations of acoustic tokens, resulting in word skipping and errors. To overcome these issues, we propose a straightforward yet effective approach called X-Codec. X-Codec incorporates semantic features from a pre-trained semantic encoder before the Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) stage and introduces a semantic reconstruction loss after RVQ. By enhancing the semantic ability of the codec, X-Codec significantly reduces WER in speech synthesis tasks and extends these benefits to non-speech applications, including music and sound generation. Our experiments in text-to-speech, music continuation, and text-to-sound tasks demonstrate that integrating semantic information substantially improves the overall performance of language models in audio generation. Our code and demo are available (Demo: https://x-codec-audio.github.io Code: https://github.com/zhenye234/xcodec)</description>

      <title>Advancing Multi-talker ASR Performance with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recognizing overlapping speech from multiple speakers in conversational scenarios is one of the most challenging problem for automatic speech recognition (ASR). Serialized output training (SOT) is a classic method to address multi-talker ASR, with the idea of concatenating transcriptions from multiple speakers according to the emission times of their speech for training. However, SOT-style transcriptions, derived from concatenating multiple related utterances in a conversation, depend significantly on modeling long contexts. Therefore, compared to traditional methods that primarily emphasize encoder performance in attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) architectures, a novel approach utilizing large language models (LLMs) that leverages the capabilities of pre-trained decoders may be better suited for such complex and challenging scenarios. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based SOT approach for multi-talker ASR, leveraging pre-trained speech encoder and LLM, fine-tuning them on multi-talker dataset using appropriate strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach surpasses traditional AED-based methods on the simulated dataset LibriMix and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the evaluation set of the real-world dataset AMI, outperforming the AED model trained with 1000 times more supervised data in previous works.</description>

      <title>SelectTTS: Synthesizing Anyone's Voice via Discrete Unit-Based Frame Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthesizing the voices of unseen speakers is a persisting challenge in multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS). Most multi-speaker TTS models rely on modeling speaker characteristics through speaker conditioning during training. Modeling unseen speaker attributes through this approach has necessitated an increase in model complexity, which makes it challenging to reproduce results and improve upon them. We design a simple alternative to this. We propose SelectTTS, a novel method to select the appropriate frames from the target speaker and decode using frame-level self-supervised learning (SSL) features. We show that this approach can effectively capture speaker characteristics for unseen speakers, and achieves comparable results to other multi-speaker TTS frameworks in both objective and subjective metrics. With SelectTTS, we show that frame selection from the target speaker's speech is a direct way to achieve generalization in unseen speakers with low model complexity. We achieve better speaker similarity performance than SOTA baselines XTTS-v2 and VALL-E with over an 8x reduction in model parameters and a 270x reduction in training data</description>

      <title>Point Neuron Learning: A New Physics-Informed Neural Network Architecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning and neural networks have advanced numerous research domains, but challenges such as large training data requirements and inconsistent model performance hinder their application in certain scientific problems. To overcome these challenges, researchers have investigated integrating physics principles into machine learning models, mainly through: (i) physics-guided loss functions, generally termed as physics-informed neural networks, and (ii) physics-guided architectural design. While both approaches have demonstrated success across multiple scientific disciplines, they have limitations including being trapped to a local minimum, poor interpretability, and restricted generalizability. This paper proposes a new physics-informed neural network (PINN) architecture that combines the strengths of both approaches by embedding the fundamental solution of the wave equation into the network architecture, enabling the learned model to strictly satisfy the wave equation. The proposed point neuron learning method can model an arbitrary sound field based on microphone observations without any dataset. Compared to other PINN methods, our approach directly processes complex numbers and offers better interpretability and generalizability. We evaluate the versatility of the proposed architecture by a sound field reconstruction problem in a reverberant environment. Results indicate that the point neuron method outperforms two competing methods and can efficiently handle noisy environments with sparse microphone observations.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Speaker Profiles for Impersonation Audio Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fake audio detection is an emerging active topic. A growing number of literatures have aimed to detect fake utterance, which are mostly generated by Text-to-speech (TTS) or voice conversion (VC). However, countermeasures against impersonation remain an underexplored area. Impersonation is a fake type that involves an imitator replicating specific traits and speech style of a target speaker. Unlike TTS and VC, which often leave digital traces or signal artifacts, impersonation involves live human beings producing entirely natural speech, rendering the detection of impersonation audio a challenging task. Thus, we propose a novel method that integrates speaker profiles into the process of impersonation audio detection. Speaker profiles are inherent characteristics that are challenging for impersonators to mimic accurately, such as speaker's age, job. We aim to leverage these features to extract discriminative information for detecting impersonation audio. Moreover, there is no large impersonated speech corpora available for quantitative study of impersonation impacts. To address this gap, we further design the first large-scale, diverse-speaker Chinese impersonation dataset, named ImPersonation Audio Detection (IPAD), to advance the community's research on impersonation audio detection. We evaluate several existing fake audio detection methods on our proposed dataset IPAD, demonstrating its necessity and the challenges. Additionally, our findings reveal that incorporating speaker profiles can significantly enhance the model's performance in detecting impersonation audio.</description>

      <title>AASIST3: KAN-Enhanced AASIST Speech Deepfake Detection using SSL Features and Additional Regularization for the ASVspoof 2024 Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) systems, which identify speakers based on their voice characteristics, have numerous applications, such as user authentication in financial transactions, exclusive access control in smart devices, and forensic fraud detection. However, the advancement of deep learning algorithms has enabled the generation of synthetic audio through Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Voice Conversion (VC) systems, exposing ASV systems to potential vulnerabilities. To counteract this, we propose a novel architecture named AASIST3. By enhancing the existing AASIST framework with Kolmogorov-Arnold networks, additional layers, encoders, and pre-emphasis techniques, AASIST3 achieves a more than twofold improvement in performance. It demonstrates minDCF results of 0.5357 in the closed condition and 0.1414 in the open condition, significantly enhancing the detection of synthetic voices and improving ASV security.</description>

      <title>Hold Me Tight: Stable Encoder-Decoder Design for Speech Enhancement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolutional layers with 1-D filters are often used as frontend to encode audio signals. Unlike fixed time-frequency representations, they can adapt to the local characteristics of input data. However, 1-D filters on raw audio are hard to train and often suffer from instabilities. In this paper, we address these problems with hybrid solutions, i.e., combining theory-driven and data-driven approaches. First, we preprocess the audio signals via a auditory filterbank, guaranteeing good frequency localization for the learned encoder. Second, we use results from frame theory to define an unsupervised learning objective that encourages energy conservation and perfect reconstruction. Third, we adapt mixed compressed spectral norms as learning objectives to the encoder coefficients. Using these solutions in a low-complexity encoder-mask-decoder model significantly improves the perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) in speech enhancement.</description>

      <title>Audio Enhancement from Multiple Crowdsourced Recordings: A Simple and Effective Baseline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the popularity of cellular phones, events are often recorded by multiple devices from different locations and shared on social media. Several different recordings could be found for many events. Such recordings are usually noisy, where noise for each device is local and unrelated to others. This case of multiple microphones at unknown locations, capturing local, uncorrelated noise, was rarely treated in the literature. In this work we propose a simple and effective crowdsourced audio enhancement method to remove local noises at each input audio signal. Then, averaging all cleaned source signals gives an improved audio of the event. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using synthetic audio signals, together with real-world recordings. This simple approach can set a new baseline for crowdsourced audio enhancement for more sophisticated methods which we hope will be developed by the research community.</description>

      <title>Contextualized Automatic Speech Recognition with Dynamic Vocabulary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep biasing (DB) enhances the performance of end-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E-ASR) models for rare words or contextual phrases using a bias list. However, most existing methods treat bias phrases as sequences of subwords in a predefined static vocabulary. This naive sequence decomposition produces unnatural token patterns, significantly lowering their occurrence probability. More advanced techniques address this problem by expanding the vocabulary with additional modules, including the external language model shallow fusion or rescoring. However, they result in increasing the workload due to the additional modules. This paper proposes a dynamic vocabulary where bias tokens can be added during inference. Each entry in a bias list is represented as a single token, unlike a sequence of existing subword tokens. This approach eliminates the need to learn subword dependencies within the bias phrases. This method is easily applied to various architectures because it only expands the embedding and output layers in common E2E-ASR architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the bias phrase WER on English and Japanese datasets by 3.1 -- 4.9 points compared with the conventional DB method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.09944v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised models have had great success in learning speech representations that can generalize to various downstream tasks. However, most self-supervised models require a large amount of compute and multiple GPUs to train, significantly hampering the development of self-supervised learning. In an attempt to reduce the computation of training, we revisit the training of HuBERT, a highly successful self-supervised model. We improve and simplify several key components, including the loss function, input representation, and training in multiple stages. Our model, MelHuBERT, is able to achieve favorable performance on phone recognition, speaker identification, and automatic speech recognition against HuBERT, while saving 31.2% of the pre-training time, or equivalently 33.5% MACs per one second speech. The code and pre-trained models are available in https://github.com/nervjack2/MelHuBERT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Creating music is iterative, requiring varied methods at each stage. However, existing AI music systems fall short in orchestrating multiple subsystems for diverse needs. To address this gap, we introduce Loop Copilot, a novel system that enables users to generate and iteratively refine music through an interactive, multi-round dialogue interface. The system uses a large language model to interpret user intentions and select appropriate AI models for task execution. Each backend model is specialized for a specific task, and their outputs are aggregated to meet the user's requirements. To ensure musical coherence, essential attributes are maintained in a centralized table. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system through semi-structured interviews and questionnaires, highlighting its utility not only in facilitating music creation but also its potential for broader applications.</description>

      <title>DAISY: Data Adaptive Self-Supervised Early Exit for Speech Representation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised speech models have shown to be useful for various tasks, but their large size limits the use in devices with low computing power and memory. In this work, we explore early exit, an approach for reducing latency by exiting the forward process of a network early. Most approaches of early exit need a separate early exit model for each task, with some even requiring fine-tuning of the entire pretrained model. We introduce Data Adaptive Self-Supervised Early Exit (DAISY), an approach that decides when to exit based on the self-supervised loss, eliminating the need for multiple round of training and fine-tuning. DAISY matches the performance of HuBERT on the MiniSUPERB benchmark, but with much faster inference times. Our analysis on the adaptivity of DAISY shows that the model exits early (using fewer layers) on clean data while exits late (using more layers) on noisy data, dynamically adjusting the computational cost of inference based on the noise level of each sample.</description>

      <title>Towards Effective and Efficient Non-autoregressive Decoding Using Block-based Attention Mask</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10034v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel non-autoregressive (NAR) block-based Attention Mask Decoder (AMD) that flexibly balances performance-efficiency trade-offs for Conformer ASR systems. AMD performs parallel NAR inference within contiguous blocks of output labels that are concealed using attention masks, while conducting left-to-right AR prediction and history context amalgamation between blocks. A beam search algorithm is designed to leverage a dynamic fusion of CTC, AR Decoder, and AMD probabilities. Experiments on the LibriSpeech-100hr corpus suggest the tripartite Decoder incorporating the AMD module produces a maximum decoding speed-up ratio of 1.73x over the baseline CTC+AR decoding, while incurring no statistically significant word error rate (WER) increase on the test sets. When operating with the same decoding real time factors, statistically significant WER reductions of up to 0.7% and 0.3% absolute (5.3% and 6.1% relative) were obtained over the CTC+AR baseline.</description>

      <title>Towards Achieving Human Parity on End-to-end Simultaneous Speech Translation via LLM Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present Cross Language Agent -- Simultaneous Interpretation, CLASI, a high-quality and human-like Simultaneous Speech Translation (SiST) System. Inspired by professional human interpreters, we utilize a novel data-driven read-write strategy to balance the translation quality and latency. To address the challenge of translating in-domain terminologies, CLASI employs a multi-modal retrieving module to obtain relevant information to augment the translation. Supported by LLMs, our approach can generate error-tolerated translation by considering the input audio, historical context, and retrieved information. Experimental results show that our system outperforms other systems by significant margins. Aligned with professional human interpreters, we evaluate CLASI with a better human evaluation metric, valid information proportion (VIP), which measures the amount of information that can be successfully conveyed to the listeners. In the real-world scenarios, where the speeches are often disfluent, informal, and unclear, CLASI achieves VIP of 81.3% and 78.0% for Chinese-to-English and English-to-Chinese translation directions, respectively. In contrast, state-of-the-art commercial or open-source systems only achieve 35.4% and 41.6%. On the extremely hard dataset, where other systems achieve under 13% VIP, CLASI can still achieve 70% VIP.</description>

      <title>GAPS: A Large and Diverse Classical Guitar Dataset and Benchmark Transcription Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce GAPS (Guitar-Aligned Performance Scores), a new dataset of classical guitar performances, and a benchmark guitar transcription model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on GuitarSet in both supervised and zero-shot settings. GAPS is the largest dataset of real guitar audio, containing 14 hours of freely available audio-score aligned pairs, recorded in diverse conditions by over 200 performers, together with high-resolution note-level MIDI alignments and performance videos. These enable us to train a state-of-the-art model for automatic transcription of solo guitar recordings which can generalise well to real world audio that is unseen during training.</description>

      <title>Wav2Small: Distilling Wav2Vec2 to 72K parameters for Low-Resource Speech emotion recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) needs high computational resources to overcome the challenge of substantial annotator disagreement. Today SER is shifting towards dimensional annotations of arousal, dominance, and valence (A/D/V). Universal metrics as the L2 distance prove unsuitable for evaluating A/D/V accuracy due to non converging consensus of annotator opinions. However, Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) arose as an alternative metric for A/D/V where a model's output is evaluated to match a whole dataset's CCC rather than L2 distances of individual audios. Recent studies have shown that wav2vec2 / wavLM architectures outputing a float value for each A/D/V dimension achieve today's State-of-the-art (Sota) CCC on A/D/V. The Wav2Vec2.0 / WavLm family has a high computational footprint, but training small models using human annotations has been unsuccessful. In this paper we use a large Transformer Sota A/D/V model as Teacher/Annotator to train 5 student models: 4 MobileNets and our proposed Wav2Small, using only the Teacher's A/D/V predictions instead of human annotations. The Teacher model sets a new Sota on the MSP Podcast dataset of valence CCC = 0.676. We choose MobileNetV4 / MobileNet-V3 as students, as MobileNet has been designed for fast execution times. We also propose Wav2Small - an architecture designed for minimal parameter number and RAM consumption. Wav2Small with an .onnx (8bit quantized) of only 120KB is a potential solution for A/D/V on hardware with low resources, having only 72K parameters vs 3.12M parameters for MobileNet-V4-Small.</description>

      <title>Mini-Omni: Language Models Can Hear, Talk While Thinking in Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in language models have achieved significant progress. GPT-4o, as a new milestone, has enabled real-time conversations with humans, demonstrating near-human natural fluency. Such human-computer interaction necessitates models with the capability to perform reasoning directly with the audio modality and generate output in streaming. However, this remains beyond the reach of current academic models, as they typically depend on extra TTS systems for speech synthesis, resulting in undesirable latency. This paper introduces the Mini-Omni, an audio-based end-to-end conversational model, capable of real-time speech interaction. To achieve this capability, we propose a text-instructed speech generation method, along with batch-parallel strategies during inference to further boost the performance. Our method also helps to retain the original model's language capabilities with minimal degradation, enabling other works to establish real-time interaction capabilities. We call this training method "Any Model Can Talk". We also introduce the VoiceAssistant-400K dataset to fine-tune models optimized for speech output. To our best knowledge, Mini-Omni is the first fully end-to-end, open-source model for real-time speech interaction, offering valuable potential for future research.</description>
