      <title>Distance-based (and path-based) covering problems for graphs of given cyclomatic number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a large family of graph covering problems, whose definitions rely on distances, for graphs of bounded cyclomatic number (that is, the minimum number of edges that need to be removed from the graph to destroy all cycles). These problems include (but are not restricted to) three families of problems: (i) variants of metric dimension, where one wants to choose a small set $S$ of vertices of the graph such that every vertex is uniquely determined by its ordered vector of distances to the vertices of $S$; (ii) variants of geodetic sets, where one wants to select a small set $S$ of vertices such that any vertex lies on some shortest path between two vertices of $S$; (iii) variants of path covers, where one wants to select a small set of paths such that every vertex or edge belongs to one of the paths. We generalize and/or improve previous results in the area which show that the optimal values for these problems can be upper-bounded by a linear function of the cyclomatic number and the degree~1-vertices of the graph. To this end, we develop and enhance a technique recently introduced in [C. Lu, Q. Ye, C. Zhu. Algorithmic aspect on the minimum (weighted) doubly resolving set problem of graphs, Journal of Combinatorial Optimization 44:2029--2039, 2022] and give near-optimal bounds in several cases. This solves (in some cases fully, in some cases partially) some conjectures and open questions from the literature. The method, based on breadth-first search, is of algorithmic nature and thus, all the constructions can be computed in linear time. Our results also imply an algorithmic consequence for the computation of the optimal solutions: for some of the problems, they can be computed in polynomial time for graphs of bounded cyclomatic number.</description>

      <title>Morse sequences on stacks and flooding sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper builds upon the framework of \emph{Morse sequences}, a simple and effective approach to discrete Morse theory. A Morse sequence on a simplicial complex consists of a sequence of nested subcomplexes generated by expansions and fillings-two operations originally introduced by Whitehead. Expansions preserve homotopy, while fillings introduce critical simplexes that capture essential topological features. We extend the notion of Morse sequences to \emph{stacks}, which are monotonic functions defined on simplicial complexes, and define \emph{Morse sequences on stacks} as those whose expansions preserve the homotopy of all sublevel sets. This extension leads to a generalization of the fundamental collapse theorem to weighted simplicial complexes. Within this framework, we focus on a refined class of sequences called \emph{flooding sequences}, which exhibit an ordering behavior similar to that of classical watershed algorithms. Although not every Morse sequence on a stack is a flooding sequence, we show that the gradient vector field associated with any Morse sequence can be recovered through a flooding sequence. Finally, we present algorithmic schemes for computing flooding sequences using cosimplicial complexes.</description>

      <title>Continuous Petri Nets for Fast Yield Computation: Polynomial-Time and MILP Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Petri nets provide accurate analogues to chemical reaction networks, with places representing individual molecules (the resources of the system) and transitions representing chemical reactions which convert educt molecules into product molecules. Their natural affinity for modeling chemical reaction networks is, however, impeded by their computational complexity, which is at least PSpace-hard for most interesting questions, including reachability. Continuous Petri nets offer the same structure and discrete time as discrete Petri nets, but use continuous state-space, which allows them to answer the reachability question in polynomial time. We exploit this property to introduce a polynomial time algorithm for computing the maximal yield of a molecule in a chemical system. Additionally, we provide an alternative algorithm based on mixed-integer linear programming with worse theoretical complexity, but better runtime in practice, as demonstrated on both synthetic and chemical data.</description>

      <title>String Graph Obstacles of High Girth and of Bounded Degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A string graph is the intersection graph of curves in the plane. Kratochv\'il previously showed the existence of infinitely many obstacles: graphs that are not string graphs but for which any edge contraction or vertex deletion produces a string graph. Kratochv\'il's obstacles contain arbitrarily large cliques, so they have girth three and unbounded degree. We extend this line of working by studying obstacles among graphs of restricted girth and/or degree. We construct an infinite family of obstacles of girth four; in addition, our construction is $K_{2,3}$-subgraph-free and near-planar (planar plus one edge). Furthermore, we prove that there is a subcubic obstacle of girth three, and that there are no subcubic obstacles of high girth. We characterize the subcubic string graphs as having a matching whose contraction yields a planar graph, and based on this characterization we find a linear-time algorithm for recognizing subcubic string graphs of bounded treewidth.</description>

      <title>Tree decompositions with small width, spread, order and degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tree-decompositions of graphs are of fundamental importance in structural and algorithmic graph theory. The main property of tree-decompositions is the width (the maximum size of a bag $-1$). We show that every graph has a tree-decomposition with near-optimal width, plus several additional properties of interest. In particular every graph $G$ with treewidth at most $k$ has a tree-decomposition with width at most $72k+1$, where each vertex $v$ appears in at most $\text{deg}_G(v)+1$ bags, the number of bags is at most $\max\{\frac{|V(G)|}{2k},1\}$, and the tree indexing the decomposition has maximum degree at most 12. This improves exponential bounds to linear in a result of Ding and Oporowski [1995], and establishes a conjecture of theirs in a strong sense.</description>

      <title>Generalizations of Ferber-Krivelevich and Gallai Theorems on parity of degrees in induced subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A long-standing and well-known conjecture (see e.g. Caro, Discrete Math, 1994) states that every $n$-vertex graph $G$ without isolated vertices contains an induced subgraph where all vertices have an odd degree and whose order is linear in $n$. Ferber and Krivelevich (Adv. Math., 2022) confirmed the conjecture. In this short paper, we generalize this result by considering $G$ with vertices labeled 0 or 1 and requiring that in an induced subgraph of $G$, the 0-labeled vertices are of even degree and the 1-labeled vertices are of odd degree. We prove that if $G$ has no isolated vertices, it contains such a subgraph of order linear in $n$.
  The well-known Gallai's Theorem states that the vertices of each graph can be partitioned into two parts such that all vertices in the subgraphs induced by the two parts have even degrees. The result also holds if we require that the degrees of all vertices in one of the induced subgraphs are even, and the degrees of all vertices in the other induced subgraph are odd. A natural generalization of Gallai's Theorem to out-degrees in digraphs does not hold and we characterize all digraphs for which it does hold. Our characterization is linear algebraic.</description>

      <title>New Results on Vertices that Belong to Every Minimum Locating-Dominating Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Locating-dominating codes have been studied widely since their introduction in the 1980s by Slater and Rall. In this paper, we concentrate on vertices that must belong to all minimum locating-dominating codes in a graph. We call them min-forced vertices. We show that the number of min-forced vertices in a connected nontrivial graph of order $n$ is bounded above by $\frac{2}{3}\left(n -\gamma^{LD}(G)\right)$, where $\gamma^{LD}(G)$ denotes the cardinality of a minimum locating-dominating code. This implies that the maximum ratio between the number of min-forced vertices and the order of a connected nontrivial graph is at most $\frac{2}{5}$. Moreover, both of these bounds can be attained. We also determine the number of different minimum locating-dominating codes in all paths. In addition, we show that deciding whether a vertex is min-forced is co-NP-hard.</description>

      <title>Arcs with increasing chords in $\mathbf{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A curve $\gamma$ that connects $s$ and $t$ has the increasing chord property if $|bc| \leq |ad|$ whenever $a,b,c,d$ lie in that order on $\gamma$. For planar curves, the length of such a curve is known to be at most $2\pi/3 \cdot |st|$. Here we examine the question in higher dimensions and from the algorithmic standpoint and show the following:
  (I) The length of any $s-t$ curve with increasing chords in $\mathbf{R}^d$ is at most $2 \cdot \left( e/2 \cdot (d+4) \right)^{d-1} \cdot |st|$ for every $d \geq 3$. This is the first bound in higher dimensions.
  (II) Given a polygonal chain $P=(p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n)$ in $\mathbf{R}^d$, where $d \geq 4$, $k =\lfloor d/2 \rfloor$, it can be tested whether it satisfies the increasing chord property in $O\left(n^{2-1/(k+1)} {\rm polylog} (n) \right)$ expected time. This is the first subquadratic algorithm in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Constricting the Computational Complexity Gap of the $4$-Coloring Problem in $(P_t,C_3)$-free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $k$-Coloring problem on hereditary graph classes has been a deeply researched problem over the last decade. A hereditary graph class is characterized by a (possibly infinite) list of minimal forbidden induced subgraphs. We say that a graph is $(H_1,H_2,\ldots)$-free if it does not contain any of $H_1,H_2,\ldots$ as induced subgraphs. The complexity landscape of the problem remains unclear even when restricting to the case $k=4$ and classes defined by a few forbidden induced subgraphs. While the case of only one forbidden induced subgraph has been completely resolved lately, the complexity when considering two forbidden induced subgraphs still has a couple of unknown cases. In particular, $4$-Coloring on $(P_6,C_3)$-free graphs is polynomial while it is NP-hard on $(P_{22},C_3)$-free graphs.
  We provide a reduction showing NP-completeness of $4$-Coloring on $(P_t,C_3)$-free graphs for $19\leq t\leq 21$, thus constricting the gap of cases whose complexity remains unknown. Our proof includes a computer search ensuring that the graph family obtained through the reduction is indeed $P_{19}$-free.</description>

      <title>A threshold for online balancing of sparse i.i.d. vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the task of \textit{online} vector balancing for stochastic arrivals $(X_i)_{i \in [T]}$, where the time horizon satisfies $T = \Theta(n)$, and the $X_i$ are i.i.d uniform $d$--sparse $n$--dimensional binary vectors, with $2\leq d \le (\log\log n)^2/\log\log\log n$. We show that for this range of parameters, every online algorithm incurs discrepancy at least $\Omega(\log \log n)$, and there is an efficient algorithm which achieves a matching discrepancy bound of $O(\log\log n)$ w.h.p. This establishes an asymptotic gap, both existential and algorithmic, between the online and offline versions of the average--case Beck--Fiala problem. Strikingly, the optimal online discrepancy in the considered setting is order $\log \log n$, independent of $d$ and the norms of the vectors $(X_i)_i$. Our assumptions on $d$ are nearly optimal, as this independence ceases when $d=\omega((\log\log n)^2)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the semiring of abstract finite dynamical systems up to isomorphism, with the operations of alternative and synchronous execution. We continue searching for efficient algorithms for solving polynomial equations of the form $P(X) = B$, with a constant side B, with the goal of decomposing complex behaviors into simpler systems. Taking inspiration from the characterization of injective polynomials P over dynamical systems, which is based on a condition on the lengths of limit cycles of their coefficients, we introduce a more general notion of pseudo-injectivity by relaxing this constraint. We prove that the associated equations can be solved efficiently, even in certain cases where the input is encoded in an exponentially more compact way.</description>

      <title>Pathwidth of 2-Layer $k$-Planar Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A bipartite graph $G = (X \cup Y, E)$ is a 2-layer $k$-planar graph if it admits a drawing on the plane such that the vertices in $X$ and $Y$ are placed on two parallel lines respectively, edges are drawn as straight-line segments, and every edge involves at most $k$ crossings. Angelini, Da Lozzo, F\"orster, and Schneck [GD 2020; Comput. J., 2024] showed that every 2-layer $k$-planar graph has pathwidth at most $k + 1$. In this paper, we show that this bound is sharp by giving a 2-layer $k$-planar graph with pathwidth $k + 1$ for every $k \geq 0$. This improves their lower bound of $(k+3)/2$.</description>

      <title>On the Nucleolus of a Class of Linear Production Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.04105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the nucleolus in a class of cooperative games where agents collaborate by sharing demands and production-distribution capacities across multiple markets. These production-distribution games form a structured subclass of linear production games and capture applications such as horizontal collaboration in logistics. While computing the nucleolus is generally NP-hard for linear production games, we show that structural properties of production-distribution games enable efficient computation in several cases. Our main results focus on the uncapacitated variant. First, we provide a polynomial-time characterization of instances where the core reduces to a singleton, allowing direct computation of the nucleolus. Second, when the number of markets is fixed, we design a separation-based polynomial-time algorithm. Third, in the single-market case, we develop a faster combinatorial primal-dual algorithm that runs in $O(n^4)$.</description>

      <title>Isometric path complexity of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00278v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A set $S$ of isometric paths of a graph $G$ is ``$v$-rooted'', where $v$ is a vertex of $G$, if $v$ is one of the endpoints of all the isometric paths in $S$. The isometric path complexity of a graph $G$, denoted by $ipco{G}$, is the minimum integer $k$ such that there exists a vertex $v\in V(G)$ satisfying the following property: the vertices of any single isometric path $P$ of $G$ can be covered by $k$ many $v$-rooted isometric paths.
  First, we provide an $O(n^2 m)$-time algorithm to compute the isometric path complexity of a graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. Then we show that the isometric path complexity remains bounded for graphs in three seemingly unrelated graph classes, namely, hyperbolic graphs, (theta, prism, pyramid)-free graphs, and outerstring graphs.
  There is a direct algorithmic consequence of having small isometric path complexity. Specifically, we show that if the isometric path complexity of a graph $G$ is bounded by a constant, then there exists a polynomial-time constant-factor approximation algorithm for ISOMETRIC PATH COVER, whose objective is to cover all vertices of a graph with a minimum number of isometric paths. This applies to all the above graph classes.</description>

      <title>The Leaf Function of Penrose P2 Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08262v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a graph-theoretic problem in the Penrose P2-graphs which are the dual graphs of Penrose tilings by kites and darts. Using substitutions, local isomorphism and other properties of Penrose tilings, we construct a family of arbitrarily large induced subtrees of Penrose graphs with the largest possible number of leaves for a given number $n$ of vertices. These subtrees are called fully leafed induced subtrees. We denote their number of leaves $L_{P2}(n)$ for any non-negative integer $n$, and the sequence $\left(L_{P2}(n)\right)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is called the leaf function of Penrose P2-graphs. We present exact and recursive formulae for $L_{P2}(n)$, as well as an infinite sequence of fully leafed induced subtrees, which are caterpillar graphs. In particular, our proof relies on the construction of a finite graded poset of 3-internal-regular subtrees.</description>

      <title>Relative-error monotonicity testing</title>

Abstract: The standard model of Boolean function property testing is not well suited for testing $\textit{sparse}$ functions which have few satisfying assignments, since every such function is close (in the usual Hamming distance metric) to the constant-0 function. In this work we propose and investigate a new model for property testing of Boolean functions, called $\textit{relative-error testing}$, which provides a natural framework for testing sparse functions.
  This new model defines the distance between two functions $f, g: \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ to be $$\textsf{reldist}(f,g) := { \frac{|f^{-1}(1) \triangle g^{-1}(1)|} {|f^{-1}(1)|}}.$$ This is a more demanding distance measure than the usual Hamming distance ${ {|f^{-1}(1) \triangle g^{-1}(1)|}/{2^n}}$ when $|f^{-1}(1)| \ll 2^n$; to compensate for this, algorithms in the new model have access both to a black-box oracle for the function $f$ being tested and to a source of independent uniform satisfying assignments of $f$.
  In this paper we first give a few general results about the relative-error testing model; then, as our main technical contribution, we give a detailed study of algorithms and lower bounds for relative-error testing of $\textit{monotone}$ Boolean functions. We give upper and lower bounds which are parameterized by $N=|f^{-1}(1)|$, the sparsity of the function $f$ being tested. Our results show that there are interesting differences between relative-error monotonicity testing of sparse Boolean functions, and monotonicity testing in the standard model. These results motivate further study of the testability of Boolean function properties in the relative-error model.</description>

      <title>A database of constructions of Hadamard matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hadamard matrices of order $n$ are conjectured to exist whenever $n$ is $1$, $2$, or a multiple of $4$; a similar conjecture exists for skew Hadamard matrices. We provide constructions covering orders $\le 1208$ of all known Hadamard and skew Hadamard matrices in the open-source software SageMath. This allowed us to verify the correctness of results given in the literature. Within this range, just one order, $292$, of a skew Hadamard matrix claimed to have a known construction, required a fix.
  We also produce the up to date tables, for $n \le 2999$ (resp. $n\le 999$ for skew case), of the minimum exponents $m$ such that a (skew) Hadamard matrix of order $2^m n$ is known, improving over 100 entries in the previously published sources. We explain how tables' entries are related to Riesel numbers. As a by-product of the latter, we show that the Paley constructions of (skew-)Hadamard matrices do not work for the order $2^m 509203$, for any $m$.</description>

      <title>Belief Propagation Guided Decimation on Random k-XORSAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the performance of Belief Propagation Guided Decimation, a physics-inspired message passing algorithm, on the random $k$-XORSAT problem. Specifically, we derive an explicit threshold up to which the algorithm succeeds with a strictly positive probability $\Omega(1)$ that we compute explicitly, but beyond which the algorithm with high probability fails to find a satisfying assignment. In addition, we analyse a thought experiment called the decimation process for which we identify a (non-) reconstruction and a condensation phase transition. The main results of the present work confirm physics predictions from [RTS: J. Stat. Mech. 2009] that link the phase transitions of the decimation process with the performance of the algorithm, and improve over partial results from a recent article [Yung: Proc. ICALP 2024].</description>

      <title>On the $E$-base of Finite Lattices: Semidistributive, Modular, and Geometric Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04146</link>

Abstract: Implicational bases are a well-known representation of closure spaces and their closure lattices. This representation is not unique, though, and a closure space usually admits multiple bases. Among these, the canonical base, the canonical direct base as well as the $D$-base aroused significant attention due to their structural and algorithmic properties. Recently, a new base has emerged from the study of free lattices: the $E$-base. It is a refinement of the $D$-base that, unlike the aforementioned implicational bases, does not always accurately represent its associated closure space. This leads to an intriguing question: for which classes of (closure) lattices do closure spaces have valid $E$-base? Lower-bounded lattices are known to form such a class. In this paper, we prove that for semidistributive lattices, the $E$-base is both valid and minimum. We also characterize those modular and geometric lattices that have valid $E$-base. Finally, we prove that any lattice is a sublattice of a lattice with valid $E$-base.</description>

      <title>Vertex-Based Localization of generalized Tur\'{a}n Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of graphs. A graph is called $\mathcal{F}$-free if it does not contain any member of $\mathcal{F}$. Generalized Tur\'{a}n problems aim to maximize the number of copies of a graph $H$ in an $n$-vertex $\mathcal{F}$-free graph. This maximum is denoted by $ex(n, H, \mathcal{F})$. When $H \cong K_2$, it is simply denoted by $ex(n,F)$. Erd\H{o}s and Gallai established the bounds $ex(n, P_{k+1}) \leq \frac{n(k-1)}{2}$ and $ex(n, C_{\geq k+1}) \leq \frac{k(n-1)}{2}$. This was later extended by Luo \cite{luo2018maximum}, who showed that $ex(n, K_s, P_{k+1}) \leq \frac{n}{k} \binom{k}{s}$ and $ex(n, K_s, C_{\geq k+1}) \leq \frac{n-1}{k-1} \binom{k}{s}$. Let $N(G,K_s)$ denote the number of copies of $K_s$ in $G$. In this paper, we use the vertex-based localization framework, introduced in \cite{adak2025vertex}, to generalize Luo's bounds. In a graph $G$, for each $v \in V(G)$, define $p(v)$ to be the length of the longest path that contains $v$. We show that \[N(G,K_s) \leq \sum_{v \in V(G)} \frac{1}{p(v)+1}{p(v)+1\choose s} = \frac{1}{s}\sum_{v \in V(G)}{p(v) \choose s-1}\] We strengthen the cycle bound from \cite{luo2018maximum} as follows: In graph $G$, for each $v \in V(G)$, let $c(v)$ be the length of the longest cycle that contains $v$, or $2$ if $v$ is not part of any cycle. We prove that \[N(G,K_s) \leq \left(\sum_{v\in V(G)}\frac{1}{c(v)-1}{c(v) \choose s}\right) - \frac{1}{c(u)-1}{c(u) \choose s}\] where $c(u)$ denotes the circumference of $G$. Furthermore, we characterize the class of extremal graphs that attain equality for these bounds. We provide full proofs for the cases $s = 1$ and $s \geq 3$, while the case $s = 2$ follows from the result in \cite{adak2025vertex}.</description>

      <title>Localized Clique Bounds in Bounded-Degree and Bounded-Path Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of graphs. A graph is said to be $\mathcal{F}$-free if it contains no member of $\mathcal{F}$. The generalized Tur\'{a}n number $ex(n,H,\mathcal{F})$ denotes the maximum number of copies of a graph $H$ in an $n$-vertex $\mathcal{F}$-free graph, while the generalized edge Tur\'{a}n number $mex(m,H,\mathcal{F})$ denotes the maximum number of copies of $H$ in an $m$-edge $\mathcal{F}$-free graph.
  It is well known that if a graph has maximum degree $d$, then it is $K_{1,d+1}$-free. Wood \cite{wood} proved that $ex(n,K_t,K_{1,d+1}) \leq \frac{n}{d+1}\binom{d+1}{t}$. More recently, Chakraborty and Chen \cite{CHAKRABORTI2024103955} established analogous bounds for graphs with bounded maximum path length: $mex(m,K_t,P_{r+1}) \leq \frac{m}{\binom{r}{2}}\binom{r}{t}$.
  In this paper, we improve these bounds using the localization technique, based on suitably defined local parameters. Furthermore, we characterize the extremal graphs attaining these improved bounds.</description>
