      <title>Strong Interactions in Crystalline Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16700v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A multiscale expansion procedure reveals a crystalline vacuum state arising as a result of resonant interactions among weak Planck-scale waves on spinor and cospinor manifolds. Quarks are presented as elastic modulations of the vacuum crystal. The complementing modes are identified with colors, and distinctions between flavors are attributed to asymmetries of the vacuum lattice. Repercussion of the theory include insights into the nature of quantum uncertainty and dark matter and energy.</description>

      <title>From new thermodynamics to mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06005v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The laws of classical and quantum mechanics are rebuilt in the frame of new thermodynamics. Heat is the sum of kinetic energy, system work, and system potential of gas, while force is the linear gradients of heat variation. Exporters and importers of force are evident in terms of exotherm and endotherm. Temperature and volume gradients create asymmetric forces driving rotation and spin (self-rotation). It verifies that force transfer does not need a medium. As an outstanding achievement, a succinct and general equation is derived to predict the equilibrium distance of molecular interaction:quation, without using any assumption, such as van der Waals force and dispersion force. In addition, the origins and attributes of repulsion and attraction are disclosed. Predicting results is applausive. For example, at 298 K, Le for N2, O2, and CH4 are 3.11, 3.11, and 3.68 astrong, comparable to the data adopted in MD simulations of the literature. Furthermore, electrons are regarded as electro-neutral particles to build the atom structure. It is consistent with the quantum predictions. The first ionization energies of elements reported in the references are found to be close to the kinetic energies calculated in this paper.</description>

      <title>Two-Time Relativistic Bohmian Model of Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09049v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-Time relativistic Bohmian Model (TTBM) is a theory in which the apparently paradoxical aspects of Quantum Mechanics are the effect of the existence of an extra unobservable time dimension. In this paper, the model is first rigorously and thoroughly summarized: definition, salient properties and observational explanations (double-slit experiment). Secondly, the theory is applied to a generic spherical atomic orbit, obtaining oscillations of the electron in the new time dimension, tau, that demonstrate the static nature of the orbitals. Something very similar happens in the case of a particle in box, where tau-oscillations cause the particle to spread out at steady states. Some speculations about spin and astrophysical follow. Finally, strengths and pending tasks of the model are summarized.</description>
