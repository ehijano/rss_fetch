      <title>Energy Efficiency Analysis of IRS-aided Wireless Communication Systems Under Statistical QoS Constraints: An Information-Theoretic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the information-theoretic energy efficiency of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided wireless communication systems, taking into account the statistical quality-of-service (QoS) constraints on delay violation probabilities. Specifically, effective capacity is adopted to capture the maximum constant arrival rate that can be supported by a time-varying service process while fulfilling these statistical QoS requirements. We derive the minimum bit energy required for the IRS-aided wireless communication system under QoS constraints and analyze the spectral efficiency and energy efficiency tradeoff at low but nonzero signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels by also characterizing the wideband slope values. Our analysis demonstrates that the energy efficiency for the considered system under statistical QoS constraints can approach that for a system without QoS limitations in the low-SNR regime. Additionally, deploying a sufficiently large number of practical IRS reflecting elements can substantially reduce energy consumption required to achieve desired spectral efficiency performance in the low-power regime, even with limited bit-resolution phase shifters. Besides, we reveal that compared with the results applied to the low-power regime, higher effective capacity performance can be achieved in scenarios with sparse multipath fading while achieving the same minimum bit energy in the wideband regime.</description>

      <title>Discrete RIS Enhanced Space Shift Keying MIMO System via Reflecting Beamforming Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a discrete reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted spatial shift keying (SSK) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) scheme is investigated, in which a direct link between the transmitter and the receiver is considered. To improve the reliability of the RIS-SSK-MIMO scheme, we formulate an objective function based on minimizing the average bit error probability (ABEP). Since the reflecting phase shift of RIS is discrete, it is difficult to address this problem directly. To this end, we optimize the RIS phase shift to maximize the Euclidean distance between the minimum constellations by applying the successive convex approximation (SCA) and penaltyalternating optimization method. Simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed RIS-SSK-MIMO scheme and demonstrate the impact of the number of RIS elements, the number of phase quantization bits, and the number of receive and transmit antennas in terms of reliability.</description>

      <title>RSRP Measurement Based Channel Autocorrelation Estimation for IRS-Aided Wideband Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00374v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The passive and frequency-flat reflection of IRS, as well as the high-dimensional IRS-reflected channels, have posed significant challenges for efficient IRS channel estimation, especially in wideband communication systems with significant multi-path channel delay spread. To address these challenges, we propose a novel neural network (NN)-empowered framework for IRS channel autocorrelation matrix estimation in wideband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. This framework relies only on the easily accessible reference signal received power (RSRP) measurements at users in existing wideband communication systems, without requiring additional pilot transmission. Based on the estimates of channel autocorrelation matrix, the passive reflection of IRS is optimized to maximize the average user received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over all subcarriers in the OFDM system. Numerical results verify that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms existing powermeasurement-based IRS reflection designs in wideband channels.</description>

      <title>Pay Less But Get More: A Dual-Attention-based Channel Estimation Network for Massive MIMO Systems with Low-Density Pilots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00986v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To reap the promising benefits of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, accurate channel state information (CSI) is required through channel estimation. However, due to the complicated wireless propagation environment and large-scale antenna arrays, precise channel estimation for massive MIMO systems is significantly challenging and costs an enormous training overhead. Considerable time-frequency resources are consumed to acquire sufficient accuracy of CSI, which thus severely degrades systems' spectral and energy efficiencies. In this paper, we propose a dual-attention-based channel estimation network (DACEN) to realize accurate channel estimation via low-density pilots, by jointly learning the spatial-temporal domain features of massive MIMO channels with the temporal attention module and the spatial attention module. To further improve the estimation accuracy, we propose a parameter-instance transfer learning approach to transfer the channel knowledge learned from the high-density pilots pre-acquired during the training dataset collection period. Experimental results reveal that the proposed DACEN-based method achieves better channel estimation performance than the existing methods under various pilot-density settings and signal-to-noise ratios. Additionally, with the proposed parameter-instance transfer learning approach, the DACEN-based method achieves additional performance gain, thereby further demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Low-Overhead Channel Estimation via 3D Extrapolation for TDD mmWave Massive MIMO Systems Under High-Mobility Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In TDD mmWave massive MIMO systems, the downlink CSI can be attained through uplink channel estimation thanks to the uplink-downlink channel reciprocity. However, the channel aging issue is significant under high-mobility scenarios and thus necessitates frequent uplink channel estimation. In addition, large amounts of antennas and subcarriers lead to high-dimensional CSI matrices, aggravating the pilot training overhead. To systematically reduce the pilot overhead, a spatial, frequency, and temporal domain (3D) channel extrapolation framework is proposed in this paper. Considering the marginal effects of pilots in the spatial and frequency domains and the effectiveness of traditional knowledge-driven channel estimation methods, we first propose a knowledge-and-data driven spatial-frequency channel extrapolation network (KDD-SFCEN) for uplink channel estimation by exploiting the least square estimator for coarse channel estimation and joint spatial-frequency channel extrapolation to reduce the spatial-frequency domain pilot overhead. Then, resorting to the uplink-downlink channel reciprocity and temporal domain dependencies of downlink channels, a temporal uplink-downlink channel extrapolation network (TUDCEN) is proposed for slot-level channel extrapolation, aiming to enlarge the pilot signal period and thus reduce the temporal domain pilot overhead under high-mobility scenarios. Specifically, we propose the spatial-frequency sampling embedding module to reduce the representation dimension and consequent computational complexity, and we propose to exploit the autoregressive generative Transformer for generating downlink channels autoregressively. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in significantly reducing the pilot training overhead by more than 16 times and improving the system's spectral efficiency under high-mobility scenarios.</description>

      <title>Unauthorized UAV Countermeasure for Low-Altitude Economy: Joint Communications and Jamming based on MIMO Cellular Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22746v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To ensure the thriving development of low-altitude economy, countering unauthorized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is an essential task. The existing widely deployed base stations hold great potential for joint communication and jamming. In light of this, this paper investigates the joint design of beamforming to simultaneously support communication with legitimate users and countermeasure against unauthorized UAVs based on dual-functional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cellular systems. We first formulate a joint communication and jamming (JCJ) problem, relaxing it through semi-definite relaxation (SDR) to obtain a tractable semi-definite programming (SDP) problem, with SDR providing an essential step toward simplifying the complex JCJ design. Although the solution to the relaxed SDP problem cannot directly solve the original problem, it offers valuable insights for further refinement. Therefore, we design a novel constraint specifically tailored to the structure of the SDP problem, ensuring that the solution adheres to the rank-1 constraint of the original problem. Finally, we validate effectiveness of the proposed JCJ scheme through extensive simulations. Simulation codes are provided to reproduce the results in this paper: https://github.com/LiZhuoRan0. The results confirm that the proposed JCJ scheme can operate effectively when the total number of legitimate users and unauthorized UAVs exceeds the number of antennas.</description>

      <title>Task-oriented Age of Information for Remote Monitoring Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of intelligent applications has fostered the development of a task-oriented communication paradigm, where a comprehensive, universal, and practical metric is crucial for unleashing the potential of this paradigm. To this end, we introduce an innovative metric, the Task-oriented Age of Information (TAoI), to measure whether the content of information is relevant to the system task, thereby assisting the system in efficiently completing designated tasks. Also, we study the TAoI in a remote monitoring system, whose task is to identify target images and transmit them for subsequent analysis. We formulate the dynamic transmission problem as a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) and transform it into an equivalent Markov Decision Process (MDP) to minimize TAoI and find the optimal transmission policy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the optimal strategy is a threshold-based policy regarding TAoI and propose a relative value iteration algorithm based on the threshold structure to obtain the optimal transmission policy. Finally, simulation results show the superior performance of the optimal transmission policy compared to the baseline policies.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Multimodal Integration in the Variational Autoencoder from an Information-Theoretic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human perception is inherently multimodal. We integrate, for instance, visual, proprioceptive and tactile information into one experience. Hence, multimodal learning is of importance for building robotic systems that aim at robustly interacting with the real world. One potential model that has been proposed for multimodal integration is the multimodal variational autoencoder. A variational autoencoder (VAE) consists of two networks, an encoder that maps the data to a stochastic latent space and a decoder that reconstruct this data from an element of this latent space. The multimodal VAE integrates inputs from different modalities at two points in time in the latent space and can thereby be used as a controller for a robotic agent. Here we use this architecture and introduce information-theoretic measures in order to analyze how important the integration of the different modalities are for the reconstruction of the input data. Therefore we calculate two different types of measures, the first type is called single modality error and assesses how important the information from a single modality is for the reconstruction of this modality or all modalities. Secondly, the measures named loss of precision calculate the impact that missing information from only one modality has on the reconstruction of this modality or the whole vector. The VAE is trained via the evidence lower bound, which can be written as a sum of two different terms, namely the reconstruction and the latent loss. The impact of the latent loss can be weighted via an additional variable, which has been introduced to combat posterior collapse. Here we train networks with four different weighting schedules and analyze them with respect to their capabilities for multimodal integration.</description>

      <title>New classes of reversible cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Boolean function $f$ on $k$~bits induces a shift-invariant vectorial Boolean function $F$ from $n$ bits to $n$ bits for every $n\geq k$. If $F$ is bijective for every $n$, we say that $f$ is a proper lifting, and it is known that proper liftings are exactly those functions that arise as local rules of reversible cellular automata. We construct new families of such liftings for arbitrary large $k$ and discuss whether all have been identified for $k\leq 6$.</description>

      <title>Robust mmWave/sub-THz multi-connectivity using minimal coordination and coarse synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02324v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates simpler alternatives to coherent joint transmission for supporting robust connectivity against signal blockage in mmWave/sub-THz access networks. By taking an information-theoretic viewpoint, we demonstrate analytically that with a careful design, full macrodiversity gains and significant SNR gains can be achieved through canonical receivers and minimal coordination and synchronization requirements at the infrastructure side. Our proposed scheme extends non-coherent joint transmission by employing a special form of diversity to counteract artificially induced deep fades that would otherwise make this technique often compare unfavorably against standard transmitter selection schemes. Additionally, the inclusion of an Alamouti-like space-time coding layer is shown to recover a significant fraction of the optimal performance. Our conclusions are based on a statistical single-user multi-point intermittent block fading channel model that, although simplified, enables rigorous ergodic and outage rate analysis, while also considering timing offsets due to imperfect delay compensation. In addition, we validate our theoretical approach by means of deterministic ray-tracing simulations that capture the essential features of next generation mmWave/sub-THz communications.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Cache Content Placement in Integrated Terrestrial and Non-terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-terrestrial networks (NTN) have emerged as a transformative solution to bridge the digital divide and deliver essential services to remote and underserved areas. In this context, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations offer remarkable potential for efficient cache content broadcast in remote regions, thereby extending the reach of digital services. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize wireless edge content placement using NTN. Despite wide coverage, the varying NTN transmission capabilities must be carefully aligned with each content placement to maximize broadcast efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize wireless edge content placement using NTN, positioning NTN as a complement to TN for achieving optimal content broadcasting. Specifically, we dynamically select content for placement via NTN links. This selection is based on popularity and suitability for delivery through NTN, while considering the orbital motion of LEO satellites. Our system-level case studies, based on a practical LEO constellation, demonstrate the significant improvement in placement speed compared to existing methods, which neglect network mobility. We also demonstrate that NTN links significantly outperform standalone wireless TN solutions, particularly in the early stages of content delivery. This advantage is amplified when there is a higher correlation of content popularity across geographical regions.</description>

      <title>Self-adhesivity in lattices of abstract conditional independence models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14053v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an algebraic concept of the frame for abstract conditional independence (CI) models, together with basic operations with respect to which such a frame should be closed: copying and marginalization. Three standard examples of such frames are (discrete) probabilistic CI structures, semi-graphoids and structural semi-graphoids. We concentrate on those frames which are closed under the operation of set-theoretical intersection because, for these, the respective families of CI models are lattices. This allows one to apply the results from lattice theory and formal concept analysis to describe such families in terms of implications among CI statements.
  The central concept of this paper is that of self-adhesivity defined in algebraic terms, which is a combinatorial reflection of the self-adhesivity concept studied earlier in context of polymatroids and information theory. The generalization also leads to a self-adhesivity operator defined on the hyper-level of CI frames. We answer some of the questions related to this approach and raise other open questions.
  The core of the paper is in computations. The combinatorial approach to computation might overcome some memory and space limitation of software packages based on polyhedral geometry, in particular, if SAT solvers are utilized. We characterize some basic CI families over 4 variables in terms of canonical implications among CI statements. We apply our method in information-theoretical context to the task of entropic region demarcation over 5 variables.</description>

      <title>Multi-Group Proportional Representation in Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image search and retrieval tasks can perpetuate harmful stereotypes, erase cultural identities, and amplify social disparities. Current approaches to mitigate these representational harms balance the number of retrieved items across population groups defined by a small number of (often binary) attributes. However, most existing methods overlook intersectional groups determined by combinations of group attributes, such as gender, race, and ethnicity. We introduce Multi-Group Proportional Representation (MPR), a novel metric that measures representation across intersectional groups. We develop practical methods for estimating MPR, provide theoretical guarantees, and propose optimization algorithms to ensure MPR in retrieval. We demonstrate that existing methods optimizing for equal and proportional representation metrics may fail to promote MPR. Crucially, our work shows that optimizing MPR yields more proportional representation across multiple intersectional groups specified by a rich function class, often with minimal compromise in retrieval accuracy.</description>
