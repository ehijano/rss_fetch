      <title>AI Narrative Breakdown. A Critical Assessment of Power and Promise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article sets off for an exploration of the still evolving discourse surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) in the wake of the release of ChatGPT. It scrutinizes the pervasive narratives that are shaping the societal engagement with AI, spotlighting key themes such as agency and decision-making, autonomy, truthfulness, knowledge processing, prediction, general purpose, neutrality and objectivity, apolitical optimization, sustainability game-changer, democratization, mass unemployment, and the dualistic portrayal of AI as either a harbinger of societal utopia or dystopia. Those narratives are analysed critically based on insights from critical computer science, critical data and algorithm studies, from STS, data protection theory, as well as from the philosophy of mind and semiotics. To properly analyse the narratives presented, the article first delves into a historical and technical contextualisation of the AI discourse itself. The article then introduces the notion of "Zeitgeist AI" to critique the imprecise and misleading application of the term "AI" across various societal sectors. Then, by discussing common narratives with nuance, the article contextualises and challenges often assumed socio-political implications of AI, uncovering in detail and with examples the inherent political, power infused and value-laden decisions within all AI applications. Concluding with a call for a more grounded engagement with AI, the article carves out acute problems ignored by the narratives discussed and proposes new narratives recognizing AI as a human-directed tool necessarily subject to societal governance.</description>

      <title>Toward Third-Party Assurance of AI Systems: Design Requirements, Prototype, and Early Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems proliferate, the need for systematic, transparent, and actionable processes for evaluating them is growing. While many resources exist to support AI evaluation, they have several limitations. Few address both the process of designing, developing, and deploying an AI system and the outcomes it produces. Furthermore, few are end-to-end and operational, give actionable guidance, or present evidence of usability or effectiveness in practice. In this paper, we introduce a third-party AI assurance framework that addresses these gaps. We focus on third-party assurance to prevent conflict of interest and ensure credibility and accountability of the process. We begin by distinguishing assurance from audits in several key dimensions. Then, following design principles, we reflect on the shortcomings of existing resources to identify a set of design requirements for AI assurance. We then construct a prototype of an assurance process that consists of (1) a responsibility assignment matrix to determine the different levels of involvement each stakeholder has at each stage of the AI lifecycle, (2) an interview protocol for each stakeholder of an AI system, (3) a maturity matrix to assess AI systems' adherence to best practices, and (4) a template for an assurance report that draws from more mature assurance practices in business accounting. We conduct early validation of our AI assurance framework by applying the framework to two distinct AI use cases -- a business document tagging tool for downstream processing in a large private firm, and a housing resource allocation tool in a public agency -- and conducting expert validation interviews. Our findings show early evidence that our AI assurance framework is sound and comprehensive, usable across different organizational contexts, and effective at identifying bespoke issues with AI systems.</description>

      <title>The Third-Party Access Effect: An Overlooked Challenge in Secondary Use of Educational Real-World Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secondary use of growing real-world data (RWD) in education offers significant opportunities for research, yet privacy practices intended to enable third-party access to such RWD are rarely evaluated for their implications for downstream analyses. As a result, potential problems introduced by otherwise standard privacy practices may remain unnoticed. To address this gap, we investigate potential issues arising from common practices by assessing (1) the re-identification risk of fine-grained RWD, (2) how communicating such risks influences learners' privacy behaviour, and (3) the sensitivity of downstream analytical conclusions to resulting changes in the data. We focus on these practices because re-identification risk and stakeholder communication can jointly influence the data shared with third parties. We find that substantial re-identification risk in RWD, when communicated to stakeholders, can induce opt-outs and non-self-disclosure behaviours. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that these behavioural changes can meaningfully alter the shared data, limiting validity of secondary-use findings. We conceptualise this phenomenon as the third-party access effect (3PAE) and discuss implications for trustworthy secondary use of educational RWD.</description>

      <title>AI Literacy, Safety Awareness, and STEM Career Aspirations of Australian Secondary Students: Evaluating the Impact of Workshop Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deepfakes and other forms of synthetic media pose growing safety risks for adolescents, yet evidence on students' exposure and related behaviours remains limited. This study evaluates the impact of Day of AI Australia's workshop-based intervention designed to improve AI literacy and conceptual understanding among Australian secondary students (Years 7-10). Using a mixed-methods approach with pre- and post-intervention surveys (N=205 pre; N=163 post), we analyse changes in students' ability to identify AI in everyday tools, their understanding of AI ethics, training, and safety, and their interest in STEM-related careers.
  Baseline data revealed notable synthetic media risks: 82.4% of students reported having seen deepfakes, 18.5% reported sharing them, and 7.3% reported creating them.
  Results show higher self-reported AI knowledge and confidence after the intervention, alongside improved recognition of AI in widely used platforms such as Netflix, Spotify, and TikTok. This pattern suggests a shift from seeing these tools as merely "algorithm-based" to recognising them as AI-driven systems. Students also reported increased interest in STEM careers post-workshop; however, effect sizes were small, indicating that sustained approaches beyond one-off workshops may be needed to influence longer-term aspirations. Overall, the findings support scalable AI literacy programs that pair foundational AI concepts with an explicit emphasis on synthetic media safety.</description>

      <title>Ethical Risks of Large Language Models in Medical Consultation: An Assessment Based on Reproductive Ethics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in healthcare and medical consultation settings, a growing concern is whether these models can respond to medical inquiries in a manner that is ethically compliant--particularly in accordance with local ethical standards. To address the pressing need for comprehensive research on reliability and safety, this study systematically evaluates LLM performance in answering questions related to reproductive ethics, specifically assessing their alignment with Chinese ethical regulations.
  Methods: We evaluated eight prominent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude-3.7) on a custom test set of 986 questions (906 subjective, 80 objective) derived from 168 articles within Chinese reproductive ethics regulations. Subjective responses were evaluated using a novel six-dimensional scoring rubric assessing Safety (Normative Compliance, Guidance Safety) and Quality of the Answer (Problem Identification, Citation, Suggestion, Empathy).
  Results: Significant safety issues were prevalent, with risk rates for unsafe or misleading advice reaching 29.91%. A systemic weakness was observed across all models: universally poor performance in citing normative sources and expressing empathy. We also identified instances of anomalous moral reasoning, including logical self-contradictions and responses violating fundamental moral intuitions.
  Conclusions: Current LLMs are unreliable and unsafe for autonomous reproductive ethics counseling. Despite knowledge recall, they exhibit critical deficiencies in safety, logical consistency, and essential humanistic skills. These findings serve as a critical cautionary note against premature deployment, urging future development to prioritize robust reasoning, regulatory justification, and empathy.</description>

      <title>Beyond Abstract Compliance: Operationalising trust in AI as a moral relationship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dominant approaches, e.g. the EU's "Trustworthy AI framework", treat trust as a property that can be designed for, evaluated, and governed according to normative and technical criteria. They do not address how trust is subjectively cultivated and experienced, culturally embedded, and inherently relational. This paper proposes some expanded principles for trust in AI that can be incorporated into common development methods and frame trust as a dynamic, temporal relationship, which involves transparency and mutual respect. We draw on relational ethics and, in particular, African communitarian philosophies, to foreground the nuances of inclusive, participatory processes and long-term relationships with communities. Involving communities throughout the AI lifecycle can foster meaningful relationships with AI design and development teams that incrementally build trust and promote more equitable and context-sensitive AI systems. We illustrate how trust-enabling principles based on African relational ethics can be operationalised, using two use-cases for AI: healthcare and education.</description>

      <title>Eroding the Truth-Default: A Causal Analysis of Human Susceptibility to Foundation Model Hallucinations and Disinformation in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As foundation models (FMs) approach human-level fluency, distinguishing synthetic from organic content has become a key challenge for Trustworthy Web Intelligence.
  This paper presents JudgeGPT and RogueGPT, a dual-axis framework that decouples "authenticity" from "attribution" to investigate the mechanisms of human susceptibility. Analyzing 918 evaluations across five FMs (including GPT-4 and Llama-2), we employ Structural Causal Models (SCMs) as a principal framework for formulating testable causal hypotheses about detection accuracy.
  Contrary to partisan narratives, we find that political orientation shows a negligible association with detection performance ($r=-0.10$). Instead, "fake news familiarity" emerges as a candidate mediator ($r=0.35$), suggesting that exposure may function as adversarial training for human discriminators. We identify a "fluency trap" where GPT-4 outputs (HumanMachineScore: 0.20) bypass Source Monitoring mechanisms, rendering them indistinguishable from human text.
  These findings suggest that "pre-bunking" interventions should target cognitive source monitoring rather than demographic segmentation to ensure trustworthy information ecosystems.</description>

      <title>When Machines Get It Wrong: Large Language Models Perpetuate Autism Myths More Than Humans Do</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22893v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models become ubiquitous sources of health information, understanding their capacity to accurately represent stigmatized conditions is crucial for responsible deployment. This study examines whether leading AI systems perpetuate or challenge misconceptions about Autism Spectrum Disorder, a condition particularly vulnerable to harmful myths. We administered a 30-item instrument measuring autism knowledge to 178 participants and three state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini. Contrary to expectations that AI systems would leverage their vast training data to outperform humans, we found the opposite pattern: human participants endorsed significantly fewer myths than LLMs (36.2% vs. 44.8% error rate; z = -2.59, p = .0048). In 18 of the 30 evaluated items, humans significantly outperformed AI systems. These findings reveal a critical blind spot in current AI systems and have important implications for human-AI interaction design, the epistemology of machine knowledge, and the need to center neurodivergent perspectives in AI development.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Effectiveness of OpenAI's Parental Control System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate how effectively platform-level parental controls moderate a mainstream conversational assistant used by minors. Our two-phase protocol first builds a category-balanced conversation corpus via PAIR-style iterative prompt refinement over API, then has trained human agents replay/refine those prompts in the consumer UI using a designated child account while monitoring the linked parent inbox for alerts. We focus on seven risk areas -- physical harm, pornography, privacy violence, health consultation, fraud, hate speech, and malware and quantify four outcomes: Notification Rate (NR), Leak-Through (LR), Overblocking (OBR), and UI Intervention Rate (UIR). Using an automated judge (with targeted human audit) and comparing the current backend to legacy variants (GPT-4.1/4o), we find that notifications are selective rather than comprehensive: privacy violence, fraud, hate speech, and malware triggered no parental alerts in our runs, whereas physical harm (highest), pornography, and some health queries produced intermittent alerts. The current backend shows lower leak-through than legacy models, yet overblocking of benign, educational queries near sensitive topics remains common and is not surfaced to parents, revealing a policy-product gap between on-screen safeguards and parent-facing telemetry. We propose actionable fixes: broaden/configure the notification taxonomy, couple visible safeguards to privacy-preserving parent summaries, and prefer calibrated, age-appropriate safe rewrites over blanket refusals.</description>

      <title>Gender Disparities in StackOverflow's Community-Based Question Answering: A Matter of Quantity versus Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community Question-Answering platforms, such as Stack Overflow (SO), are valuable knowledge exchange and problem-solving resources. These platforms incorporate mechanisms to assess the quality of answers and participants' expertise, ideally free from discriminatory biases. However, prior research has highlighted persistent gender biases, raising concerns about the inclusivity and fairness of these systems. Addressing such biases is crucial for fostering equitable online communities. While previous studies focus on detecting gender bias by comparing male and female user characteristics, they often overlook the interaction between genders, inherent answer quality, and the selection of ``best answers'' by question askers. In this study, we investigate whether answer quality is influenced by gender using a combination of human evaluations and automated assessments powered by Large Language Models. Our findings reveal no significant gender differences in answer quality, nor any substantial influence of gender bias on the selection of ``best answers." Instead, we find that the significant gender disparities in SO's reputation scores are primarily attributable to differences in users' activity levels, e.g., the number of questions and answers they write. Our results have important implications for the design of scoring systems in community question-answering platforms. In particular, reputation systems that heavily emphasize activity volume risk amplifying gender disparities that do not reflect actual differences in answer quality, calling for more equitable design strategies.</description>

      <title>How should AI Safety Benchmarks Benchmark Safety?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI safety benchmarks are pivotal for safety in advanced AI systems; however, they have significant technical, epistemic, and sociotechnical shortcomings. We present a review of 210 safety benchmarks that maps out common challenges in safety benchmarking, documenting failures and limitations by drawing from engineering sciences and long-established theories of risk and safety. We argue that adhering to established risk management principles, mapping the space of what can(not) be measured, developing robust probabilistic metrics, and efficiently deploying measurement theory to connect benchmarking objectives with the world can significantly improve the validity and usefulness of AI safety benchmarks. The review provides a roadmap on how to improve AI safety benchmarking, and we illustrate the effectiveness of these recommendations through quantitative and qualitative evaluation. We also introduce a checklist that can help researchers and practitioners develop robust and epistemologically sound safety benchmarks. This study advances the science of benchmarking and helps practitioners deploy AI systems more responsibly.</description>

      <title>MemeChain: A Multimodal Cross-Chain Dataset for Meme Coin Forensics and Risk Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The meme coin ecosystem has grown into one of the most active yet least observable segments of the cryptocurrency market, characterized by extreme churn, minimal project commitment, and widespread fraudulent behavior. While countless meme coins are deployed across multiple blockchains, they rely heavily on off-chain web and social infrastructure to signal legitimacy. These very signals are largely absent from existing datasets, which are often limited to single-chain data or lack the multimodal artifacts required for comprehensive risk modeling.
  To address this gap, we introduce MemeChain, a large-scale, open-source, cross-chain dataset comprising 34,988 meme coins across Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Solana, and Base. MemeChain integrates on-chain data with off-chain artifacts, including website HTML source code, token logos, and linked social media accounts, enabling multimodal and forensic study of meme coin projects. Analysis of the dataset shows that visual branding is frequently omitted in low-effort deployments, and many projects lack a functional website. Moreover, we quantify the ecosystem's extreme volatility, identifying 1,801 tokens (5.15%) that cease all trading activity within just 24 hours of launch. By providing unified cross-chain coverage and rich off-chain context, MemeChain serves as a foundational resource for research in financial forensics, multimodal anomaly detection, and automated scam prevention in the meme coin ecosystem.</description>

      <title>The Benefit of Collective Intelligence in Community-Based Content Moderation is Limited by Overt Political Signalling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms face increasing scrutiny over the rapid spread of misinformation. In response, many have adopted community-based content moderation systems, including Community Notes (formerly Birdwatch) on X (formerly Twitter), Footnotes on TikTok, and Facebook's Community Notes initiative. However, research shows that the current design of these systems can allow political biases to influence both the development of notes and the rating processes, reducing their overall effectiveness. We hypothesize that enabling users to collaborate on writing notes, rather than relying solely on individually authored notes, can enhance their overall quality. To test this idea, we conducted an online experiment in which participants jointly authored notes on political posts. Our results show that teams produce notes that are rated as more helpful than individually written notes. We also find that politically diverse teams perform better when evaluating Republican posts, while group composition does not affect perceived note quality for Democrat posts. However, the advantage of collaboration diminishes when team members are aware of one another's political affiliations. Taken together, these findings underscore the complexity of community-based content moderation and highlight the importance of understanding group dynamics and political diversity when designing more effective moderation systems.</description>

      <title>Sparks of Rationality: Do Reasoning LLMs Align with Human Judgment and Choice?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly positioned as decision engines for hiring, healthcare, and economic judgment, yet real-world human judgment reflects a balance between rational deliberation and emotion-driven bias. If LLMs are to participate in high-stakes decisions or serve as models of human behavior, it is critical to assess whether they exhibit analogous patterns of (ir)rationalities and biases. To this end, we evaluate multiple LLM families on (i) benchmarks testing core axioms of rational choice and (ii) classic decision domains from behavioral economics and social norms where emotions are known to shape judgment and choice. Across settings, we show that deliberate "thinking" reliably improves rationality and pushes models toward expected-value maximization. To probe human-like affective distortions and their interaction with reasoning, we use two emotion-steering methods: in-context priming (ICP) and representation-level steering (RLS). ICP induces strong directional shifts that are often extreme and difficult to calibrate, whereas RLS produces more psychologically plausible patterns but with lower reliability. Our results suggest that the same mechanisms that improve rationality also amplify sensitivity to affective interventions, and that different steering methods trade off controllability against human-aligned behavior. Overall, this points to a tension between reasoning and affective steering, with implications for both human simulation and the safe deployment of LLM-based decision systems.</description>

      <title>Culturally Grounded Personas in Large Language Models: Characterization and Alignment with Socio-Psychological Value Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the growing utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) for simulating human behavior, the extent to which these synthetic personas accurately reflect world and moral value systems across different cultural conditionings remains uncertain. This paper investigates the alignment of synthetic, culturally-grounded personas with established frameworks, specifically the World Values Survey (WVS), the Inglehart-Welzel Cultural Map, and Moral Foundations Theory. We conceptualize and produce LLM-generated personas based on a set of interpretable WVS-derived variables, and we examine the generated personas through three complementary lenses: positioning on the Inglehart-Welzel map, which unveils their interpretation reflecting stable differences across cultural conditionings; demographic-level consistency with the World Values Survey, where response distributions broadly track human group patterns; and moral profiles derived from a Moral Foundations questionnaire, which we analyze through a culture-to-morality mapping to characterize how moral responses vary across different cultural configurations. Our approach of culturally-grounded persona generation and analysis enables evaluation of cross-cultural structure and moral variation.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Anonymity Claims in Synthetic Data Generation: A Model-Centric Privacy Attack Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training generative machine learning models to produce synthetic tabular data has become a popular approach for enhancing privacy in data sharing. As this typically involves processing sensitive personal information, releasing either the trained model or generated synthetic datasets can still pose privacy risks. Yet, recent research, commercial deployments, and privacy regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) largely assess anonymity at the level of an individual dataset.
  In this paper, we rethink anonymity claims about synthetic data from a model-centric perspective and argue that meaningful assessments must account for the capabilities and properties of the underlying generative model and be grounded in state-of-the-art privacy attacks. This perspective better reflects real-world products and deployments, where trained models are often readily accessible for interaction or querying. We interpret the GDPR's definitions of personal data and anonymization under such access assumptions to identify the types of identifiability risks that must be mitigated and map them to privacy attacks across different threat settings. We then argue that synthetic data techniques alone do not ensure sufficient anonymization. Finally, we compare the two mechanisms most commonly used alongside synthetic data -- Differential Privacy (DP) and Similarity-based Privacy Metrics (SBPMs) -- and argue that while DP can offer robust protections against identifiability risks, SBPMs lack adequate safeguards. Overall, our work connects regulatory notions of identifiability with model-centric privacy attacks, enabling more responsible and trustworthy regulatory assessment of synthetic data systems by researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.</description>

      <title>Under-Canopy Terrain Reconstruction in Dense Forests Using RGB Imaging and Neural 3D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22861v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mapping the terrain and understory hidden beneath dense forest canopies is of great interest for numerous applications such as search and rescue, trail mapping, forest inventory tasks, and more. Existing solutions rely on specialized sensors: either heavy, costly airborne LiDAR, or Airborne Optical Sectioning (AOS), which uses thermal synthetic aperture photography and is tailored for person detection.
  We introduce a novel approach for the reconstruction of canopy-free, photorealistic ground views using only conventional RGB images. Our solution is based on the celebrated Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), a recent 3D reconstruction method. Additionally, we include specific image capture considerations, which dictate the needed illumination to successfully expose the scene beneath the canopy. To better cope with the poorly lit understory, we employ a low light loss. Finally, we propose two complementary approaches to remove occluding canopy elements by controlling per-ray integration procedure.
  To validate the value of our approach, we present two possible downstream tasks. For the task of search and rescue (SAR), we demonstrate that our method enables person detection which achieves promising results compared to thermal AOS (using only RGB images). Additionally, we show the potential of our approach for forest inventory tasks like tree counting. These results position our approach as a cost-effective, high-resolution alternative to specialized sensors for SAR, trail mapping, and forest-inventory tasks.</description>

      <title>Exploring Sidewalk Sheds in New York City through Chatbot Surveys and Human Computer Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sidewalk sheds are a common feature of the streetscape in New York City, reflecting ongoing construction and maintenance activities. However, policymakers and local business owners have raised concerns about reduced storefront visibility and altered pedestrian navigation. Although sidewalk sheds are widely used for safety, their effects on pedestrian visibility and movement are not directly measured in current planning practices. To address this, we developed an AI-based chatbot survey that collects image-based annotations and route choices from pedestrians, linking these responses to specific shed design features, including clearance height, post spacing, and color. This AI chatbot survey integrates a large language model (e.g., Google's Gemini-1.5-flash-001 model) with an image-annotation interface, allowing users to interact with street images, mark visual elements, and provide structured feedback through guided dialogue. To explore pedestrian perceptions and behaviors, this paper conducts a grid-based analysis of entrance annotations and applies logistic mixed-effects modeling to assess sidewalk choice patterns. Analysis of the dataset (n = 25) shows that: (1) the presence of scaffolding significantly reduces pedestrians' ability to identify ground-floor retail entrances, and (2) variations in weather conditions and shed design features significantly influence sidewalk selection behavior. By integrating generative AI into urban research, this study demonstrates a novel method for evaluating sidewalk shed designs and provides empirical evidence to support adjustments to shed guidelines that improve the pedestrian experience without compromising safety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11947v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in digital platforms used by youth has created significant challenges related to privacy, autonomy, and data protection. While AI-driven personalization offers enhanced user experiences, it often operates without clear ethical boundaries, leaving young users vulnerable to data exploitation and algorithmic biases. This paper presents a call to action for ethical AI governance, advocating for a structured framework that ensures youth-centred privacy protections, transparent data practices, and regulatory oversight. We outline key areas requiring urgent intervention, including algorithmic transparency, privacy education, parental data-sharing ethics, and accountability measures. Through this approach, we seek to empower youth with greater control over their digital identities and propose actionable strategies for policymakers, AI developers, and educators to build a fairer and more accountable AI ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Open Shouldn't Mean Exempt: Open-Source Exceptionalism and Generative AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open-source status should not shield generative artificial intelligence systems from ethical or legal accountability. Through a rigorous analysis of regulatory, legal, and policy frameworks, this Article contends that open-source GenAI must be held to the same standards as proprietary systems. While recognizing the value of openness for scientific advancement, I propose a narrowly tailored safe harbor for bona fide, non-commercial research, conditioned on strict compliance with defined criteria. This Article critically examines and refutes the core claims of open-source exceptionalism--namely, that open-source GenAI disrupts entrenched oligopolies, democratizes access, and uniquely drives innovation. The evidence shows that open-source GenAI can facilitate unlawful conduct, exacerbate environmental harms, and reinforce existing power structures. Rhetoric around "democratization" and "innovation" often serves as an unsubstantiated basis for regulatory exemptions not afforded to proprietary systems. This Article ultimately advocates for a framework that promotes responsible AI development, balancing openness with robust legal and ethical safeguards and a clear-eyed assessment of societal impacts.</description>

      <title>In the Mood to Exclude: Revitalizing Trespass to Chattels in the Era of GenAI Scraping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GenAI companies are strip-mining the web. Their scraping bots harvest content at an unprecedented scale, circumventing technical barriers to fuel billion-dollar models while creators receive nothing. Courts have enabled this exploitation by misunderstanding what property rights protect online. The prevailing view treats websites as mere repositories of intellectual property and dismisses trespass claims absent server damage. That framework grants AI companies presumptive access while ignoring the economic devastation they inflict. But the content is severable from the website itself. This paper reframes the debate: websites are personal property as integrated digital assets subject to the same exclusionary rights as physical chattels. When scrapers bypass access controls and divert traffic that sustains a website's value, they commit actionable trespass. The law need not create new protections; it need only apply existing property principles to digital space.
  Courts and litigants have struggled to police unwanted, large-scale scraping because copyright preemption often narrows available claims, leaving copyright and its fair use defense as the primary battleground. Trespass to chattels offers a superior path, grounded in the fundamental right to exclude unwanted intrusions. Reviving this tort would protect not only content creators but also the digital ecosystem. Such protection would discourage exploitative scraping, preserve incentives for content creation, help protect privacy and personal data, and safeguard autonomy and expression. Reaffirming website owners' right to exclude is essential to maintaining a fair and sustainable online environment.</description>

      <title>Evaluating LLMs for Career Guidance: Comparative Analysis of Computing Competency Recommendations Across Ten African Countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employers increasingly expect graduates to utilize large language models (LLMs) in the workplace, yet the competencies needed for computing roles across Africa remain unclear given varying national contexts. This study examined how six LLMs, namely ChatGPT 4, DeepSeek, Gemini, Claude 3.5, Llama 3, and Mistral AI, describe entry-level computing career expectations across ten African countries. Using the Computing Curricula 2020 framework and drawing on Digital Colonialism Theory and Ubuntu Philosophy, content analysis of 60 LLM responses to standardized prompts reveals consistent coverage of technical competencies such as cloud computing and programming, but notable differences in non-technical competencies, particularly ethics and responsible AI use. Models vary considerably in recognizing country-specific factors, including local technology ecosystems, language requirements, and national policies averaging only 35.4% contextual awareness overall. Open-source models demonstrated stronger contextual awareness and better balance between technical and professional skills, with Llama (4.47/5) and DeepSeek (4.25/5) outperforming proprietary alternatives ChatGPT-4 (3.90/5) and Claude (3.46/5). However, Mistral's poor contextual performance (0.00/4) despite being open-source indicates that development philosophy alone does not guarantee contextual responsiveness. This first comprehensive comparison of LLM career guidance for African computing students uncovers entrenched infrastructure assumptions and Western-centric biases that create gaps between technical recommendations and local realities. The findings challenge assumptions about AI tool quality in resource-constrained settings and underscore the need for decolonial approaches to AI in education, emphasizing contextual relevance and hybrid human-AI guidance models.</description>

      <title>Protocol Futuring: Speculating Second-Order Dynamics of Protocols in Sociotechnical Infrastructural Futures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drawing on infrastructure studies in HCI and CSCW, this paper introduces Protocol Futuring, a methodological framework that extends design futuring by foregrounding protocols -- rules, standards, and coordination mechanisms -- as the primary material of speculative inquiry. Rather than imagining discrete future artifacts, Protocol Futuring examines how protocol rules accumulate drift, jam, and other second-order effects over long temporal horizons. We demonstrate the method through a case study of Knowledge Futurama, a multi-team participatory workshop exploring millennial-scale knowledge preservation. Using a relay format in which teams inherited and reinterpreted partially formed designs, the workshop revealed how ambiguous handovers, adversarial reinterpretations, shifting cultural norms, and crisis dynamics transform protocols as they move across communities and epochs. The case shows how Protocol Futuring makes infrastructural politics and long-run consequences analytically visible. We discuss the method's strengths, limitations, and implications for researchers investigating emergent sociotechnical systems whose impacts unfold over extended timescales.</description>

      <title>Video Deepfake Abuse: How Company Choices Predictably Shape Misuse Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2022, AI image generators crossed a key threshold, enabling much more efficient and dynamic production of photorealistic deepfake images than before. This enabled opportunities for creative and positive uses of these models. However, it also enabled unprecedented opportunities for the low-effort creation of AI-generated non-consensual intimate imagery (AIG-NCII), including AI-generated child sexual abuse material (AIG-CSAM). Empirically, these harms were principally enabled by a small number of models that were trained on web data with pornographic content, released with open weights, and insufficiently safeguarded. In this paper, we observe ways in which the same patterns are emerging with video generation models in 2025. Specifically, we analyze how a small number of open-weight AI video generation models have become the dominant tools for videorealistic AIG-NCII video generation. We then analyze the literature on model safeguards and conclude that (1) developers who openly release the weights of capable video generation models without appropriate data curation and/or post-training safeguards foreseeably contribute to mitigatable downstream harm, and (2) model distribution platforms that do not proactively moderate individual misuse or models designed for AIG-NCII foreseeably amplify this harm. While there are no perfect defenses against AIG-NCII and AIG-CSAM from open-weight AI models, we argue that risk management by model developers and distributors, informed by emerging safeguard techniques, will substantially affect the future ease of creating AIG-NCII and AIG-CSAM with generative AI video tools.</description>

      <title>Learning Context: A Unified Framework and Roadmap for Context-Aware AI in Education</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a unified Learning Context (LC) framework designed to transition AI-based education from context-blind mimicry to a principled, holistic understanding of the learner. This white paper provides a multidisciplinary roadmap for making teaching and learning systems context-aware by encoding cognitive, affective, and sociocultural factors over the short, medium, and long term. To realize this vision, we outline concrete steps to operationalize LC theory into an interoperable computational data structure. By leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP), we will enable a wide range of AI tools to "warm-start" with durable context and achieve continual, long-term personalization. Finally, we detail our particular LC implementation strategy through the OpenStax digital learning platform ecosystem and SafeInsights R&amp;D infrastructure. Using OpenStax's national reach, we are embedding the LC into authentic educational settings to support millions of learners. All research and pedagogical interventions are conducted within SafeInsights' privacy-preserving data enclaves, ensuring a privacy-first implementation that maintains high ethical standards while reducing equity gaps nationwide.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Moral Machine Judgment in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous systems increasingly require moral judgment capabilities, yet whether these capabilities scale predictably with model size remains unexplored. We systematically evaluate 75 large language model configurations (0.27B--1000B parameters) using the Moral Machine framework, measuring alignment with human preferences in life-death dilemmas. We observe a consistent power-law relationship with distance from human preferences ($D$) decreasing as $D \propto S^{-0.10\pm0.01}$ ($R^2=0.50$, $p&lt;0.001$) where $S$ is model size. Mixed-effects models confirm this relationship persists after controlling for model family and reasoning capabilities. Extended reasoning models show significantly better alignment, with this effect being more pronounced in smaller models (size$\times$reasoning interaction: $p = 0.024$). The relationship holds across diverse architectures, while variance decreases at larger scales, indicating systematic emergence of more reliable moral judgment with computational scale. These findings extend scaling law research to value-based judgments and provide empirical foundations for artificial intelligence governance.</description>

      <title>Moral Outrage Shapes Commitments Beyond Attention: Multimodal Moral Emotions on YouTube in Korea and the US</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how media rhetoric shapes audience engagement is crucial in the attention economy. This study examines how moral emotional framing by mainstream news channels on YouTube influences user behavior across Korea and the United States. To capture the platform's multimodal nature, combining thumbnail images and video titles, we develop a multimodal moral emotion classifier by fine tuning a vision language model. The model is trained on human annotated multimodal datasets in both languages and applied to approximately 400,000 videos from major news outlets. We analyze engagement levels including views, likes, and comments, representing increasing degrees of commitment. The results show that other condemning rhetoric expressions of moral outrage that criticize others morally consistently increase all forms of engagement across cultures, with effects ranging from passive viewing to active commenting. These findings suggest that moral outrage is a particularly effective emotional strategy, attracting not only attention but also active participation. We discuss concerns about the potential misuse of other condemning rhetoric, as such practices may deepen polarization by reinforcing in group and out group divisions. To facilitate future research and ensure reproducibility, we publicly release our Korean and English multimodal moral emotion classifiers.</description>

      <title>PICACO: Pluralistic In-Context Value Alignment of LLMs via Total Correlation Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16679</link>

Abstract: In-Context Learning has shown great potential for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values, helping reduce harmful outputs and accommodate diverse preferences without costly post-training, known as In-Context Alignment (ICA). However, LLMs' comprehension of input prompts remains agnostic, limiting ICA's ability to address value tensions--human values are inherently pluralistic, often imposing conflicting demands, e.g., stimulation vs. tradition. Current ICA methods therefore face the Instruction Bottleneck challenge, where LLMs struggle to reconcile multiple intended values within a single prompt, leading to incomplete or biased alignment. To address this, we propose PICACO, a novel pluralistic ICA method. Without fine-tuning, PICACO optimizes a meta-instruction that navigates multiple values to better elicit LLMs' understanding of them and improve their alignment. This is achieved by maximizing the total correlation between specified values and LLM responses, theoretically reinforcing value correlation while reducing distractive noise, resulting in effective value instructions. Extensive experiments on five value sets show that PICACO works well with both black-box and open-source LLMs, outperforms several recent strong baselines, and achieves a better balance across up to 8 distinct values.</description>

      <title>AI for Scientific Discovery is a Social Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06580v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is being increasingly applied to scientific research, but its benefits remain unevenly distributed across different communities and disciplines. While technical challenges such as limited data, fragmented standards, and unequal access to computational resources are already well known, social and institutional factors are often the primary constraints. Narratives emphasizing autonomous "AI scientists," the underrecognition of data and infrastructure work, misaligned incentives, and gaps between domain experts and machine learning researchers all limit the impact of AI on scientific discovery. Four interconnected challenges are highlighted in this paper: community coordination, the misalignment of research priorities with upstream needs, data fragmentation, and infrastructure inequities. We argue that addressing these challenges requires not only technical innovations but also intentional community-building efforts, cross-disciplinary education, shared benchmarks, and accessible infrastructure. We call for reframing AI for science as a collective social project, where sustainable collaboration and equitable participation are treated as prerequisites for achieving technical progress.</description>

      <title>An Aristotelian ontology of instrumental goals: Structural features to be managed and not failures to be eliminated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instrumental goals such as resource acquisition, power-seeking, and self-preservation are key to contemporary AI alignment research, yet the phenomenon's ontology remains under-theorised. This article develops an ontological account of instrumental goals and draws out governance-relevant distinctions for advanced AI systems. After systematising the dominant alignment literature on instrumental goals we offer an exploratory Aristotelian framework that treats advanced AI systems as complex artefacts whose ends are externally imposed through design, training and deployment. On a structural reading, Aristotle's notion of hypothetical necessity explains why, given an imposed end pursued over extended horizons in particular environments, certain enabling conditions become conditionally required, thereby yielding robust instrumental tendencies. On a contingent reading, accidental causation and chance-like intersections among training regimes, user inputs, infrastructure and deployment contexts can generate instrumental-goal-like behaviours not entailed by the imposed end-structure. This dual-aspect ontology motivates for governance and management approaches that treat instrumental goals as features of advanced AI systems to be managed rather than anomalies eliminable by technical interventions.</description>

      <title>TALES: A Taxonomy and Analysis of Cultural Representations in LLM-generated Stories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millions of users across the globe turn to AI chatbots for their creative needs, inviting widespread interest in understanding how they represent diverse cultures. However, evaluating cultural representations in open-ended tasks remains challenging and underexplored. In this work, we present TALES, an evaluation of cultural misrepresentations in LLM-generated stories for diverse Indian cultural identities. First, we develop TALES-Tax, a taxonomy of cultural misrepresentations by collating insights from participants with lived experiences in India through focus groups (N=9) and individual surveys (N=15). Using TALES-Tax, we evaluate 6 models through a large-scale annotation study spanning 2925 annotations from 108 annotators with lived experience and native language proficiency from across 71 regions in India and 14 languages. Concerningly, we find that 88% of the generated stories contain misrepresentations, and such errors are more prevalent in mid- and low-resourced languages and stories based in peri-urban regions in India. We also transform the annotations into TALES-QA, a standalone question bank to evaluate the cultural knowledge of models.</description>

      <title>An Automated Framework for Large-Scale Graph-Based Cerebrovascular Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present CaravelMetrics, a computational framework for automated cerebrovascular analysis that models vessel morphology through skeletonization-derived graph representations. The framework integrates atlas-based regional parcellation, centerline extraction, and graph construction to compute fifteen morphometric, topological, fractal, and geometric features. The features can be estimated globally from the complete vascular network or regionally within arterial territories, enabling multiscale characterization of cerebrovascular organization. Applied to 570 3D TOF-MRA scans from the IXI dataset (ages 20-86), CaravelMetrics yields reproducible vessel graphs capturing age- and sex-related variations and education-associated increases in vascular complexity, consistent with findings reported in the literature. The framework provides a scalable and fully automated approach for quantitative cerebrovascular feature extraction, supporting normative modeling and population-level studies of vascular health and aging.</description>
