      <title>Examining (Political) Content Consumption on Facebook Through Data Donation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the usage patterns of Facebook among different demographics in the United States, focusing on the consumption of political information and its variability across age, gender, and ethnicity. Employing a novel data donation model, we developed a tool that allows users to voluntarily share their interactions with public Facebook groups and pages, which we subsequently enrich using CrowdTangle. This approach enabled the collection and analysis of a dataset comprising over 1,200 American users. Our findings indicate that political content consumption on Facebook is relatively low, averaging around 17%, and exhibits significant demographic variations. Additionally, we provide insights into the temporal trends of these interactions. The main contributions of this research include a methodological framework for studying social media usage in a privacy-preserving manner, a comprehensive dataset reflective of current engagement patterns, and descriptive insights that highlight demographic disparities and trends over time. This study enhances our understanding of social media's role in information dissemination and its implications for political engagement, offering a valuable resource for researchers and policymakers in a landscape where direct data access is diminishing.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Viral Trends in WhatsApp: A Case Study From a Village in Rural India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research studies the nature and spread of WhatsApp content among everyday users in a rural Indian village. Leveraging a dataset of hundreds of private WhatsApp groups collected with consent from participants, our study uncovers the kinds of WhatsApp groups users are part of, marking the first such categorization. The dataset comprises tens of thousands of messages, out of which we manually classified 604 pieces of content designated as 'forwarded many times'-indicating their viral status.
  Our key findings indicate a high prevalence of content focused on national politics, with the viral messages overwhelmingly supporting a specific political party and disparaging the opposition. Significantly, these messages were fraught with misinformation, engendering hate against Muslims and promoting a narrative of Hindus being under threat. This trend was particularly noticeable within caste-based groups, which were dominated by misinformation, pro-BJP rhetoric, anti-Congress content, and Hindutva propaganda. Remarkably, much of the misinformation circulating had previously been discredited by established fact-checking organizations. This suggests not only a recurring cycle of debunked information reappearing but also that fact-checks are failing to penetrate these specific groups.
  As the first quantitative analysis of everyday WhatsApp use in a rural context, this research has far-reaching implications for understanding the unique challenges posed by end-to-end encrypted platforms. It serves as a crucial baseline for designing more effective moderation policies aimed at combating misinformation and fostering a more responsible use of encrypted communication channels.</description>

      <title>Evolving Network Modeling Driven by the Degree Increase and Decrease Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ever since the Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) scale-free network has been proposed, network modeling has been studied intensively in light of the network growth and the preferential attachment (PA). However, numerous real systems are featured with a dynamic evolution including network reduction in addition to network growth. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism for evolving networks from the perspective of vertex degree. We construct a queueing system to describe the increase and decrease of vertex degree, which drives the network evolution. In our mechanism, the degree increase rate is regarded as a function positively correlated to the degree of a vertex, ensuring the preferential attachment in a new way. Degree distributions are investigated under two expressions of the degree increase rate, one of which manifests a ``long tail'', and another one varies with different values of parameters. In simulations, we compare our theoretical distributions with simulation results and also apply them to real networks, which presents the validity and applicability of our model.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Social Media Personalization: Dynamic User Profile Embeddings and Multimodal Contextual Analysis Using Transformer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of dynamic user profile embedding on personalized context-aware experiences in social networks. A comparative analysis of multilingual and English transformer models was performed on a dataset of over twenty million data points. The analysis included a wide range of metrics and performance indicators to compare dynamic profile embeddings versus non-embeddings (effectively static profile embeddings). A comparative study using degradation functions was conducted. Extensive testing and research confirmed that dynamic embedding successfully tracks users' changing tastes and preferences, providing more accurate recommendations and higher user engagement. These results are important for social media platforms aiming to improve user experience through relevant features and sophisticated recommendation engines.</description>

      <title>Authenticity and exclusion: social media recommendation algorithms and the dynamics of belonging in professional networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homophily - the attraction of similarity - profoundly influences social interactions, affecting associations, information disclosure, and the dynamics of social exchanges. Organizational studies reveal that when professional and personal boundaries overlap, individuals from minority backgrounds often encounter a dilemma between authenticity and inclusion due to these homophily-driven dynamics: if they disclose their genuine interests, they risk exclusion from the broader conversation. Conversely, to gain inclusion, they might feel pressured to assimilate. How might the nature and design of social media platforms, where different conversational contexts frequently collapse, and the recommender algorithms that are at the heart of these platforms, which can prioritize content based on network structure and historical user engagement, impact these dynamics? In this paper, we employ agent-based simulations to investigate this question. Our findings indicate a decline in the visibility of professional content generated by minority groups, a trend that is exacerbated over time by recommendation algorithms. Within these minority communities, users who closely resemble the majority group tend to receive greater visibility. We examine the philosophical and design implications of our results, discussing their relevance to questions of informational justice, inclusion, and the epistemic benefits of diversity.</description>

Abstract: The rapid dissemination of misinformation through online social networks poses a pressing issue with harmful consequences jeopardizing human health, public safety, democracy, and the economy; therefore, urgent action is required to address this problem. In this study, we construct a new human-annotated dataset, called MiDe22, having 5,284 English and 5,064 Turkish tweets with their misinformation labels for several recent events between 2020 and 2022, including the Russia-Ukraine war, COVID-19 pandemic, and Refugees. The dataset includes user engagements with the tweets in terms of likes, replies, retweets, and quotes. We also provide a detailed data analysis with descriptive statistics and the experimental results of a benchmark evaluation for misinformation detection.</description>

      <title>The Death of Renaissance Scientist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scholars are often categorized into two types: hedgehogs (specialists), who focus on working within a specific research field, and foxes (generalists), who actively contribute to a variety of fields. Despite the familiar anecdotes and popularity of this distinction, its empirical foundation has remained largely unexamined. We examine whether the research style of being a fox or a hedgehog is a stable personal trait or an evolving strategy over a scientist's career. Analyzing 2.3 million scholars' publication records over a century, we find that research styles exhibit remarkable stability. Notably, the proportion of fox-like scientists has dramatically declined in the past century, a phenomenon we term "the death of Renaissance scientists." This decline is particularly significant as science shifts toward team collaboration. Teams of foxes consistently outperform teams of hedgehogs in generating new ideas and directions, as confirmed by two emerging innovation metrics for papers: atypicality and disruption. Our research is the first to quantify the process and consequences of the decline of Renaissance scientists. By doing so, we establish a universal link between research styles, demographic shifts, and innovative output.</description>

      <title>Fairness and Consensus in Opinion Models (Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a DeGroot-based model for opinion dynamics in social networks. A community of agents is represented as a weighted directed graph whose edges indicate how much agents influence one another. The model is formalized using labeled transition systems, henceforth called opinion transition systems (OTS), whose states represent the agents' opinions and whose actions are the edges of the influence graph. If a transition labeled $(i,j)$ is performed, agent $j$ updates their opinion taking into account the opinion of agent $i$ and the influence $i$ has over $j$. We study (convergence to) opinion consensus among the agents of strongly-connected graphs with influence values in the interval $(0,1)$. We show that consensus cannot be guaranteed under the standard strong fairness assumption on transition systems. We derive that consensus is guaranteed under a stronger notion from the literature of concurrent systems; bounded fairness. We argue that bounded-fairness is too strong of a notion for consensus as it almost surely rules out random runs and it is not a constructive liveness property. We introduce a weaker fairness notion, called $m$-bounded fairness, and show that it guarantees consensus. The new notion includes almost surely all random runs and it is a constructive liveness property. Finally, we consider OTS with dynamic influence and show convergence to consensus holds under $m$-bounded fairness if the influence changes within a fixed interval $[L,U]$ with $0&lt;L&lt;U&lt;1$. We illustrate OTS with examples and simulations, offering insights into opinion formation under fairness and dynamic influence.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Global Maritime Traffic Network Forecasting with Gravity-Inspired Deep Learning Models</title>

Abstract: Aquatic non-indigenous species (NIS) pose significant threats to biodiversity, disrupting ecosystems and inflicting substantial economic damages across agriculture, forestry, and fisheries. Due to the fast growth of global trade and transportation networks, NIS has been introduced and spread unintentionally in new environments. This study develops a new physics-informed model to forecast maritime shipping traffic between port regions worldwide. The predicted information provided by these models, in turn, is used as input for risk assessment of NIS spread through transportation networks to evaluate the capability of our solution. Inspired by the gravity model for international trades, our model considers various factors that influence the likelihood and impact of vessel activities, such as shipping flux density, distance between ports, trade flow, and centrality measures of transportation hubs. Accordingly, this paper introduces transformers to gravity models to rebuild the short- and long-term dependencies that make the risk analysis feasible. Thus, we introduce a physics-inspired framework that achieves an 89% binary accuracy for existing and non-existing trajectories and an 84.8% accuracy for the number of vessels flowing between key port areas, representing more than 10% improvement over the traditional deep-gravity model. Along these lines, this research contributes to a better understanding of NIS risk assessment. It allows policymakers, conservationists, and stakeholders to prioritize management actions by identifying high-risk invasion pathways. Besides, our model is versatile and can include new data sources, making it suitable for assessing international vessel traffic flow in a changing global landscape.</description>

      <title>The SIS process on Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs: determining the infected fraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are many methods to estimate the quasi-stationary infected fraction of the SIS process on (random) graphs. A challenge is to adequately incorporate correlations, which is especially important in sparse graphs. Methods typically are either significantly biased in sparse graphs, or computationally very demanding already for small network sizes. In this paper we present a new method to determine the infected fraction in sparse graphs, which we test on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs. Our method does take into account correlations and gives accurate predictions. At the same time, computations are very feasible and can easily be done even for large networks.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Sample Size in Reconstructing Noisy Graph Signals: A Theoretical Characterisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing a signal on a graph from noisy observations of a subset of the vertices is a fundamental problem in the field of graph signal processing. This paper investigates how sample size affects reconstruction error in the presence of noise via an in-depth theoretical analysis of the two most common reconstruction methods in the literature, least-squares reconstruction (LS) and graph-Laplacian regularised reconstruction (GLR). Our theorems show that at sufficiently low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), under these reconstruction methods we may simultaneously decrease sample size and decrease average reconstruction error. We further show that at sufficiently low SNRs, for LS reconstruction we have a $\Lambda$-shaped error curve and for GLR reconstruction, a sample size of $ \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ is the total number of vertices, results in lower reconstruction error than near full observation. We present thresholds on the SNRs, $\tau$ and $\tau_{GLR}$, below which the error is non-monotonic, and illustrate these theoretical results with experiments across multiple random graph models, sampling schemes and SNRs. These results demonstrate that any decision in sample-size choice has to be made in light of the noise levels in the data.</description>
