      <title>Organic Acid Chemistry in ISM: Detection of Formic Acid and its Prebiotic Chemistry in Hot Core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the interstellar medium, formic acid (HCOOH) plays a significant role in the synthesis of the simplest amino acid, glycine (NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH). The presence of HCOOH suggests that oxygen-bearing molecules may be directly involved in the chemical and physical evolution of star formation regions, particularly in hot molecular cores. This paper presents the first detection of the rotational emission lines of the $trans$-conformer of HCOOH toward the hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1, located in the massive star formation region G358.93$-$0.03. This study employed high-resolution observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Band 7. The column density and excitation temperature of $t$-HCOOH are determined as $(8.13\pm0.72)\times10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $120\pm15$ K, respectively. The fractional abundance of $t$-HCOOH relative to H$_{2}$ is $(2.62\pm 0.29)\times 10^{-9}$. The column density ratios of $t$-HCOOH/CH$_{3}$OH and $t$-HCOOH/H$_{2}$CO are $(1.56 \pm 0.12)\times 10^{-2}$ and $(1.16 \pm 0.12)$, respectively. We computed a three-phase warm-up chemical model of HCOOH using the gas-grain chemical code UCLCHEM. We found that the observed and modelled abundances of HCOOH are almost identical, within a factor of 0.89. Based on chemical modelling, we showed that HCOOH may be formed through the reaction between HCO and OH on the grain surface, which is further released in the gas-phase.</description>

      <title>Space AI: Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for Space to Improve Life on Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming domains from healthcare and agriculture to finance and industry. As progress on Earth meets growing constraints, the next frontier is outer space, where AI can enable autonomous, resilient operations under extreme uncertainty and limited human oversight. This paper introduces Space AI as a unified interdisciplinary field at the intersection of artificial intelligence and space science and technology. We consolidate historical developments and contemporary progress, and propose a systematic framework that organises Space AI into four mission contexts: 1 AI on Earth, covering intelligent mission planning, spacecraft design optimisation, simulation, and ground-based data analytics; 2 AI in Orbit, focusing on satellite and station autonomy, space robotics, on-board/near-real-time data processing, communication optimisation, and orbital safety; 3 AI in Deep Space, enabling autonomous navigation, adaptive scientific discovery, resource mapping, and long-duration human-AI collaboration under communication constraints; and 4 AI for Multi-Planetary Life, supporting in-situ resource utilisation, habitat and infrastructure construction, life-support and ecological management, and resilient interplanetary networks. Ultimately, Space AI can accelerate humanity's capability to explore and operate in space, while translating advances in sensing, robotics, optimisation, and trustworthy AI into broad societal impact on Earth.</description>
