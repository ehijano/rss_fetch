      <title>CombineHarvesterFlow: Joint Probe Analysis Made Easy with Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to efficiently sample the joint posterior of two non-covariant experiments with a large set of nuisance parameters. Specifically, we train an ensemble of normalizing flows to learn the the posterior distribution of both experiments. Once trained, we can use the flows to draw $\mathcal{O} (10^9)$ samples from the joint posterior of two independent cosmological measurements in seconds -- saving up to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ ton of $\text{CO}_2$ per Monte Carlo run. Using this new technique we find joint constraints between the Dark Energy Survey $3 \times 2$ point measurement, South Pole Telescope and Planck CMB lensing and a BOSS direct fit full shape analyses, for the first time. We find $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.32^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$ and $S_8 = 0.79 ^ {+0.01}_ {-0.01}$. We release a public package called {\tt CombineHarvesterFlow} (https://github.com/pltaylor16/CombineHarvesterFlow) which performs these calculations.</description>

      <title>The measurement of the splashback radius of dark matter halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the hierarchical evolution framework of cosmology, larger halos grow through matter accretion and halo mergers. To clarify the halo evolution, we need to define the halo mass and radius physically. However, the pseudo-evolution problem makes the process difficult. Thus, we aim to measure the splashback radius, a physically defined halo radius for a large number of halos with various mass and redshift, and to determine the most important parameters to affect it. We use the typical definition of splashback radius (Rsp) as the radius with the steepest radial density profile. In this work, we measure Rsp of dark matter halos within the mass of 1e13-3e15Msun and redshifts spanning 0.08-0.65. This is the measurement of the Rsp in the largest range of halo mass and redshift. Using the shear catalog of the DECaLS DR8, we investigate Rsp of halos associated with galaxies and galaxy clusters identified in the various catalogs. Our finding reveals a trend wherein massive halos demonstrate a larger Rsp, and the normalized splashback radius (Rsp/R200m) shows a U-shaped mass evolution. The upturn in these relations mainly comes from the contribution of massive halos with low redshifts. We further find Rsp increases with the peak height, while Rsp/R200m has a negative relation with the peak height. We also find the Rsp &gt;~R200m for most halos, indicating their low accretion rates. Our result is consistent with previous literature across a wide range of mass, redshift, and peak height, as well as the simulation work from More et al. (2015).</description>

      <title>The XMM-SERVS X-ray eXtended Galaxy Cluster (XVXGC) catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To explain the well-known tension between cosmological parameter constraints obtained from the primary CMB and those drawn from galaxy cluster samples, we propose a possible explanation for the incompleteness of detected clusters are higher than estimated. We aim to search for galaxy groups and clusters with particularly extended surface brightness distributions by creating a new X-ray-selected catalog of extended galaxy clusters from the XMM-SERVS data, based on a dedicated source detection and characterization algorithm that is optimized for extended sources. Our state-of-the-art algorithm is composed of wavelet filtering, source detection, and characterization. We make a visual inspection of the optical image, and spatial distribution of galaxies within the same redshift layer to confirm the existence of clusters and estimate the cluster redshift with the spectroscopic and photometric redshifts of galaxies. The growth curve analysis is used to characterize the detections. We report a catalog of extended X-ray galaxy clusters detected from the XMM-SERVS data, named the XMM- SERVS X-ray eXtended Galaxy Cluster (XVXGC) catalog. It includes 141 cluster candidates. Specifically, there are 52 clusters previously identified as clusters with the intra-cluster medium (ICM) emission (class 3), 37 ones previously known as optical or infrared clusters but detected as X-ray clusters for the first time (class 2), and 52 identified as clusters for the first time (class 1). Compared with the class3 sample, the 'class1+2' sample is systematically fainter, and exhibits a flatter surface brightness profile. The median flux in [0.1-2.4]keV band for 'class1+2' and class3 sample is 2.336e-14 and 3.163e-14erg/s/cm2, respectively. The median slope of surface brightness profile are 0.502 and 0.577 for the 'class1+2' and class 3 samples, respectively.</description>

      <title>Exploring Alternative Cosmologies with the LSST: Simulated Forecasts and Current Observational Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) model, which has been pivotal in cosmological studies, has faced significant challenges due to emerging observational and theoretical inconsistencies. This paper explores alternative cosmological models to address these discrepancies, using simulated three years photometric Supernovae Ia data from the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), supplemented with additional Pantheon+, Union, and the recently released Dark Energy Survey 5 Years (DESY5) supernova compilations and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements. We assess the constraining power of these datasets on various dynamic dark energy models, including CPL, BA, JBP, SCPL, and GCG. Our analysis demonstrates that the LSST with its high precision data, can provide tighter constraints on dark energy parameters compared to other datasets. Additionally, the inclusion of BAO measurements significantly improves parameter constraints across all models.
  Except for Pantheon+, we find that across all the cosmological datasets, and the dark energy models considered in this work, there is a consistent deviation from the LCDM model that exceeds a 2-sigma significance level. Our findings underscore the necessity of exploring dynamic dark energy models, which offer more consistent frameworks with fundamental physics and observational data, potentially resolving tensions within the LCDM paradigm. Furthermore, the use of simulated LSST data highlights the survey's potential in offering significant advantages for exploring alternative cosmologies, suggesting that future LSST observations would play a crucial role.</description>

      <title>Predictions for a Low-mass Cutoff for the Primordial Black Hole Mass Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we outline how a modest violation in the conservation of mass during the merger of two PBHs affects the PBH mass spectrum that we previously obtained using a Boltzmann equation model for the evolution of the mass spectrum with no mass loss. We find that if the initial cosmological redshift is on the order 10$^{12}$, then the fraction of primordial holes with masses greater than $10^{3}$ solar masses appears be close to what is required to provide the seeds for galaxies. In addition we note that as a result of rapid collisions and strong coupling to electromagnetic radiation for temperatures $&gt;$ GeV (Chapline 2018), there will be an effective low mass cutoff in the mass spectrum for PBH masses less than a certain PBH mass less than than $0.1M_{\odot}$. We also point out that this cutoff in the mass spectrum below $\sim 0.1 M_\odot$ can be confirmed by combining future microlensing observations from the Roman Space Telescope and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory with astrometric observations.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Stasis from Dynamical Scalars: Tracking Solutions and the Possibility of a Stasis-Induced Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been realized that many theories of physics beyond the Standard Model give rise to cosmological histories exhibiting extended epochs of cosmological stasis. During such epochs, the abundances of different energy components such as matter, radiation, and vacuum energy each remain fixed despite cosmological expansion. In previous analyses of the stasis phenomenon, these different energy components were modeled as fluids with fixed, unchanging equations of state. In this paper, by contrast, we consider more realistic systems involving dynamical scalars which pass through underdamping transitions as the universe expands. Indeed, such systems might be highly relevant for BSM scenarios involving higher-dimensional bulk moduli and inflatons. Remarkably, we find that stasis emerges even in such situations, despite the appearance of time-varying equations of state. Moreover, this stasis includes several new features which might have important phenomenological implications and applications. For example, in the presence of an additional "background" energy component, we find that the scalars evolve into a "tracking" stasis in which the stasis equation of state automatically tracks that of the background. This phenomenon exists even if the background has only a small initial abundance. We also discuss the intriguing possibility that our results might form the basis of a new "Stasis Inflation" scenario in which no ad-hoc inflaton potential is needed and in which there is no graceful-exit problem. Within such a scenario, the number of e-folds of cosmological expansion produced is directly related to the hierarchies between physical BSM mass scales. Moreover, non-zero matter and radiation abundances can be sustained throughout the inflationary epoch.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of $k$-essence and Quintessence Scalar Field Models: A Data Analysis Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a comparative analysis of quintessence and $k$-essence scalar field models in the data analysis perspective. We study the quintessence field with an exponential potential and the $k$-essence field with an inverse square potential in the present work. Before delving into data analysis, we provide a brief perspective on dynamical evolution on both of the models and obtain the stability constraints on the model parameters. We adopt Bayesian inference procedure to estimate the model parameters that best-fit the data. A comprehensive analysis utilizing Observational Hubble data (OHD) and Pantheon+ compilation of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) shows that $k$-essence model fits the data slightly better than the quintessence model while the evidence of these models in comparison with the $\Lambda$CDM model is weak. The value of the Hubble constant predicted by both the models is in close agreement with the value obtained by the Planck2018 collaboration assuming the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>The New Worlds Simulations: Large-scale Simulations across Three Cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we describe the set of ``New Worlds Simulations'', three very large cosmology simulations, Qo'noS, Vulcan, and Ferenginar, that were carried out on the Summit supercomputer with the Hardware/Hybrid Cosmology Code, HACC. The gravity-only simulations follow the evolution of structure in the Universe by each employing 12,288^3 particles in (3 Gpc/h)^3 volumes, leading to a mass resolution of m_p~10^9 Msun/h. The simulations cover three different cosmologies, one LambdaCDM model, consistent with measurements from Planck, one simulation with massive neutrinos, and one simulation with a varying dark energy equation of state. All simulations have the same phases to allow a detailed comparison of the results and the investigation of the impact of different cosmological parameters. We present measurements of some basic statistics, such as matter power spectra, correlation function, halo mass function and concentration-mass relation and investigate the differences due to the varying cosmologies. Given the large volume and high resolution, these simulations provide excellent bases for creating synthetic skies. A subset of the data is made publicly available as part of this paper.</description>

      <title>Single and merger soliton dynamics in scalar field dark matter with and without self-interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (abridged)Scalar field dark matter (SFDM) made of bosons has become a popular alternative to the CDM paradigm, especially for its potential to cure the so-called "small-scale problems" of CDM. Cosmological simulations have determined that SFDM halos exhibit a core-envelope structure, but they are computationally expensive. Halo cores have been found to be well approximated by "solitons". The study of single soliton and multiple soliton merger dynamics constitutes a more feasible approach to investigate in detail the genuine quantum dynamics of SFDM and its interplay with self-gravity for a multitude of free boson parameters. In this paper, we present dedicated simulations of single solitons and binary soliton mergers, for models without and with a 2-boson, repulsive, weak to intermediate self-interaction (SI), as well as multiple soliton mergers without SI. We adapt the open-source code Pyultralight to simulate solitons with SI. We derive numerical scaling relations between the central density and mass of solitons for several values of SI and find deviations from the monotonic relations known from fuzzy dark matter (no SI), or the strongly repulsive Thomas-Fermi regime. Solitons with SI exemplify larger cores and lower central densities, compared to solitons without SI. Using our simulations, we extract numerical density profiles for solitons and post-merger objects, and fit them to analytic functions of previous literature. We find a mild preference for Gaussian cores for objects with SI, while the envelopes of post-mergers can be fit to NFW profiles albeit with some caution as we discuss. Similar to previous work, we find global, persistent oscillations for solitons as well as post-mergers, confirming that self-gravitating SFDM has very long relaxation times, although objects with SI exhibit oscillations of comparatively smaller amplitude.</description>

      <title>Holographic and Gravity-Thermodynamic Approaches in Entropic Cosmology: Bayesian Assessment using late-time Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological implications of entropy-based approaches in the context of Holographic Dark Energy (HDE) and Gravity-Thermodynamics (GT) formalisms. We utilise the extended Barrow entropy form, with the index parameter $\Delta$, representing the fractal dimension of the horizon. We also test implementing different parameter ranges for $\Delta$, which can be extended to Tsallis' interpretation within the same formal cosmology. We perform a Bayesian analysis to constrain the cosmological parameters using the Pantheon+, more recent DESy5, DESI, and, as a supplement, Quasar datasets. We find that the HDE model within almost all data combinations performs extremely well in comparison to the GT approach, which is usually strongly disfavored. Using the combination of DESy5+DESI alone, we find that the GT approaches are disfavored at $|\log \mathcal{B}| \sim 5.8$ and $|\log \mathcal{B}| \sim 6.2$ for the Barrow and Tsallis limits on $\Delta$, respectively, wrt $\Lambda$CDM model. While the HDE approach is statistically equivalent to $\Lambda$CDM when comparing the Bayesian evidence. We also investigate the evolution of the dark energy equation of state and place limits on the same, consistent with quintessence-like behaviour in the HDE approaches.</description>

      <title>A model-independent test of pre-recombination New Physics: Machine Learning based estimate of the Sound Horizon from Gravitational Wave Standard Sirens and the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation Angular Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In any cosmological model where spacetime is described by a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, photons propagate along null geodesics, and their number is conserved, upcoming Gravitational Wave (GW) observations can be combined with measurements of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) angular scale to provide model-independent estimates of the sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch. By focusing on the accuracy expected from forthcoming surveys such as LISA GW standard sirens and DESI or Euclid angular BAO measurements, we forecast a relative precision of $\sigma_{r_{\rm d}} /r_{\rm d} \sim 1.5\%$ within the redshift range $z \lesssim 1$. This approach will offer a unique model-independent measure of a fundamental scale characterizing the early universe, which is competitive with model-dependent values inferred within specific theoretical frameworks. These measurements can serve as a consistency test for $\Lambda$CDM, potentially clarifying the nature of the Hubble tension and confirming or ruling out new physics prior to recombination with a statistical significance of $\sim 4\sigma$.</description>

      <title>COMAP Pathfinder -- Season 2 results I. Improved data selection and processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder is performing line intensity mapping of CO emission to trace the distribution of unresolved galaxies at redshift $z \sim 3$. We present an improved version of the COMAP data processing pipeline and apply this to the first two seasons of observations. This analysis improves on the COMAP Early Science (ES) results in several key aspects. On the observational side, all second season scans were made in constant-elevation mode, after noting that the previous Lissajous scans were associated with increased systematic errors; those scans accounted for 50% of the total Season 1 data volume. Secondly, all new observations were restricted to an elevation range of 35-65 degrees, to minimize sidelobe ground pickup. On the data processing side, more effective data cleaning in both the time- and map-domain has allowed us to eliminate all data-driven power spectrum-based cuts. This increases the overall data retention and reduces the risk of signal subtraction bias. On the other hand, due to the increased sensitivity, two new pointing-correlated systematic errors have emerged, and we introduce a new map-domain PCA filter to suppress these. Subtracting only 5 out of 256 PCA modes, we find that the standard deviation of the cleaned maps decreases by 67% on large angular scales, and after applying this filter, the maps appear consistent with instrumental noise. Combining all these improvements, we find that each hour of raw Season 2 observations yields on average 3.2 times more cleaned data compared to ES analysis. Combining this with the increase in raw observational hours, the effective amount of data available for high-level analysis is a factor of 8 higher than in ES. The resulting maps have reached an uncertainty of $25$-$50\,\mu K$ per voxel, providing by far the strongest constraints on cosmological CO line emission published to date.</description>

      <title>COMAP Pathfinder -- Season 2 results II. Updated constraints on the CO(1-0) power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present updated constraints on the cosmological 3D power spectrum of carbon monoxide CO(1-0) emission in the redshift range $2.4$-$3.4$. The constraints are derived from the two first seasons of Carbon monOxide Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder line-intensity mapping observations aiming to trace star-formation during the Epoch of Galaxy Assembly. These results improve on the previous Early Science (ES) results through both increased data volume and improved data processing methodology. On the methodological side, we now perform cross-correlations between groups of detectors (''feed-groups''), as opposed to cross-correlations between single feeds, and this new feed-group pseudo power spectrum (FGPXS) is constructed to be more robust against systematic effects. In terms of data volume, the effective mapping speed is significantly increased due to an improved observational strategy as well as better data selection methodology. The updated spherically- and field-averaged FGPXS, $\tilde{C}(k)$, is consistent with zero, at a probability-to-exceed of around $34\,\%$, with an excess of $2.7\,\sigma$ in the most sensitive bin. Our power spectrum estimate is about an order of magnitude more sensitive in our six deepest bins across ${0.09\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} &lt; k &lt; 0.73\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}}$, as compared to the feed-feed pseudo power spectrum (FPXS) of COMAP ES. Each of these bins individually constrains the CO power spectrum to ${kP_\mathrm{CO}(k)&lt; 2400-4900\,\mathrm{\mu K^2 Mpc^{2}}}$ at $95\,\%$ confidence. To monitor potential contamination from residual systematic effects, we analyze a set of 312 difference-map null tests and find that these are consistent with the instrumental noise prediction. In sum, these results provide the strongest direct constraints on the cosmological 3D CO(1-0) power spectrum published to date.</description>

      <title>COMAP Pathfinder -- Season 2 results III. Implications for cosmic molecular gas content at "Cosmic Half-past Eleven"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Carbon monOxide Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder survey continues to demonstrate the feasibility of line-intensity mapping using high-redshift carbon monoxide (CO) line emission traced at cosmological scales. The latest COMAP Pathfinder power spectrum analysis is based on observations through the end of Season 2, covering the first three years of Pathfinder operations. We use our latest constraints on the CO(1-0) line-intensity power spectrum at $z\sim3$ to update corresponding constraints on the cosmological clustering of CO line emission and thus the cosmic molecular gas content at a key epoch of galaxy assembly. We first mirror the COMAP Early Science interpretation, considering how Season 2 results translate to limits on the shot noise power of CO fluctuations and the bias of CO emission as a tracer of the underlying dark matter distribution. The COMAP Season 2 results place the most stringent limits on the CO tracer bias to date, at $\langle{Tb}\rangle&lt;4.8$ $\mu$K. These limits narrow the model space significantly compared to previous CO line-intensity mapping results while maintaining consistency with small-volume interferometric surveys of resolved line candidates. The results also express a weak preference for CO emission models used to guide fiducial forecasts from COMAP Early Science, including our data-driven priors. We also consider directly constraining a model of the halo-CO connection, and show qualitative hints of capturing the total contribution of faint CO emitters through the improved sensitivity of COMAP data. With continued observations and matching improvements in analysis, the COMAP Pathfinder remains on track for a detection of cosmological clustering of CO emission.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM scenario in a type II minimally modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The idea of a rapid sign-switching cosmological constant (mirror AdS-dS transition) in the late universe at $z\sim1.7$, known as the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, has significantly improved the fit to observational data and provides a promising scenario for alleviating major cosmological tensions, such as the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions. However, in the absence of a fully predictive model, implementing this fit required conjecturing that the dynamics of the linear perturbations are governed by general relativity. Recent work embedding the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model with the Lagrangian of a type-II minimally modified gravity known as VCDM has propelled $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM to a fully predictive model, removing the uncertainty related to the aforementioned assumption; we call this new model $\Lambda_{\rm s}$VCDM. In this work, we demonstrate that not only does $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM fit the data better than the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, but the new model, $\Lambda_{\rm s}$VCDM, performs even better in alleviating cosmological tensions while also providing a better fit to the data, including CMB, BAO, SNe Ia, and Cosmic Shear measurements. Our findings highlight the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM framework, particularly the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$VCDM model, as a compelling alternative to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, especially by successfully alleviating the $H_0$ tension. Additionally, these models predict higher values for $\sigma_8$, indicating enhanced structuring, albeit with lower present-day matter density parameter values and consequently reduced $S_8$ values, alleviating the $S_8$ tension as well. This demonstrates that the data are well fit by a combination of background and linear perturbations, both having dynamics differing from those of $\Lambda$CDM. This paves the way for further exploration of new ways for embedding the sign-switching cosmological constant into other models.</description>

      <title>Interpreting DESI 2024 BAO: late-time dynamical dark energy or a local effect?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform fits to DESI, CMB and supernova data to understand the physical origin of the DESI hint for dynamical dark energy. We find that the linear parametrization of the equation of state $w$ may guide to misleading interpretations, such as the hint for a phantom Universe, which are not preferred by the data. Instead, physical quintessence models fit the data well. Model-independently, present observations prefer deviations from the constant dark energy, $w=-1$, only at very low redshifts, $z &lt; \mathcal{O}(0.1)$. We find that this result is driven by low-$z$ supernova data. Therefore, either the fundamental properties of our Universe, characterised by the equation of state $w$ and the Hubble parameter $H$, underwent dramatic changes very recently or, alternatively, we do not fully understand the systematics of our local Universe in a radius of about $300\,h^{-1}\rm Mpc$.</description>

      <title>Prospects for constraining quasar ages with fiber spectrographs: quasar-induced Ly$\alpha$ emission from the intergalactic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02374v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for linking quasar properties, such as quasar age, to the surrounding Ly$\alpha$ emission intensity. In particular, we focus on a method for mapping the large-scale structure of Ly$\alpha$ emission intensity with galaxy spectra from wide-field spectroscopic surveys, e.g., the Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) or the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), and consider the quasar-induced Ly$\alpha$ emission from the intergalactic medium (IGM). To do this, we construct a theoretical model based on two physical processes: resonant scattering of quasar Ly$\alpha$ photons and fluorescence due to quasar ionizing photons, finding that the fluorescence contribution due to optically thick gas clouds is dominant. Taking into account the light cone effect and assuming a typical quasar spectrum, we calculate the fluorescence contribution to the spectrum stacked within each bin of the separation angle from the quasar as a function of quasar age. Furthermore, we compute the quasar-Ly$\alpha$ emission cross-correlation and its SNR for the planned PFS survey. The predicted signal can only account for $\sim10\%$ of the measurements indicated from the BOSS and eBOSS surveys in the outer region of $&gt; 10\ \rm{cMpc}\ \rm{h}^{-1}$, and the predicted SNR is not sufficient to detect the quasar-induced contribution. However, we found that our model, combined with the contribution of star-forming galaxies, is not in conflict with these measurements. We discuss other possible contributions to the Ly$\alpha$ emission excess around quasars, the efficiency of using spectroscopic fibers, and the redshift dependence of our model.</description>

      <title>Constraining extended teleparallel gravity via cosmography: A model-independent approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a classical approach, the dynamics of the Universe, influenced by its dark components, are unveiled through prior modifications of Einstein's equations. Cosmography, on the other hand, is a highly efficient tool for reconstructing any modified theory in a model-independent manner. By employing kinematic variables, it offers a profound explanation for cosmic expansion. Although the cosmographical approach has been highly successful in several geometric theories in recent years, it has not been extensively explored in coupled gravities. With this in mind, we intend to constrain an extended teleparallel gravity model, $f(T,\mathcal{T})$, through cosmographic parameters. We utilize Taylor series expansion, assuming a minimally coupled form, to constrain the unknowns involved in the series. To achieve this, we conduct a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis (MCMC) using three different datasets (CC, BAO, and Pantheon+SH0ES). The constrained results obtained from MCMC are then compared and verified using various cosmological parameters. Finally, we compare the resulting models with \textbf{three} well-known $f(T,\mathcal{T})$ models.</description>

      <title>Inflaton Production of Scalar Dark Matter through Fluctuations and Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects on particle production of a Planck-suppressed coupling between the inflaton and a scalar dark matter candidate, $\chi$. In the absence of this coupling, the dominant source for the relic density of $\chi$ is the long wavelength modes produced from the scalar field fluctuations during inflation. In this case, there are strong constraints on the mass of the scalar and the reheating temperature after inflation from the present-day relic density of $\chi$ (assuming $\chi$ is stable). When a coupling $\sigma \phi^2 \chi^2$ is introduced, with $\sigma = {\tilde \sigma} m_\phi^2/ M_P^2 \sim 10^{-10} {\tilde \sigma}$, where $m_\phi$ is the inflaton mass, the allowed parameter space begins to open up considerably even for ${\tilde \sigma}$ as small as $\gtrsim 10^{-7}$. For ${\tilde \sigma} \gtrsim \frac{9}{16}$, particle production is dominated by the scattering of the inflaton condensate, either through single graviton exchange or the contact interaction between $\phi$ and $\chi$. In this regime, the range of allowed masses and reheating temperatures is maximal. For $0.004 &lt; {\tilde \sigma} &lt; 50$, constraints from isocurvature fluctuations are satisfied, and the production from parametric resonance can be neglected.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Radiation Power Spectrum of Garfinkle-Vachaspati Cosmic String Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the power spectrum $P_n$ of the $n$th harmonic for Garfinkle-Vachaspati cosmic strings, which correspond to planar rectangular loops. While these loop tractories are self-intersecting, a slightly perturbed non-self-intersecting form of these trajectories has been suggested as a generic end state of cosmic string loop fragmentation. We find that $P_n$ scales as $n^{-2} \ln n$, rather than the expected $n^{-2}$ for kink-kink collisions. This result is demonstrated analytically for even $n$ in square loops and numerically for all other cases. At lowest order, the effect of loop decays is to further enhance $P_n$ at large $n$ relative to its value at small $n$. The consequences for relic stochastic background radiation along with the caveats pertaining to our results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Universal properties of the evolution of the Universe in modified loop quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically study the evolution of the Universe in the framework of a modified loop quantum cosmological model (mLQC-I) with various inflationary potentials, including chaotic, Starobinsky, generalized Starobinsky, polynomials of the first and second kinds, generalized T- models and natural inflation. In all these models, the big bang singularity is represented by a quantum bounce, and the evolution of the Universe both before and after the bounce is universal and weakly depends on the inflationary potentials, as long as the evolution is dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton at the bounce. In particular, the evolution in the pre-bounce region can be universally divided into three different phases: pre-bouncing, pre-transition, and pre-de Sitter. The pre-bouncing phase occurs immediately before the quantum bounce, during which the evolution of the Universe is dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton. Thus, the equation of state of the inflaton is about one, w = 1. Soon, the inflation potential takes over, so w rapidly falls from one to negative one. This pre-transition phase is very short and quickly turns into the pre-de Sitter phase, whereby the effective cosmological constant with a Planck size takes over and dominates the rest of the contracting phase. In the entire pre-bounce regime, the evolution of the expansion factor and the inflaton can be approximated by analytical solutions, which are universal and independent of the inflation potentials.</description>

      <title>The PAU Survey: Photometric Calibration of Narrow Band Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Physics of the Accelerating Universe (PAU) camera is an optical narrow band and broad band imaging instrument mounted at the prime focus of the William Herschel Telescope. We describe the image calibration procedure of the PAU Survey data. We rely on an external photometric catalogue to calibrate our narrow band data using stars that have been observed by both datasets. We fit stellar templates to the stellar broad band photometry of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and synthesise narrow band photometry that we compare to the PAUS narrow band data to determine their calibration. Consequently, the PAUS data are in the AB system as inherited from its reference calibrator. We do several tests to check the performance of the calibration. We find it self-consistent when comparing repeated observations of the same objects, with a good overall accuracy to the AB system which we estimate to be at the 2\% precision level and no significant trends as a function of narrow band filter or wavelength. Repeated observations allow us to build a spatial map of the illumination pattern of the system. We also check the wavelength dependence of the calibration comparing to stellar spectra. We find that using only blue stars reduces the effects of variations in the stellar template fitting to broad-band colours, improving the overall precision of the calibration to around 1\% and its wavelength uniformity. The photometric redshift performance obtained with the PAUS data attests to the validity of our calibration to reach the PAUS science goals.</description>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to memory of late Professor V. G. Bagrov, who was my first teacher in theoretical physics. About 45 years later, theoretical physics has changed and me too. The subject of this paper relates some old ideas in cosmology with some recent ideas, as is reflected in the title. The current status of Starobinsky inflation is reviewed and compared to three main conjectures in the Swampland program. It is argued that the Starobinsky inflation model is not in conflict with those Swampland conjectures in their basic versions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several extensions of the Standard Model predict the existence of sub-GeV particles that can be copiously produced in the cores of supernovae. A broad family of these particles are dubbed feebly interacting particles (FIPs), which can have masses of up to a few hundreds of MeV. Here, we review the most recent and leading constraints on electrophilic FIPs, describing multimessenger techniques that allow us to probe the full phenomenology of the electron/positron emission produced by these FIPs; from their associated X-ray emission to the production of the $511$~keV line. Furthermore, the approach described here is independent of the specific particle model and can be translated to the coupling and other properties of a variety of different particles, such as axion-like particles, sterile neutrinos or dark photons</description>

      <title>A comprehensive forecast for cosmological parameter estimation using joint observations of gravitational waves and short $\gamma$-ray bursts</title>

Abstract: In the third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detector era, the multi-messenger GW observation for binary neutron star (BNS) merger events can exert great impacts on exploring the cosmic expansion history. In this work, we comprehensively explore the potential of 3G GW standard siren observations in cosmological parameter estimations by considering the 3G GW detectors and the future short $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) detector THESEUS-like telescope joint observations. Based on the 10-year observation of different detection strategies, we predict that the numbers of detectable GW-GRB events are 334--674 with the redshifts $z&lt;3.5$ and the inclination angles $\iota&lt;15^{\circ}$. For the cosmological analysis, we consider the $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, $w_0w_a$CDM models, and interacting dark energy (IDE) models. We find that GW can tightly constrain the Hubble constant with precisions of $0.345\%-0.065\%$, but perform not well in constraining other cosmological parameters. Fortunately, GW could effectively break the cosmological parameter degeneracies generated by the mainstream EM observations, CMB+BAO+SN (CBS). When combining the mock GW data with the CBS data, CBS+GW can tightly constrain the equation of state of dark energy $w$ with a precision of 1.26\%, close to the standard of precision cosmology. Meanwhile, the addition of GW to CBS could improve constraints on cosmological parameters by $34.2\%-94.9\%$. In conclusion, GW standard siren observations from 3G GW detectors could play a crucial role in helping solve the Hubble tension and probe the fundamental nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Ly$\alpha$NNA: A Deep Learning Field-level Inference Machine for the Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest</title>

Abstract: The inference of astrophysical and cosmological properties from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest conventionally relies on summary statistics of the transmission field that carry useful but limited information. We present a deep learning framework for inference from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest at field-level. This framework consists of a 1D residual convolutional neural network (ResNet) that extracts spectral features and performs regression on thermal parameters of the IGM that characterize the power-law temperature-density relation. We train this supervised machinery using a large set of mock absorption spectra from Nyx hydrodynamic simulations at $z=2.2$ with a range of thermal parameter combinations (labels). We employ Bayesian optimization to find an optimal set of hyperparameters for our network, and then employ a committee of 20 neural networks for increased statistical robustness of the network inference. In addition to the parameter point predictions, our machine also provides a self-consistent estimate of their covariance matrix with which we construct a pipeline for inferring the posterior distribution of the parameters. We compare the results of our framework with the traditional summary (PDF and power spectrum of transmission) based approach in terms of the area of the 68% credibility regions as our figure of merit (FoM). In our study of the information content of perfect (noise- and systematics-free) Ly$\alpha$ forest spectral data-sets, we find a significant tightening of the posterior constraints -- factors of 10.92 and 3.30 in FoM over power spectrum only and jointly with PDF, respectively -- that is the consequence of recovering the relevant parts of information that are not carried by the classical summary statistics.</description>

      <title>Carbon monoxide and ionized carbon line emission global signals: foregrounds and targets for absolute microwave spectrometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (abr.) We consider the potential of future microwave spectrometers akin to PIXIE in light of the sky-averaged global signal expected from the total intensity of extragalactic carbon monoxide (CO) and ionized carbon ([CII]) line emission. We start from models originally developed for forecasts of line-intensity mapping (LIM) observations targeting the same line emission at specific redshifts, extrapolating them across all of cosmic time. We then calculate Fisher forecasts for uncertainties on parameters describing relic spectral deviations, the CO/[CII] global signal, and a range of other Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds considered in previous work. We find that the measurement of the CO/[CII] global signal with a future CMB spectrometer presents an exciting opportunity to constrain the evolution of metallicity and molecular gas in galaxies across cosmic time. From PIXIE to its enhanced version, SuperPIXIE, microwave spectrometers would have the fundamental sensitivity to constrain the redshift evolution of average kinetic temperature and cosmic molecular gas density at a level of 10% to 1%, respectively. Taking a spectral distortion-centric perspective, when combined with other foregrounds, sky-averaged CO/[CII] emission can mimic $\mu$- and to a lesser extent $y$-type distortions. Under fiducial parameters, marginalising over the CO/[CII] model parameters increases the error on $\mu$ by $\simeq86$%, and the error on $y$ by $\simeq10$%. Incorporating information from planned CO LIM surveys can recover some of this loss in precision. Future work should deploy a more general treatment of the microwave sky to quantify in more detail the potential synergies between PIXIE-like and CO LIM experiments, which complement each other strongly in breadth versus depth, and ways to optimise both spectrometer and LIM surveys to improve foreground cleaning and maximise the science return for each.</description>

      <title>Restoring cosmological concordance with axion-like early dark energy and dark matter characterized by a constant equation of state?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hubble tension persists as a challenge in cosmology. Even early dark energy (EDE) models, initially considered the most promising for alleviating the Hubble tension, fall short of addressing the issue without exacerbating other tensions, such as the $S_8$ tension. Considering that a negative dark matter (DM) equation of state (EoS) parameter is conducive to reduce the value of $\sigma_8$ parameter, we extend the axion-like EDE model in this paper by replacing the cold dark matter (CDM) with DM characterized by a constant EoS $w_{\rm dm}$ (referred as WDM hereafter). We then impose constraints on this axion-like EDE extension model, along with three other models: the axion-like EDE model, $\Lambda$WDM, and $\Lambda$CDM. These constraints are derived from a comprehensive analysis incorporating data from the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), the Pantheon compilation, as well as a prior on $H_0$ (i.e., $H_0=73.04\pm1.04$, based on the latest local measurement by Riess et al.) and a Gaussianized prior on $S_8$ (i.e., $S_8=0.766\pm0.017$, determined through the joint analysis of KID1000+BOSS+2dLenS). We find that although the new model maintains the ability to alleviate the Hubble tension to $\sim$ 1.4$\sigma$, it still exacerbate the $S_8$ tension to a level similar to that of the axion-like EDE model.</description>

      <title>TDCOSMO XVI: Population Analysis of Lines of Sight of 25 Strong Galaxy-Galaxy Lenses with Extreme Value Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-Delay Cosmography is a technique for measuring $H_0$ with strong gravitational lensing. It requires a correction for line of sight perturbations, and it is necessary to build tools to assess populations of these lines of sight efficiently. We aim demonstrate the techniques necessary to analyze line of sight effects at a population level, and investigate whether strong lenses fall in preferably overdense environments. We analyze a set of 25 galaxy-galaxy lens lines of sight in the Strong Lensing Legacy Survey sample using standard techniques, then perform a hierarchical analysis to constrain the population-level parameters. We introduce a new statistical model for these posteriors that may provide insight into the underlying physics of the system. We find the median value of $\kappa_{\rm{ext}}$ in the population model to be $0.033 \pm 0.010$. The median value of $\kappa_{\rm{ext}}$ for the individual lens posteriors is $0.008 \pm 0.015$. Both approaches demostrate that our systems are drawn from an overdense sample. The different results from these two approaches show the importance of population models that do not multiply the effect of our priors.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Calibration of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch Distance Method in the Near Infrared. II. JWST NIRCam Wide Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tip of the red giant (TRGB) is a standardizable candle and is identifiable as the discontinuity at the bright extreme of the red giant branch (RGB) stars in color-magnitude diagram (CMD) space. The TRGB-based distance method has been calibrated and used to measured distances to galaxies out to $D\leq20$ Mpc with the $I$-band equivalent Hubble Space Telescope ($HST$) $F814W$ filter, and as an important rung in the distance ladder to measure the Hubble constant, $H_0$. In the infrared (IR), the TRGB apparent magnitude ranges from $1-2$ magnitudes brighter than in the optical, and now with the IR James Webb Space Telescope ($JWST$) observatory the feasible distance range of the TRGB method can be extended to $\sim50$ Mpc. However, in the IR the TRGB luminosity depends to varying degrees on stellar metallicity and age. In this study we standardize the TRGB luminosity using stellar colors as a proxy for metallicity/age to derive color-based corrections for the $JWST$ Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) short wavelength (SW) filters $F090W$, $F115W$, $F150W$ and the long wavelength (LW) filters $F277W$, $F356W,$ and $F444W$. We provide recommended filter combinations for distance measurements depending on the requisite precision. For science requiring high precision ($\leq1\%$ in distance) and robustness we recommend measuring the TRGB in $F090W$ vs $F090W-F150W$ or $F115W$ vs. $F115W-F277W$ with the caveat that even with $JWST$ long integration times will be necessary at further distances. If lower precision ($&gt;1.5\%$ in distance) can be tolerated, or if shorter integration times are desirable, we recommend measuring the TRGB in either $F115W$ or $F150W$ paired with $F356W$. We do not recommend $F444W$ for precision TRGB measurements due to its lower angular resolution.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing redshift distributions with photometric galaxy clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate determination of the true redshift distributions in tomographic bins is critical for cosmological constraints from photometric surveys. The proposed redshift self-calibration method, which utilizes the photometric galaxy clustering alone, is highly convenient and avoids the challenges from incomplete or unrepresentative spectroscopic samples in external calibration. However, the imperfection of the theoretical approximation on broad bins as well as the flaw of the previous algorithm risk the accuracy and application of the method. In this paper, we propose the improved self-calibration algorithm that incorporates novel update rules, which effectively accounts for heteroskedastic weights and noisy data with negative values. The improved algorithm greatly expands the application range of self-calibration method and accurately reconstructs the redshift distributions for various mock data. Using the luminous red galaxy (LRG) sample of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey, we find that the reconstructed results are comparable to the state-of-the-art external calibration. This suggests the exciting prospect of using photometric galaxy clustering to reconstruct redshift distributions in the cosmological analysis of survey data.</description>

      <title>Alleviating the cosmological constant problem from particle production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.14158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a toy model mechanism of geometric cancellation, alleviating the (classical) cosmological constant problem. To do so, we assume at primordial times that vacuum energy fuels an inflationary quadratic hilltop potential nonminimally coupled to gravity through a standard Yukawa-like interacting term, whose background lies on a perturbed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric. We demonstrate how vacuum energy release transforms into geometric particles, adopting a quasi-de Sitter phase where we compute the expected particle density and mass ranges. Perturbations are introduced by means of the usual external-field appproximation, so that the back-reaction of the created particles on the geometry is not considered here. We discuss the limitations of this approach and we also suggest possible refinements. We then propose the most suitable dark matter candidates, showing under which circumstances we can interpret dark matter as constituted by geometric quasiparticles. We confront our predictions with quantum particle production and constraints made using a Higgs portal. In addition, the role of the bare cosmological constant is reinterpreted to speed up the universe today. Thus, consequences on the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm are critically highlighted, showing how both coincidence and fine-tuning issues can be healed requiring the Israel-Darmois matching conditions between our involved inhomogeneous and homogeneous phases.</description>

      <title>Suitability of Magnetic Microbolometers based on Paramagnetic Temperature Sensors for CMB Polarization Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.06088v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High resolution maps of polarization anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) are in high demand, since the discovery of primordial B-Modes in the polarization patterns would confirm the inflationary phase of the Universe that would have taken place before the last scattering of the CMB at the recombination epoch. Transition Edge Sensors (TES) and Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKID) are the predominant detector technologies of cryogenic detector array based CMB instruments that search for primordial B-Modes. In this paper we propose another type of cryogenic detector to be used for CMB survey: A magnetic microbolometer (MMB) that is based on a paramagnetic temperature sensor. It is an adaption of state-of-the-art metallic magnetic calorimeters (MMCs) that are meanwhile a key technology for high resolution $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ and X-ray spectroscopy as well as the study of neutrino mass. The effort to adapt MMCs for CMB surveys is triggered by their lack of Johnson noise associated with the detector readout, the possibility of straightforward calibration and higher dynamic range given it possesses a broad and smooth responsivity dependence with temperature and the absence of Joule dissipation which simplifies the thermal design. A brief proof of concept case study is analyzed, taking into account typical constraints in CMB measurements and reliable microfabrication processes. The results show that MMBs provide a promising technology for CMB polarization survey as their sensitivity can be tuned for background limited detection of the sky while simultaneously maintaining a low time response to avoid distortion of the point-source response of the telescope. As the sensor technology and its fabrication techniques are compatible with TES based bolometric detector arrays, a change of detector technology would even come with very low cost.</description>

      <title>Understanding the radio luminosity function of star-forming galaxies and its cosmological evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the redshift evolution of the radio luminosity function (RLF) of star-forming galaxies using GALFORM, a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation and a dynamo model of the magnetic field evolving in a galaxy. Assuming energy equipartition between the magnetic field and cosmic rays, we derive the synchrotron luminosity of each sample galaxy. In a model where the turbulent speed is correlated with the star formation rate, the RLF is in fair agreement with observations in the redshift range $0 \leq z \leq 2$. At larger redshifts, the structure of galaxies, their interstellar matter and turbulence appear to be rather different from those at $z\lesssim2$, so that the turbulence and magnetic field models applicable at low redshifts become inadequate. The strong redshift evolution of the RLF at $0 \leq z \leq 2$ can be attributed to an increased number, at high redshift, of galaxies with large disc volumes and strong magnetic fields. On the other hand, in models where the turbulent speed is a constant or an explicit function of $z$, the observed redshift evolution of the RLF is poorly captured. The evolution of the interstellar turbulence and outflow parameters appear to be major (but not the only) drivers of the RLF changes. We find that both the small- and large-scale magnetic fields contribute to the RLF but the small-scale field dominates at high redshifts. Polarisation observations will therefore be important to distinguish these two components and understand better the evolution of galaxies and their nonthermal constituents.</description>

      <title>Lower tensor-to-scalar ratio as possible signature of modified gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper simplifies the induced four-dimensional gravitational equations originating from a five-dimensional bulk within the framework of Nash's embeddings, incorporating them into a well-known $\mu-\Sigma$ modified gravity (MG) parametrization. By leveraging data from Planck Public Release 4 (PR4), BICEP/Keck Array 2018, Planck cosmic microwave background lensing, and baryon acoustic oscillation observations, we establish a stringent lower limit for the tensor-to-scalar ratio parameter: $r &lt; 0.0303$ at a confidence level (CL) of 95\%. This finding suggests the presence of extrinsic dynamics influencing standard four-dimensional cosmology. Notably, this limit surpasses those typically obtained through Bayesian analysis using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, which yield $r&lt;0.038$, or through the frequentist profile likelihood method, which yields $r&lt;0.037$ at 95\% CL.</description>

      <title>The discovery and significance of fast radio bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2007 we were part of a team that discovered the so-called ``Lorimer Burst'', the first example of a new class of objects now known as fast radio bursts (FRBs). These enigmatic events are only a few ms in duration and occur at random locations on the sky at a rate of a few thousand per day. Several thousand FRBs are currently known. While it is now well established that they have a cosmological origin, and about 10\% of all currently known sources have been seen to exhibit multiple bursts, the origins of these enigmatic sources are currently poorly understood. In this article, we review the discovery of FRBs and present some of the highlights from the vast body of work by an international community. Following a brief overview of the scale of the visible Universe in \S 1, we describe the key moments in radio astronomy (\S 2) that led up to the discovery of the Lorimer burst (\S 3). Early efforts to find more FRBs are described in \S 4 which led to the discovery of the first repeating source (\S 5). In \S 6, as we close out on the second decade of FRBs, we outline some of the many open questions in the field and look ahead to the coming years where many surprises are surely in store.</description>
