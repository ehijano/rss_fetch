      <title>Positronium formation and threshold behavior in positron-sodium collisions at low energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the elastic and inelastic scattering of positrons by sodium atoms in both the ground state, Na(3s), and excited states, Na*(3p, 4s, 3d), using the hyperspherical coordinate method with a model potential to represent the atomic core. The threshold behavior of positronium (Ps) formation cross sections is analyzed as the positron impact energy $E$ approaches zero. Within this framework, we derive a generalized expression for partial-wave Ps-formation cross sections at low positron energies, which applies to both ground-state and excited-state sodium targets. Our results confirm that the total threshold behavior follows the expected power-law dependence: $\sigma_{\scriptscriptstyle \text{Ps}}\propto E^{-1/2}$ for exothermic reactions and $\sigma_{\scriptscriptstyle \text{Ps}} \propto E^{a}$ for endothermic reactions, where $a &gt; 0$. Furthermore, we find that Ps-formation cross sections for positron scattering from excited Na states are significantly larger than those from the ground state in the low-energy region. A notable enhancement of Gailitis-Damburg oscillations is observed above the Ps(n=2) threshold, which may account for the increase observed in experimental data. Incorporating contributions from excited sodium targets improves agreement with experimental results and may help resolve discrepancies between theoretical predictions and measurements.</description>

      <title>Atomic determination of the nuclear quadrupole moment $\mathrm{Q}(^{209}{\rm Bi})$ using the multi-configuration Dirac-Hartree-Fock method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock method implemented in the Grasp2018 package was employed to calculate the magnetic dipole hyperfine interaction constants and electric field gradients of levels in the ground configuration of the neutral bismuth atom. Combining the calculated electric field gradient of the ground state with the measured electric quadrupole hyperfine interaction constant, we extracted the nuclear quadrupole moment for the $^{209}$Bi isotope, $\mathrm{Q}(^{209}\textbf{Bi}) = -422(22)$~mb. This value, together with other results obtained from atomic- and molecular-structure calculations, created the ``world average" nuclear quadrupole moment of this isotope, $\mathrm{Q}(^{209}\textbf{Bi}) = -420(17)$~mb.</description>

      <title>Fast and Error-Correctable Quantum RAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum devices can process data in a fundamentally different way than classical computers. To leverage this potential, many algorithms require the aid of a quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM), i.e. a module capable of efficiently loading datasets (both classical and quantum) onto the quantum processor. However, a realization of this fundamental building block is still outstanding, since existing proposals require prohibitively many resources for reliable implementations, or are not compatible with current architectures. Moreover, present approaches cannot be scaled-up, as they do not allow for efficient quantum error-correction. Here we develop a QRAM design, that enables fast and robust QRAM calls, naturally allows for fault-tolerant and error-corrected operation, and can be integrated on present hardware. Our proposal employs a special quantum resource state that is consumed during the QRAM call: we discuss how it can be assembled and processed efficiently in a dedicated module, and give detailed blueprints for modern neutral-atom processors. Our work places a long missing, fundamental component of quantum computers within reach of currently available technology; this opens the door to algorithms featuring practical quantum advantage, including search or oracular problems, quantum chemistry and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Intermolecular Radiative Decay: A non-local decay mechanism providing an insider's view of the solvation shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aqueous solutions are crucial in chemistry, biology, environmental science, and technology. The chemistry of solutes is influenced by the surrounding solvation shell of water molecules, which have different chemical properties than bulk water due to their different electronic and geometric structure. It is an experimental challenge to selectively investigate this property-determining electronic and geometric structure.
  Here, we report experimental results on a novel non-local X-ray emission process, Intermolecular Radiative Decay (IRD), for the prototypical ions Na$^{+}$ and Mg$^{2+}$ in water. We show that, in IRD, an electron from the solvation shell fills a core hole in the solute, and the released energy is emitted as an X-ray photon. We analyze the underlying mechanism using theoretical calculations, and show how IRD will allow us to meet the challenge of chemically selective probing of solvation shells from within.</description>

      <title>Photon-Mediated Atomic Interactions in Curved Surface Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subwavelength atomic lattices have emerged as a promising platform for quantum applications, leveraging collective superradiant and subradiant effects to enhance light-matter interactions. Integrating atomic lattices into nanostructures is at the front of effort toward any application with atomic lattices, but is still a challenging theoretical task, as the dipole interactions are hard to model in arbitrary dielectric environment. Here, we develop a formalism that allows the embedding of emitters to a wide class of thin curved waveguides, by greatly simplifying the wave equation and consequentially the dipole interactions. We demonstrate the formalism for locally constant positive curved surfaces, where we derive a new surface Green function that allows exact computation of the collective superradiant and subradiant states. We also show how the curvature and the thickness of the waveguides affects the collective states through an effective surface wavelength.</description>

      <title>Dielectronic recombination studies on Fe$^{2+}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dielectronic recombination resonance strengths, energy-differential cross sections, and recombination rate coefficients are calculated fully relativistically for Fe$^{2+}$ ions. The ground-state and resonance energies are determined using the multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock method. Radiative and auto-ionization rates are computed with a relativistic configuration interaction method. For the calculation of Auger widths and resonance strengths, the continuum electron is treated within the framework of the relativistic distorted-wave model. Notably, the calculated level energies for Fe$^{2+}$ not only align well with experimental results but also show improvements compared to earlier theoretical studies. These fully relativistic calculations provide a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the recombination process. This is particularly important in astrophysics and plasma physics, especially for studying phenomena such as kilonova events.</description>

      <title>Taming Recoil Effect in Cavity-Assisted Quantum Interconnects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photon recoil is one of the fundamental limitations for high-fidelity control of trapped-atom qubits such as neutral atoms and trapped ions. In this work, we derive an analytical model for efficiently evaluating the motion-induced infidelity in remote entanglement generation protocols. Our model is applicable for various photonic qubit encodings such as polarization, time bin, and frequency, and with arbitrary initial motional states, thus providing a crucial theoretical tool for realizing high-fidelity quantum networking. For the case of tweezer-trapped neutral atoms, our results indicate that operating in the bad-cavity regime with cavity decay rate exceeding atom-photon coupling rate, and near-ground-state cooling with motional quanta below 1, are desired to suppress the motion-induced infidelity sufficiently below the 1% level required for efficient quantum networking. Finite temperature effects can be mitigated efficiently by detection time filtering at the moderate cost of success probability and network speed. These results extend the understanding of infidelity sources in remote entanglement generation protocols, establishing a concrete path towards fault-tolerant quantum networking with scalable trapped-atom qubit systems.</description>

      <title>EIT in V+ inverted $\Xi$ system using Rydberg state in thermal Rb atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg excitation using blue and IR transition is an advantageous path for quantum computation in alkali elements. Aiming to stabilize the IR laser for quantum computation, we study electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) spectrum using Rydberg state in V+inverted $\Xi$ system (${5S_{1/2}}$ $\rightarrow$ ${5P_{3/2}}$ and ${5S_{1/2}}$ $\rightarrow$ ${6P_{1/2}}$ $\rightarrow$ ${r=69D_{3/2}}$) in Rb vapour cell at room temperature. The probe laser absorption at 780 nm is monitored in the presence of the two control lasers at 421 nm and 1003 nm. In comparison to the previously studied inverted $\Xi$ system, this system has a good signal-to-noise ratio even at room temperature with similar linewidth (around $10$~MHz). We also observe Autler-Towns splitting of the EIT due to the high power of probe and blue control lasers. For completeness and comparison, we also study the EIT in an inverted $\Xi$ system using $5S_{1/2}\rightarrow6P_{1/2}\rightarrow 69D_{3/2}$ transitions.</description>

      <title>Coincidence measurement of two-photon double ionization of argon through an autoionizing resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present coincidence measurements of two-photon double-ionization (TPDI) of argon driven by femtosecond pulses centered at 26.5 eV photon energy, which are obtained from a high-harmonic generation source. The measured photoelectron spectra are interpreted with regard to three TPDI mechanisms. Theoretical predictions are obtained by an approximate model for direct TPDI and atomic structure calculations, which are implemented into a Monte Carlo simulation. The prevailing mechanism includes the excitation and prompt photoionization of an autoionizing resonance in neutral argon. We provide evidence for pronounced electron-electron interaction in this ultrafast ionization process. The present work paves the way for scrutinizing and controlling non-linear photoionization in the extreme ultraviolet using table-top sources.</description>

      <title>Spectral Signatures of Vibronic Coupling in Trapped Cold Ionic Rydberg Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atoms and ions confined with electric and optical fields form the basis of many current quantum simulation and computing platforms. When excited to high-lying Rydberg states, long-ranged dipole interactions emerge which strongly couple the electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom through state-dependent forces. This vibronic coupling and the ensuing hybridization of internal and external degrees of freedom manifest through clear signatures in the many-body spectrum. We illustrate this by considering the case of two trapped Rydberg ions, for which the interaction between the relative vibrations and Rydberg states realizes a quantum Rabi model. We proceed to demonstrate that the aforementioned hybridization can be probed by radio frequency spectroscopy and discuss observable spectral signatures at finite temperatures and for larger ion crystals.</description>

      <title>Recoil-induced errors and their correction in photon-mediated entanglement between atom qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photonically-interconnected matter qubit systems have wide-ranging applications across quantum science and technology, with entanglement between distant qubits serving as a universal resource. While state-of-the-art heralded entanglement generation performance thus far has been achieved in trapped atomic systems modelled as stationary emitters, the improvements to fidelities and generation rates demanded by large-scale applications require taking into account their motional degrees of freedom. Here, we derive the effects of atomic motion on spontaneous emission coupled into arbitrary optical modes, and study the implications for commonly-used atom-atom entanglement protocols. We arrive at a coherent physical picture in the form of "kick operators" associated with each instant in the photonic wavepackets, which also suggests a method to mitigate motional errors by disentangling qubit and motion post-herald. This proposed correction technique removes overheads associated with the thermal motion of atoms, and may greatly increase entanglement rates in long-distance quantum network links by allowing single-photon-based protocols to be used in the high-fidelity regime.</description>
