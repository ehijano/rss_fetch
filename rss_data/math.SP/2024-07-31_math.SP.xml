      <title>Optimal Algorithms for Quantifying Spectral Size with Applications to Quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce computational strategies for measuring the ``size'' of the spectrum of bounded self-adjoint operators using various metrics such as the Lebesgue measure, fractal dimensions, the number of connected components (or gaps), and other spectral characteristics. Our motivation comes from the study of almost-periodic operators, particularly those that arise as models of quasicrystals. Such operators are known for intricate hierarchical patterns and often display delicate spectral properties, such as Cantor spectra, which are significant in studying quantum mechanical systems and materials science. We propose a series of algorithms that compute these properties under different assumptions and explore their theoretical implications through the Solvability Complexity Index (SCI) hierarchy. This approach provides a rigorous framework for understanding the computational feasibility of these problems, proving algorithmic optimality, and enhancing the precision of spectral analysis in practical settings. For example, we show that our methods are optimal by proving certain lower bounds (impossibility results) for the class of limit-periodic Schr\"odinger operators. We demonstrate our methods through state-of-the-art computations for aperiodic systems in one and two dimensions, effectively capturing these complex spectral characteristics. The results contribute significantly to connecting theoretical and computational aspects of spectral theory, offering insights that bridge the gap between abstract mathematical concepts and their practical applications in physical sciences and engineering. Based on our work, we conclude with conjectures and open problems regarding the spectral properties of specific models.</description>

      <title>The restricted discrete Fourier transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the restriction of the discrete Fourier transform $F_N : L^2(\mathbb{Z}/N \mathbb{Z}) \to L^2(\mathbb{Z}/N \mathbb{Z})$ to the space $\mathcal C_a$ of functions with support on the discrete interval $[-a,a]$, whose transforms are supported inside the same interval. A periodically tridiagonal matrix $J$ on $L^2(\mathbb{Z}/N \mathbb{Z})$ is constructed having the three properties that it commutes with $F_N$, has eigenspaces of dimensions 1 and 2 only, and the span of its eigenspaces of dimension 1 is precisely $\mathcal C_a$. The simple eigenspaces of $J$ provide an orthonormal eigenbasis of the restriction of $F_N$ to $\mathcal C_a$. The dimension 2 eigenspaces of $J$ have canonical basis elements supported on $[-a,a]$ and its complement. These bases give an interpolation formula for reconstructing $f(x)\in L^2(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})$ from the values of $f(x)$ and $\widehat f(x)$ on $[-a,a]$, i.e., an explicit Fourier uniqueness pair interpolation formula. The coefficients of the interpolation formula are expressed in terms of theta functions. Lastly, we construct an explicit basis of $\mathcal C_a$ having extremal support and leverage it to obtain explicit formulas for eigenfunctions of $F_N$ in $C_a$ when $\dim \mathcal C_a \leq 4$.</description>

      <title>A sharp quantitative nonlinear Poincar\'e inequality on convex domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any $p \in ( 1, +\infty)$, we give a new inequality for the first nontrivial Neumann eigenvalue $\mu _ p (\Omega, \varphi)$ of the $p$-Laplacian on a convex domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ with a power-concave weight $\varphi$. Our result improves the classical estimate in terms of the diameter, first stated in a seminal paper by Payne and Weinberger: we add in the lower bound an extra term depending on the second largest John semi-axis of $\Omega$ (equivalent to a power of the width in the special case $N = 2$). The power exponent in the extra term is sharp, and the constant in front of it is explicitly tracked, thus enlightening the interplay between space dimension, nonlinearity and power-concavity. Moreover, we attack the stability question: we prove that, if $\mu _ p (\Omega, \varphi)$ is close to the lower bound, then $\Omega$ is close to a thin cylinder, and $\varphi$ is close to a function which is constant along its axis. As intermediate results, we establish a sharp $L^ \infty$ estimate for the associated eigenfunctions, and we determine the asymptotic behaviour of $\mu _ p (\Omega, \varphi)$ for varying weights and domains, including the case of collapsing geometries.</description>

      <title>Quantitative spectral stability for compact operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with quantitative spectral stability for compact operators acting on $L^2(X,m)$, where $(X,m)$ is a measure space. Under fairly general assumptions, we provide a characterization of the dominant term of the asymptotic expansion of the eigenvalue variation in this abstract setting. Many of the results about quantitative spectral stability available in the literature can be recovered by our analysis. Furthermore, we illustrate our result with several applications, e.g. quantitative spectral stability for a Robin to Neumann problem, conformal transformations of Riemann metrics, Dirichlet forms under the removal of sets of small capacity, and for families of pseudo-differentials operators.</description>

      <title>Spectral bounds for certain special type of rational matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02894v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive bounds on the moduli of eigenvalues of certain special type of rational matrices, using the following techniques/methods: (1) an upper bound is obtained using the Bauer-Fike theorem on an associated block matrix of the given rational matrix, (2) a lower bound is obtained by associating a real rational function, along with Rouch$\text{\'e}$'s theorem for the rational matrix and (3) an upper bound is also obtained using a numerical radius inequality for a block matrix for the rational matrix. These bounds are compared when the coefficients are unitary matrices. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the results obtained.</description>

      <title>Prescribed exponential stabilization of a one-layer neural network with delayed feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13730v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides control-oriented delay-based modeling of a one-layer neural network of Hopfield-type subject to an external input designed as delayed feedback. The specificity of such a model is that it makes the considered neuron less susceptible to seizure caused by its inherent dynamic instability. This modeling exploits a recently set partial pole placement for linear functional differential equations, which relies on the coexistence of real spectral values, allowing the explicit prescription of the closed-loop solution's exponential decay. The proposed framework improves some pioneering and scarce results from the literature on the characterization of the exact solution's exponential decay when a simple real spectral value exists. Indeed, it improves neural stability when the inherent dynamic is stable and provides insights into the design of a one-layer neural network that can be stabilized exponentially with delayed feedback and with a prescribed decay rate regardless of whether the inherent neuron dynamic is stable or unstable.</description>
