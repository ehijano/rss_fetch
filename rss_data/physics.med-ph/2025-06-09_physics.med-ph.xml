      <title>An analytical model for gold nanoparticle radiosensitisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a variance-driven Local-Effect-Model ($\sigma$-LEM) to predict radiosensitization due to gold nanoparticles (AuNP). Assuming that the number of Au photo-ionisations scales strictly with particle volume $V_{\mathrm{NP}} \propto R^{3}$ and that the cascade energy deposition is log-normally distributed, the enhanced dose in each target voxel can be written as $D_{\text{enh}} = D_{0} \exp(\sigma Z)$ with $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ and width $\sigma = \sqrt{2 \ln(1 + Kc)}$.
  By assuming a linear-quadratic (LQ) dose response, a relation between survival and dose can be derived for each voxel. Although there is no closed form for the log-normal distribution, averaging over the entire domain using first and second order moments leads to three possible closed forms: a variance-only one, a mixed-term one, where simultaneous hits from enhancement and baseline can occur, and a second-order model, accurate to $\mathcal{O}(\sigma^{3})$. These three variants adapt well to low-concentration, mid-concentration, and high-concentration regimes.
  The model was tested for Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) results, irradiated with a 100 kVp x-ray beam, taken from a Local Effect Model (LEM) and experimental values. The model shows good agreement with the experimental data, with deviations within acceptable limits, but presents significant changes to the results obtained with the LEM. In particular, results seem to indicate that dose enhancement is mostly $\alpha$-driven. These findings are further developed in the manuscript.
  The theoretical framework presented here collapses radiobiological outcomes to two experimentally controllable variables, beam quality, in the term $K_c$, and intracellular concentration $c$, while retaining mechanistic fidelity. Additional tests should be made to further confirm the validity of the model.</description>

      <title>Active Lubrication of Transluminal Medical Instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transluminal minimally invasive surgery uses natural orifices and small incisions to access internal anatomical structures, promoting quicker recovery and reduced morbidity. However, navigating instruments--catheters and endoscopes--through anatomical pathways creates frictional interactions with luminal walls, risking complications such as perforation, poor haptic feedback, and instrument buckling. In this paper, we present a new approach to actively lubricate transluminal instruments and dynamically reduce friction with surrounding tissues. This approach employs ultrasonic vibrations, at the instrument surface, to generate a pressurized fluid layer at the contact interface, lubricating the interface and thereby reducing friction. We implemented this approach in a prototype catheter, which we validated under dry and liquid-lubricated conditions, across rigid and soft interfaces, and along varied anatomical curvatures. In a cardiac catheter use case, active lubrication reduced friction by up to 42% on ex-vivo porcine aorta tissue and 82% on rigid substrates, denoting its potential performance on healthy and calcified tissue, respectively. Thermal imaging confirmed that temperature at the tissue-catheter interface remained within safe limits. Additionally, the system effectively prevented buckling during catheter insertion experiment, further showcasing its potential. By minimizing injury risk and enhancing procedural stability, active lubrication can drastically enhance the safety and efficacy of transluminal interventions.</description>

      <title>First positronium imaging using $^{44}$Sc with the J-PET scanner: a case study on the NEMA-Image Quality phantom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positronium Lifetime Imaging (PLI), an emerging extension of conventional positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, offers a novel window for probing the submolecular properties of biological tissues by imaging the mean lifetime of the positronium atom. Currently, the method is under rapid development in terms of reconstruction and detection systems. Recently, the first in vivo PLI of the human brain was performed using the J-PET scanner utilizing the $^{68}$Ga isotope. However, this isotope has limitations due to its comparatively low prompt gamma yields, which is crucial for positronium lifetime measurement. Among alternative radionuclides, $^{44}$Sc stands out as a promising isotope for PLI, characterized by a clinically suitable half-life (4.04 hours) emitting 1157 keV prompt gamma in 100% cases after the emission of the positron. This study reports the first experimental demonstration of PLI with $^{44}$Sc, carried out on a NEMA-Image Quality (IQ) phantom using the Modular J-PET tomograph-the first plastic scintillators-based PET scanner.</description>

      <title>Geodesic-based Predictive Shape Modeling of the Right Ventricle in Patients with Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is characterized by severe underdevelopment of left ventricle requiring staged surgical reconstruction (stages) to allow the right ventricle (RV) alone to support the circulation. In this setting changes in RV size and shape over time reflect adaptations to single-ventricle physiology, dysfunction of the associated tricuspid valve (TV), and are associated with circulatory failure. As such, an accurate prediction of the RV shape of a patient would inform understanding of both RV and TV failure, as well as clinical prognosis and associated decision making. We present a geodesic-based predictive shape modeling framework applied a cohort of RVs obtained from 15 HLHS patients at three individual time points. Reasonable predictions on stage 1 RV shapes can generated using pre-stage 1 RV shapes and two predictors from prior clinical and demographic measures. Our results demonstrate the future potential for a data-driven method to predict how the morphology of the RV of an individual patient will change in size and shape over time. Future studies will seek to expand the training sample size and integrate more comprehensive demographic and morphological data into the proposed predictive model.</description>

      <title>Impact of normal lung volume choices on radiation pneumonitis risk prediction in locally advanced NSCLC radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study is to evaluate the impact of lung volume choices on predicting radiation pneumonitis (RP) risk in patients with locally advanced NSCLC undergoing radiotherapy. Dosimetric variables V20, V5, and mean lung dose (MLD) were extracted from the treatment plans of 442 patients enrolled in the NRG Oncology RTOG 0617 trial. Three lung volumes were defined: total lung excluding gross-tumor-target (TL-GTV), total lung excluding clinical-target-volume (TL-CTV), and total lung excluding planning-target-volume (TL-PTV). Patients were grouped as no-RP2 (N = 377, grade &lt;= 1 RP) and RP2 (N = 65, grade &gt;= 2 RP). Statistical analyses were performed to assess the effect on lung volume definition on RP2 prediction. Three supervised machine learning (ML) models: logistic regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), were used to evaluate predictive performance. Model performance was quantified using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and statistical significance was tested via a bootstrap analysis. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were applied to interpret feature contributions to model predictions. Statistical analyses showed that V20 and MLD were significantly associated with RP2, while differences among volume definitions were not statistically significant. Both kNN and XGB classifiers consistently yielded higher AUC values for the TL-PTV definition compared to the other definitions, a finding supported by bootstrap analysis. SHAP analysis further indicated that V20 and MLD were the most influential predictors of RP2. Both statistical analysis and SHAP confirmed that V20 and MLD were associated with RP2. The ML models indicated that defining normal lung volume as total lung excluding PTV yielded the highest predictive performance for RP2 risk. Further validation using external datasets is warranted to confirm these findings.</description>

      <title>A Cloud-native Agile approach to cyber platform prototyping and integration for astronomy: the ENGAGE SKA case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) Observatory is gearing up the formal construction of its two radio interferometers in Australia and South Africa after the end of design and pre-construction phases. Agile methodologies, the Cloud native Computing technologies and the DevOps software ideas are influencing the design of compute infrastructures that will be key to reduce the operational costs of SKA while improving the control and monitoring of the SKA antennas and ancillary systems, Correlators, HPC facilities or related data centre tiered systems. These tools will likely include advanced power metering technologies and efficient distribution automation and Network Operation Centres (NOC). SKA will become the world's largest radio telescope and is expected to achieve its first science by 2026. To cope with this dimension and complexity, a key part of this distributed Observatory is the overall software control and monitoring system embodied in the Observatory Management and Control (OMC) and the Services Teams that requires specialized Agile Teams to assist in software and cyber infrastructure building using an Agile development environment that includes test automation, Continuous Integration, and Continuous Deployment. To manage such a large and distributed machine, the Agile approach was adopted for the core software package of the SKA Telescope aimed at scheduling observations, controlling their execution, monitoring the telescope status and ensuring scalability and reliability. Here, we report on the ENGAGE SKA ciberinfrastructure prototyping support to the SKA Agile Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).</description>
