      <title>An Optimal Transport approach to arbitrage correction: Application to volatility Stress-Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method based on optimal transport to remove arbitrage opportunities within a finite set of option prices. The method is notably intended for regulatory stress-tests, which impose to apply important local distortions to implied volatility surfaces. The resulting stressed option prices are naturally associated to a family of signed marginal measures: we formulate the process of removing arbitrage as a projection onto the subset of martingale measures with respect to a Wasserstein metric in the space of signed measures. We show how this projection problem can be recast as an optimal transport problem; in view of the numerical solution, we apply an entropic regularization technique. For the regularized problem, we derive a strong duality formula, show convergence results as the regularization parameter approaches zero, and formulate a multi-constrained Sinkhorn algorithm, where each iteration involves, at worse, finding the root of an explicit scalar function. The convergence of this algorithm is also established. We compare our method with the existing approach by [Cohen, Reisinger and Wang, Appl.\ Math.\ Fin.\ 2020] across various scenarios and test cases.</description>

      <title>A System of BSDEs with Singular Terminal Values Arising in Optimal Liquidation with Regime Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a stochastic control problem with regime switching arising in an optimal liquidation problem with dark pools and multiple regimes. The new feature of this model is that it introduces a system of BSDEs with jumps and with singular terminal values, which appears in literature for the first time. The existence result for this system is obtained. As a result, we solve the stochastic control problem with regime switching. More importantly, the uniqueness result of this system is also obtained, in contrast to merely minimal solutions established in most related literature.</description>

      <title>Sequential Portfolio Selection under Latent Side Information-Dependence Structure: Optimality and Universal Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the investment problem of constructing an optimal no-short sequential portfolio strategy in a market with a latent dependence structure between asset prices and partly unobservable side information, which is often high-dimensional. The results demonstrate that a dynamic strategy, which forms a portfolio based on perfect knowledge of the dependence structure and full market information over time, may not grow at a higher rate infinitely often than a constant strategy, which remains invariant over time. Specifically, if the market is stationary, implying that the dependence structure is statistically stable, the growth rate of an optimal dynamic strategy, utilizing the maximum capacity of the entire market information, almost surely decays over time into an equilibrium state, asymptotically converging to the growth rate of a constant strategy.
  Technically, this work reassesses the common belief that a constant strategy only attains the optimal limiting growth rate of dynamic strategies when the market process is identically and independently distributed. By analyzing the dynamic log-optimal portfolio strategy as the optimal benchmark in a stationary market with side information, we show that a random optimal constant strategy almost surely exists, even when a limiting growth rate for the dynamic strategy does not. Consequently, two approaches to learning algorithms for portfolio construction are discussed, demonstrating the safety of removing side information from the learning process while still guaranteeing an asymptotic growth rate comparable to that of the optimal dynamic strategy.</description>

      <title>A Unifying Approach for the Pricing of Debt Securities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06303v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a unifying framework for the pricing of debt securities under general time-inhomogeneous short-rate diffusion processes. The pricing of bonds, bond options, callable/putable bonds, and convertible bonds (CBs) is covered. Using continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) approximations, we obtain closed-form matrix expressions to approximate the price of bonds and bond options under general one-dimensional short-rate processes. A simple and efficient algorithm is also developed to price callable/putable debt. The availability of a closed-form expression for the price of zero-coupon bonds allows for the perfect fit of the approximated model to the current market term structure of interest rates, regardless of the complexity of the underlying diffusion process selected. We further consider the pricing of CBs under general bi-dimensional time-inhomogeneous diffusion processes to model equity and short-rate dynamics. Credit risk is also incorporated into the model using the approach of Tsiveriotis and Fernandes (1998). Based on a two-layer CTMC method, an efficient algorithm is developed to approximate the price of convertible bonds. When conversion is only allowed at maturity, a closed-form matrix expression is obtained. Numerical experiments show the accuracy and efficiency of the method across a wide range of model parameters and short-rate models.</description>
