      <title>Coupled Modeling of External Pressure and Capillary Blood Flow: Nonlinear Dynamics of Vascular Elasticity and Collapse Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: External pressure significantly influences microcirculatory capillary blood flow, yet current studies lack quantitative modeling. This work proposes a nonlinear segmented coupling model between external pressure and capillary flow, incorporating vascular elasticity and collapse effects. The pressure-flow response is divided into three phases: elastic compression under low pressure (less than 30 mmHg), elliptical collapse in the transition zone (30 to 40 mmHg), and closure-induced attenuation under high pressure (above 40 mmHg), with explicit expressions derived for each. Parameter sensitivity analysis and comparison with literature demonstrate the model's capability in capturing key determinants. The proposed framework supports dose-response assessment and individualized parameter tuning in pressure-based therapies such as tourniquets and compression garments.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Ocular Surface Changes with Contact Lens Wear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over 140 million people worldwide and over 45 million people in the United states wear contact lenses; it is estimated 12%-27.4% contact lens users stop wearing them due to discomfort. Contact lens mechanical interactions with the ocular surface have been found to affect the ocular surface. The mechanical interactions between the contact lens and the eye are difficult to measure and calculate in the clinical setting, and the research in this field is limited. This paper presents the first mathematical model that couples the interaction between the contact lens and the open eye, where the contact lens configuration, the contact lens suction pressure, and the deformed ocular shape are all emergent properties of the model. The non-linear coupling between the contact lens and the eye is achieved assuming the the suction pressure under the lens is applied directly to the ocular surface, neglecting the post-lens tear film layer. The contact lens dynamics is modeled using a previous published model. We consider a homogeneous and a heterogeneous linear elastic eye model, different ocular shapes, different lens shapes and lens thickness profiles, and extract lens deformation, lens suction pressure profiles, and ocular deformations and stresses for all the scenarios considered. The model predicts higher ocular deformations and stresses at the center of the eye and in the limbal/scleral region. Accounting for a heterogeneous material eye parameters increases such deformations and stresses. The ocular displacements and stresses increase non-linearly as we increase the stiffness of the contact lens. Inserting a steeper contact lens on the eye results in a reduction of the ocular displacement at the center of the eye and a larger displacement at the edge of the contact lens. The model predictions are compared to experimental data and previously developed mathematical models.</description>

      <title>Advanced X-rays techniques for research-oriented high-resolution imaging of articular cartilage: a scoping review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Articular cartilage is a musculoskeletal soft tissue renowned for its unique mechanical properties. Understanding both its hierarchical structure and the interplay between its constituents could shed light on the mechanical competence of the tissue. Therefore, rheologic approaches based on high-resolution non-destructive imaging techniques are desired. In this context, X-ray imaging could ideally accomplish this task. Nevertheless, the nature of articular cartilage translates into poor contrast using conventional absorption modality. To overcome this limitation, several approaches can be embraced. X-ray visibility of articular cartilage can be increased with the use of radiopaque contrast agents. Therefore, further discrimination of structures could be provided by spectral techniques, pivoting on either multi-energy acquisitions or photon-counting technology. Alternatively, phase-contrast techniques unveil details typically undetected with conventional approaches. Phase-contrast imaging, based on the intrinsic decrement in the refractive index of the tissue, can be achieved with different configurations and implementations, including distinct X-ray sources and optical elements. Additionally, some phase-contrast techniques retrieve the small-angle scattering-based dark-field signal, relatable to sub-pixel structures. This scoping review aims to catalogue the application of these advanced X-ray techniques to articular cartilage imaging, following PRISMA guidelines. It discusses their advantages, limitations, and includes an overview of rheologic applications to articular cartilage.</description>

      <title>MoDyGAN: Combining Molecular Dynamics With GANs to Investigate Protein Conformational Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensively exploring protein conformational landscapes remains a major challenge in computational biology due to the high computational cost involved in dynamic physics-based simulations. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline, MoDyGAN, that leverages molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to explore protein conformational spaces. MoDyGAN contains a generator that maps Gaussian distributions into MD-derived protein trajectories, and a refinement module that combines ensemble learning with a dual-discriminator to further improve the plausibility of generated conformations. Central to our approach is an innovative representation technique that reversibly transforms 3D protein structures into 2D matrices, enabling the use of advanced image-based GAN architectures. We use three rigid proteins to demonstrate that MoDyGAN can generate plausible new conformations. We also use deca-alanine as a case study to show that interpolations within the latent space closely align with trajectories obtained from steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations. Our results suggest that representing proteins as image-like data unlocks new possibilities for applying advanced deep learning techniques to biomolecular simulation, leading to an efficient sampling of conformational states. Additionally, the proposed framework holds strong potential for extension to other complex 3D structures.</description>
