      <title>Factorization and resummation of QED radiative corrections for neutron beta decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Details of the two-loop analysis of long-distance QED radiative corrections to neutron beta decay are presented. Explicit expressions are given for hard, jet, and soft functions appearing in the factorization formula that describes the small mass/large energy limit. Power corrections, cancellation of singularities in the small mass expansion, renormalization scheme dependence, and bound state effects are discussed. The results impact the determination of $|V_{ud}|$ from the measured neutron lifetime.</description>

      <title>Space-time Areas and Hadronization Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-time area laws play a fundamental role in modeling strongly interacting phenomena, such as in relativistic string models, QCD on the lattice, and in hadronization modeling. For the latter, an exact expression for relevant space-time areas related to the final state hadronic events for hadrons of any mass is calculated. Usage of this expression in the UCLA hadronization model helps validate its space-time area law (STAL) principle and unifies the treatment of heavy and light hadrons via a single fragmentation function.</description>

      <title>Neutrino fog in the light dark sector: the role of isospin violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) direct detection is now standing at an interesting juncture, where the Standard Model (SM) neutrino background and the upper bound on the DM signal cross section are starting to overlap in the DM mass region around 10 GeV. The neutrino floor, which defines the extent of the neutrino background, can be modified in different Beyond Standard Model (BSM) setups. We work in a simple BSM dark sector extension of the SM visible sector, where isospin-violating interactions occur naturally. In this model, both DM and neutrinos have, in general, isospin-violating (IV) interactions with nuclei, through a newly added local U(1) gauge boson $Z^{\prime}$. Depending on the choice of the model parameters, the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\mathrm{\nu}$NS) cross section can either increase or decrease, shifting up or down the neutrino floor in the parameter space. The same is true for the DM experimental upper bound, whose change is driven exclusively by the IV parameter $f_n/f_p$. Several scenarios are constructed, based on the interplay between the two regions and the allowed parameter space left between them, and discussed. The potential observation of solar neutrinos in DM direct detection experiments is also discussed in the context of our framework.</description>

      <title>Correlation functions for $n\,\bar{D}_{s1}(2460)$ and $n\,\bar{D}_{s1}(2536)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interaction of the $n \bar {D}_{s1}(2460)$ and $n \bar {D}_{s1}(2536)$ systems from the perspective that the $D_{s1}(2460)$ and $D_{s1}(2536)$ states are molecular states of $K D^*$ and $K^*D$, respectively. We use an improved version of the fixed center approximation to the Faddeev equations which fulfills exact elastic unitarity at the threshold of the systems. We predict the existence of resonant states below threshold and also determine the scattering length, effective range and correlation functions of these systems, showing that the results contain important information to test the assumed molecular nature of the two $D_{s1}$ states.</description>

      <title>Detecting Traces of Light-Quark Yukawa Couplings to the Higgs Boson in Fragmentation Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out that Yukawa interactions of light quarks with the Higgs boson are imprinted as unique azimuthal modulations in the density of fragmentation hadrons relative to the Higgs $p_T$. We introduce Yukawa Fragmentation Asymmetries (YFAs), interference observables that are linearly proportional to real (Standard Model) or CP-odd Yukawa couplings, respectively. The chiral suppression is lifted nonperturbatively by chiral-odd multi-hadron fragmentation functions. As a case study, we consider $VH$ production with a tagged target fragmentation hadron at the HL-LHC. We estimate that the YFAs from this single example process are already competitive with current projected HL-LHC sensitivities for second-generation couplings, and outperform them by a factor of 2-3 for first-generation couplings. Our results point to deep synergies between precision studies of confinement and the in-depth exploration of the Higgs sector.</description>

      <title>Models for the Electric Dipole Moment and Anomalous Magnetic Moment of the Tau Lepton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Belle II experiment and other ongoing and projected lepton facilities are expected to greatly enhance the sensitivity to the electric dipole moment (EDM) and anomalous magnetic moment ($g-2$) for the tau lepton, making it timely to explore models that predict these observables. We present a class of models that generate a sizable EDM and $g-2$ of the tau lepton via radiative tau mass generation. Two benchmark models with different hypercharge assignments are investigated. The first model contains neutral fermions and charged scalars. We find that the model can predict a large signal of the tau EDM, $d_{\tau} = \mathcal{O}(10^{-19}) \, e \, {\rm cm}$, and $g-2$, $a_{\tau} = \mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$, which are within the reach of future updates of their measurements. In contrast, the second model, containing a charged fermion and neutral scalars, yields a similar magnitude for the $g-2$ but predicts a comparatively smaller EDM signal. Our models serve as benchmarks for new physics generating sizable EDM and $g-2$ of the tau lepton.</description>

      <title>Illuminating Scalar Dark Matter Co-Scattering in EFT with Monophoton Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the co-scattering mechanism for dark matter production in an EFT framework which contains new $Z_2$-odd singlets, namely two fermions $N_{1,2}$ and a real scalar $\chi$. The singlet scalar $\chi$ is the dark matter candidate. The dimension-5 operators play a vital role to set the observed DM relic density. We focus on a nearly degenerate mass spectrum for the $Z_2$ odd particles to allow for a significant contribution from the co-scattering or co-annihilation mechanisms. We present two benchmark points where either of the two mechanisms primarily set the DM relic abundance. The main constraint on the model at the LHC arise from the ATLAS mono-$\gamma$ search. We obtain the parameter space allowed by the observed relic density and the mono-$\gamma$ search after performing a scan over the key parameters, the masses $M_{N_{1,2}}, M_\chi$ and couplings $c_3^\prime, Y^\prime_{11,22}$. We find the region of parameter space where the relic abundance is set primarily by the co-scattering mechanism while being allowed by the LHC search. We also determine how the model can be further probed at the HL-LHC via the mono-$\gamma$ signature.</description>

      <title>Mass Spectrum of Heavy Mesons using WKB Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we analyze the bound-state energy spectrum of quark-antiquark systems using the semiclassical WKB approximation. We consider the Cornell potential, which combines a linear confinement term with a Coulombic interaction, and perform a Taylor series expansion around an appropriately chosen point $r_{0}$ to simplify the potential near the classical turning points. This expansion enables an analytic treatment of the Schr\"odinger equation within the leading-order WKB framework. The resulting quantization condition yields approximate energy levels that capture the essential dynamics of quarkonium systems and illustrate the utility of the WKB method in modeling hadronic bound states.</description>

      <title>Semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering off a tensor-polarized spin-1 target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering off a tensor-polarized spin-1 target, focusing on the production of an unpolarized hadron. The complete differential cross section is expressed in terms of 23 structure functions, which depend on the spin states of the target and the azimuthal modulations of the final-state hadron. Within the transverse momentum dependent (TMD) factorization framework, we derive the hadronic tensor using quark-quark correlators and quark-gluon-quark correlators up to twist-3. At tree-level, 21 nonvanishing structure functions are obtained at the leading and subleading twist, expressed as convolutions of TMD parton distribution functions and TMD fragmentation functions. The measurement of these nonzero structure functions can be utilized to explore the tensor-polarized structure of spin-1 particles, offering insights into their internal dynamics.</description>

      <title>Drell--Yan lepton pair production at low invariant masses: transverse-momentum resummation and non-perturbative effects in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the transverse-momentum ($q_T$) distribution of Drell-Yan lepton pairs produced with invariant masses ($M$) from low values up to the $Z$-boson peak ($4\leq M \leq 116$~GeV). We present perturbative predictions obtained by consistently combining the resummation of logarithmically enhanced QCD corrections at small $q_T$ ($q_T \ll M$) up to next-to-next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy with the available fixed-order calculations at next-to-next-to-leading order (i.e. $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_S^3)$) valid at large $q_T$. For very low $q_T$ ($q_T\sim \Lambda_{\mathrm{QCD}}$), non-perturbative (NP) QCD effects become dominant and have been included through a NP form factor with a small number of free-parameters. We compare our results with multiple experimental datasets from hadron colliders, finding excellent agreement between theory and data. By fitting the NP parameters, we achieve a precise extraction of the NP form factor and the so-called Collins-Soper kernel.</description>

      <title>The Free Massive Quadratic Action from the Exotic Model (E7)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Exotic Model arises from adding a special exotic invariant to the Supersymmetric Standard Model. The Exotic Model has a supersymmetry violating mass spectrum without using spontaneous or explicit breaking of supersymmetry. The splitting arises with gauge symmetry breaking, at tree level, in the supermultiplets of the Z vector boson and a new X vector boson. It spreads to the other particles at one loop. This mass splitting is possible because the exotic invariant changes the algebra of supersymmetry. This paper E7 discusses a number of issues that arise in the calculation of the mass splitting of the Exotic Model. That mass splitting will require computer programs for solution.</description>

      <title>Illuminating Degenerate Dark Sector of Inert Doublet Model at Muon Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Inert scalar Doublet Model (IDM) presents a simple yet elegant framework for a scalar dark sector where the lightest mode functions as a viable dark matter candidate under a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. With TeV-scale particles accessible to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) or future colliders, probing different dark matter scenarios within IDM provides an exciting opportunity. While the Higgs portal dark matter scenario is extensively well-studied at the LHC, probing the degenerate scalar dark sector presents some unique challenges, not only in detecting excessively soft decay products and the tiny production cross-section expected at the higher masses. The present study explores the potential of a forward muon facility at a future muon collider to uncover this elusive degenerate dark sector.</description>

      <title>Quarkonium Parton Shower in Herwig 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the implementation of a fully automated quarkonium parton shower in Herwig 7, based on non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorisation with spin-colour projections. The framework systematically incorporates colour-singlet and colour-octet production mechanisms, gluon fragmentation, and diquark production processes. Perturbative short-distance coefficients are combined with non-perturbative NRQCD matrix elements to simulate heavy-quark bound state formation. Splitting functions for $S$-, $P$- and $D$-wave states are explicitly derived and integrated into the angular-ordered shower evolution. The implementation preserves spin correlations and polarisation effects while accurately accounting for feed-down contributions. Results demonstrate improved agreement with the existing LHC data. This quarkonium parton shower will become publicly available with the release of Herwig-7.4.0.</description>

      <title>$b \to c$ semileptonic sum rule: Current status and prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $b \to c$ semileptonic sum rules provide relations between the decay rates of $B \to D^{(*)} \tau\bar\nu$ and $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c \tau\bar\nu$. Starting from the heavy quark and zero-recoil limits, we revisit the derivation of the sum rule for total decay rates. We then examine deviations from the limits and investigate corrections arising from realistic hadron masses and higher-order contributions to form factors, taking account of uncertainties. We show that these corrections are negligible compared to current experimental uncertainties, indicating that the sum rule is useful for cross-checking experimental consistency and testing the validity of the Standard Model predictions. In future, precise determinations of the form factors particularly for the tensor operator will be necessary to compare the sum rule predictions with $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c \tau\bar\nu$ data from the LHCb experiment and the Tera-Z projects.</description>

      <title>Production of $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ pairs in diffractive photon-proton and in proton-proton collisions revisited, in particular concerning the Drell-S\"oding contribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the central exclusive photoproduction of $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ pairs in photon-proton and in proton-proton collisions at high energies. The $\rho^{0}$, $\omega$, $f_{2}(1270)$, and non-resonant (Drell-S\"oding) contributions are considered. The calculation is based on the tensor-pomeron model that includes not only the dominant pomeron exchange but also reggeon and odderon exchanges. In the Drell-S\"oding contribution we have different subenergies for the $\pi^{+}p$ and $\pi^{-}p$ systems. In the method which we propose now we take this into account. Respecting the gauge-invariance constraints is then a nontrivial problem for which, however, we present a solution here. In this way we improve the corresponding calculations presented in JHEP 01, 151 (2015) and in Phys. Rev. D 91, 074023 (2015). The revised model leads to enhanced cross sections and gives an increased skewing of the $\rho^{0}$ spectral shape. For the $pp\to pp\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ reaction, we calculate differential cross sections as function of the two-pion invariant mass, pion transverse momentum and pion pseudorapidity. Predictions of proton-pion and proton-pion-pion invariant mass distributions and the distribution in the proton-proton four-momentum transfer squared are also presented. This research is relevant in the context of ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb measurements in $pp$ collisions, even when the leading protons are not detected and instead only rapidity-gap conditions are checked experimentally. Our results can also serve as basis for the description of coherent $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ production in ultra-peripheral $p$A and AA collisions at the LHC. The formulas given in our paper can directly be used for the analysis of photoproduction and small-$Q^{2}$ electroproduction in $ep$ collisions at high energies. Such data exist from the HERA experiments and will be obtained in the future at the electron-ion colliders.</description>

Abstract: We revisit a model of electroweak baryogenesis that includes a dark matter candidate, and sequesters the new CP violation required to produce the baryon asymmetry in a dark sector. The model can successfully explain the baryon asymmetry, dark matter relic density, and the long-standing excess of gamma rays from the galactic center. The first order electroweak phase transition induced by the new physics can give rise to gravitational waves that may be observed in future experiments. The model predicts dark matter signals in direct detectors, and a significant contribution to the Higgs boson invisible decay width.</description>

      <title>Prompt atmospheric leptons and the potential role of intrinsic charm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The all-sky very-high energy ($10^4-10^6$ GeV) atmospheric muon flux is most recently measured by IceCube, where in the higher energy range, the spectrum hardens indicating a prompt component. IceCube also measures the atmospheric muon neutrino flux at high energy. Since this is dominated by the astrophysical flux, they are only able to set an upper bound on the prompt atmospheric muon neutrino flux contribution. We provide a new evaluation of the prompt atmospheric muon flux including for the first time an intrinsic charm component to colliding nucleons. This increases forward production of $\bar{D}^{0}$, $D^-$ and $\Lambda_c$ which decay into final states that can contain muons and muon neutrinos. We show how the increase in the prompt muon flux due to intrinsic charm has an associated increase in the prompt muon neutrino flux. We consider the Regge ansatz for intrinsic charm production that we implement in MCEq used for the calculation of the lepton fluxes. We discuss the challenges of obtaining predictions that are simultaneously consistent with both IceCube's high energy atmospheric muon flux measurements and their upper bound on the prompt muon neutrino flux. We quantify the discrepancies.</description>

      <title>On the Determination of Collisional Stopping Power via Kaluza-Klein Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the tools of general relativity are used to analytically derive collisional stopping power. We start from a Kaluza-Klein inspired, five-dimensional diffeomorphism-invariant action, and upon compactification, obtain a four-dimensional effective theory in which the matter fields are treated to be brane-localized. The medium response to the projected electron is encoded in symmetric tensor fields coupled covariantly to both electromagnetic and fermionic parts via Lagrangian-derived interactions. When $R_c \sim \Lambda_{\text{EM}}^{-1}$, $\Lambda_{\text{EM}} \gg m_e$ and $g_4^2 = \frac{3\pi^2 m_e v}{4\gamma^3 R_c^2 e^2 \Lambda_{\text{EM}}}$ are satisfied, the leading term of Bethe-Moller formula is shown to be recovered in the large $R'$ limit. The construction presented here may serve as an alternative approach that uses compactification geometry and medium excitations to determine observable couplings and stopping power. The model intrinsically supports phenomena linked to anisotropy and nonlinear response, as well as gravitational or extra-dimensional effects in laboratory-scale systems via the study of stopping power and particle range.</description>

      <title>Mean free path of photons in relativistic heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic probes, such as photons and dileptons, play a key role in diagnosing the initial temperature of the hot and dense quark-gluon plasma (QGP) matter created in relativistic nuclear collisions at very high energies. This is due to their large mean free path $\lambda$, which allows them to escape the medium without significant interactions. Unlike hadronic particles, which experience multiple scatterings and are affected by the evolving medium, electromagnetic probes carry undistorted information from the initial stages of the expanding system. In this work an attempt has been made to revisit the estimation of mean free paths of photons in QGP phase for a temperature range predicted by hydrodynamics for heavy ion collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV at RHIC and $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV at the LHC. The mean free paths have been estimated for a plasma expanding via (1+1)D and (2+1)D hydrodynamical expansions. For the (1+1)D case, photons with low energy ($E_{\gamma}&lt; 0.2$ GeV) coming from a high temperature ($&gt;250$ MeV) source are found to have shorter mean free path compared to the expansion scale of the system; while the high energy photons have always larger mean free paths. A similar qualitative nature of the mean free path has also been observed for a more realistic (2+1)D hydrodynamic model calculations although the $\lambda$ values are found to be larger on a quantitative scale compared to the (1+1)D case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve the Schr\"odinger equation for few-body systems to obtain the wave function for light nuclear clusters and hypernuclei from d to $\rm ^5_{\Lambda\Lambda}He$ employing realistic nucleon-nucleon and nucleon-$\Lambda$ potentials. We project the solution to the hyperspherical harmonic basis states to obtain the corresponding density matrices and the Wigner densities. The experimental root mean square (rms) radii and binding energies of the different clusters are well reproduced. The Wigner densities obtained will allow to improve the present coalescence approaches to identify clusters, created in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Illuminating Hidden Pulsars: Scintillation-Enhanced Discovery of Two Binary Millisecond Pulsars in M13 with FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted a sensitive acceleration search using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) techniques on full-length and segmented data from 84 observations of the globular cluster M13 with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Employing a low detection threshold (2 $\sigma$) to maximize sensitivity to faint pulsars, here we report the discovery of two binary millisecond pulsars: J1641+3627G (M13G) and J1641+3627H (M13H). Both pulsars were detected during scintillation-brightened states, revealing systems that would otherwise remain undetected. For M13G, we obtained a phase-connected timing solution spanning 6.4 years, identifying it as a black widow system with an orbital period of 0.12 days hosting an extremely low-mass companion ($\sim 9.9\times 10^{-3}~{ M}_\odot$), though no eclipses were observed. M13H, however, shows significant apparent acceleration but was detected in only 2 of 84 observations; its extremely low detection rate currently prevents constraints on orbital parameters or classification.</description>

      <title>Realistic shell model for ordinary muon capture of sd-shell nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report about a study of the ordinary muon capture in nuclei belonging to the sd shell, an electroweak process that occurs with exchange momenta far larger than ordinary beta decays (approximately 100 MeV). Such a characteristic places this transition in an energy range that is consistent with the neutrinoless double-beta decay, and represents an interesting test for nuclear models to support their predictions of the nuclear matrix elements for such an unobserved process. For the first time, the calculations are carried out within the realistic shell model (RSM), namely employing effective shell-model Hamiltonians and decay operators derived from realistic nuclear forces, without resorting to any empirical adjustment of the coupling constants. This is a chapter of a research program that is aimed to assess the realistic shell model in reproducing the observables related to electroweak processes in nuclei, and then to evaluate the reliability of nuclear matrix elements for the neutrinoless double-beta decay that are calculated within this approach. We calculate the partial capture rates for many nuclear systems in the sd-shell region, as well as their spectroscopic properties, and compare the results with the available experimental counterparts. Such a comparison tests the relevance of a microscopic approach to the renormalization of transition operators to reproduce data and provide solid predictions of unknown observables.</description>

      <title>Illuminating Black Hole Shadow with Dark Matter Annihilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16673v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has significantly advanced our ability to study black holes, achieving unprecedented spatial resolution and revealing horizon-scale structures. Notably, these observations feature a distinctive dark shadow--primarily arising from faint jet emissions--surrounded by a bright photon ring. Anticipated upgrades of the EHT promise substantial improvements in dynamic range, enabling deeper exploration of low-background regions, particularly the inner shadow defined by the lensed equatorial horizon. Our analysis shows that observations of these regions transform supermassive black holes into powerful probes for annihilating dark matter, which is expected to accumulate densely in their vicinity. By analyzing the black hole image morphology and performing electron-positron propagation calculations in realistic plasma backgrounds derived from general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we set stringent constraints on dark matter annihilation, requiring contributions below the astrophysical emission. These constraints, derived from both current EHT observations and projections for future upgraded arrays, exclude a substantial region of previously unexplored parameter space and remain robust against astrophysical uncertainties, including black hole spin and plasma temperature variations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phase diagram of QCD may contain a moat regime in a large region of temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\mu\neq0$. A moat regime is characterized by quasiparticle moatons (pions) whose energy is minimal at nonzero spatial momentum. At $\mu\neq 0$, higher mass dimension operators play a critical role in a moat regime. At dimension six, there are nine possible gauge invariant couplings between scalars and photons. For back-to-back dilepton production, only one operator contributes, which significantly enhances production near a moat threshold. This enhancement is an experimental signature of moatons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Standard Model extensions with isodoublet vector-like quarks with standard charges. Their presence induces right-handed charged and neutral currents. We identify minimal sets of independent parameters characterizing these extensions, describe useful weak bases, and provide parameterizations for all quark mixing. We analyze the intricacies of CP violation in such scenarios, finding a complete set of CP-odd invariants for the single doublet case. Crucially, we uncover a connection between weak-basis invariants and effective rephasing invariants involving only standard quarks. These results allow us to explore the phenomenology of doublet vector-like quarks through a rephasing-invariant analysis, with an emphasis on CP violation, including the potential role of these fields in explaining the Cabibbo angle anomalies.</description>

Abstract: The flavor-dependent quark-antiquark contact interactions, induced by vacuum polarization and recently derived for flavor U(3) Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, are articulated with the resulting mixing effects emerging from flavor symmetry breaking in view. The formal effects of the explicit mixing interactions, $G_{i\neq j}$, are detailed firstly for the meson mixing problem without the inclusion of 't Hooft interactions induced by instantons. Secondly, it is shown that these mixings, in the scalar channel of quark-antiquark interactions, might give rise to quark mixing in the gap equations. Sixth order quark-antiquark interactions from vacuum polarization, that break $U_A(1)$ symmetry, also contribute.</description>

Abstract: The physics of quarkonium created in heavy-ion collisions is intrinsically connected to the correlation functions of adjoint chromoelectric fields in quantum chromodynamics. We study such correlation functions in a weak-coupling expansion in a thermal medium. We identify three distinct gauge-invariant correlators, and evaluate them to next-to-leading order. Two of the resulting correlators turn out to be asymmetric. We pinpoint the source of this asymmetry to Matsubara zero modes associated with Wilson lines. The results are shown to agree well with recent lattice calculations at high temperatures.</description>

Abstract: We show that solutions to the strong CP problem based on modular invariance can be extended to incorporate features that appear in string compactifications: quarks with mostly positive modular weights and non-trivial gauge kinetic functions. This requires assuming that singularities and zeroes only appear at special points, such as decompactification limits. We discuss the impact of these assumptions on string gauge unification.</description>

      <title>Comparing effective temperatures in standard and Tsallis distributions from transverse momentum spectra in small collision systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00339v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra of identified light charged hadrons, specifically bosons ($\pi^{\pm}$ and $K^{\pm}$) as well as fermions [$p(\bar p)$], produced in small collision systems, namely deuteron-gold (d+Au) and proton-proton (p+p) collisions at the top energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) with a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, are investigated in this paper. In present study, d+Au collisions are categorized into three centrality classes: central (0--20\%), semi-central (20--40\%), and peripheral (40--100\%) collisions. Various types of distributions, including standard [Bose-Einstein (Fermi-Dirac) and Boltzmann] and Tsallis distributions, are employed to fit the same $p_T$ spectra to derive different effective temperatures denoted as $T_{eff}$. The results indicate that $T_{eff}$ values obtained from Bose-Einstein, Boltzmann, Fermi-Dirac, and Tsallis distributions exhibit systematically a decreasing trend. Meanwhile, these $T_{eff}$ values also show a decreasing trend with a decrease in collision centrality. Furthermore, based on the spectra of given particles, a perfect linear relationship is observed between different pairwise combinations of $T_{eff}$ derived from both Boltzmann and Bose-Einstein (Fermi-Dirac) distributions as well as between Tsallis and Bose-Einstein (Fermi-Dirac) distributions.</description>

      <title>Axion Gamma-Ray Signatures from Quark Matter in Neutron Stars and Gravitational Wave Comparisons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2004.08722v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical model for detecting axions from neutron stars in a QCD phase of quark matter. The axions would be produced from a quark-antiquark pair $u\bar{u}$ or $d\bar{d}$, in loop(s) involving gluons. The chiral anomaly of QCD and the spontaneously broken symmetry are invoked to explain the non-conservation of the axion current. From the coupling form factors, the axion emissivities $\epsilon_a$ can be derived, from which fluxes can be determined. We predict a photon flux, which may be detectable by Fermi LAT, and limits on the QCD mass $m_a$. In this model, axions decay to gamma rays in a 2-photon vertex. We may determine the expected fluxes from the theoretical emissivity. The sensitivity curve from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi LAT) would allow axion mass constraints for neutron stars as low as $m_a \le 10^{-14}$ eV 95$\% C.L.$. Axions could thus be detectable in gamma rays for neutron stars as distant as 100 kpc. A signal from LIGO GWS 170817 could be placed from the NS-NS merger, which gives an upper limit of $m_a \le 10^{-10}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Gauge Theory Bootstrap: Pion amplitudes and low energy parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10772v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the Gauge Theory Bootstrap method proposed in our previous work [arXiv:2309.12402], we compute pion scattering phase shifts for all partial waves with angular momentum $\ell\le 3$ up to 2 GeV and calculate the low energy $\chi$PT coefficients $\bar{\ell}_{1,2,4,6}$. The method looks for the most general S-matrix that matches at low energy the tree level amplitudes of the non-linear sigma model and at high energy, QCD sum rules and form factors. This is a theoretical/numerical calculation that uses as only data the pion mass $m_\pi$, pion decay constant $f_\pi$ and the QCD parameters $N_c=3$, $N_f=2$, $m_q$ and $\alpha_s$. All results are in reasonable agreement with experiment. In particular, we find the $\rho(770)$, $f_2(1270)$ and $\rho(1450)$ resonances. The interplay between the UV gauge theory and low energy pion physics is an example of a general situation where we know the microscopic theory as well as the effective theory of long wavelength fluctuations but we want to solve the strongly coupled dynamics at intermediate energies. The bootstrap builds a bridge between the low and high energy by determining the consistent S-matrix that matches both and provides, in this case, a new direction to understand the strongly coupled physics of gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Inflationary constraints on the moduli-dependent species scale in modular invariant theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a broad class of modular inflation models predicts the emergence of new physics within an energy range of approximately \( 10^{15} \, \mathrm{GeV} \) to \( 10^{17} \, \mathrm{GeV} \). This prediction arises by comparing the moduli-dependent species scale with observational constraints on inflation. Specifically, we illustrate this within the context of \( SL(2, \mathbb{Z}) \)-modular inflation models by re-expressing inflationary observables in terms of the species scale. We further discuss the implications of this approach for generic Calabi-Yau threefolds.</description>

      <title>QED nuclear medium effects at EIC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first calculation of quantum electrodynamics (QED) nuclear medium effects under the experimental conditions of future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) experiments. Our work offers numerical estimates, particularly in the context of inclusive deep inelastic scattering on a $^{208}_{82}\mathrm{Pb}$ nucleus. While prior studies have predominantly focused on elastic scattering, our investigation extends to the more complex scenarios of inelastic processes within a nuclear medium. Our findings suggest that the cross-section corrections due to QED nuclear medium effects could be substantial, reaching or exceeding the level of experimental precision. This work further compares the effects of single re-scattering events with those of multiple re-scatterings, as particles travel the nuclear volume. We estimate the dominant source of the uncertainties associated with our formalism by varying the scale of the atomic physics where the screening of the electric field of the nucleus happens. This calculation not only contributes to the understanding of QED nuclear medium effects, but also offers a path to a more precise extraction of the process-independent non-perturbative structure of nuclei.</description>

      <title>One-Loop Galaxy Bispectrum: Consistent Theory, Efficient Analysis with COBRA, and Implications for Cosmological Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient and accurate pipeline for the analysis of the redshift-space galaxy bispectrum multipoles at one-loop order in effective field theory (EFT). We provide a systematic theory derivation based on power counting, which features the first comprehensive treatment of stochastic EFT contributions -- these are found to significantly improve the match to data. Our computational pipeline utilizes the COBRA technique that expands the linear matter power spectrum over a basis of principal components based on a singular value decomposition, allowing the cosmology dependence to be captured to sub-permille accuracy with just eight templates. This transforms the problem of computing the one-loop EFT bispectrum to a simple tensor multiplication, reducing the computation time to around a second per cosmology with negligible loss of accuracy. Using these tools, we study the cosmological information in the bispectrum by analyzing PTChallenge simulations, whose gigantic volume provides the most powerful test of the one-loop EFT bispectrum so far. We find that the one-loop prediction provides an excellent match to the bispectrum data up to $k_{\rm max}=0.15~h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, as evidenced by the precise recovery of the dark matter density $\omega_\text{cdm}$, Hubble constant $H_0$, and mass fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8$ parameters, and the amplitude of equilateral primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm equil}$. Combined with the power spectrum, the COBRA-based one-loop bispectrum multipoles yield tighter constraints than the tree-level bispectrum monopole, with the posteriors on $\omega_{\text{cdm}}$, $H_0$, and $\sigma_8$ shrinking by 41\%, 25\%, and 19\%, respectively. This suggests that the COBRA-based bispectrum analysis will be an important tool in the interpretation of data from ongoing redshift surveys such as DESI and Euclid.</description>
