      <title>Dark Matter Haloscope with a Disordered Dielectric Absorber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light dark matter candidates such as axions and dark photons generically couple to electromagnetism, yielding dark-matter-to-photon conversion as a key search strategy. In addition to resonant conversion in cavities and circuits, light dark matter bosons efficiently convert to photons on material interfaces, with a broadband power proportional to the total area of these interfaces. In this work, we make use of interface conversion to develop a new experimental dark matter detector design: the disordered dielectric detector. We show that a volume filled with dielectric powder is an efficient, robust, and broadband target for axion-to-photon or dark-photon-to-photon conversion. We perform semi-analytical and numerical studies in small-volume 2D and 3D disordered systems to compute the conversion power as a function of dark matter mass. We also discuss the power gathered onto a sensitive photodetector in terms of the bulk properties of the disordered material, making it possible to characterize the predicted dark-matter-to-photon conversion rate across a wide range of wavelengths. Finally, we propose DPHaSE: the Dielectric Powder Haloscope SNSPD Experiment which is composed of a disordered dielectric target, a veto system, and a photon collection chamber to maximize the coupling between the powder target and a low noise superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD). The projected reach, in the 10 meV-eV mass range, is sensitive to QCD axion-photon couplings and exceeds current constraints on dark photon dark matter by up to 5 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>A Flavor of SO(10) Unification with a Spinor Higgs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Higgs Parity Unification-a realization of $SO(10)$ grand unification based on the Higgs Parity mechanism in which the Standard Model (SM) Higgs resides in a spinor representation. The theory has an intermediate left-right symmetric stage where the $SU(2)_R$ symmetry breaking scale is fixed by the vanishing of the SM Higgs quartic coupling. The strong $CP$ problem is solved by parity. Gauge coupling unification successfully predicts $\alpha_s(M_Z)$ to within 1%. The spinor Higgs naturally leads to a seesaw origin for SM flavor observables. We identify a novel mechanism where large mixing of third generation fermions with additional heavy vector-like fermions accounts for the anarchical nature of the PMNS matrix and the lack of hierarchy in the neutrino mass spectrum, relative to the up-quarks. A fit to quark and lepton masses and mixings, with a minimal parameter set, predicts 1) A testable relation between the top quark mass and $\alpha_s(M_Z)$ which is about $(1-2)\sigma$ from current best fit values, 2) The order of magnitude of the baryon asymmetry of the universe, via leptogenesis from second-generation right-handed neutrino decays. 3) The proton decay and the neutron EDM are likely observable in next generation experiments, and 4) A normal ordered neutrino mass spectrum where $0\nu \beta \beta$ decay and the mass of the lightest neutrino are out of reach of next generation experiments.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the 95 GeV resonance in the Two Higgs Doublet Model: Implications for the Electroweak Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate if the recent mass resonance excesses seen around 95 GeV at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) can be reconciled with a first-order electroweak phase transition. Performing the first large-scale parameter scan of the Two Higgs Doublet model (2HDM) using high-temperature dimensionally reduced effective field theory, we focus on regions of parameter space consistent with interpreting the excess as an additional pseudoscalar state. We find that, in contrast to the Standard Model, the electroweak transition pattern in the 2HDM is generically first-order, proceeding either in a single or in two steps. While transition strengths can reach up to $v_c/T_c \sim 1.3$, the gravitational wave signals lie below the projected reach of future interferometer experiments and are likely insufficient to support successful electroweak baryogenesis.</description>

Abstract: Quarks and leptons, the fundamental building blocks of the subatomic world, manifest in three families - replicas with identical quantum numbers that differ only in their masses. After summarizing the present data, an overview is presented of the main attempts to explain the origin of the observed patterns and trace it back to an as-yet-unknown fundamental principle.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Physics and Astrophysics at Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonzero neutrino masses guarantee new physics and neutrinos are excellent probes of extreme environments in the Universe. The recent collider neutrino experimental program, including FASER$\nu$ and SND@LHC, along with the planned Forward Physics Facility at the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider, is opening a new window into neutrino physics and astrophysics. In this article, we review recent achievements and prospects of collider neutrino experiments, including key achievements such as the first measurements of collider neutrino interactions at unprecedented energies and the exploration of new physics scenarios, like dark matter candidates, sterile neutrinos, and non-standard neutrino interactions. For concreteness, we will focus on the significant scientific opportunities presented by the Forward Physics Facility, which will enable precision measurements of neutrino cross sections and proton structure at low parton momentum fraction. Furthermore, collider neutrino studies will substantially reduce systematic uncertainties in calculating atmospheric neutrino fluxes, thereby improving astrophysical neutrino observations as well as advancing our understanding of cosmic-ray interactions.</description>

      <title>Chiral-odd generalized parton distributions in the large-$N_{c}$ limit of QCD: Next-to-leading-order contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nucleon's chiral-odd generalized parton distribution functions (GPDs) in the large-$N_c$ limit of QCD. Extending previous work on the leading-order contribution in the $1/N_c$ expansion, we focus on the next-to-leading-order contributions and provide a complete set of flavor-singlet and flavor-non-singlet chiral-odd GPDs. This study includes the derivation of the spin-flavor structure of the baryon matrix element of the chiral-odd operator, the proof of the polynomiality property and associated sum rules, and numerical estimates based on the gradient expansion. The spin-flavor structure of the nucleon matrix element is interpreted through a multipole expansion in the transverse momentum transfer, leading to the definition of multipole mean-field GPDs. Using these GPDs as the basis of our analysis, we take their $m$-th moments and demonstrate the polynomiality property within the mean-field framework, making use of discrete symmetries in the proof. In particular, the first moments ($m = 1$) of the GPDs are related to the nucleon tensor form factors, as generally required. By performing a gradient expansion, we compute the chiral-odd GPDs and present numerical estimates. Our results show good agreement with lattice QCD predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a hitherto unknown class of RG-stable relations between parameters of bosonic field theories have been identified and dubbed as the r0 or 'GOOFy' symmetries. Here, 1-loop properties of the r0 invariant 2-Higgs Doublet Model and a minimal symmetric model are discussed. It is concluded that the symmetry is present at the 1-loop provided the UV cut-off squared transforms non-trivially under r0. The minimal model requires the presence of two real fields.</description>

      <title>Higgs pole inflation with loop corrections in light of ACT results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Coleman-Weinberg potential for the inflaton in the pole inflation scenarios such as the Higgs pole inflation and the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) pole inflation. The loop corrections stem from the Standard Model particles and extra singlet scalar fields in the former case, making the quartic coupling for the Higgs inflaton modified by the inflaton-dependent power corrections during inflation. We also obtain similar power corrections to the quartic coupling for the PQ inflaton, depending on the realizations of the PQ symmetry in KSVZ and DFSZ models. We show that the loop corrections shift the spectral index in the pole inflation to a larger value in favor of the ACT results, while being compatible with the bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. For a positive one-loop beta function for the inflaton quartic coupling (namely, $b_1&gt;0$), a sub-dominant contribution from the two-loop corrections can be accommodated. On the other hand, if the one-loop beta function for the inflaton coupling is negative (namely, $b_1&lt;0$), we need sizable contributions from two-loops that are larger than the one-loop corrections due to the ACT results.</description>

      <title>Multifaceted Supercooling: From PTA to LIGO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supercooled phase transitions, as predicted, e.g., in near-conformal and confining extensions of the Standard Model (SM), are established sources of strong stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs). In this work, we investigate another facet of such transitions: their significant and largely uncharted impact on gravitational wave spectra originating from independent cosmological sources. Focusing on gravitational waves produced by a metastable cosmic string network, we show that an intervening supercooled phase, initiating thermal inflation, can reshape and suppress the high-frequency part of the spectrum. This mechanism reopens regions of string parameter space previously excluded by LIGO's null results, while remaining compatible with the nanohertz SGWB signal reported by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). The resulting total spectrum typically exhibits a dual-component structure, sourced by both string decay and the phase transition itself, rendering the scenario observationally distinctive. We systematically classify the viable parameter space and identify regions accessible to upcoming detectors such as Advanced LIGO, LISA, and ET.</description>

      <title>SCET sum rules for $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda \ell^+\ell^-$, $\Lambda \gamma$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct light-cone sum rules for various types of effective form factors in the $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda \ell^+\ell^-$ and $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda \gamma$ decays by analyzing vacuum-to-$\Lambda_b$ (or $\gamma^\ast$-to-$\Lambda_b$) correlation functions with the light $\Lambda$-baryon interpolating current. These form factors, defined via hadronic matrix elements within soft-collinear effective theory (SCET), enter the next-to-leading-power QCD factorization formulas for large-recoil transitions. Implementing the perturbative matching from $\text{SCET}_\text{I}$ to heavy quark effective theory, we determine the hard-collinear functions at next-to-leading-order accuracy. Based on light-cone sum rule predictions for the $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda$ form factors, we compute the $q^2$-dependent differential branching fraction, forward-backward asymmetry and dilepton longitudinal polarization fraction for $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda \ell^+\ell^-$ decay, as well as the branching fraction for $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda \gamma$ decay.</description>

      <title>Probing Neutral Triple Gauge Couplings via $ZZ$ Production at $e^+e^-$ Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral triple gauge couplings (nTGCs) first arise from the dimension-8 operators of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), rather than the dimension-4 SM Lagrangian and dimension-6 SMEFT operators, opening up a unique window for probing new physics at the dimension-8 level. In this work, we formulate the nTGC form factors of $ZZV^*$ ($V=Z,\gamma$) that are compatible with the spontaneous breaking of the SU(2)$\otimes$U(1) electroweak gauge symmetry and consistently match the dimension-8 nTGC operators in the broken phase. We study the sensitivities for probing both the $ZZV^*$ form factors and the corresponding new physics scales through $ZZ$ production (with visible/invisible fermionic $Z$ decays) at high energy $e^+e^-$ colliders including CEPC, FCC-ee, ILC and CLIC. In particular, we identify the dimension-8 operator that contributes to the pure triple $Z$ boson coupling $ZZZ^*$ alone, but not the mixed $ZZ\gamma^*$ coupling. We further study the correlations between probes of the $ZZZ^*$ and $ZZ\gamma^*$ couplings. We show that angular distributions of the final-state fermions can play key roles in suppressing the SM backgrounds and that the sensitivities can be improved by using polarized $e^\mp$ beams. We demonstrate that machine learning is advantageous for handling the 4-body final states from $ZZ$ decays and improves significantly the sensitivity reaches of probes of nTGCs in $e^+e^-$ collisions. We find that nTGC new physics scales can be probed up to the multi-TeV scale at the proposed $e^+e^-$ colliders.</description>

      <title>Testing a 95 GeV Scalar at the CEPC with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several possible excesses around $95\,$GeV hint at an additional light scalar beyond the Standard Model. We examine the capability of the CEPC to test this hypothesis in the Higgsstrahlung channel $e^{+}e^{-}\!\to ZS$ with $Z\!\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ and $S\!\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$. Full detector simulation shows that the optimal center-of-mass energy to study the 95 GeV light scalar is 210 GeV. A deep neural network classifier reduces the luminosity required for discovery by half. At $L=500$ fb$^{-1}$, the CEPC can probe signal strengths down to $\mu_{\tau\tau}^{ZS} = 0.116\ (0.150)$ for $\sqrt{s}=210\ (240)$ GeV. A complete $5\sigma$ coverage of all surviving samples in the flipped N2HDM requires $L = 0.9\ (1.4)$ ab$^{-1}$ at the corresponding energies. These results establish a 210 GeV run, augmented by machine-learning selection, as the most efficient strategy to confirm or refute the 95 GeV excess at future lepton colliders.</description>

      <title>NLO QCD effects on angular observables in $e^-p \to e^-(\nu_e)Hj$ in presence of non-standard $HVV$ couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The single Higgs production in neutral-current (NC) and charged-current (CC) processes at an electron-proton ($ep$) collider is a useful channel to probe new physics effects in the Higgs coupling to vector boson ($HVV$). In this context, observables sensitive to non-standard couplings previously studied at leading order require improved theoretical precision through the inclusion of radiative corrections. In this work, we present a fully differential Higgs plus one jet production at next-to-leading-order (NLO) accuracy in QCD for both the NC and CC processes. For the proposed Large Hadron electron Collider (LHeC) configuration, with a 60~GeV electron beam and a 7~TeV proton beam, the total cross sections receive modest corrections with significantly reduced scale uncertainties. We find that in several kinematic distributions which are relevant to the analysis of $HVV$ couplings, the NLO K-factors are not flat. Within the Standard Model, the polar angle of the electron (for NC) and the azimuthal angular correlation (for both NC and CC processes) receive maximum corrections in the range of 3-4\% in certain bins. We also compute NLO QCD corrections in the presence of non-standard $HVV$ interactions. The corrections in the azimuthal angular correlations are similar to the standard model predictions. For the polar angle of the electron, the corrections are sensitive to the nature of the $HVV$ coupling.</description>

      <title>Scaling solutions for current-carrying cosmic string networks. II. Biased solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The charge-velocity-dependent one-scale model is an extension of the canonical velocity-dependent one-scale model which explicitly incorporates additional degrees of freedom on the string worldsheet, such as arbitrary currents and charges, expected in physically realistic models. A previous paper [Pimenta and Martins, Phys. Rev. D 110, 023540 (2024)] started an in-depth classification of its possible asymptotic scaling solutions, with the goal of identifying distinguishing features which may be tested against numerical simulations or future observations. This earlier analysis restricted itself to unbiased solutions; in the present one we relax this assumption, allowing for the possibility of energy loss biases between the bare string and the charge/current, or between the charge and the current themselves. We find additional scaling solutions, some of which are parametric extensions of the unbiased ones while others are new scaling branches which do not exist in the unbiased case. Overall it remains the case that there are three broad classes of solutions, mainly depending on the balance between the expansion rate and the available energy loss mechanisms. Our results enable a quantitative calibration of the model, using forthcoming high-resolution numerical simulations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a formulation of relativistic spin hydrodynamics with totally antisymmetric spin tensors that satisfy the Frenkel-Mathisson-Pirani condition. In our proposed spin hydrodynamics, the second law of thermodynamics is fulfilled by the spin-induced corrections in the heat flow, the viscous tensor, and the antisymmetric part of the energy-momentum tensor. These corrections are interpreted as the inverse spin Hall effect and the anomalous Hall effect in the nonrelativistic limit. We show that our evolution equation for the spin density is interpreted as an extension of the Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation known in relativistic many-body systems, including the Thomas precession term, the spin-rotation term, and new coupling terms between spin and hydrodynamic variables.</description>

      <title>Updated constraints on the primordial power spectrum at sub-Mpc scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primordial power spectrum of matter density perturbations contains highly valuable information about new fundamental physics, in particular cosmological inflation, but is only very weakly constrained observationally for small cosmological scales $k\gtrsim 3\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. We derive novel constraints, $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}(k)\lesssim 5\cdot10^{-6}$ over a large range of such scales, from the formation of ultracompact minihalos in the early universe. Unlike most existing constraints of this type, our results do not rest on the assumption that dark matter can annihilate into ordinary matter.</description>

      <title>Dark Classification Matters: Searching for Primordial Black Holes with LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present projected constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) as a constituent of dark matter, based on microlensing observations from the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. We use a catalogue of microlensing light curves simulated with Rubin Observatory's OpSims to demonstrate that competitive constraints crucially rely on minimising the false positive rate (FPR) of the classification algorithm. We propose the Bayesian information criterion and a Boosted Decision Tree as effective discriminators and compare their derived efficiency and FPR to a more standard $\chi^2$-test.</description>

      <title>Hybrid thermalization in the large $N$ limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semi-holography provides a formulation of dynamics in gauge theories involving both weakly self-interacting (perturbative) and strongly self-interacting (non-perturbative) degrees of freedom. These two subsectors interact via their effective metrics and sources, while the full local energy-momentum tensor is conserved in the physical background metric. In the large $N$ limit, the subsectors have their individual entropy currents, and so the full system can reach a pseudo-equilibrium state in which each subsector has a different physical temperature.
  We first complete the proof that the global thermal equilibrium state, where both subsectors have the \textit{same} physical temperature, can be defined in consistency with the principles of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Particularly, we show that the global equilibrium state is the unique state with maximum entropy in the microcanonical ensemble. Furthermore, we show that in the large $N$ limit, a \textit{typical} non-equilibrium state of the full isolated system relaxes to the global equilibrium state when the average energy density is large compared to the scale set by the inter-system coupling. We discuss quantum statistical perspectives.</description>

      <title>New bounds on Memory Burdened Primordial Black Holes from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses below $10^9\,\rm{g}$ are typically assumed to have negligible cosmological impact due to their rapid evaporation via Hawking radiation. However, the 'memory burden' effect, which is a quantum suppression of PBH evaporation, can dramatically alter their decay dynamics. In this work, we revisit early-Universe constraints on ultralight PBHs in this mass range, demonstrating that memory burden significantly alters previous constraints. We compute new cosmological bounds from BBN that strongly limit the presence of ultralight PBHs in the early Universe. We report that the PBHs in the mass range $10^0$-$10^2\,\rm{g}$ for $k=2$ are unconstrained by observations.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing electron-neutrino lepton number crossings in core-collapse supernovae: a comparison of methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast neutrino flavor conversion may impact the explosion mechanism and nucleosynthesis in core-collapse supernovae. A necessary condition for fast flavor conversion is the presence of crossings in the angular distribution of the electron-neutrino lepton number (ELN crossing). Because of the computational costs, flavor-dependent angular distributions are not computed by the vast majority of state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations; instead, angular distributions are reconstructed employing approximate methods in post-processing. In this work, we evaluate the performance of four methods adopted to diagnose the existence of ELN crossings. For selected post-bounce times, we extract the fluid and thermodynamic properties from spherically symmetric supernova simulations for an $18.6 M_\odot$ progenitor, testing cases with and without muons as well as with and without mixing-length treatment of proto-neutron star convection. We compare the occurrence of crossings in the angular distributions obtained by solving the Boltzmann equations with those in distributions reconstructed from angular moments of our Boltzmann solutions by using the maximum entropy and Minerbo schemes, and also with crossings identified via a polynomial weighting function applied to the angular moments. Our results show that the polynomial method and the Minerbo closure scheme have severe limitations. The maximum entropy approach captures most of the forward crossings, although it fails to reproduce or misidentifies crossings in a subset of our models. These findings highlight the need for robust modeling of the neutrino angular properties in order to assess the impact of flavor conversion on the supernova mechanism.</description>

      <title>Test-time Scaling Techniques in Theoretical Physics -- A Comparison of Methods on the TPBench Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in complex reasoning, and test-time scaling techniques can enhance their performance with comparably low cost. Many of these methods have been developed and evaluated on mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as AIME. This paper investigates whether the lessons learned from these benchmarks generalize to the domain of advanced theoretical physics. We evaluate a range of common test-time scaling methods on the TPBench physics dataset and compare their effectiveness with results on AIME. To better leverage the structure of physics problems, we develop a novel, symbolic weak-verifier framework to improve parallel scaling results. Our empirical results demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms existing test-time scaling approaches on TPBench. We also evaluate our method on AIME, confirming its effectiveness in solving advanced mathematical problems. Our findings highlight the power of step-wise symbolic verification for tackling complex scientific problems.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Gravitational Memory in the Post-Minkowskian Expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first computation of the nonlinear gravitational memory waveform for the scattering of two compact objects in General Relativity at leading order in the post-Minkowskian expansion. We use the scattering-amplitudes-based representation of the gravitational waveform, which naturally expresses the nonlinear memory as the contribution of soft gravitons emitted by the gravitational waves themselves. We perform the calculation by applying a multipolar decomposition to the waveform and using the reverse unitarity method to obtain explicit exact-in-velocity predictions. We validate the results by calculating the corresponding velocity-expanded post-Newtonian multipoles, finding perfect agreement. Our results complete the knowledge of the gauge-invariant non-analytic-in-frequency part of the $\mathcal{O}(G^3)$ multipolar waveform, thus providing a useful benchmark for future calculations of this quantity.</description>

      <title>Exploring Fermionic Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars in the Light of Astrophysical Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied the properties of dark matter admixed-neutron stars (DMANS), considering fermionic dark matter (DM) that interacts gravitationally with hadronic matter (HM). Using relativistic mean-field equations of state (EoSs) for both components, we solved the two-fluid Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff (TOV) equations to determine neutron star (NS) properties assuming that DM is confined within the stellar core. For hadronic matter, we employed realistic EoSs derived from low energy nuclear physics experiments, heavy-ion collision data, and NS observations. To constrain key dark matter parameters such as particle mass, mass fraction, and the coupling to mass ratio, we applied Bayesian inference, incorporating various astrophysical data including mass, radii, and NICER mass-radius distributions for PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0030+0451. Additionally, we explored the influence of high-density HM EoSs and examined the impact of stiffer hadronic EoSs, excluding the vector meson self-interaction term. Our findings indicate that current astrophysical observations primarily constrain the dark matter fraction, while providing limited constraints on the particle mass or coupling. However, the dark matter fraction is largely insensitive to how astrophysical observations or uncertainties in the high-density EoS are incorporated. Instead, it is predominantly determined by the stiffness of the hadronic EoS at high densities, with stiffer hadronic EoSs yielding a higher dark matter mass fraction. Therefore, we conclude that the dark matter fraction plays a crucial role in shaping the properties of DMANS. Future investigations incorporating more realistic EoSs and astrophysical observations of other compact objects may provide deeper insights into dark matter.</description>

      <title>Phantom Crossing and Oscillating Dark Energy with $F(R)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we shall consider how a dynamical oscillating and phantom crossing dark energy era can be realised in the context of $F(R)$ gravity. We approach the topic from a theoretical standpoint, considering all the conditions that may lead to a consistent phantom crossing behaviour and separately how the $F(R)$ gravity context may realise an oscillating dark energy era. Apart from our qualitative considerations, we study quantitatively two $F(R)$ gravity dark energy models, which are viable cosmologically and also exhibit simultaneously phantom crossing behaviour and oscillating dark energy. We consider these models by numerically solving the field equations using appropriate statefinder parameters engineered for dark energy studies. As we show, $F(R)$ provides a natural extension of Einstein's general relativity, which can naturally realise a transition from a phantom era to a quintessential era, a feature supported by recent observational data, without resorting to phantom scalar fields to realise the phantom evolution.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Generation and Detection in Gravitational Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the production and detection of gravitational waves (GWs) within the framework of Gravitational Quantum Field Theory (GQFT). In this theory, GWs exhibit five propagating modes: one scalar, two vector, and two tensor modes. Unlike General Relativity, the gravitational field equations in GQFT involve both symmetric and antisymmetric tensors, governed by their respective energy-momentum tensors, both of which can act as sources for GW radiation. By solving the linearized gravitational equations, we derive general analytic expressions for the different GW degrees of freedom. Our analysis reveals that the symmetric energy-momentum tensor generates scalar and tensor GWs through the trace and traceless parts of the quadrupole moment, respectively. In contrast, the antisymmetric stress tensor induces scalar and vector GWs with enhanced coupling strengths. We examine two illustrative examples: a black hole binary with a slightly elliptical orbit, which produces scalar GWs, and a neutron star binary where one component has a net spin aligned with its velocity, leading to vector GW emission. Finally, we study the detectability of these GW polarizations by analyzing their signatures in GW detectors. Our findings indicate that current observatories can detect both scalar and tensor modes, while a newly designed detector would be required to probe vector GWs.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound of QCD matter at chiral crossover</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on a generalized Beth-Uhlenbeck approach to thermodynamics of QCD motivated by cluster decomposition we present a unified equation of state of hot strongly interacting matter and analyze its properties in a wide range of temperatures. The hadrons are treated as color singlet multiquark clusters in medium with a background gluon field in the Polyakov gauge. The confining aspect of QCD is accounted for by the Polyakov loop mechanism and by a large vacuum quark mass motivated by a confining density functional approach. We demonstrate that an abrupt switching between hadronic and partonic degrees of freedom, which is one of striking manifestations of dynamical restoration of chiral symmetry, is accompanied by a smooth behavior of entropy density at chiral crossover. Individual contributions of different components of strongly interacting matter to its speed of sound are analyzed for the first time. It is shown that restoration of chiral symmetry drives speed of sound of hadron gas to negative values, manifesting its mechanical instability and being in a strike disagreements with the lattice QCD data. Accounting for the partonic excitations naturally resolves this contradiction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse DESI BAO, CMB, and supernova data to explore the physical origin of the DESI indication for dynamical dark energy. Beyond the standard CPL parametrization, we explore truncated alternatives and quintessence models. We conclude that there is compelling evidence for dark energy to be decaying in the late universe, but the evidence for a phantom behaviour is less significant. Models without phantom behaviour are compatible with the data at the $2\sigma$ CL. Furthermore, we examine a concrete quintessence scenario with a Higgs-like potential, allowing for a direct comparison with parametrized approaches and testing its consistency with current observations. This framework enables a broader investigation of late-time cosmic evolution and reveals a $93.8\%$ preference for a future transition into an anti-de Sitter space, which may ultimately lead to a cosmological collapse of our Universe.</description>

      <title>Composite Dark Matter and Neutrino Masses from a Light Hidden Sector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09719v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of models in which the particle that constitutes dark matter arises as a composite state of a strongly coupled hidden sector. The hidden sector interacts with the Standard Model through the neutrino portal, allowing the relic abundance of dark matter to be set by annihilation into final states containing neutrinos. The coupling to the hidden sector also leads to the generation of neutrino masses through the inverse seesaw mechanism, with composite hidden sector states playing the role of the singlet neutrinos. We focus on the scenario in which the hidden sector is conformal in the ultraviolet, and the compositeness scale lies at or below the weak scale. We construct a holographic realization of this framework based on the Randall-Sundrum setup and explore the implications for experiments. We determine the current constraints on this scenario from direct and indirect detection, lepton flavor violation and collider experiments and explore the reach of future searches. We show that in the near future, direct detection experiments and searches for $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion will be able to probe new parameter space. At colliders, dark matter can be produced in association with composite singlet neutrinos via Drell Yan processes or in weak decays of hadrons. We show that current searches at the Large Hadron Collider have only limited sensitivity to this new production channel and we comment on how the reconstruction of the singlet neutrinos can potentially expand the reach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07987v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study real-time nucleation in perturbative high-temperature quantum field theories. Specifically, we incorporate the evolution of thermally fluctuating plasma driven out of equilibrium by nucleation. This plasma forms the thermal bath for the nucleating bubbles, and its off-equilibrium dynamics backreact on the bubbles, modifying the nucleation rate. Utilizing kinetic Boltzmann descriptions for the plasma particles, we derive that the nucleation rate in high-temperature quantum field theories is described by Langer's rate formula with effects arising from the off-equilibrium plasma, unaccounted for in Linde's thermal rate. Importantly, we establish a connection to equilibrium computations of nucleation rates, particularly with the effective field theory approach, showing that they correctly capture the leading parts of the logarithm of the rate. We also show that the dominant modifications to the nucleation rate from a light bosonic quantum field arise from its corresponding long-wavelength classical modes, rather than the associated hard particles. This work provides a foundation for further studies of off-equilibrium effects in nucleation rates for realistic Standard Model extensions.</description>

      <title>Complete Next-to-Leading Order QCD Corrections to $ZZ$ Production in Gluon Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the complete NLO QCD corrections to loop-induced $gg \rightarrow ZZ$ production including full top-quark mass effects. The two-loop virtual corrections are obtained by combining analytic results for the massless, Higgs-mediated, and one-loop factorizable contributions with numerically computed amplitudes containing the top-quark mass. We show that the choice of subtraction scheme for the virtual contribution impacts the precision with which the virtual contribution must be evaluated in order to obtain sufficiently precise phenomenological predictions. For direct production through a massive top-quark loop, we observe that the relative NLO corrections are large. The direct massive and Higgs-mediated contributions individually increase relative to the massless production at high diboson invariant mass, but interfere destructively with each other. At the Large Hadron Collider, the NLO corrections to the gluon channel give a sizable contribution to the $pp \to ZZ+X$ cross-section at N${}^3$LO.</description>

      <title>Probing leptophobic dark sector with a pseudoscalar portal in the NA64 experiment at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the possibility of discovering a light pseudoscalar particle $a$, axion-like particle (ALP), interacting mainly with quarks using the electron and photon scattering reaction chain $e + Z \rightarrow e + \gamma + Z$; $\gamma + Z \rightarrow a + Z$ on nuclei in the NA64 experiment at the CERN SPS. We consider the mixing of ALP with light pseudoscalar mesons $P = \pi, \eta, \eta'$ with taking into account of the ALP mass explicitly breaking the Peccei-Quinn symmetry. It could open invisible channels of ALP decaying into dark fermion matter by analogy with $P$ mesons decays. New bounds on the coupling strengths of the ALP with quarks and of pseudoscalar mesons with dark fermions are obtained by using existing upper bounds on invisible decay modes of $P$s including those recently derived by NA64. We also study a scenario when the $a$ plays the role of a messenger in the communication between our world and the dark sector. New upper limits on axion couplings with quarks and its mixing parameters with $\pi, \eta, \eta'$ mesons are established.</description>

      <title>First Search for Ultralight Dark Matter Using a Magnetically Levitated Particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform the first search for ultralight dark matter using a magnetically levitated particle. A sub-millimeter permanent magnet is levitated in a superconducting trap with a measured force sensitivity of $0.2\,\mathrm{fN/\sqrt{Hz}}$. We find no evidence of a signal and derive limits on dark matter coupled to the difference between baryon and lepton number, $B - L$, in the mass range $(1.10360 \text{ - } 1.10485) \times 10^{-13}\,\mathrm{eV} / c^2$. Our most stringent limit on the coupling strength is $g_{B - L} \lesssim 2.98 \times 10^{-21}$. We propose the POLONAISE (Probing Oscillations using Levitated Objects for Novel Accelerometry in Searches of Exotic physics) experiment, featuring short-, medium-, and long-term upgrades that will give us leading sensitivity in a wide mass range and demonstrating the promise of this novel quantum sensing technology in the hunt for dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09521v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An extension of the Standard Model is proposed, where the Higgs field is valued in the complex projective plane ${\mathbb{CP}}^2$, rather than ${\mathbb{C}}^2$. Its geometry is consistent with $U(2) \simeq (SU(2) \times U(1))/ \mathbb{Z}_2$ electroweak gauge symmetry. The leading terms in the Lagrangian, beyond those of the Standard Model, are much more tightly constrained than in general SMEFTs, and the custodial $SO(4)$ symmetry of the Higgs sector is mildly broken. The predicted tree-level deviations from Standard Model phenomenology depend on a single large mass parameter $M$. Current experimental data imply that $M$ is a few TeV or larger.</description>

      <title>The Sivers asymmetry of vector meson production in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transverse single-spin asymmetry for $\rho^0$ production in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering was recently reported by the COMPASS Collaboration. Using the Sivers functions extracted from pion and kaon productions, we perform a calculation of the Sivers asymmetry within the transverse momentum dependent factorization. Our results are consistent with the COMPASS data, confirming the universality of the Sivers functions within current experimental uncertainties. While various global analyses of Sivers functions can equally well describe the current data, we obtain very different predictions on the Sivers asymmetry of $\rho$ and $K^*$ productions at electron-ion colliders, which therefore are expected to provide further constraints.</description>

      <title>Exclusive $\eta$ production in proton-proton collisions at energies available at the GSI Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cross sections for the $p p \to p p \eta$ reaction are evaluated at energies relevant for the HADES, PANDA, and SIS100 experiments at GSI-FAIR. Consideration includes the $\eta$-bremsstrahlung mechanism involving intermediate proton exchange via the $\pi^{0}$, $\eta$, $\rho^{0}$, and $\omega$ exchanges and the mechanism involving the nucleon resonances $N(1535)$, $N(1650)$, $N(1710)$, and $N(1880)$ excited via the pseudoscalar- and/or vector-meson exchanges, depending on the model. The role of the $\omega \omega$- and $\rho^{0} \rho^{0}$-fusion processes with the reggeized vector-meson exchanges is also discussed. The calculation is done in an effective Lagrangian approach. To determine the parameters of the model, the $\gamma p \to \eta p$ and $\pi^{-} p \to \eta n$ reactions are studied and the results are then compared with the Crystal Ball and CLAS data. For the $p p \to p p \eta$ reaction, the model results are compared with the energy dependence of the cross section measured far from the threshold and with the differential distributions $d\sigma/d\cos{\theta_{\eta}}$ and $d\sigma/dp_{\eta}$ measured by the DISTO Collaboration. The comparison shows that the $N(1535)$ resonance is the dominant contribution and that other contributions are also important due to interference effects. Assuming that the $\rho$ exchange is the dominant resonant excitation process, the model is able to describe the available data, e.g., it reproduces the shape of the angular distributions measured by the DISTO Collaboration. Predictions are given for the HADES experiment at center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 3.46$ GeV, which can be verified in the near future, and for planned PANDA and SIS100 experiments at higher energies.</description>

      <title>$Z_c(3900)$ in a hadronic molecule and a triangle singularity approach at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19374v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying exotic hadrons is a challenge against the conventional quark model, providing us with a good platform to deepen our understanding of the strong interaction. An inclusive study of the exotic hadrons in vacuum and at finite temperature is an intriguing approach to shed light on their nature. As a first step, we study the $Z_c(3900)$ in both the $D\bar{D}^\ast$ hadronic molecular and the triangle singularity pictures, and discuss the behaviors of $Z_c(3900)$ at finite temperature in these two different pictures. As a result, we show the properties that its mass becomes smaller and its width becomes larger when the temperature increases, which are seen commonly in the hadronic molecular picture and in the triangle singularity picture. The enhanced widths in hot medium indicate that the $Z_c(3900)$ will be dissociated at a sufficiently high temperature. This feature is also reflected by a decrease of the effective couplings in the hadronic molecular picture. It is concluded that, not only in vacuum but also in hot medium, the behaviors of $Z_{c}(3900)$ are similar in the two different interpretations of $Z_c(3900)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the prospects of probing weak-scale higgsinos through electroweak precision measurements at a future $e^+ e^-$ collider. In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, higgsinos mix with winos and binos after electroweak symmetry breaking, forming charginos and neutralinos. These states contribute to electroweak precision observables, which can be measured with high accuracy at future $e^+ e^-$ colliders. Their contributions depend on the mixing structure, as evidenced by the generation of the oblique parameters $\hat{S}$ and $\hat{T}$, in addition to the $W$ and $Y$ parameters, which arise even in the absence of mixing. We demonstrate that higgsinos with masses up to $\sim 500~\mathrm{GeV}$ can be probed through future electroweak precision experiments, highlighting their significance in probing weak-scale supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>Primordial neutrinos fade to gray: constraints from cosmological observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of potentially large distortions of the relic neutrino spectra on cosmological observables. To that end, we consider a phenomenological model of "gray" spectral distributions, described by a single parameter, which generalizes the traditional $y$-distortions to possibly large negative values. Implementing these distortions in the primordial nucleosynthesis code PRIMAT, we can constrain the distortion parameter along with the presence of extra radiation, exploiting the complementarity of big bang nucleosynthesis and cosmic microwave background measurements to disentangle gravitational and non-thermal effects. These constraints rule out a distortion where more than $\sim 1/2$ of the neutrinos' energy density is replaced by dark radiation. Nonetheless, we find that large distortions, accompanied with extra radiation, are allowed-and even slightly preferred in some cases-by current cosmological observations. As this scenario would require substantial modifications to the physics of neutrino decoupling in the early Universe, these observational constraints call for a renewed attention on the possibility of large deviations from the standard cosmological model in the neutrino sector.</description>

      <title>Central exclusive production of $\eta$ and $\eta'$ mesons in diffractive proton-proton collisions at the LHC within the tensor-pomeron approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study of the central exclusive production (CEP) of $\eta$ and $\eta'(958)$ mesons in diffractive proton-proton collisions at high energies. The amplitudes, including pomeron and $f_{2 \mathbb{R}}$ reggeon exchanges, are calculated within the tensor-pomeron model. Absorption effects are also taken into account at the amplitude level. We fit some undetermined model parameters (coupling constants and cutoff parameters in form factors) to the WA102 experimental data and then make predictions for the LHC energy $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. Both, total cross sections and several differential distributions are presented. For $pp \to pp \eta$, we find an upper limit for the total cross section of 2.5 $\mu$b for pseudorapidity of the $\eta$ meson $|\eta_{M}| &lt; 1$ and 5.6 $\mu$b for $2 &lt; \eta_{M} &lt; 5$. For $pp \to pp \eta'$, we predict the cross section to be in the range of 0.3-0.7 $\mu$b for pseudorapidity of the $\eta'$ meson $|\eta_{M}| &lt; 1$ and 0.9-2.1 $\mu$b for $2 &lt; \eta_{M} &lt; 5$. This opens the possibility to study diffractive production of pseudoscalar mesons in experiments at the LHC. We discuss if there are arguments from SU(3)-flavor symmetry which would forbid pomeron-pomeron fusion giving an $\eta$ meson. In our opinion such arguments do not exist. We also consider CEP of the pseudoscalars $\eta$ and $\eta'(958)$ and the pseudovector meson $f_{1}(1285)$ in diffractive proton-proton collisions in a theory with a scalar pomeron. We show that none of these particles can be produced in this way in the scalar-pomeron theory. Thus, experimental observation of any of these particles in the above CEP processes at the LHC would give striking evidence against a scalar character of the pomeron.</description>

      <title>Deconstructing resonant Higgs pair production at the LHC: effects of coloured and neutral scalars in the NMSSM test case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study resonant production of pairs of Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs bosons, in the presence of new neutral Higgs states together with new coloured scalars (stops or sbottoms) in loops within the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric SM (NMSSM). This is used as a test case to prove that the Large Hadron Collider has sensitivity to a variety of effects stemming from interferences between resonant (heavy) Higgs diagrams and/or among these and non-resonant topologies involving loops of both tops and stops. These effects can alter significantly the naive description of individual $s$-channel Breit-Wigner resonances, leading to distortions of the latter which, on the one hand, may mask their presence but, on the other hand, could enable one to extract features of the underlying new physics scenario. This last aspect is made possible through a decomposition of the $gg\to hh$ signal process into all its amplitude components, each of which has a well-defined coupling structure. Ultimately, such effects can be traced back to the relevant Feynman diagrams and can enable a detailed interpretation of this process. To illustrate this, we introduce various Benchmark Points that exhibit potentially observable features during the current and/or upcoming runs of the LHC in one or more of the three customary di-Higgs decay channels: $b\bar bb\bar b$, $b\bar b \tau^+\tau^-$ and $b\bar b\gamma\gamma$.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Spike surrounding Supermassive Black Holes Binary and the Nanohertz Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The NANOGrav, PPTA, EPTA, CPTA and MPTA collaborations have reported compelling evidence for the existence of the Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background (SGWB). This inferred background's amplitude and frequency spectrum align closely with the astrophysical predictions for a signal originating from the population of supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. Considering these findings, we explore the possibility of detecting dark matter (DM) spikes surrounding SMBHs, which could alter the gravitational-wave waveform and influence the SGWB. We show that the evolution of SMBH binaries, driven by both gravitational radiation and the dynamic friction of the surrounding DM spike, presents observable effects in the nHz frequency domain of the SGWB. We also employ the Bayesian inference method to fit the SGWB spectra from the NANOGrav, EPTA, and PPTA. The model with DM spike improves the fittings to the former two data sets. The spike slope $\gamma_{\rm sp}$ is slightly smaller than 1, which may suggest that the spike is flattened during the inspiral of the SMBHBs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a class of quantum field theories with relativistic Luttinger fermions and local self-interaction in scalar channels. For an understanding of possible low-energy phases, we first classify the set of mass terms arising from scalar fermion bilinears. For large flavor numbers, we show that each of our models features a coupling branch in which the theory is asymptotically free. In order to address the long-range behavior, we use mean-field theory which is exact in the limit of large flavor numbers. We identify two models which undergo dimensional transmutation, interconnecting the asymptotically free high-energy regime with an ordered low-energy phase sustaining a vacuum condensate. We also study the analytic structure of the Luttinger-fermionic propagator in the various possible gapped phases.</description>

      <title>A Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield bound with a first-order system in the $2D$ Gross-Pitaevskii equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) bound for the Gross-Pitaevskii equations in two spatial dimensions is presented. The energy can be bounded from below in terms of the combination of two boundary terms, one related to the vorticity (but ``dressed'' by the condensate profile) and the second to the ``skewness'' of the configurations. The bound is saturated by configurations that satisfy a system of two first-order partial differential equations. When such a BPS system is satisfied, the Gross-Pitaevskii equations are also satisfied. The analytic solutions of this BPS system in the present manuscript represent configurations with fractional vorticity living in an annulus. Using these techniques, we present the first analytic examples of this kind. The hydrodynamical interpretation of the BPS system is discussed, and the implications of these results are outlined.</description>

      <title>Resummed effective actions and heat kernels: the Worldline approach and Yukawa assisted pair creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We adapt the Worldline Formalism to obtain resummed expressions for the effective action and the heat kernel of a quantum scalar field coupled to a Yukawa background. The resummation includes all the invariants built from powers, first derivatives and second derivatives of the latter. Using such results, we compute the instability of the vacuum computing the vacuum persistence amplitude and the corresponding Schwinger pair production probability. We show that the inclusion of an additional, rapidly varying background can greatly enhance the production of pairs.</description>

      <title>A new method for structural diagnostics with muon tomography and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the production of high-resolution images of typical support elements in concrete structures by means of muon tomography (muography). By exploiting detailed Monte Carlo radiation-matter simulations, we demonstrate the feasibility of reconstructing 1 cm-thick iron bars inside 30 cm-deep concrete blocks, regarded as an important testbed within the structural diagnostics community. In addition, we present a new method for integrating simulated data with advanced deep learning techniques in order to improve the muon imaging of concrete structures. Through deep learning enhancement techniques, this results in a dramatic improvement in image quality and a significant reduction in data acquisition time, which are two critical limitations within the usual practice of muography for civil engineering diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Rapidly spinning dark matter-admixed neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17948v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars, representing the older neutron star population, are believed to have undergone a prolonged period of dark matter accumulation, resulting in a higher dark matter content. Their extreme rotation makes them unique laboratories for studying rapidly rotating neutron stars admixed with dark matter. In this work, we model uniformly rotating neutron stars with a dark matter component that rotates independently from the baryon matter, allowing for the investigation of both co-rotating and counter-rotating scenarios. We examine the impact of dark matter rotation on the macroscopic properties of neutron stars, including the mass-radius relation, the mass-shedding Keplerian limit, and moments of inertia, for various dark matter particle masses and total fractions, considering both core and halo distributions. Our findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of how dark matter influences the equilibrium properties of rotating neutron stars, offering new insights into the astrophysical implications of self-interacting dark matter.</description>

      <title>Linear sigma model with quarks and Polyakov loop in rotation: phase diagrams, Tolman-Ehrenfest law and mechanical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of rotation on the confining and chiral properties of QCD using the Polyakov-enhanced linear sigma model coupled to quarks. Working in the homogeneous approximation, we obtain the phase diagram at finite temperature, baryon density and angular frequency, taking into account the causality constraint enforced by the spectral boundary conditions at a cylindrical surface. We explicitly address various limits with respect to system size $R$, angular frequency $\Omega$ and chemical potential $\mu$. We demonstrate that, in this model, the critical temperatures of both transitions diminish in response to the increasing rotation, being in contradiction with the first-principle lattice results. We demonstrate that consistency between the thermodynamics of the model and the Tolman-Ehrenfest law is achieved in the limit of large volume. We also compute the mechanical characteristics of rotating plasma, such as the moment of inertia and the $K_n$ shape coefficients describing the response of the thermodynamic potential with respect to the increase of angular velocity $\Omega$.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Anisotropic Cosmic Birefringence from CMB B-mode Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13154v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic birefringence$-$the rotation of the polarization plane of light as it traverses the universe$-$offers a direct observational window into parity-violating physics beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we revisit the anisotropic component of cosmic birefringence, which leads to the generation of $B$-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Using an exact theoretical treatment beyond the thin last-scattering surface approximation, we constrain the amplitude of anisotropic birefringence with combined polarization data from SPTpol, ACT, POLARBEAR, and BICEP. The joint analysis yields a best-fit amplitude of $A_{\rm CB} = 0.42^{+0.40}_{-0.34} \times 10^{-4}$, consistent with zero within $2\sigma$, and we place a 95\% confidence-level upper bound of $A_{\rm CB} &lt; 1 \times 10^{-4}$. The constraint is not dominated by any single experiment and remains robust under the inclusion of a possible isotropic rotation angle. These results provide leading constraints on anisotropic cosmic birefringence from CMB $B$-mode polarization and illustrate the potential of upcoming experiments to improve sensitivity to parity-violating effects in the early universe.</description>
