      <title>From large-eddy simulations to deep learning: A U-net model for fast urban canopy flow predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of wind flow fields in urban canopies is crucial for ensuring pedestrian comfort, safety, and sustainable urban design. Traditional methods using wind tunnels and Computational Fluid Dynamics, such as Large-Eddy Simulations (LES), are limited by high costs, computational demands, and time requirements. This study presents a deep neural network (DNN) approach for fast and accurate predictions of urban wind flow fields, reducing computation time from an order of 10 hours on 32 CPUs for one LES evaluation to an order of 1 second on a single GPU using the DNN model. We employ a U-Net architecture trained on LES data including 252 synthetic urban configurations at seven wind directions ($0^{o}$ to $90^{o}$ in $15^{o}$ increments). The model predicts two key quantities of interest: mean velocity magnitude and streamwise turbulence intensity, at multiple heights within the urban canopy. The U-net uses 2D building representations augmented with signed distance functions and their gradients as inputs, forming a $256\times256\times9$ tensor. In addition, a Spatial Attention Module is used for feature transfer through skip connections. The loss function combines the root-mean-square error of predictions, their gradient magnitudes, and L2 regularization. Model evaluation on 50 test cases demonstrates high accuracy with an overall mean relative error of 9.3% for velocity magnitude and 5.2% for turbulence intensity. This research shows the potential of deep learning approaches to provide fast, accurate urban wind assessments essential for creating comfortable and safe urban environments.

      <title>Heat Transport and Dissipation in 2.5D Rotating Internally Heated and Cooled Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models of astrophysical convection, such as mixing length theory, typically assume that the heat transport is independent of microphysical diffusivities. Such 'diffusion-free' behaviour is, however, not observed in numerical simulations employing standard fixed-flux or fixed-temperature boundary conditions, except possibly in extreme parameter regimes that are computationally expensive to achieve. Recent numerical and experimental work has suggested that internally heated and cooled convection can exhibit diffusion-free scalings in more numerically accessible regimes. Here, we present direct numerical simulations of 2.5D Cartesian rotating thermal convection driven by an internal heating and cooling function. The use of distributed heating and cooling functions alleviates sharp thermal boundary layers that would otherwise be present, allowing the flows to be simulated with modest computational resources. We show that for high Rossby numbers this set-up recovers mixing length theory scalings for the heat transport. The velocity amplitudes, in contrast, are observed to display diffusion-limited scalings. By comparing against boundary driven rotating convection, we show that internally heated cases have a larger fraction of their thermal dissipation occuring in the bulk of the fluid. We suggest this is connected to the increased convective efficiency observed in these cases. Our results indicate that 2.5D internally heated convection can be used as a computationally inexpensive test-bed to investigate some aspects of diffusion-free heat transport.</description>

      <title>Ideal incompressible axisymmetric MHD: Uncovering finite-time singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide compelling numerical evidence for the development of (potential) finite-time singularities in the three-dimensional (3D) axisymmetric, ideal, incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (IMHD) equations, in a wall-bounded cylindrical domain, starting from smooth initial data, for the velocity and magnetic fields. We demonstrate that the nature of the singularity depends crucially on the relative strength C of the velocity and magnetic fields at the time of initialisation: (i) if C &lt; 1, then the swirl components, at the wall, evolve towards square profiles that lead to the intensification of shear at the meridional plane (r = 1, z = L/2) and the development of a finite-time singularity; (ii) if C = 1, there is no temporal evolution; (iii) if C &gt; 1, then the swirl components, at the wall, evolve towards a cusp-type singularity. By examining the spatiotemporal evolution of the pressure, we obtain insights into the development of these singularities.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learned Force Fields for Lattice Dynamics at Coupled-Cluster Level Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate Machine-Learned Force Fields (MLFFs) trained on approximate Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Coupled Cluster (CC) level potential energy surfaces for the carbon diamond and lithium hydride solids. We assess the accuracy and precision of the MLFFs by calculating phonon dispersions and vibrational densities of states (VDOS) that are compared to experiment and reference ab initio results. To overcome limitations from long-range effects and the lack of atomic forces in the CC training data, a delta-learning approach based on the difference between CC and DFT results is explored. Compared to DFT, MLFFs trained on CC theory yield higher vibrational frequencies for optical modes, agreeing better with experiment. Furthermore, the MLFFs are used to estimate anharmonic effects on the VDOS of lithium hydride at the level of CC theory.</description>

      <title>Accurate calculation of bubble and droplet properties in diffuse-interface two-phase simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of accurately calculating droplet/bubble properties (e.g., volume, number) in diffuse-interface two-phase flow simulations. Currently, flood-fill algorithms can truncate a significant portion of the volume of droplets/bubbles contained within the diffuse interface region or artificially merge multiple droplets/bubbles. This error is also dependent on the volume fraction cutoff value, which is typically chosen to be 0.5 arbitrarily, in the flood-fill algorithms. We propose a simple volume-correction approach that incorporates an analytical approximation of the truncated volume to correct for the missing droplet/bubble volumes. This proposed method results in accurately recovering the dispersed phase volumes with minimal volume error over a wide range of volume fraction cutoff values; and hence, can also accurately recover the number of droplets/bubbles. This can be a valuable tool for accurate calculation of drop/bubble size distributions for analysis and for Eulerian-to-Lagrangian conversion of the dispersed phase in multi-scale modeling approaches.</description>

      <title>The Software Landscape for the Density Matrix Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm is a cornerstone computational method for studying quantum many-body systems, renowned for its accuracy and adaptability. Despite DMRG's broad applicability across fields such as materials science, quantum chemistry, and quantum computing, numerous independent implementations have been developed. This survey maps the rapidly expanding DMRG software landscape, providing a comprehensive comparison of features among 35 existing packages. We found significant overlap in features among the packages when comparing key aspects, such as parallelism strategies for high-performance computing and symmetry-adapted formulations that enhance efficiency. This overlap suggests opportunities for modularization of common operations, including tensor operations, symmetry representations, and eigensolvers, as the packages are mostly independent and share few third-party library dependencies where functionality is factored out. More widespread modularization and standardization would result in reduced duplication of efforts and improved interoperability. We believe that the proliferation of packages and the current lack of standard interfaces and modularity are more social than technical. We aim to raise awareness of existing packages, guide researchers in finding a suitable package for their needs, and help developers identify opportunities for collaboration, modularity standardization, and optimization. Ultimately, this work emphasizes the value of greater cohesion and modularity, which would benefit DMRG software, allowing these powerful algorithms to tackle more complex and ambitious problems.</description>

      <title>L-based numerical linked cluster expansion for square lattice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02458v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a numerical linked cluster expansion for square-lattice models whose building block is an L-shape cluster. For the spin-1/2 models studied in this work, we find that this expansion exhibits a similar or better convergence of the bare sums than that of the (larger) square-shaped clusters, and can be used with resummation techniques (like the site- and bond-based expansions) to obtain results at even lower temperatures. We compare the performance of weak- and strong-embedding versions of this expansion in various spin-1/2 models, and show that the strong-embedding version is preferable because of its convergence properties and lower computational cost. Finally, we show that the expansion based on the L-shape cluster can be naturally used to study properties of lattice models that smoothly connect the square and triangular lattice geometries.</description>

      <title>Interpretable and Equation-Free Response Theory for Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Response theory provides a pathway for understanding the sensitivity of a system and for predicting how its statistical properties change when a perturbation is applied. In the case of complex and multiscale systems, to achieve enhanced practical applicability, response theory should be interpretable, capable of focusing on relevant timescales, and amenable to data-driven and equation-agnostic implementations. Along these lines, in the spirit of Markov state modelling, we present linear and nonlinear response formulas for Markov chains. We obtain simple and easily implementable expressions that can be used to predict the response of observables as well as of higher-order correlations. The methodology proposed here can be implemented in a purely data-driven setting and even if the underlying evolution equations are unknown. The use of algebraic expansions inspired by Koopmanism allows to elucidate the role of different time scales and modes of variability, and to find explicit and interpretable expressions for the Green's functions at all orders. This is a major advantage of the framework proposed here. We illustrate our methodology in a very simple yet instructive metastable system. Finally, our results provide a dynamical foundation for the Prony method, which is commonly used for the statistical analysis of discrete time signals.</description>

      <title>Variational Transformer Ansatz for the Density Operator of Steady States in Dissipative Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transformer architecture, known for capturing long-range dependencies and intricate patterns, has extended beyond natural language processing. Recently, it has attracted significant attention in quantum information and condensed matter physics. In this work, we propose the \textit{transformer density operator ansatz} for determining the steady states of dissipative quantum many-body systems. By vectorizing the density operator as a many-body state in a doubled Hilbert space, the transformer encodes the amplitude and phase of the state's coefficients, with its parameters serving as variational variables. Our design preserves translation invariance while leveraging attention mechanisms to capture diverse long-range correlations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by numerically calculating the steady states of dissipative Ising and Heisenberg spin chain models, showing that our method achieves excellent accuracy in predicting mixed steady states.</description>

      <title>Julia in HEP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Julia is a mature general-purpose programming language, with a large ecosystem of libraries and more than 12000 third-party packages, which specifically targets scientific computing. As a language, Julia is as dynamic, interactive, and accessible as Python with NumPy, but achieves run-time performance on par with C/C++. In this paper, we describe the state of adoption of Julia in HEP, where momentum has been gathering over a number of years.
  HEP-oriented Julia packages can already, via UnROOT.jl, read HEP's major file formats, including TTree and RNTuple. Interfaces to some of HEP's major software packages, such as through Geant4.jl, are available too. Jet reconstruction algorithms in Julia show excellent performance. A number of full HEP analyses have been performed in Julia.
  We show how, as the support for HEP has matured, developments have benefited from Julia's core design choices, which makes reuse from and integration with other packages easy. In particular, libraries developed outside HEP for plotting, statistics, fitting, and scientific machine learning are extremely useful.
  We believe that the powerful combination of flexibility and speed, the wide selection of scientific programming tools, and support for all modern programming paradigms and tools, make Julia the ideal choice for a future language in HEP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19452v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine-learning-based surrogate models offer significant computational efficiency and faster simulations compared to traditional numerical methods, especially for problems requiring repeated evaluations of partial differential equations. This work introduces the Geometry-Informed Neural Operator Transformer (GINOT), which integrates the transformer architecture with the neural operator framework to enable forward predictions on arbitrary geometries. GINOT employs a sampling and grouping strategy together with an attention mechanism to encode surface point clouds that are unordered, exhibit non-uniform point densities, and contain varying numbers of points for different geometries. The geometry information is seamlessly integrated with query points in the solution decoder through the attention mechanism. The performance of GINOT is validated on multiple challenging datasets, showcasing its high accuracy and strong generalization capabilities for complex and arbitrary 2D and 3D geometries.</description>

      <title>PINN-DG: Residual neural network methods trained with Finite Elements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past few years, neural network methods have evolved in various directions for approximating partial differential equations (PDEs). A promising new development is the integration of neural networks with classical numerical techniques such as finite elements and finite differences. In this paper, we introduce a new class of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) trained using discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods. Unlike standard collocation-based PINNs that rely on pointwise gradient evaluations and Monte Carlo quadrature, our approach computes the loss functional using finite element interpolation and integration. This avoids costly pointwise derivative computations, particularly advantageous for elliptic PDEs requiring second-order derivatives, and inherits key stability and accuracy benefits from the finite element framework. We present a convergence analysis based on variational arguments and support our theoretical findings with numerical experiments that demonstrate improved efficiency and robustness.</description>

      <title>Orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects transform minima in molecular ionization probabilities into maxima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the tunneling regime and at sufficiently low field amplitudes, the shape of orientation-dependent molecular ionization rate curves usually resembles the shape of the ionized orbital. As the ionizing field strength increases, the shape of the ionization rate can deviate from this pattern. The oft-cited explanation is that the increasing contribution of excited states relative to the ground state modifies the distribution. In this paper, we show that orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects, which are independent of excited-state effects, can also significantly modify the angular dependence of the yields of widely studied molecules where excited state effects are negligible. For example, we find that in CH$_3$Br, the interplay between orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects transforms a local minimum in the orientation-dependent ionization rate to a local maximum as the ionizing field strength increases. To simulate orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects, we use the one-electron weak-field asymptotic theory including the first-order correction (OE-WFAT(1)) in the integral representation. Since OE-WFAT(1) incurs expensive computations when the number of orientation angles is large, we also reformulate the original OE-WFAT(1) algorithm into a partial-wave expansion form, which greatly enhances the efficiency of the method.</description>

      <title>Reference compositions for bismuth telluride thermoelectric materials for low-temperature power generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermoelectric (TE) technology enables direct heat-to-electricity conversion and is gaining attention as a clean, fuel-saving, and carbon-neutral solution for industrial, automotive, and marine applications. Despite nearly a century of research, apart from successes in deep-space power sources and solid-state cooling modules, the industrialization and commercialization of TE power generation remain limited. Since the new millennium, nanostructured bulk materials have accelerated the discovery of new TE systems. However, due to limited access to high-temperature heat sources, energy harvesting still relies almost exclusively on BiTe-based alloys, which are the only system operating stably near room temperature. Although many BiTe-based compositions have been proposed, concerns over reproducibility, reliability, and lifetime continue to hinder industrial adoption. Here, we aim to develop reference BiTe-based thermoelectric materials through data-driven analysis of Starrydata2, the world's largest thermoelectric database. We identify Bi0.46Sb1.54Te3 and Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 as the most frequently studied ternary compositions. These were synthesized using hot pressing and spark-plasma sintering. Thermoelectric properties were evaluated with respect to the processing method and measurement direction. The results align closely with the median of reported data, confirming the representativeness of the selected compositions. We propose these as reference BiTe materials, accompanied by transparent data and validated benchmarks. Their use can support the standardization of TE legs and modules while accelerating performance evaluation and industrial integration. We further estimated the performance of a thermoelectric module made from the reference composition, which gives the power output of over 2.51 W and an efficiency of 3.58% at a temperature difference of 120 K.</description>
