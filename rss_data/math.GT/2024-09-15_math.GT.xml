      <title>Simplicial maps between spheres and Davis' manifolds with positive simplicial volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the simplicial volume of manifolds obtained from Davis' reflection group trick, the goal being characterizing those having positive simplicial volume. In particular, we focus on checking whether manifolds in this class with nonzero Euler characteristic have positive simplicial volume (Gromov asked whether this holds in general for aspherical manifolds). This leads to a combinatorial problem about triangulations of spheres: we define a partial order on the set of triangulations -- the relation being the existence of a nonzero-degree simplicial map between two triangulations -- and the problem is to find the minimal elements of a specific subposet. We solve explicitly the case of triangulations of the two-dimensional sphere, and then perform an extensive analysis, with the help of computer searches, of the three-dimensional case. Moreover, we present a connection of this problem with the theory of graph minors.</description>

      <title>Simply transitive geodesics and omnipotence of lattices in PSL$(2,\mathbb{C})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the isometry group of a finite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifold acts simply transitively on many of its closed geodesics. Combining this observation with the Virtual Special Theorems of the first author and Wise, we show that every non-arithmetic lattice in PSL$(2,\mathbb{C})$ is the full group of orientation-preserving isometries for some other lattice and that the orientation-preserving isometry group of a finite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifold acts non-trivially on the homology of some finite-sheeted cover.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We relaxe the constraint on the domains of combinatorial HHS machinery so combinatorial HHS machinery works for most cubical curve graphs. As an application we extend the factor system machinery of the CAT(0) cube complex to the quasi-median graphs.</description>

      <title>The polyhedral decomposition of cusped hyperbolic $n$-manifolds with totally geodesic boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a volume finite non-compact complete hyperbolic $n$-manifold with totally geodesic boundary. We show that there exists a polyhedral decomposition of $M$ such that each cell is either an ideal polyhedron or a partially truncated polyhedron with exactly one truncated face. This result parallels Epstein-Penner's ideal decomposition \cite{EP} for cusped hyperbolic manifolds and Kojima's truncated polyhedron decomposition \cite{Kojima} for compact hyperbolic manifolds with totally geodesic boundary. We take two different approaches to demonstrate the main result in this paper. We also show that the number of polyhedral decompositions of $M$ is finite.</description>

      <title>The unknotting number, hard unknot diagrams, and reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a reinforcement learning agent that often finds a minimal sequence of unknotting crossing changes for a knot diagram with up to 200 crossings, hence giving an upper bound on the unknotting number. We have used this to determine the unknotting number of 57k knots. We took diagrams of connected sums of such knots with oppositely signed signatures, where the summands were overlaid. The agent has found examples where several of the crossing changes in an unknotting collection of crossings result in hyperbolic knots. Based on this, we have shown that, given knots $K$ and $K'$ that satisfy some mild assumptions, there is a diagram of their connected sum and $u(K) + u(K')$ unknotting crossings such that changing any one of them results in a prime knot. As a by-product, we have obtained a dataset of 2.6 million distinct hard unknot diagrams; most of them under 35 crossings. Assuming the additivity of the unknotting number, we have determined the unknotting number of 43 at most 12-crossing knots for which the unknotting number is unknown.</description>

      <title>A note on combinatorial type and splitting invariants of plane curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Splitting invariants are effective for distinguishing the embedded topology of plane curves. In this note, we introduce a generalization of splitting invariants, called the G-combinatorial type, for plane curves by using the modified plumbing graph defined by Hironaka [14]. We prove that the G-combinatorial type is invariant under certain homeomorphisms based on the arguments of Waldhausen [32, 33] and Neumann [22]. Furthermore, we distinguish the embedded topology of quasi-triangular curves by the G-combinatorial type, which are generalization of triangular curves studied in [4].</description>

      <title>Extending free actions of finite groups on unoriented surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05863v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the unoriented version of the Schur and Bogomolov multiplier associated with a finite group $G$. We show that the unoriented Schur multiplier is isomorphic to the second cohomology group $H^2(G;\mathbb{Z}_2)$. We define the unoriented Bogomolov multiplier as the quotient of the unoriented Schur multiplier by the subgroup generated by classes over the disjoint union of tori, Klein bottles, and projective spaces. Disregarding the subgroup generated by the trivial $G$-bundle over the projective space, we show that the unoriented Bogomolov multiplier is a complete obstruction. This means that a free surface action over an unoriented surface equivariantly bounds if and only if the class in the unoriented Bogomolov multiplier is trivial. We show that the unoriented Bogomolov multiplier is trivial for abelian, dihedral, and symmetric groups. Because the group cohomology $H^2(G;\mathbb{Z}_2)$ is trivial for a group of odd order, there are plenty of examples where the usual Bogomolov multiplier is not trivial while the unoriented Bogomolov multiplier is trivial. However, we show that there is a group of order $64$ where the unoriented Bogomolov multiplier is non-trivial.</description>

      <title>Trisections of PL 4-manifolds arising from colored triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01902v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of the present paper is twofold: firstly to extend to non-orientable compact 4-manifolds the notion of gem-induced trisection, directly obtained from colored triangulations (or, equivalently, from colored graphs encoding them, called gems); secondly to prove that, both in the orientable and non-orientable case, if the boundary is homeomorphic to a connected sum of sphere bundles over $\mathbb S^1$, gem-induced trisections naturally give rise to trisections of the corresponding closed 4-manifold. As a consequence, an estimation of the trisection genus of any closed orientable 4-manifold in terms of surgery description is obtained via colored triangulations.</description>

      <title>On sequential versions of distributional topological complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17218v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a (non-decreasing) sequence $\{\mathsf{dTC}_m(X)\}_{m\ge 2}$ of higher versions of distributional topological complexity ($\mathsf{dTC}$) of a space $X$ introduced by Dranishnikov and Jauhari. This sequence generalizes $\mathsf{dTC}(X)$ in the sense that $\mathsf{dTC}_2(X) = \mathsf{dTC}(X)$, and is a direct analog to the classical sequence $\{\mathsf{TC}_m(X)\}_{m\ge 2}$. We show that like $\mathsf{TC}_m$ and $\mathsf{dTC}$, the sequential versions $\mathsf{dTC}_m$ are also homotopy invariants. Also, $\mathsf{dTC}_m(X)$ relates with the distributional LS-category ($\mathsf{dcat}$) of products of $X$ in the same way as $\mathsf{TC}_m(X)$ relates with the classical LS-category ($\mathsf{cat}$) of products of $X$. On one hand, we show that in general, $\mathsf{dTC}_m$ is a different concept than $\mathsf{TC}_m$ for each $m \ge 2$. On the other hand, by finding sharp cohomological lower bounds to $\mathsf{dTC}_m(X)$, we provide various examples of closed manifolds $X$ for which the sequences $\{\mathsf{TC}_m(X)\}_{m\ge 2}$ and $\{\mathsf{dTC}_m(X)\}_{m\ge 2}$ coincide.</description>
