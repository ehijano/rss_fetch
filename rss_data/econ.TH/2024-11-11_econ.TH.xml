      <title>Market efficiency, informational asymmetry and pseudo-collusion of adaptively learning agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the dynamics of informational efficiency in a market with asymmetrically informed, boundedly rational traders who adaptively learn optimal strategies using simple multiarmed bandit (MAB) algorithms. The strategies available to the traders have two dimensions: on the one hand, the traders must endogenously choose whether to acquire a costly information signal, on the other, they must determine how aggressively they trade by choosing the share of their wealth to be invested in the risky asset. Our study contributes to two strands of literature: the literature comparing the effects of competitive and strategic behavior on asset price efficiency under costly information as well as the actively growing literature on algorithmic tacit collusion and pseudo-collusion in financial markets. We find that for certain market environments (with low information costs) our model reproduces the results of Kyle [1989] in that the ability of traders to trade strategically leads to worse price efficiency compared to the purely competitive case. For other environments (with high information costs), on the other hand, our results show that a market with strategically acting traders can be more efficient than a purely competitive one. Furthermore, we obtain novel results on the ability of independently learning traders to coordinate on a pseudo-collusive behavior, leading to non-competitive pricing. Contrary to some recent contributions (see e.g. [Cartea et al. 2022]), we find that the pseudo-collusive behavior in our model is robust to a large number of agents, demonstrating that even in the setting of financial markets with a large number of independently learning traders non-competitive pricing and pseudo-collusive behavior can frequently arise.</description>

      <title>Higher education funding: The value of choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An alternative to the dependence on traditional student loans may offer a viable relief from the tremendous burden that those loans usually incur. This article establishes that it is desirable for governmental intervention to grant students 'more choice' in their funding decisions by allowing them to have portfolios, mixtures of different types of loans. To emphasize this point, a model is presented of a situation where students invest in higher education while facing uncertainty about their individual earning potential. The model reveals that when students are allowed to have portfolios of loans, some of them indeed take the opportunity and diversify their loans, benefiting themselves, but also improving the loan terms of other students. Therefore, when governments organize student loans, they should consider providing students with more choice in their funding decisions.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Voter Relevance in Facility Location Games with Tree-Shaped Invitation Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion mechanism design, which investigate how to incentivise agents to invite as many colleagues to a multi-agent decision making as possible, is a new research paradigm at the intersection between microeconomics and computer science. In this paper we extend traditional facility location games into the model of diffusion mechanism design. Our objective is to completely understand to what extent of anonymity/voter-relevance we can achieve, along with strategy-proofness and Pareto efficiency when voters strategically invite collegues. We define a series of anonymity properties applicable to the diffusion mechanism design model, as well as parameterized voter-relevance properties for guaranteeing reasonably-fair decision making. We obtained two impossibility theorems and two existence theorems, which partially answer the question we have raised in the beginning of the paper</description>

      <title>Some Characterizations of TTC in Multiple-Object Reallocation Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04822v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers reallocation of indivisible objects when agents are endowed with and can consume any bundles. We obtain characterizations of generalized versions of the Top Trading Cycles (TTC) rule on several preference domains. On the lexicographic domain, the TTC rule is uniquely determined by balancedness, Pareto efficiency, the worst endowment lower bound, and either truncation-proofness or drop strategy-proofness. On the more general responsive domain, the TTC rule is the unique individual-good-based rule that satisfies balancedness, individual-good efficiency, truncation-proofness, and either individual rationality or the worst endowment lower bound. On the conditionally lexicographic domain, the augmented TTC rule is characterized by balancedness, Pareto efficiency, the worst endowment lower bound, and drop strategy-proofness. The conditionally lexicographic domain is a maximal domain on which Pareto efficiency coincides with individual-good efficiency. For the housing market introduced by Shapley and Scarf (1974), the TTC rule is characterized by Pareto efficiency, individual rationality, and truncation-proofness.</description>

      <title>Robust Pricing for Quality Disclosure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A platform charges a producer for disclosing hard evidence of product quality to a consumer before trading. To tackle strategic uncertainty, the platform offers the producer quality-dependent and disclosure probability-dependent prices to maximize its revenue guarantee across all equilibria. The platform optimally offers off-path disclosure options to incentivize each producer type to "conquer herself" by deviating continually to full disclosure, yielding strictly convex advertising price functions of disclosure probability. Moreover, the platform prioritizes attracting higher types into service and offers them higher rents despite the absence of adverse selection. Comparative statics demonstrate that more informative hard evidence increases the platform's revenue guarantee.</description>

      <title>Statistical Discrimination in Ratings-Guided Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.11531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study statistical discrimination of individuals based on payoff-irrelevant social identities in markets that utilize ratings and recommendations for social learning. Even though rating/recommendation algorithms can be designed to be fair and unbiased, ratings-based social learning can still lead to discriminatory outcomes. Our model demonstrates how users' attention choices can result in asymmetric data sampling across social groups, leading to discriminatory inferences and potential discrimination based on group identities.</description>
