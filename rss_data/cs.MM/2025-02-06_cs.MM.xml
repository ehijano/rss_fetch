      <title>Secure &amp; Personalized Music-to-Video Generation via CHARCHA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music is a deeply personal experience and our aim is to enhance this with a fully-automated pipeline for personalized music video generation. Our work allows listeners to not just be consumers but co-creators in the music video generation process by creating personalized, consistent and context-driven visuals based on lyrics, rhythm and emotion in the music. The pipeline combines multimodal translation and generation techniques and utilizes low-rank adaptation on listeners' images to create immersive music videos that reflect both the music and the individual. To ensure the ethical use of users' identity, we also introduce CHARCHA (patent pending), a facial identity verification protocol that protects people against unauthorized use of their face while at the same time collecting authorized images from users for personalizing their videos. This paper thus provides a secure and innovative framework for creating deeply personalized music videos.</description>

      <title>Efficient Vision Language Model Fine-tuning for Text-based Person Anomaly Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the HFUT-LMC team's solution to the WWW 2025 challenge on Text-based Person Anomaly Search (TPAS). The primary objective of this challenge is to accurately identify pedestrians exhibiting either normal or abnormal behavior within a large library of pedestrian images. Unlike traditional video analysis tasks, TPAS significantly emphasizes understanding and interpreting the subtle relationships between text descriptions and visual data. The complexity of this task lies in the model's need to not only match individuals to text descriptions in massive image datasets but also accurately differentiate between search results when faced with similar descriptions. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Similarity Coverage Analysis (SCA) strategy to address the recognition difficulty caused by similar text descriptions. This strategy effectively enhances the model's capacity to manage subtle differences, thus improving both the accuracy and reliability of the search. Our proposed solution demonstrated excellent performance in this challenge.</description>

      <title>Long-tailed Medical Diagnosis with Relation-aware Representation Learning and Iterative Classifier Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently computer-aided diagnosis has demonstrated promising performance, effectively alleviating the workload of clinicians. However, the inherent sample imbalance among different diseases leads algorithms biased to the majority categories, leading to poor performance for rare categories. Existing works formulated this challenge as a long-tailed problem and attempted to tackle it by decoupling the feature representation and classification. Yet, due to the imbalanced distribution and limited samples from tail classes, these works are prone to biased representation learning and insufficient classifier calibration. To tackle these problems, we propose a new Long-tailed Medical Diagnosis (LMD) framework for balanced medical image classification on long-tailed datasets. In the initial stage, we develop a Relation-aware Representation Learning (RRL) scheme to boost the representation ability by encouraging the encoder to capture intrinsic semantic features through different data augmentations. In the subsequent stage, we propose an Iterative Classifier Calibration (ICC) scheme to calibrate the classifier iteratively. This is achieved by generating a large number of balanced virtual features and fine-tuning the encoder using an Expectation-Maximization manner. The proposed ICC compensates for minority categories to facilitate unbiased classifier optimization while maintaining the diagnostic knowledge in majority classes. Comprehensive experiments on three public long-tailed medical datasets demonstrate that our LMD framework significantly surpasses state-of-the-art approaches.

      <title>Seeing World Dynamics in a Nutshell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of efficiently representing casually captured monocular videos in a spatially- and temporally-coherent manner. While existing approaches predominantly rely on 2D/2.5D techniques treating videos as collections of spatiotemporal pixels, they struggle with complex motions, occlusions, and geometric consistency due to absence of temporal coherence and explicit 3D structure. Drawing inspiration from monocular video as a projection of the dynamic 3D world, we explore representing videos in their intrinsic 3D form through continuous flows of Gaussian primitives in space-time. In this paper, we propose NutWorld, a novel framework that efficiently transforms monocular videos into dynamic 3D Gaussian representations in a single forward pass. At its core, NutWorld introduces a structured spatial-temporal aligned Gaussian (STAG) representation, enabling optimization-free scene modeling with effective depth and flow regularization. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that NutWorld achieves high-fidelity video reconstruction quality while enabling various downstream applications in real-time. Demos and code will be available at https://github.com/Nut-World/NutWorld.</description>

      <title>Lost in Overlap: Exploring Logit-based Watermark Collision in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10020v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) in generating content raises concerns about text copyright. Watermarking methods, particularly logit-based approaches, embed imperceptible identifiers into text to address these challenges. However, the widespread usage of watermarking across diverse LLMs has led to an inevitable issue known as watermark collision during common tasks, such as paraphrasing or translation. In this paper, we introduce watermark collision as a novel and general philosophy for watermark attacks, aimed at enhancing attack performance on top of any other attacking methods. We also provide a comprehensive demonstration that watermark collision poses a threat to all logit-based watermark algorithms, impacting not only specific attack scenarios but also downstream applications.</description>

      <title>Distilling Implicit Multimodal Knowledge into Large Language Models for Zero-Resource Dialogue Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating multimodal knowledge into large language models (LLMs) represents a significant advancement in dialogue generation capabilities. However, the effective incorporation of such knowledge in zero-resource scenarios remains a substantial challenge due to the scarcity of diverse, high-quality dialogue datasets. To address this, we propose the Visual Implicit Knowledge Distillation Framework (VIKDF), an innovative approach aimed at enhancing LLMs for enriched dialogue generation in zero-resource contexts by leveraging implicit multimodal knowledge. VIKDF comprises two main stages: knowledge distillation, using an Implicit Query Transformer to extract and encode visual implicit knowledge from image-text pairs into knowledge vectors; and knowledge integration, employing a novel Bidirectional Variational Information Fusion technique to seamlessly integrate these distilled vectors into LLMs. This enables the LLMs to generate dialogues that are not only coherent and engaging but also exhibit a deep understanding of the context through implicit multimodal cues, effectively overcoming the limitations of zero-resource scenarios. Our extensive experimentation across two dialogue datasets shows that VIKDF outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in generating high-quality dialogues. The code is available at https://github.com/zhangbo-nlp/VIKDF.</description>

      <title>Images that Sound: Composing Images and Sounds on a Single Canvas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectrograms are 2D representations of sound that look very different from the images found in our visual world. And natural images, when played as spectrograms, make unnatural sounds. In this paper, we show that it is possible to synthesize spectrograms that simultaneously look like natural images and sound like natural audio. We call these visual spectrograms images that sound. Our approach is simple and zero-shot, and it leverages pre-trained text-to-image and text-to-spectrogram diffusion models that operate in a shared latent space. During the reverse process, we denoise noisy latents with both the audio and image diffusion models in parallel, resulting in a sample that is likely under both models. Through quantitative evaluations and perceptual studies, we find that our method successfully generates spectrograms that align with a desired audio prompt while also taking the visual appearance of a desired image prompt.
