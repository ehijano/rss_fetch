      <title>On the universal completions of pointfree function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper approaches the construction of the universal completion of the Riesz space $\mathrm{C}(L)$ of continuous real functions on a completely regular frame $L$ in two different ways. Firstly as the space of continuous real functions on the Booleanization of $L$. Secondly as the space of nearly finite Hausdorff continuous functions on $L$. The former has no counterpart in the classical theory, as the Booleanization of a spatial frame is not spatial in general, and it offers a lucid way of representing the universal completion as a space of continuous real functions. As a corollary we obtain that $\mathrm{C}(L)$ and $\mathrm{C}(M)$ have isomorphic universal completions if and only if the Booleanization of $L$ and $M$ are isomorphic and we characterize frames $L$ such that $\mathrm{C}(L)$ is universally complete as almost Boolean frames. The application of this last result to the classical case $\mathrm{C}(X)$ of the space of continuous real functions on a topological space $X$ characterizes those spaces $X$ for which $\mathrm{C}(X)$ is universally complete. Finally, we present a pointfree version of the Maeda-Ogasawara-Vulikh representation theorem and use it to represent the universal completion of an Archimedean Riesz space with weak unit as a space of continuous real functions on a Boolean frame.</description>

      <title>Generating fractal functions associated with Suzuki iterated function systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article constructs a fractal interpolation function, also referred to as $\alpha$-fractal function, using Suzuki-type generalized $\varphi$-contraction mappings (STGPC). The STGPC is a generalization of $\varphi$-contraction mappings. The process of constructing $\alpha$-fractal functions using the STGPC is detailed, and examples of STGPC are given. The FIF has broad applications in data analysis, finance and price prediction. We have included a case study analyzing the price volatility of spinach in the Azadpur vegetable market in New Delhi. The fractal analysis gives a unique perspective on understanding price fluctuations over a period. Finally, the box-dimensional analysis is presented to comprehend the complexity of price fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: We show that every Banach space in which weakly compact sets are super weakly compact in automatically weakly sequentially complete answering a question by Silber (2024). In the proof we show how to build a weakly compact set which is not super weakly compact from an arbitrary nontrivial weakly Cauchy sequence using the notion of a summing subsequence of Rosenthal or Singer.</description>

      <title>Frames for source recovery from non-uniform dynamical samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of Aldroubi et al., we investigate the stability of the source term of the discrete dynamical system indexing over a non-uniform discrete set arising from spectral pairs in infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert spaces. Extending results due to Aldroubi et al., firstly, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the recovery of the source term in finitely many iterations. Afterwards, we derive a necessary condition for the stability of the source term in finitely many iterations when it belongs to the closed subspace of an infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert space. Finally, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the recovery of the source term in infinitely many iterations.</description>

      <title>Adaptive multipliers for extrapolation in frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resolving the details of an object from coarse-scale measurements is a classical problem in applied mathematics. This problem is usually formulated as extrapolating the Fourier transform of the object from a bounded region to the entire space, that is, in terms of performing extrapolation in frequency. This problem is ill-posed unless one assumes that the object has some additional structure. When the object is compactly supported, then it is well-known that its Fourier transform can be extended to the entire space. However, it is also well-known that this problem is severely ill-conditioned.
  In this work, we assume that the object is known to belong to a collection of compactly supported functions and, instead performing extrapolation in frequency to the entire space, we study the problem of extrapolating to a larger bounded set using dilations in frequency and a single Fourier multiplier. This is reminiscent of the refinement equation in multiresolution analysis. Under suitable conditions, we prove the existence of a worst-case optimal multiplier over the entire collection, and we show that all such multipliers share the same canonical structure. When the collection is finite, we show that any worst-case optimal multiplier can be represented in terms of an Hermitian matrix. This allows us to introduce a fixed-point iteration to find the optimal multiplier. This leads us to introduce a family of multipliers, which we call $\Sigma$-multipliers, that can be used to perform extrapolation in frequency. We establish connections between $\Sigma$-multipliers and multiresolution analysis. We conclude with some numerical experiments illustrating the practical consequences of our results.</description>

Abstract: We affirmatively resolve a question posed by Uffe Haagerup in 1975 on the positive version of the bipolar theorem on the dual spaces of C$^*$-algebras. As a direct consequence, we obtain a complete set of four positive Hahn-Banach separation theorems on von Neumann algebras, their preduals, C$^*$-algebras, and their duals.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of a class of infinite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian systems with boundary control and observation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the well-posedness of a class of infinite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian systems with boundary control and observation. This class includes in particular the Euler-Bernoulli beam equations and more generally 1D linear infinite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian systems with boundary control and observation as well as coupled systems. It is known, that for the Timoshenko beam models internal well-posedness implies well-posedness of the overall system. By means of an example we show that this is not true for the Euler-Bernoulli beam models. An easy verifiable equivalent condition for well-posedness of the overall system will be presented. We will conclude the paper by applying the obtained results to several Euler-Bernoulli beam models.</description>

      <title>A max filtering local stability theorem with application to weighted phase retrieval and cryo-EM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an inner product space $V$ and a group $G$ of linear isometries, max filtering offers a rich class of convex $G$-invariant maps. In this paper, we identify sufficient conditions under which these maps are locally lower Lipschitz on $R(G)$, the set of orbits with maximal dimension, with respect to the quotient metric on the orbit space $V/G$. Central to our proof is a desingularization theorem, which applies to open, dense neighborhoods around each orbit in $R(G)/G$ and may be of independent interest.
  As an application, we provide guarantees for stable weighted phase retrieval. That is, we construct componentwise convex bilipschitz embeddings of weighted complex (resp.\ quaternionic) projective spaces. These spaces arise as quotients of direct sums of nontrivial unitary irreducible complex (resp.\ quaternionic) representations of the group of unit complex numbers $S^1\cong \operatorname{SO}(2)$ (resp.\ unit quaternions $S^3\cong \operatorname{SU}(2)$).
  We also discuss the relevance of such embeddings to a nearest-neighbor problem in single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), a leading technique for resolving the spatial structure of biological molecules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the notion of Fredholm tetrad of closed linear subspaces in a Banach space is introduced. Then the stability of the Fredholm tetrad is proved. After that, the notion of semi-compact perturbation of a closed linear subspace is introduced. Then for a of pair of closed linear subspace of a Banach space such that one is a semi-compact perturbation of the other, it is proved that the relative dimension between them is well-defined. If the perturbation is compact, the relative dimension is stable. Finally the perturbed argumented Morse index is studied.</description>

      <title>Trace of Multi-variable Matrix Functions and its Application to Functions of Graph Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matrix extension of a scalar function of a single variable is well-studied in literature. Of particular interest is the trace of such functions. It is known that for diagonalizable matrices, $M$, the function $g(M) = \text{Tr}(f(M)) = \sum_{j=1}^n f(\mu_j)$ (where $\{\mu_j\}_{j=1,2,\cdots,n}$ are the eigenvalues of $M$) inherits the monotonocity and convexity properties of $f$ (i.e., for $g$ to be convex, $f$ need not be operator convex -- convexity is sufficient). In this paper we formalize the idea of matrix extension of a function of multiple variables, study the monotonicity and convexity properties of the trace, and thus show that a function of form $g(M) = \sum_{j_1=1}^n \sum_{j_2=1}^n \cdots \sum_{j_m=1}^n f(\mu_{j_1}, \mu_{j_2},\cdots, \mu_{j_m})$ also inherits the monotonocity and convexity properties of the multi-variable function, $f$. We apply these results to functions of the spectrum of the weighted Laplacian matrix of undirected, simple graphs.</description>

      <title>A note on critical intersections of classical and Schatten $p$-balls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is to study the asymptotic volume of intersections of unit balls associated with two norms in $\mathbb{R}^n$ as their dimension $n$ tends to infinity. A general framework is provided and then specialized to the following cases. For classical $\ell_p^n$-balls the focus lies on the case $p=\infty$, which has previously not been studied in the literature. As far as Schatten $p$-balls are considered, we concentrate on the cases $p=2$ and $p=\infty$. In both situations we uncover an unconventional limiting behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Every equi-isoclinic tight fusion frame (EITFF) is a type of optimal code in a Grassmannian, consisting of subspaces of a finite-dimensional Hilbert space for which the smallest principal angle between any pair of them is as large as possible. EITFFs yield dictionaries with minimal block coherence and so are ideal for certain types of compressed sensing. By refining classical work of Lemmens and Seidel based on Radon-Hurwitz theory, we fully characterize EITFFs in the special case where the dimension of the subspaces is exactly one-half of that of the ambient space. We moreover show that each such "Radon-Hurwitz EITFF" is highly symmetric, where every even permutation is an automorphism.</description>

      <title>On the best constants of Schur multipliers of second order divided difference functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a new proof of the boundedness of bilinear Schur multipliers of second order divided difference functions, as obtained earlier by Potapov, Skripka and Sukochev in their proof of Koplienko's conjecture on the existence of higher order spectral shift functions. Our proof is based on recent methods involving bilinear transference and the H\"ormander-Mikhlin-Schur multiplier theorem. Our approach provides a significant sharpening of the known asymptotic bounds of bilinear Schur multipliers of second order divided difference functions. Furthermore, we give a new lower bound of these bilinear Schur multipliers, giving again a fundamental improvement on the best known bounds obtained by Coine, Le Merdy, Potapov, Sukochev and Tomskova.
  More precisely, we prove that for $f \in C^2(\mathbb{R})$ and $1 &lt; p, p_1, p_2 &lt; \infty$ with $\frac{1}{p} = \frac{1}{p_1} + \frac{1}{p_2}$ we have \[ \Vert M_{f^{[2]}}: S_{p_1} \times S_{p_2} \rightarrow S_p \Vert \lesssim \Vert f'' \Vert_\infty D(p, p_1, p_2), \] where the constant $D(p, p_1, p_2)$ is specified in Theorem 7.1 and $D(p, 2p, 2p) \approx p^4 p^\ast$ with $p^\ast$ the H\"older conjugate of $p$. We further show that for $f(\lambda) = \lambda \vert \lambda \vert$, $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, for every $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$ we have \[ p^2 p^\ast \lesssim \Vert M_{f^{[2]}}: S_{2p} \times S_{2p} \rightarrow S_p \Vert. \] Here $f^{[2]}$ is the second order divided difference function of $f$ with $M_{f^{[2]}}$ the associated Schur multiplier. In particular it follows that our estimate $D(p, 2p, 2p)$ is optimal for $p \searrow 1$.</description>

      <title>Spectrality of a measure consisting of two line segments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Take an interval $[t, t+1]$ on the $x$-axis together with the same interval on the $y$-axis and let $\rho$ be the normalized one-dimensional Lebesgue measure on this set of two segments. Continuing the work done by Lai, Liu and Prince (2021) as well as Ai, Lu and Zhou (2023) we examine the spectrality of this measure for all different values of $t$ (being spectral means that there is an orthonormal basis for $L^2(\rho)$ consisting of exponentials $e^{2\pi i (\lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 y)}$). We almost complete the study showing that for $-\frac12&lt;t&lt;0$ and for all $t \notin {\mathbb Q}$ the measure $\rho$ is not spectral. The only remaining undecided case is the case $t=-\frac12$ (plus space). We also observe that in all known cases of spectral instances of this measure the spectrum is contained in a line and we give an easy necessary and sufficient condition for such measures to have a line spectrum.</description>
