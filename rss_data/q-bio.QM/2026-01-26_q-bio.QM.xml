      <title>Ultrafast topological data analysis reveals pandemic-scale dynamics of convergent evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.07292v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Genome variants which re-occur independently across evolutionary lineages are key molecular signatures of adaptation. Inferring the dynamics of such genetic changes from pandemic-scale genomic datasets is now possible, which opens up unprecedented insight into evolutionary processes. However, existing approaches depend on the construction of accurate phylogenetic trees, which remains challenging at scale. Here we present EVOtRec, an organism-agnostic, fast and scalable Topological Data Analysis approach that enables the inference of convergently evolving genomic variants over time directly from topological patterns in the dataset, without requiring the construction of a phylogenetic tree. Using data from both simulations and published experiments, we show that EVOtRec can robustly identify variants under positive selection and performs orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art phylogeny-based approaches, with comparable results. We apply EVOtRec to three large viral genome datasets: SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus A subtype H5N1 and HIV-1. We identify key convergent genome variants and demonstrate how EVOtRec facilitates the real-time tracking of high fitness variants in large datasets with millions of genomes, including effects modulated by varying genomic backgrounds. We envision our Topological Data Analysis approach as a new framework for efficient comparative genomics.</description>

      <title>A mathematical framework to study organising principles in graphical representations of biochemical processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The complexity of molecular and cellular processes forces experimental studies to focus on subsystems. To study the functioning of biological systems across levels of structural and functional organisation, we require tools to compose and organise networks with different levels of detail and abstraction. Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) is a standardised notational system that visualises biochemical processes as networks. Despite their widespread adoption, SBGN languages remain purely visual and lack an underlying mathematical framework, limiting their compositional analysis, abstraction, and integration with formal modelling approaches. SBGN comprises three complementary visual languages-Process Description (SBGN-PD), Activity Flow (SBGN-AF), and Entity Relationship (SBGN-ER)-each operating at a different level of abstraction.
  In this manuscript, we introduce a category-theoretic formalism for SBGN-PD, a visual language to describe biochemical processes as biochemical reaction networks. Using the theory of structured cospans, we construct a symmetric monoidal double category whose horizontal 1-morphisms correspond to SBGN-PD diagrams. We also analyse how a designated subnetwork influences the surrounding network and how external entities, in turn, affect the internal reactions of the subnetwork. Our work addresses a key gap between biological visualisation and mathematical structure. It provides precise organising principles for SBGN-PD, including compositionality, enabling the construction of large biochemical reaction networks from smaller ones, and zooming out, allowing the abstraction of detailed biochemical mechanisms while preserving their functional interfaces. Throughout the paper, the proposed framework is illustrated using standard SBGN-PD examples, demonstrating its applicability to large-scale biochemical reaction networks.</description>

      <title>Escaping Local Optima in the Waddington Landscape: A Two-Stage TRPO-PPO Approach for Single-Cell Perturbation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling cellular responses to genetic and chemical perturbations remains a central challenge in single-cell biology. Existing data-driven frameworks have advanced perturbation prediction through variational autoencoders, chemically conditioned autoencoders, and large-scale transformer pretraining. However, most existing models rely exclusively on either in silico perturbation data or experimental perturbation data but rarely integrate both, limiting their ability to generalize and validate predictions across simulated and real biological contexts in a digital twin system. Moreover, the models are prone to local optima in the nonconvex Waddington landscape of cell fate decisions, where poor initialization can trap trajectories in spurious lineages. In this work, we introduce a two-stage reinforcement learning algorithm for modeling single-cell perturbation. We first compute an explicit natural gradient update using Fisher-vector products and a conjugate gradient solver, scaled by a KL trust-region constraint to provide a safe, curvature-aware first step for the policy. Starting with these preconditioned parameters, we then apply a second phase of proximal policy optimization (PPO) with a KL penalty, exploiting minibatch efficiency to refine the policy. We demonstrate that this initialization strategy substantially improves generalization on Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) perturbation analysis in a digital twin system.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale Graph Autoregressive Modeling: Molecular Property Prediction via Next Token Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02530v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Connection-Aware Motif Sequencing (CamS), a graph-to-sequence representation that enables decoder-only Transformers to learn molecular graphs via standard next-token prediction (NTP). For molecular property prediction, SMILES-based NTP scales well but lacks explicit topology, whereas graph-native masked modeling captures connectivity but risks disrupting the pivotal chemical details (e.g., activity cliffs). CamS bridges this gap by serializing molecular graphs into structure-rich causal sequences. CamS first mines data-driven connection-aware motifs. It then serializes motifs via scaffold-rooted breadth-first search (BFS) to establish a stable core-to-periphery order. Crucially, CamS enables hierarchical modeling by concatenating sequences from fine to coarse motif scales, allowing the model to condition global scaffolds on dense, uncorrupted local structural evidence. We instantiate CamS-LLaMA by pre-training a vanilla LLaMA backbone on CamS sequences. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on MoleculeNet and the activity-cliff benchmark MoleculeACE, outperforming both SMILES-based language models and strong graph baselines. Interpretability analysis confirms that our multi-scale causal serialization effectively drives attention toward cliff-determining differences.</description>
