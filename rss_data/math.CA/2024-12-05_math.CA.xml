      <title>Compactly supported, orthogonal, continuous piecewise polynomial multiresolution analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present explicit representations in terms of hypergeometric functions for the scaling functions in the $C^0$ orthogonal multiresolution analyses associated with piecewise continuous polynomials. Closed formulas for the Mellin transform of these functions as well as their Fourier transforms are derived. Some new multiresolution analyses whose scaling functions have coefficients that are rational numbers are introduced and discussed.</description>

      <title>Hyperdeterminantal Total Positivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given positive integer $m$, the concept of {\it hyperdeterminantal total positivity} is defined for a kernel $K:\R^{2m} \to \R$, thereby generalizing the classical concept of total positivity. Extending the fundamental example, $K(x,y) = \exp(xy)$, $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$, of a classical totally positive kernel, the hyperdeterminantal total positivity property of the kernel $K(x_1,\ldots,x_{2m}) = \exp(x_1\cdots x_{2m})$, $x_1,\ldots,x_{2m} \in \mathbb{R}$ is established. A hyperdeterminantal Binet-Cauchy argument is applied to derive a generalization of Karlin's Basic Composition Formula, from which several examples of hyperdeterminantal totally positive kernels are constructed. Further generalizations of hyperdeterminantal total positivity by means of the theory of finite reflection groups are described and some open problems are posed.</description>

      <title>Deformations of singularities of meromorphic $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$-connections and meromorphic quadratic differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper contributes to the theory of singularities of meromorphic linear ODEs in traceless $2\times2$ cases, focusing on their deformations and confluences.
  It is divided into two parts:
  The first part addresses individual singularities without imposing restrictions on their type or degeneracy. The main result establishes a correspondence between local formal invariants and jets of meromorphic quadratic differentials. This result is then utilized to describe the parameter space of universal isomonodromic deformation of meromorphic $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$-connections over Riemann surfaces.
  The second part examines the confluence of singularities in a fully general setting, accommodating all forms of degeneracies. It explores the relationship between the geometry of the unfolded Stokes phenomenon and the horizontal and vertical foliations of parametric families of quadratic differentials. The local moduli space is naturally identified with a specific space of local monodromy and Stokes data, presented as a space of representations of certain fundamental groupoids associated with the foliations. This is then used for studying degenerations of isomonodromic deformations in parametric families.</description>

      <title>Matrix valued orthogonal polynomials arising from hexagon tilings with 3x3-periodic weightings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix valued orthogonal polynomials (MVOP) appear in the study of doubly periodic tiling models. Of particular interest is their limiting behavior as the degree tends to infinity. In recent years, MVOP associated with doubly periodic domino tilings of the Aztec diamond have been successfully analyzed. The MVOP related to doubly periodic lozenge tilings of a hexagon are more complicated. In this paper we focus on a special subclass of hexagon tilings with 3x3 periodicity. The special subclass leads to a genus one spectral curve with additional symmetries that allow us to find an equilibrium measure in an external field explicitly. The equilibrium measure gives the asymptotic distribution for the zeros of the determinant of the MVOP. The associated g-functions appear in the strong asymptotic formula for the MVOP that we obtain from a steepest descent analysis of the Riemann-Hilbert problem for MVOP.</description>

      <title>Non-Symmetric Askey--Wilson Shift Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify the shift operators for the symmetric Askey-Wilson polynomials and construct shift operators for the non-symmetric Askey-Wilson polynomials using two decompositions of non-symmetric Askey-Wilson polynomials in terms of symmetric ones. These shift operators are difference-reflection operators, and we discuss the conditions under which they restrict to shift operators for the symmetric Askey-Wilson polynomials. We use them to compute the norms of the non-symmetric Askey-Wilson polynomials and compute their specialisations for $q\to1$. These turn out to be shift operators for the non-symmetric Heckman-Opdam polynomials of type $BC_1$ that have recently been found.</description>

      <title>A family of orthogonal functions on the unit circle and a new multilateral matrix inverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Bailey's very-well-poised $_6\psi_6$ summation, we show that a specific sequence of well-poised bilateral basic hypergeometric $_3\psi_3$ series form a family of orthogonal functions on the unit circle. We further extract a bilateral matrix inverse from Dougall's ${}_2H_2$ summation which we use, in combination with the Pfaff--Saalsch\"utz summation, to derive a summation for a particular bilateral hypergeometric $_3H_3$ series. We finally provide multivariate extensions of the bilateral matrix inverse and the $_3H_3$ summation in the setting of hypergeometric series associated to the root system $A_r$.</description>

      <title>Self-improvement of fractional Hardy inequalities in metric measure spaces via hyperbolic fillings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a self-improvement result for $(\theta,p)$-fractional Hardy inequalities, in both the exponent $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ and the regularity parameter $0&lt;\theta&lt;1$, for bounded domains in doubling metric measure spaces. The key conceptual tool is a Caffarelli-Silvestre-type argument, which relates fractional Sobolev spaces on $Z$ to Newton-Sobolev spaces in the hyperbolic filling $\overline{X}_{\varepsilon}$ of $Z$ via trace results. Using this insight, it is shown that a fractional Hardy inequality in an open subset of $Z$ is equivalent to a classical Hardy inequality in the filling $\overline{X}_{\varepsilon}$. The main result is then obtained by applying a new weighted self-improvement result for $p$-Hardy inequalities. The exponent $p$ can be self-improved by a classical Koskela-Zhong argument, but a new theory of regularizable weights is developed to obtain the self-improvement in the regularity parameter $\theta$. This generalizes a result of Lehrb\"ack and Koskela on self-improvement of $d_\Omega^\beta$-weighted $p$-Hardy inequalities by allowing a much broader class of weights. Using the equivalence of fractional Hardy inequalities with Hardy inequalities in the fillings, we also give new examples of domains satisfying fractional Hardy inequalities.</description>

      <title>Universal projection theorems with applications to multifractal analysis and the dimension of every ergodic measure on self-conformal sets simultaneously</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a universal projection theorem, giving conditions on a parametrized family of maps $\Pi_\lambda : X \to \mathbb{R}^d$ and a collection $M$ of measures on $X$ under which for almost every $\lambda$ equality $\mathrm{dim}_H \Pi_\lambda \mu = \min\{d, \mathrm{dim}_H \mu\}$ holds for all measures $\mu \in M$ simultaneously (i.e. on a full-measure set of $\lambda$'s independent of $\mu$). We require $\Pi_\lambda$ to satisfy a transversality condition and $M$ to satisfy a new condition called relative dimension separability. We also prove that if the Assouad dimension of $X$ is smaller than d, then for almost every $\lambda$, projection $\Pi_\lambda$ is nearly bi-Lipschitz at $\mu$-a.e. $x$, for all measures $\mu \in M$ simultaneously. Our setting can include families of orthogonal projections, natural projections for conformal, non-autonomous or random iterated functions systems.
  As an application, we prove that for a parametrized family of contracting conformal IFS with natural projections $\Pi_\lambda$ satisfying the transversality condition, for almost every parameter $\lambda$ one has $\mathrm{dim}_H \Pi_\lambda \mu = \min\{ d, \frac{h(\mu)}{\chi(\lambda, \mu)} \}$ for all ergodic shift-invariant measures simultaneously.
  We also prove that for self-similar systems on the line with similarity dimension smaller than one, for Lebesgue almost every choice of translations the multifractal formalism holds simultaneously on the full spectrum interval $\left[\min \frac{\log p_i}{\log|\lambda_i|},\max \frac{\log p_i}{\log|\lambda_i|}\right]$ for every self-similar measure.
  We prove that the dimension part of the Marstrand-Mattila projection theorem holds simultaneously for the collection of all ergodic measures on a self-conformal set with the strong separation condition and without any separation for the collection of all Gibbs measures.</description>

      <title>Entropy and Diversity: The Axiomatic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.02113v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This book brings new mathematical rigour to the ongoing vigorous debate on how to quantify biological diversity. The question "what is diversity?" has surprising mathematical depth, and breadth too: this book involves parts of mathematics ranging from information theory, functional equations and probability theory to category theory, geometric measure theory and number theory. It applies the power of the axiomatic method to a biological problem of pressing concern, but the new concepts and theorems are also motivated from a purely mathematical perspective.
  The main narrative thread requires no more than an undergraduate course in analysis. No familiarity with entropy or diversity is assumed.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen-like Schr\"odinger Operators at Low Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.08355v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a Schr\"odinger operator on an asymptotically Euclidean manifold $X$ of dimension at least two, and suppose that the potential is of attractive Coulomb-like type. Using Vasy's second 2nd-microlocal approach, "the Lagrangian approach," we analyze -- uniformly, all the way down to $E=0$ -- the output of the limiting resolvent $R(E\pm i 0) = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0^+} R(E\pm i \epsilon)$. The Coulomb potential causes the output of the low-energy resolvent to possess oscillatory asymptotics which differ substantially from the sorts of asymptotics observed in the short-range case by Guillarmou, Hassell, Sikora, and (more recently) Hintz and Vasy. Specifically, the compound asymptotics at low energy and large spatial scales are more delicate, and the resolvent output is smooth all the way down to $E=0$. In fact, we will construct a compactification of $(0,1]_E\times X$ on which the resolvent output is given by a specified (and relatively complicated) function that oscillates as $r\to\infty$ times something polyhomogeneous. As a corollary, we get complete and compatible asymptotic expansions for solutions to the scattering problem as functions of both position and energy, with a transitional regime.</description>

      <title>The singularities of Selberg- and Dotsenko-Fateev-like integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the meromorphic continuation of certain hypergeometric integrals modeled on the Selberg integral, including the 3-point and 4-point functions of BPZ's minimal models of 2D CFT as described by Felder and Silvotti and Dotsenko and Fateev (the ``Coulomb gas formalism''). This is accomplished via a geometric analysis of the singularities of the integrands. In the case that the integrand is symmetric (as in the Selberg integral itself) or, more generally, what we call ``DF-symmetric,'' we show that a number of apparent singularities are removable, as required for the construction of the minimal models via these methods.</description>
