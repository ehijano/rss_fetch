Abstract: Wave scattering plays a central role for the modeling of complex wave propagation across all corners of science and engineering applications, including electromagnetic, acoustics, seismic and scattering physics. Wave control using time interfaces, where the properties of the medium through with the wave travels rapidly change in time, has opened further opportunities to control wave propagation in both space and time. For acoustic waves, studies on time modulated media have not been reported. In this context, full numerical solution of the wave equation using time interfaces is key to fully understand their potential. When applying time interfaces, the underlying physics of acoustic wave propagation and scattering and their similar roles on time and space, are still being explored. In this work, we introduce a mathematical formulation of the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equations for acoustic wave scattering when time interfaces are induced via a change of the velocity of the medium. We demonstrate that space-time duality for acoustic wave propagation with time interfaces and derive the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equations for wave scattering in time-dependent media, multiple scattering theory, Kirchhoff Helmholtz integrals, Green's functions, reciprocity theorems. We experimentally verify our theoretical derivation by studying and measuring the acoustic wave scattering in strongly scattering media. We illustrate the proposed framework and present results of acoustic wave scattering without prior knowledge of the background wave-fields. This improves the understanding of the generation and wave scattering and opens previously inaccessible research directions, potentially facilitating practical applications for acoustic, geophysical and optical imaging.</description>

      <title>Quantifying uncertainty in inverse scattering problems set in layered environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The attempt to solve inverse scattering problems often leads to optimization and sampling problems that require handling moderate to large amounts of partial differential equations acting as constraints. We focus here on determining inclusions in a layered medium from the measurement of wave fields on the surface, while quantifying uncertainty and addressing the effect of wave solver quality. Inclusions are characterized by a few parameters describing their material properties and shapes. We devise algorithms to estimate the most likely configurations by optimizing cost functionals with Bayesian regularizations and wave constraints. In particular, we design an automatic Levenberg-Marquardt-Fletcher type scheme based on the use of algorithmic differentiation and adaptive finite element meshes for time dependent wave equation constraints with changing inclusions. In synthetic tests with a single frequency, this scheme converges in few iterations for increasing noise levels. To attain a global view of other possible high probability configurations and asymmetry effects we resort to parallelizable affine invariant Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, at the cost of solving a few million wave problems. This forces the use of prefixed meshes. While the optimal configurations remain similar, we encounter additional high probability inclusions influenced by the prior information, the noise level and the layered structure, effect that can be reduced by considering more frequencies. We analyze the effect on the calculations of working with adaptive and fixed meshes, under a simple choice of non-reflecting boundary conditions in truncated layered domains for which we establish wellposedness and convergence results.</description>
