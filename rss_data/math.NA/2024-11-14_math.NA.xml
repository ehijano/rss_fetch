      <title>Jacobi convolution polynomial for Petrov-Galerkin scheme and general fractional calculus of arbitrary order over finite interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, general fractional calculus was introduced by Kochubei (2011) and Luchko (2021) as a further generalisation of fractional calculus, where the derivative and integral operator admits arbitrary kernel. Such a formalism will have many applications in physics and engineering, since the kernel is no longer restricted. We first extend the work of Al-Refai and Luchko (2023) on finite interval to arbitrary orders. Followed by, developing an efficient Petrov-Galerkin scheme by introducing Jacobi convolution polynomials as basis functions. A notable property of this basis function, the general fractional derivative of Jacobi convolution polynomial is a shifted Jacobi polynomial. Thus, with a suitable test function it results in diagonal stiffness matrix, hence, the efficiency in implementation. Furthermore, our method is constructed for any arbitrary kernel including that of fractional operator, since, its a special case of general fractional operator.</description>

      <title>High-order and Mass-conservative Regularized Implicit-explicit relaxation Runge-Kutta methods for the logarithmic Schr\"{o}dinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-differentiability of the singular nonlinearity (such as $f=\ln|u|^2$) at $u=0$ presents significant challenges in devising accurate and efficient numerical schemes for the logarithmic Schr\"{o}dinger equation (LogSE). To address this singularity, we propose an energy regularization technique for the LogSE. For the regularized model, we utilize Implicit-Explicit Relaxation Runge-Kutta methods, which are linearly implicit, high-order, and mass-conserving for temporal discretization, in conjunction with the Fourier pseudo-spectral method in space. Ultimately, numerical results are presented to validate the efficiency of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Quantifying uncertainty in the numerical integration of evolution equations based on Bayesian isotonic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new Bayesian framework for quantifying discretization errors in numerical solutions of ordinary differential equations. By modelling the errors as random variables, we impose a monotonicity constraint on the variances, referred to as discretization error variances. The key to our approach is the use of a shrinkage prior for the variances coupled with variable transformations. This methodology extends existing Bayesian isotonic regression techniques to tackle the challenge of estimating the variances of a normal distribution. An additional key feature is the use of a Gaussian mixture model for the $\log$-$\chi^2_1$ distribution, enabling the development of an efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm for the corresponding posterior.</description>

      <title>Recursive reduction quadrature for the evaluation of Laplace layer potentials in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A high-order quadrature rule is constructed for the evaluation of Laplace single and double layer potentials and their normal derivatives on smooth surfaces in three dimensions. The construction begins with a harmonic approximation of the density {\it on each patch}, which allows for a natural harmonic polynomial extension in a {\it volumetric neighborhood} of the patch. Then by the general Stokes theorem, singular and nearly singular surface integrals are reduced to line integrals preserving the singularity of the kernel, instead of the standard origin-centered 1-forms that often require expensive adaptive integration. These singularity-preserving line integrals can be semi-analytically evaluated using singularity-swap quadrature. In other words, the evaluation of singular and nearly singular surface integrals is reduced to function evaluations on the vertices on the boundary of each patch. The recursive reduction quadrature largely removes adaptive integration that is needed in most existing high-order quadratures for singular and nearly singular surface integrals, leading to improved efficiency and robustness. The algorithmic steps are discussed in detail. The accuracy and efficiency of the recursive reduction quadrature are illustrated via several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Dual-Valued Functions of Dual Matrices with Applications in Causal Emergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual continuation, an innovative insight into extending the real-valued functions of real matrices to the dual-valued functions of dual matrices with a foundation of the G\^ateaux derivative, is proposed. Theoretically, the general forms of dual-valued vector and matrix norms, the remaining properties in the real field, are provided. In particular, we focus on the dual-valued vector $p$-norm $(1\!\leq\! p\!\leq\!\infty)$ and the unitarily invariant dual-valued Ky Fan $p$-$k$-norm $(1\!\leq\! p\!\leq\!\infty)$. The equivalence between the dual-valued Ky Fan $p$-$k$-norm and the dual-valued vector $p$-norm of the first $k$ singular values of the dual matrix is then demonstrated. Practically, we define the dual transitional probability matrix (DTPM), as well as its dual-valued effective information (${\rm{EI_d}}$). Additionally, we elucidate the correlation between the ${\rm{EI_d}}$, the dual-valued Schatten $p$-norm, and the dynamical reversibility of a DTPM. Through numerical experiments on a dumbbell Markov chain, our findings indicate that the value of $k$, corresponding to the maximum value of the infinitesimal part of the dual-valued Ky Fan $p$-$k$-norm by adjusting $p$ in the interval $[1,2)$, characterizes the optimal classification number of the system for the occurrence of the causal emergence.</description>

      <title>General Order Virtual Element Methods for Neumann Boundary Optimal Control Problems in Saddle Point Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the application of the Virtual Element Methods for Neumann boundary Optimal Control Problems in saddle point formulation. The method is proposed for arbitrarily polynomial order of accuracy and general polygonal meshes. Our contribution includes a rigorous a priori error estimate that holds for general polynomial degree. On the numerical side, we present (i) an initial convergence test that reflects our theoretical findings, and (ii) a second test case based on a more application-oriented experiment. For the latter test, we focus on the role of VEM stabilization, conducting a detailed experimental analysis, and proposing an alternative structure-preserving strategy to circumvent issues related to the choice of the stabilization parameter.</description>

      <title>A Deep Uzawa-Lagrange Multiplier Approach for Boundary Conditions in PINNs and Deep Ritz Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08702v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a deep learning-based framework for weakly enforcing boundary conditions in the numerical approximation of partial differential equations. Building on existing physics-informed neural network and deep Ritz methods, we propose the Deep Uzawa algorithm, which incorporates Lagrange multipliers to handle boundary conditions effectively. This modification requires only a minor computational adjustment but ensures enhanced convergence properties and provably accurate enforcement of boundary conditions, even for singularly perturbed problems.
  We provide a comprehensive mathematical analysis demonstrating the convergence of the scheme and validate the effectiveness of the Deep Uzawa algorithm through numerical experiments, including high-dimensional, singularly perturbed problems and those posed over non-convex domains.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transport-Based Displacement Interpolation with Data Augmentation for Reduced Order Modeling of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel reduced-order Model (ROM) that leverages optimal transport (OT) theory and displacement interpolation to enhance the representation of nonlinear dynamics in complex systems. While traditional ROM techniques face challenges in this scenario, especially when data (i.e., observational snapshots) is limited, our method addresses these issues by introducing a data augmentation strategy based on OT principles. The proposed framework generates interpolated solutions tracing geodesic paths in the space of probability distributions, enriching the training dataset for the ROM. A key feature of our approach is its ability to provide a continuous representation of the solution's dynamics by exploiting a virtual-to-real time mapping. This enables the reconstruction of solutions at finer temporal scales than those provided by the original data. To further improve prediction accuracy, we employ Gaussian Process Regression to learn the residual and correct the representation between the interpolated snapshots and the physical solution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology with atmospheric mesoscale benchmarks characterized by highly nonlinear, advection-dominated dynamics. Our results show improved accuracy and efficiency in predicting complex system behaviors, indicating the potential of this approach for a wide range of applications in computational physics and engineering.</description>

      <title>Energy Dissipation Preserving Physics Informed Neural Network for Allen-Cahn Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a numerical solution of Allen-Cahn equation with constant and degenerate mobility, with polynomial and logarithmic energy functionals, with deterministic and random initial functions, and with advective term in one, two, and three spatial dimensions, based on the physics-informed neural network (PINN). To improve the learning capacity of the PINN, we incorporate the energy dissipation property of the Allen-Cahn equation as a penalty term into the loss function of the network. To facilitate the learning process of random initials, we employ a continuous analogue of the initial random condition by utilizing the Fourier series expansion. Adaptive methods from traditional numerical analysis are also integrated to enhance the effectiveness of the proposed PINN. Numerical results indicate a consistent decrease in the discrete energy, while also revealing phenomena such as phase separation and metastability.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of a Variable-Exponent Telegraph Equation Applied to Image Despeckling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a telegraph diffusion model with variable exponents for image despeckling. Moving beyond the traditional assumption of a constant exponent in the telegraph diffusion framework, we explore three distinct variable exponents for edge detection. All of these depend on the gray level of the image or its gradient. We rigorously prove the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions of our model in a functional setting and perform numerical experiments to assess how well it can despeckle noisy gray-level images. We consider both a range of natural images contaminated by varying degrees of artificial speckle noise and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. We finally compare our method with the nonlocal speckle removal technique and find that our model outperforms the latter at speckle elimination and edge preservation.</description>

      <title>Exact Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors for Some n-Dimensional Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on previous work that provided analytical solutions to generalised matrix eigenvalue problems arising from numerical discretisations, this paper develops exact eigenvalues and eigenvectors for a broader class of $n$-dimensional matrices, focusing on non-symmetric and non-persymmetric matrices. These matrices arise in one-dimensional Laplacian eigenvalue problems with mixed boundary conditions and in a few quantum mechanics applications where standard Toeplitz-plus-Hankel matrix forms do not suffice. By extending analytical methodologies to these broader matrix categories, the study not only widens the scope of applicable matrices but also enhances computational methodologies, leading to potentially more accurate and efficient solutions in physics and engineering simulations.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Thresholding Algorithm with Memory for Linear Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relaxed optimal $k$-thresholding pursuit (ROTP) is a recent algorithm for linear inverse problems. This algorithm is based on the optimal $k$-thresholding technique which performs vector thresholding and error metric reduction simultaneously. Although ROTP can be used to solve small to medium-sized linear inverse problems, the computational cost of this algorithm is high when solving large-scale problems. By merging the optimal $k$-thresholding technique and iterative method with memory as well as optimization with sparse search directions, we propose the so-called dynamic thresholding algorithm with memory (DTAM), which iteratively and dynamically selects vector bases to construct the problem solution. At every step, the algorithm uses more than one or all iterates generated so far to construct a new search direction, and solves only the small-sized quadratic subproblems at every iteration. Thus the computational complexity of DTAM is remarkably lower than that of ROTP-type methods. It turns out that DTAM can locate the solution of linear inverse problems if the matrix involved satisfies the restricted isometry property. Experiments on synthetic data, audio signal reconstruction and image denoising demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs comparably to several mainstream thresholding and greedy algorithms, and it works much faster than the ROTP-type algorithms especially when the sparsity level of signal is relatively low.</description>

      <title>Optimal Oblivious Subspace Embeddings with Near-optimal Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An oblivious subspace embedding is a random $m\times n$ matrix $\Pi$ such that, for any $d$-dimensional subspace, with high probability $\Pi$ preserves the norms of all vectors in that subspace within a $1\pm\epsilon$ factor. In this work, we give an oblivious subspace embedding with the optimal dimension $m=\Theta(d/\epsilon^2)$ that has a near-optimal sparsity of $\tilde O(1/\epsilon)$ non-zero entries per column of $\Pi$. This is the first result to nearly match the conjecture of Nelson and Nguyen [FOCS 2013] in terms of the best sparsity attainable by an optimal oblivious subspace embedding, improving on a prior bound of $\tilde O(1/\epsilon^6)$ non-zeros per column [Chenakkod et al., STOC 2024]. We further extend our approach to the non-oblivious setting, proposing a new family of Leverage Score Sparsified embeddings with Independent Columns, which yield faster runtimes for matrix approximation and regression tasks.
  In our analysis, we develop a new method which uses a decoupling argument together with the cumulant method for bounding the edge universality error of isotropic random matrices. To achieve near-optimal sparsity, we combine this general-purpose approach with new traces inequalities that leverage the specific structure of our subspace embedding construction.</description>

      <title>A probabilistic reduced-order modeling framework for patient-specific cardio-mechanical analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardio-mechanical models can be used to support clinical decision-making. Unfortunately, the substantial computational effort involved in many cardiac models hinders their application in the clinic, despite the fact that they may provide valuable information. In this work, we present a probabilistic reduced-order modeling (ROM) framework to dramatically reduce the computational effort of such models while providing a credibility interval. In the online stage, a fast-to-evaluate generalized one-fiber model is considered. This generalized one-fiber model incorporates correction factors to emulate patient-specific attributes, such as local geometry variations. In the offline stage, Bayesian inference is used to calibrate these correction factors on training data generated using a full-order isogeometric cardiac model (FOM). A Gaussian process is used in the online stage to predict the correction factors for geometries that are not in the training data. The proposed framework is demonstrated using two examples. The first example considers idealized left-ventricle geometries, for which the behavior of the ROM framework can be studied in detail. In the second example, the ROM framework is applied to scan-based geometries, based on which the application of the ROM framework in the clinical setting is discussed. The results for the two examples convey that the ROM framework can provide accurate online predictions, provided that adequate FOM training data is available. The uncertainty bands provided by the ROM framework give insight into the trustworthiness of its results. Large uncertainty bands can be considered as an indicator for the further population of the training data set.</description>

      <title>The Kolmogorov N-width for linear transport: Exact representation and the influence of the data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00066v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kolmogorov $N$-width describes the best possible error one can achieve by elements of an $N$-dimensional linear space. Its decay has extensively been studied in Approximation Theory and for the solution of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Particular interest has occurred within Model Order Reduction (MOR) of parameterized PDEs e.g.\ by the Reduced Basis Method (RBM).
  While it is known that the $N$-width decays exponentially fast (and thus admits efficient MOR) for certain problems, there are examples of the linear transport and the wave equation, where the decay rate deteriorates to $N^{-1/2}$. On the other hand, it is widely accepted that a smooth parameter dependence admits a fast decay of the $N$-width. However, a detailed analysis of the influence of properties of the data (such as regularity or slope) on the rate of the $N$-width seems to lack.
  In this paper, we use techniques from Fourier Analysis to derive exact representations of the $N$-width in terms of initial and boundary conditions of the linear transport equation modeled by some function $g$ for half-wave symmetric data. For arbitrary functions $g$, we derive bounds and prove that these bounds are sharp. In particular, we prove that the $N$-width decays as ${c_r N^{-r}}$ for functions {with Sobolev regularity} $g\in H^{r{-\varepsilon}}$ for all $\varepsilon&gt;0$ even if $g\not\in H^{r}$. Our theoretical investigations are complemented by numerical experiments which confirm the sharpness of our bounds and give additional quantitative insight.</description>

      <title>Cost-optimal adaptive FEM with linearization and algebraic solver for semilinear elliptic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider scalar semilinear elliptic PDEs, where the nonlinearity is strongly monotone, but only locally Lipschitz continuous. To linearize the arising discrete nonlinear problem, we employ a damped Zarantonello iteration, which leads to a linear Poisson-type equation that is symmetric and positive definite. The resulting system is solved by a contractive algebraic solver such as a multigrid method with local smoothing. We formulate a fully adaptive algorithm that equibalances the various error components coming from mesh refinement, iterative linearization, and algebraic solver. We prove that the proposed adaptive iteratively linearized finite element method (AILFEM) guarantees convergence with optimal complexity, where the rates are understood with respect to the overall computational cost (i.e., the computational time). Numerical experiments investigate the involved adaptivity parameters.</description>

      <title>Solving Partial Differential Equations Using Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09001v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partial differential equations have a wide range of applications in modeling multiple physical, biological, or social phenomena. Therefore, we need to approximate the solutions of these equations in computationally feasible terms. Nowadays, among the most popular numerical methods for solving partial differential equations in engineering, we encounter the finite difference and finite element methods. An alternative numerical method that has recently gained popularity for numerically solving partial differential equations is the use of artificial neural networks.
  Artificial neural networks, or neural networks for short, are mathematical structures with universal approximation properties. In addition, thanks to the extraordinary computational development of the last decade, neural networks have become accessible and powerful numerical methods for engineers and researchers. For example, imaging and language processing are applications of neural networks today that show sublime performance inconceivable years ago.
  This dissertation contributes to the numerical solution of partial differential equations using neural networks with the following two-fold objective: investigate the behavior of neural networks as approximators of solutions of partial differential equations and propose neural-network-based methods for frameworks that are hardly addressable via traditional numerical methods.
  As novel neural-network-based proposals, we first present a method inspired by the finite element method when applying mesh refinements to solve parametric problems. Secondly, we propose a general residual minimization scheme based on a generalized version of the Ritz method. Finally, we develop a memory-based strategy to overcome a usual numerical integration limitation when using neural networks to solve partial differential equations.</description>

Abstract: Solving parametric Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) for a broad range of parameters is a critical challenge in scientific computing. To this end, neural operators, which \textcolor{black}{predicts the PDE solution with variable PDE parameter inputs}, have been successfully used. However, the training of neural operators typically demands large training datasets, the acquisition of which can be prohibitively expensive. To address this challenge, physics-informed training can offer a cost-effective strategy. However, current physics-informed neural operators face limitations, either in handling irregular domain shapes or in in generalizing to various discrete representations of PDE parameters. In this research, we introduce a novel physics-informed model architecture which can generalize to various discrete representations of PDE parameters and irregular domain shapes. Particularly, inspired by deep operator neural networks, our model involves a discretization-independent learning of parameter embedding repeatedly, and this parameter embedding is integrated with the response embeddings through multiple compositional layers, for more expressivity. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.

      <title>Pathwise uniform convergence of a full discretization for a three-dimensional stochastic Allen-Cahn equation with multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03016v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a full discretization of a three-dimensional stochastic Allen-Cahn equation with multiplicative noise. The discretization uses the Euler scheme for temporal discretization and the finite element method for spatial discretization. A key contribution of this work is the introduction of a novel stability estimate for a discrete stochastic convolution, which plays a crucial role in establishing pathwise uniform convergence estimates for fully discrete approximations of nonlinear stochastic parabolic equations. By using this stability estimate in conjunction with the discrete stochastic maximal $L^p$-regularity estimate, the study derives a pathwise uniform convergence rate that encompasses general general spatial $L^q$-norms. Moreover, the theoretical convergence rate is verified by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Flow updates for domain decomposition of entropic optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain decomposition has been shown to be a computationally efficient distributed method for solving large scale entropic optimal transport problems. However, a naive implementation of the algorithm can freeze in the limit of very fine partition cells (i.e. it asymptotically becomes stationary and does not find the global minimizer), since information can only travel slowly between cells. In practice this can be avoided by a coarse-to-fine multiscale scheme. In this article we introduce flow updates as an alternative approach. Flow updates can be interpreted as a variant of the celebrated algorithm by Angenent, Haker, and Tannenbaum, and can be combined canonically with domain decomposition. We prove convergence to the global minimizer and provide a formal discussion of its continuity limit. We give a numerical comparison with naive and multiscale domain decomposition, and show that the hybrid method does not suffer from freezing in the regime of very many cells. While the multiscale scheme is observed to be faster than the hybrid approach in general, the latter could be a viable alternative in cases where a good initial coupling is available. Our numerical experiments are based on a novel GPU implementation of domain decomposition that we describe in the appendix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mass scaling is widely used in finite element models of structural dynamics for increasing the critical time step of explicit time integration methods. While the field has been flourishing over the years, it still lacks a strong theoretical basis and mostly relies on numerical experiments as the only means of assessment. This contribution thoroughly reviews existing methods and connects them to established linear algebra results to derive rigorous eigenvalue bounds and condition number estimates. Our results cover some of the most successful mass scaling techniques, unraveling for the first time well-known numerical observations.</description>

      <title>Impact of Numerical Fluxes on High Order Semidiscrete WENO-DeC Finite Volume Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The numerical flux determines the performance of numerical methods for solving hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we compare a selection of 8 numerical fluxes in the framework of nonlinear semidiscrete finite volume (FV) schemes, based on Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) spatial reconstruction and Deferred Correction (DeC) time discretization. The methodology is implemented and systematically assessed for order of accuracy in space and time up to seven. The numerical fluxes selected in the present study represent the two existing classes of fluxes, namely centred and upwind. Centred fluxes do not explicitly use wave propagation information, while, upwind fluxes do so from the solution of the Riemann problem via a wave model containing $A$ waves. Upwind fluxes include two subclasses: complete and incomplete fluxes. For complete upwind fluxes, $A=E$, where $E$ is the number of characteristic fields in the exact problem. For incomplete upwind ones, $A&lt;E$. Our study is conducted for the one- and two-dimensional Euler equations, for which we consider the following numerical fluxes: Lax-Friedrichs (LxF), First-Order Centred (FORCE), Rusanov (Rus), Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLL), Central-Upwind (CU), Low-Dissipation Central-Upwind (LDCU), HLLC, and the flux computed through the exact Riemann solver (Ex.RS). We find that the numerical flux has an effect on the performance of the methods. The magnitude of the effect depends on the type of numerical flux and on the order of accuracy of the scheme. It also depends on the type of problem; that is, whether the solution is smooth or discontinuous, whether discontinuities are linear or nonlinear, whether linear discontinuities are fast- or slowly-moving, and whether the solution is evolved for short or long time.</description>

Abstract: Engineering design problems often involve solving parametric Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) under variable PDE parameters and domain geometry. Recently, neural operators have shown promise in learning PDE operators and quickly predicting the PDE solutions. However, training these neural operators typically requires large datasets, the acquisition of which can be prohibitively expensive. To overcome this, physics-informed training offers an alternative way of building neural operators, eliminating the high computational costs associated with Finite Element generation of training data. Nevertheless, current physics-informed neural operators struggle with limitations, either in handling varying domain geometries or varying PDE parameters. In this research, we introduce a novel method, the Physics-Informed Geometry-Aware Neural Operator (PI-GANO), designed to simultaneously generalize across both PDE parameters and domain geometries. We adopt a geometry encoder to capture the domain geometry features, and design a novel pipeline to integrate this component within the existing DCON architecture. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.

      <title>Hybrid finite element implementation of two-potential constitutive modeling of dielectric elastomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dielectric elastomers are increasingly studied for their potential in soft robotics, actuators, and haptic devices. Under time-dependent loading, they dissipate energy via viscous deformation and friction in electric polarization. However, most constitutive models and finite element (FE) implementations consider only mechanical dissipation because mechanical relaxation times are much larger than electric ones. Accounting for electric dissipation is crucial when dealing with alternating electric fields. Ghosh et al. (2021) proposed a fully coupled three-dimensional constitutive model for isotropic, incompressible dielectric elastomers. We critically investigate their numerical scheme for solving the initial boundary value problem (IBVP) describing the time-dependent behavior. We find that their fifth-order explicit Runge-Kutta time discretization may require excessively small or unphysical time steps for realistic simulations due to the stark contrast in mechanical and electric relaxation times. To address this, we present a stable implicit time-integration algorithm that overcomes these constraints. We implement this algorithm with a conforming FE discretization to solve the IBVP and present the mixed-FE formulation implemented in FEniCSx. We demonstrate that the scheme is robust, accurate, and capable of handling finite deformations, incompressibility, and general time-dependent loading. Finally, we validate our code against experimental data for VHB 4910 under complex time-dependent electromechanical loading, as studied by Hossain et al. (2015).</description>
