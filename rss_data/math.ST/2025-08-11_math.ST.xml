      <title>Validity and Power of Heavy-Tailed Combination Tests under Asymptotic Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy-tailed combination tests, such as the Cauchy combination test and harmonic mean p-value method, are widely used for testing global null hypotheses by aggregating dependent p-values. However, their theoretical guarantees under general dependence structures remain limited. We develop a unified framework using multivariate regularly varying copulas to model the joint behavior of p-values near zero. Within this framework, we show that combination tests remain asymptotically valid when the transformation distribution has a tail index $\gamma \leq 1$, with $\gamma = 1$ maximizing power while preserving validity. The Bonferroni test emerges as a limiting case when $\gamma \to 0$ and becomes overly conservative under asymptotic dependence. Consequently, combination tests with $\gamma = 1$ achieve increasing asymptotic power gains over Bonferroni as p-values exhibit stronger lower-tail dependence and signals are not extremely sparse. Our results provide theoretical support for using truncated Cauchy or Pareto combination tests, offering a principled approach to enhance power while controlling false positives under complex dependence.</description>

      <title>Estimating the size of a set using cascading exclusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a finite set, and $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ an i.i.d. uniform sample from $S$. To estimate the size $|S|$, without further structure, one can wait for repeats and use the birthday problem. This requires a sample size of the order $|S|^\frac{1}{2}$. On the other hand, if $S=\{1,2,\ldots,|S|\}$, the maximum of the sample blown up by $n/(n-1)$ gives an efficient estimator based on any growing sample size. This paper gives refinements that interpolate between these extremes. A general non-asymptotic theory is developed. This includes estimating the volume of a compact convex set, the unseen species problem, and a host of testing problems that follow from the question `Is this new observation a typical pick from a large prespecified population?' We also treat regression style predictors. A general theorem gives non-parametric finite $n$ error bounds in all cases.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Estimation For Censored Circular Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the probability density function of a circular random variable subject to censoring. To this end, we propose a fully computable quotient estimator that combines a projection estimator on linear sieves with a method-of-moments approach. We derive an upper bound for its mean integrated squared error and establish convergence rates when the underlying density lies in a Sobolev class. The practical performance of the estimator is illustrated through simulated examples.</description>

      <title>Consistency of variational inference for Besov priors in non-linear inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the variational posterior convergence rates of inverse problems for partial differential equations (PDEs) with parameters in Besov spaces $B_{pp}^\alpha$ ($p \geq 1$) which are modeled naturally in a Bayesian manner using Besov priors constructed via random wavelet expansions with $p$-exponentially distributed coefficients. Departing from exact Bayesian inference, variational inference transforms the inference problem into an optimization problem by introducing variational sets. Building on a refined ``prior mass and testing'' framework, we derive general conditions on PDE operators and guarantee that variational posteriors achieve convergence rates matching those of the exact posterior under widely adopted variational families (Besov-type measures or mean-field families). Moreover, our results achieve minimax-optimal rates over $B^{\alpha}_{pp}$ classes, significantly outperforming the suboptimal rates of Gaussian priors (by a polynomial factor). As specific examples, two typical nonlinear inverse problems, the Darcy flow problems and the inverse potential problem for a subdiffusion equation, are investigated to validate our theory. Besides, we show that our convergence rates of ``prediction'' loss for these ``PDE-constrained regression problems'' are minimax optimal.</description>

      <title>Latent confounding in high-dimensional nonlinear models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the the problem of identifying causal effects given a high-dimensional treatment vector in the presence of low-dimensional latent confounders. We assume a parametric structural causal model in which the outcome is permitted to depend on a sparse linear combination of the treatment vector and confounders nonlinearly. We consider a generalisation of the LAVA estimator of Chernozhukov et al. [2017] for estimating the treatment effects and show that under the so-called `dense confounding' assumption that each confounder can affect a wide range of observed treatment variables, one can estimate the causal parameters at the same rate as possible without confounding. Notably, the results permit a form of weak confounding in that the minimum non-zero singular value of the loading matrix of the confounders can grow more slowly than the $\sqrt{p}$, where $p$ is the dimension of the treatment vector. We further use our generalised LAVA procedure within a generalised covariance measure-based test for edges in a causal DAG in the presence of latent confounding.</description>

      <title>Identifiability of the minimum-trace directed acyclic graph and hill climbing algorithms without strict local optima under weakly increasing error variances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the true underlying directed acyclic graph (DAG) in Gaussian linear structural equation models is identifiable as the minimum-trace DAG when the error variances are weakly increasing with respect to the true causal ordering. This result bridges two existing frameworks as it extends the identifiable cases within the minimum-trace DAG method and provides a principled interpretation of the algorithmic ordering search approach, revealing that its objective is actually to minimize the total residual sum of squares. On the computational side, we prove that the hill climbing algorithm with a random-to-random (R2R) neighborhood does not admit any strict local optima. Under standard settings, we confirm the result through extensive simulations, observing only a few weak local optima. Interestingly, algorithms using other neighborhoods of equal size exhibit suboptimal behavior, having strict local optima and a substantial number of weak local optima.</description>

      <title>Identifiability of Large Phylogenetic Mixtures for Many Phylogenetic Model Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifiability of phylogenetic models is a necessary condition to ensure that the model parameters can be uniquely determined from data. Mixture models are phylogenetic models where the probability distributions in the model are convex combinations of distributions in simpler phylogenetic models. Mixture models are used to model heterogeneity in the substitution process in DNA sequences. While many basic phylogenetic models are known to be identifiable, mixture models in generality have only been shown to be identifiable in certain cases. We expand the main theorem of [Rhodes, Sullivant 2012] to prove identifiability of mixture models in equivariant phylogenetic models, specifically the Jukes-Cantor, Kimura 2-parameter model, Kimura 3-parameter model and the Strand Symmetric model.</description>

      <title>Transversality Methods for Homotopy Groups of Stable Loci in Affine GIT Quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the homotopy groups of stable loci in affine Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT), arising from linear actions of complex reductive algebraic groups on complex affine spaces. Our approach extends the infinite-dimensional transversality framework of Daskalopoulos-Uhlenbeck and Wilkin to this general GIT setting. Central to our method is the construction of a G-equivariant holomorphic vector bundle over the conjugation orbit of a one-parameter subgroup (1-PS), whose fibres are precisely the negative weight spaces determining instability. A key proposition establishes that a naturally defined evaluation map is transverse to the zero section of this bundle, implying that generic homotopies avoid all unstable and strictly semistable strata under certain dimensional inequalities.
  Our result also covers cases where semistability does not coincide with stability. The applicability of this framework is illustrated by several examples. For the 2-Kronecker quiver, our conclusions precisely match the known topology of the stable locus. In linear control theory, where GIT stability corresponds to the notion of controllability, our results determine the connectivity of the space of controllable systems. In statistical modelling, where stability for star-shaped Gaussian model corresponds to the existence of a unique Maximum Likelihood Estimate, we compute the connectivity of the space of data samples that yield such a unique estimate, providing topological insight into the problem of parameter non-identifiability.</description>

      <title>DP-SPRT: Differentially Private Sequential Probability Ratio Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit Wald's celebrated Sequential Probability Ratio Test for sequential tests of two simple hypotheses, under privacy constraints. We propose DP-SPRT, a wrapper that can be calibrated to achieve desired error probabilities and privacy constraints, addressing a significant gap in previous work. DP-SPRT relies on a private mechanism that processes a sequence of queries and stops after privately determining when the query results fall outside a predefined interval. This OutsideInterval mechanism improves upon naive composition of existing techniques like AboveThreshold, potentially benefiting other sequential algorithms. We prove generic upper bounds on the error and sample complexity of DP-SPRT that can accommodate various noise distributions based on the practitioner's privacy needs. We exemplify them in two settings: Laplace noise (pure Differential Privacy) and Gaussian noise (R\'enyi differential privacy). In the former setting, by providing a lower bound on the sample complexity of any $\epsilon$-DP test with prescribed type I and type II errors, we show that DP-SPRT is near optimal when both errors are small and the two hypotheses are close. Moreover, we conduct an experimental study revealing its good practical performance.</description>

      <title>Coverage correlation: detecting singular dependencies between random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the coverage correlation coefficient, a novel nonparametric measure of statistical association designed to quantifies the extent to which two random variables have a joint distribution concentrated on a singular subset with respect to the product of the marginals. Our correlation statistic consistently estimates an $f$-divergence between the joint distribution and the product of the marginals, which is 0 if and only if the variables are independent and 1 if and only if the copula is singular. Using Monge--Kantorovich ranks, the coverage correlation naturally extends to measure association between random vectors. It is distribution-free, admits an analytically tractable asymptotic null distribution, and can be computed efficiently, making it well-suited for detecting complex, potentially nonlinear associations in large-scale pairwise testing.</description>

      <title>A variational approach to dimension-free self-normalized concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the self-normalized concentration of vector-valued stochastic processes. We focus on bounds for sub-$\psi$ processes, a tail condition that encompasses a wide variety of well-known distributions (including sub-exponential, sub-Gaussian, sub-gamma, and sub-Poisson distributions). Our results recover and generalize the influential bound of Abbasi-Yadkori et al. (2011) and fill a gap in the literature between determinant-based bounds and those based on condition numbers. As applications we prove a Bernstein inequality for random vectors satisfying a moment condition (which is more general than boundedness), and also provide the first dimension-free, self-normalized empirical Bernstein inequality. Our techniques are based on the variational (PAC-Bayes) approach to concentration.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to establish Hoeffding and Bernstein type concentration inequalities for weighted sums of exchangeable random variables. A special case is the i.i.d. setting, where random variables are sampled independently from some distribution (and are therefore exchangeable). In contrast to the existing literature on this problem, our results provide a natural unified view of both the i.i.d. and the exchangeable setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two new algorithms, namely, aHOLA and aHOLLA, to sample from high-dimensional target distributions with possibly super-linearly growing potentials. We establish non-asymptotic convergence bounds for aHOLA in Wasserstein-1 and Wasserstein-2 distances with rates of convergence equal to $1+q/2$ and $1/2+q/4$, respectively, under a local H\"{o}lder condition with exponent $q\in(0,1]$ and a convexity at infinity condition on the potential of the target distribution. Similar results are obtained for aHOLLA under certain global continuity conditions and a dissipativity condition. Crucially, we achieve state-of-the-art rates of convergence of the proposed algorithms in the non-convex setting which are higher than those of the existing algorithms. Examples from high-dimensional sampling and logistic regression are presented, and numerical results support our main findings.</description>

      <title>Minmax Exclusivity Classes for Power-Type Loss Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In statistical decision theory, the choice of loss function fundamentally shapes which estimators qualify as optimal. This paper introduces and develops the general concept of exclusivity classes of loss functions: subsets of loss functions such that no estimator can be optimal (according to a specified notion) for losses lying in different classes. We focus on the case of minmax optimality and define minmax exclusivity classes, demonstrating that the classical family of power-type loss functions $L_p(\theta,a) = |\theta - a|^p$ forms such a class. Under standard regularity and smoothness assumptions, we prove that no estimator can be simultaneously minmax for losses belonging to two distinct $L_p$ classes. This result is obtained via a perturbation argument relying on differentiability of risk functionals and the conic structure of loss spaces. We formalize the framework of exclusivity partitions, distinguishing trivial and realizable structures, and analyze their algebraic properties. These results open a broader inquiry into the geometry of estimator optimality, and the potential classification of the loss function space via exclusivity principles.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we address a model selection problem for ergodic jump diffusion processes based on high-frequency samples. We evaluate the expected genuine log-likelihood function and derive an Akaike-type information criterion based on the threshold-based quasi-likelihood function. In the derivation process, we also give new estimates of the transition density of jump diffusion processes. We also provide the relative selection probability of the proposed information criterion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the mean-median-mode triad of univariate centrality measures, the mode has been overlooked for estimating the center of symmetry in continuous and unimodal settings. This paper expands on the connection between kernel mode estimators and M-estimators for location, bridging the gap between the nonparametrics and robust statistics communities. The variance of modal estimators is studied in terms of a bandwidth parameter, establishing conditions for an optimal solution that outperforms the household sample mean. A purely nonparametric approach is adopted, modeling heavy-tailedness through regular variation. The results lead to an estimator proposal that includes a novel one-parameter family of kernels with compact support, offering extra robustness and efficiency. The effectiveness and versatility of the new method are demonstrated in a real-world case study and a thorough simulation study, comparing favorably to traditional and more competitive alternatives. Several myths about the mode are clarified along the way, reopening the quest for flexible and efficient nonparametric estimators.</description>

Abstract: Mediation analysis is a crucial tool for uncovering the mechanisms through which a treatment affects the outcome, providing deeper causal insights and guiding effective interventions. Despite advances in analyzing the mediation effect with fixed/low-dimensional mediators and covariates, our understanding of estimation and inference of mediation functional in the presence of (ultra)-high-dimensional mediators and covariates is still limited. In this paper, we present an estimator for mediation functional in a high-dimensional setting that accommodates the interaction between covariates and treatment in generating mediators, as well as interactions between both covariates and treatment and mediators and treatment in generating the response. We demonstrate that our estimator is $\sqrt{n}$-consistent and asymptotically normal, thus enabling reliable inference on direct and indirect treatment effects with asymptotically valid confidence intervals. A key technical contribution of our work is to develop a multi-step debiasing technique, which may also be valuable in other statistical settings with similar structural complexities where accurate estimation depends on debiasing. We evaluate our proposed methodology through extensive simulation studies and apply it to the TCGA lung cancer dataset to estimate the effect of smoking, mediated by DNA methylation, on the survival time of lung cancer patients.</description>

      <title>Regularity Conditions for Critical Point Convergence</title>

Abstract: We focus on a sequence of functions $\{f_n\}$, defined on a compact manifold with boundary $S$, converging in the $C^k$ metric to a limit $f$. A common assumption implicitly made in the empirical sciences is that when such functions represent random processes derived from data, the topological features of $f_n$ will eventually resemble those of $f$. In this work, we investigate the validity of this claim under various regularity assumptions, with the goal of finding conditions sufficient for the number of local maxima, minima and saddle of such functions to converge. In the $C^1$ setting, we do so by employing lesser-known variants of the Poincar\'{e}-Hopf and mountain pass theorems, and in the $C^2$ setting we pursue an approach inspired by the homotopy-based proof of the Morse Lemma. To aid practical use, we end by reformulating our central theorems in the language of the empirical processes.</description>
