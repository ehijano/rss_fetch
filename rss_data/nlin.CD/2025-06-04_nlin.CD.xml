      <title>Early warning skill, extrapolation and tipping for accelerating cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how nonlinear behaviour (both of forcing in time and of the system itself) can affect the skill of early warning signals to predict tipping in (directionally) coupled bistable systems when using measures based on critical slowing down due to the breakdown of extrapolation. We quantify the skill of early warnings with a time horizon using a receiver-operator methodology for ensembles where noise realisations and parameters are varied to explore the role of extrapolation and how it can break down. We highlight cases where this can occur in an accelerating cascade of tipping elements, where very slow forcing of a slowly evolving ``upstream'' system forces a more rapidly evolving ``downstream'' system. If the upstream system crosses a tipping point, this can shorten the timescale of valid extrapolation. In particular, ``downstream-within-upstream'' tipping will typically have warnings only on a timescale comparable to the duration of the upstream tipping process, rather than the timescale of the original forcing.</description>

      <title>Unifying Framework for Amplification Mechanisms: Criticality, Resonance and Non-Normality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We bring together three key amplification mechanisms in linear dynamical systems: spectral criticality, resonance, and non-normality. We disentangle and quantitatively couple these effects through two fundamental parameters: (i) the spectral distance to a conventional bifurcation or to a resonance and (ii) a non-normal index K (or condition number $\kappa$) that measures the obliqueness of the eigenvectors. Closed-form expressions for the system's response to both Gaussian noise and periodic forcing in the inertial and overdamped regimes reveal a single combining amplification law, represented in universal phase diagrams. By reanalyzing a model of remote earthquake triggering based on breaking of Hamiltonian symmetry, we illustrate how our two-parameter framework significantly expands both the range of conditions under which amplification can occur and the magnitude of the resulting response, revealing a broad pseudo-critical regime associated with large $\kappa$ that previous single-parameter approaches overlooked. Our framework applies broadly -- from seismology to non-Hermitian photonics and ecological networks -- and offers new diagnostic tools to distinguish true critical behavior from transient amplification driven by non-normality.</description>

      <title>Chaotic magnetization dynamics in magnetic Duffing oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a magnetic analogy of the Duffing oscillator--magnetic Duffing oscillator--which is characterized by a double-well magnetic potential of a ferromagnet with a uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. Based on the linear stability analysis of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we show that an external magnetic field applied perpendicular to the magnetic anisotropy field creates an anharmonicity on the magnetic potential, generating homoclinic orbits in the phase space. By evaluating the Lyapunov exponent, we demonstrate that the magnetic Duffing oscillator exhibits chaotic behaviors in the presence of periodically oscillating external forces: Oersted field and spin-orbit torque by considering the ferromagnet/heavy-metal bilayer. We also show that the external magnetic field can be adjusted to generate or modify homoclinic orbits, thereby controlling the parameter range of the oscillating external forces that induce chaos. This work deepens our understanding of chaotic magnetization dynamics by bridging the fields of nonlinear dynamics and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Agile laser wavelength tuning using dynamic targeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tunable lasers are essential and versatile tools in photonics, with applications spanning telecommunications, spectroscopy, and sensing. Advancements have aimed to expand tuning ranges, suppress mode hopping, and enable photonic integration. In this work, we explore the adaptation of dynamic targeting, a technique originally developed to stabilize lasers under optical feedback, as a method for achieving agile, fast, and continuous wavelength tuning. By adjusting the feedback rate and phase, we enable a stable and controlled frequency shift. We experimentally demonstrate reliable and reproducible tuning over 2.1 GHz using a free-space optical setup. Simulations further suggest that this approach could extend the tuning range to tens of GHz, with a potential scan speed exceeding $10^{17}$ Hz/s. These results highlight dynamic targeting as a promising route toward agile frequency control in semiconductor lasers.</description>

      <title>Quantum Systems with jump-discontinuous mass. I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a free quantum particle in one dimension whose mass profile exhibits jump discontinuities. The corresponding Hamiltonian is realised as a self-adjoint extension of the kinetic energy operator formulated in divergence form, with the extension encoded in the boundary conditions at the mass discontinuity points. For a family of scale-free boundary conditions, we analyse the associated spectral problem. We find that the eigenfunctions exhibit a highly sensitive and erratic dependence on the energy, leading to irregular spectral behaviour. Notably, the system supports infinitely many distinct semiclassical limits, each labeled by a point on a spectral curve embedded in the two-torus. These results demonstrate a rich interplay between discontinuous coefficients, boundary data, and spectral asymptotics.</description>
