      <title>Controls on the ocean response to idealized Antarctic meltwater input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antarctic meltwater is expected to increase throughout the coming centuries and impact sea level, ocean circulation, and the coupled climate evolution. This motivates interest in understanding the ocean response to Antarctic freshwater injection, including potential sources of uncertainty. In this study, we use idealized single-basin ocean simulations with meltwater input to examine the dependence of ocean transport and the timescales of the adjustment of regional sea level patterns on: (a) the model resolution and parameter values such as the mesoscale eddy Gent-McWilliams parameterization and vertical diffusivity, thereby partially addressing structural and parametric uncertainty; and (b) the depth of meltwater forcing, which must be prescribed both in our experiments and in most comprehensive climate model simulations, due to a lack of dynamic coupling with an ice sheet model. We find distinct sea level adjustment timescales and changes in the upper and abyssal cells depending on the depth of input, including a near total shutdown of the abyssal cell which only occurs with meltwater injection at the surface. We additionally demonstrate strong connections between the adjustment of key variables, such as regional sea level, and the background stratification in the control simulation, which depends on the model resolution and parameter values. This indicates that the ocean state and physics substantially influence the dynamic ocean response to ice shelf meltwater, in addition to uncertainty in how ocean models interact with fluxes from ice sheets.</description>

      <title>Global Drought Escalation Since 2014: Multivariate Insights for Ecosystem Resilience and Water Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How is climate change altering the global patterns, frequency, and intensity of drought? To investigate this, we analyzed global drought events from 2000-2020 using a composite of hydrological indices ({\Sigma}(ET-P), SSMI, and GRACE-DSI). Our results reveal that near-normal to severe droughts became increasingly widespread after 2014. Unexpectedly, extreme, 100-year return period droughts occurred not only in semi-arid zones but also in high latitude and typically wet regions. The frequency of these rare events increased globally, with durations exceeding 100 days in hotspots like Eurasia. Ecosystem case studies further showed divergent vulnerabilities in carbon and water cycling. These findings underscore an urgent need for region-specific adaptation strategies to enhance resilience against increasingly extreme droughts.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Reconstruction of Significant Wave Heights from Sparse Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution regional significant wave height fields from sparse and uneven buoy observations remains a core challenge for ocean monitoring and risk-aware operations. We introduce AUWave, a hybrid deep learning framework that fuses a station-wise sequence encoder (MLP) with a multi-scale U-Net enhanced by a bottleneck self-attention layer to recover 32$\times$32 regional SWH fields. A systematic Bayesian hyperparameter search with Optuna identifies the learning rate as the dominant driver of generalization, followed by the scheduler decay and the latent dimension. Using NDBC buoy observations and ERA5 reanalysis over the Hawaii region, AUWave attains a minimum validation loss of 0.043285 and a slightly right-skewed RMSE distribution. Spatial errors are lowest near observation sites and increase with distance, reflecting identifiability limits under sparse sampling. Sensitivity experiments show that AUWave consistently outperforms a representative baseline in data-richer configurations, while the baseline is only marginally competitive in the most underdetermined single-buoy cases. The architecture's multi-scale and attention components translate into accuracy gains when minimal but non-trivial spatial anchoring is available. Error maps and buoy ablations reveal key anchor stations whose removal disproportionately degrades performance, offering actionable guidance for network design. AUWave provides a scalable pathway for gap filling, high-resolution priors for data assimilation, and contingency reconstruction.</description>

      <title>S$^2$Transformer: Scalable Structured Transformers for Global Station Weather Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19648v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global Station Weather Forecasting (GSWF) is a key meteorological research area, critical to energy, aviation, and agriculture. Existing time series forecasting methods often ignore or unidirectionally model spatial correlation when conducting large-scale global station forecasting. This contradicts the intrinsic nature underlying observations of the global weather system, limiting forecast performance. To address this, we propose a novel Spatial Structured Attention Block in this paper. It partitions the spatial graph into a set of subgraphs and instantiates Intra-subgraph Attention to learn local spatial correlation within each subgraph, and aggregates nodes into subgraph representations for message passing among the subgraphs via Inter-subgraph Attention -- considering both spatial proximity and global correlation. Building on this block, we develop a multiscale spatiotemporal forecasting model S$^2$Transformer by progressively expanding subgraph scales. The resulting model is both scalable and able to produce structured spatial correlation, and meanwhile, it is easy to implement. The experimental results show that it can achieve performance improvements up to 16.8% over time series forecasting baselines at low running costs.</description>

      <title>Post-processing of wind gusts from COSMO-REA6 with a spatial Bayesian hierarchical extreme value model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this study is to provide a probabilistic gust analysis for the region of Germany that is calibrated with station observations and with an interpolation to unobserved locations. To this end, we develop a spatial Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) for the post-processing of surface maximum wind gusts from the COSMO-REA6 reanalysis. Our approach uses a non-stationary extreme value distribution for the gust observations, with parameters that vary according to a linear model using COSMO-REA6 predictor variables. To capture spatial patterns in surface wind gust behavior, the regression coefficients are modeled as 2-dimensional Gaussian random fields with a constant mean and an isotropic covariance function that depends on the distance between locations. In addition, we include an elevation offset in the distance metric for the covariance function to account for the topography. This allows us to include data from mountaintop stations in the training process. The training of the BHM is carried out with an independent data set from which the data at the station to be predicted are excluded. We evaluate the spatial prediction performance at the withheld station using Brier score and quantile score, including their decomposition, and compare the performance of our BHM to climatological forecasts and a non-hierarchical, spatially constant baseline model. This is done for 109 weather stations in Germany. Compared to the spatially constant baseline model, the spatial BHM significantly improves the estimation of local gust parameters. It shows up to 5 % higher skill for prediction quantiles and provides a particularly improved skill for extreme wind gusts. In addition, the BHM improves the prediction of threshold levels at most of the stations. Although a spatially constant approach already provides high skill, our BHM further improves predictions and improves spatial consistency.</description>

      <title>On the Integration of Spatial-Temporal Knowledge: A Lightweight Approach to Atmospheric Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers have gained attention in atmospheric time series forecasting (ATSF) for their ability to capture global spatial-temporal correlations. However, their complex architectures lead to excessive parameter counts and extended training times, limiting their scalability to large-scale forecasting. In this paper, we revisit ATSF from a theoretical perspective of atmospheric dynamics and uncover a key insight: spatial-temporal position embedding (STPE) can inherently model spatial-temporal correlations even without attention mechanisms. Its effectiveness arises from the integration of geographical coordinates and temporal features, which are intrinsically linked to atmospheric dynamics. Based on this, we propose STELLA, a Spatial-Temporal knowledge Embedded Lightweight modeL for ASTF, utilizing only STPE and an MLP architecture in place of Transformer layers. With 10k parameters and one hour of training, STELLA achieves superior performance on five datasets compared to other advanced methods. The paper emphasizes the effectiveness of spatial-temporal knowledge integration over complex architectures, providing novel insights for ATSF.

      <title>FedRAIN-Lite: Federated Reinforcement Algorithms for Improving Idealised Numerical Weather and Climate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sub-grid parameterisations in climate models are traditionally static and tuned offline, limiting adaptability to evolving states. This work introduces FedRAIN-Lite, a federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) framework that mirrors the spatial decomposition used in general circulation models (GCMs) by assigning agents to latitude bands, enabling local parameter learning with periodic global aggregation. Using a hierarchy of simplified energy-balance climate models, from a single-agent baseline (ebm-v1) to multi-agent ensemble (ebm-v2) and GCM-like (ebm-v3) setups, we benchmark three RL algorithms under different FedRL configurations. Results show that Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) consistently outperforms both static and single-agent baselines, with faster convergence and lower area-weighted RMSE in tropical and mid-latitude zones across both ebm-v2 and ebm-v3 setups. DDPG's ability to transfer across hyperparameters and low computational cost make it well-suited for geographically adaptive parameter learning. This capability offers a scalable pathway towards high-complexity GCMs and provides a prototype for physically aligned, online-learning climate models that can evolve with a changing climate.
