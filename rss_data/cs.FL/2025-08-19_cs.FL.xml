      <title>Programmable Anyon Mobility through Higher Order Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling anyon mobility is critical for robust quantum memory and understanding symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases with subsystem symmetries (e.g., line-like, fractal, chaotic, or mixed supports). However, a unified framework for anyon mobility in SET phases with such diverse geometric patterns of symmetry supports has remained a major challenge. In this Letter, by introducing higher-order cellular automata (HOCA) -- a powerful computer science tool -- to SET physics, we establish a unified approach for complete characterization of anyon mobility induced by the complexity of subsystem symmetries. First, we design finite-depth HOCA-controlled unitary quantum circuits, yielding exactly solvable SET models with Abelian anyons and all possible locally generated subsystem symmetries. Then, we present a theorem that precisely programs all excitation mobilities (fractons, lineons, or fully mobile anyons) directly from the HOCA rule, representing the first complete characterization of anyon mobility in SET phases. As a corollary, this theorem yields symmetry-enriched fusion rules which govern mobility transmutation during fusion. Fusion rules with multiple channels are identified, exhibiting non-Abelian characteristics in Abelian anyon systems. Leveraging HOCA, this Letter opens new avenues for characterization of SET phases of matter and programmability of topological quantum codes.</description>

      <title>Active Learning of Mealy Machines with Timers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02019v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first algorithm for query learning Mealy machines with timers in a black-box context. Our algorithm is an extension of the L# algorithm of Vaandrager et al. to a timed setting. We rely on symbolic queries which empower us to reason on untimed executions while learning. Similarly to the algorithm for learning timed automata of Waga, these symbolic queries can be realized using finitely many concrete queries. Experiments with a prototype implementation show that our algorithm is able to efficiently learn realistic benchmarks.</description>
