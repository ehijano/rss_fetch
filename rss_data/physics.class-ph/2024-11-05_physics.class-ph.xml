      <title>Newtonian restricted three-body gravitational problem with positive and negative point masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Newtonian restricted three-body problem involving a positive primary point mass, $m_+$, and a negative secondary point mass, $m_-$, in a circular orbit, and a positive or negative tertiary point mass, $m_3$, with $m_+ &gt; |m_-| \gg |m_3|$, is solved. Five Lagrange points are found for $m_3$, three of which are coplanar with $m_+$ and $m_-$, and two of which are not, a subtle consequence of the gravitational repulsion from $m_-$. All Lagrange points are linearly unstable, except for one point in the regime $m_+ \gtrsim 8.4 |m_-|$, which is linearly stable and collinear with $m_+$ and $m_-$.</description>

      <title>A More General Linear Projectile Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a full 3D context, we study a projectile subject to linear drag, a non-uniform gravitational field, time-dependent wind, and parameterized atmospheric thinning. In this general context, we provide integral solutions, exact to $\mathcal{ O }( \varepsilon )$, for the position and velocity of the projectile, where $\varepsilon$ is a small perturbation parameter; in the special case of constant wind, we provide closed-form solutions, exact to $\mathcal{ O }( \varepsilon )$. Under the constant-wind assumption, we provide closed-form solutions of $\mathcal{ O }( 1 )$ for the time of tangency, times of flight, and extreme values of the radius achieved by the projectile. We provide physical interpretations throughout, including a physical interpretation of the branches $W_0$ and $W_{ -1 }$ of the Lambert W function in the context of flight time. We also provide parameterized, error-controlled algorithms to compute trajectories, complete with a full Matlab implementation that we make freely available. We compare the results of our implementation to a general-purpose, stiff ODE solver.</description>

      <title>On the Time-Range Dependency of the Beampatterns Produced by Arbitrary Antenna Arrays: Discussions on the Misplaced Expectations from Frequency Diverse Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03508</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.03508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the recent years constructing time-invariant spatial-focusing beampatterns by using frequency diverse arrays (FDAs) is conveyed in several papers. Further than time-invariant spatial-focusing beampatterns, the unfeasibility of constructing range-dependent time-invariant beampatterns is demonstrated in this paper. It is indicated that the beampatterns produced by antenna arrays including FDAs are not independently controllable in time, t, and range, r, dimensions, in the farfield. Inappropriate applications of the FDAs having time-invariant spatial-focusing beampatterns in two recent papers are also discussed.</description>

      <title>A Steady Loop Current Does Not Radiate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to classical electrodynamics, a steady loop current does not radiate. Edward, Kenyon, and Lemon take the approximated electric field equation (the approximation of the magnetic one is trivial) for a moving point charge and show that the electric field of a steady loop current can be partitioned into a static field falling with the square of the distance and a loop integral of an exact differential (also called total differential, full differential, or perfect differential). Thus, no radiation is emitted. Inspired by their work, we do the same to the electric and magnetic fields without approximation.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy in a wire medium resulting from the rectangularity of a unit cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study is focused on the dispersion properties of a wire medium formed by a rectangular lattice of parallel wires at the frequencies close to its plasma frequency. While the effective medium theory predicts isotropic behaviour of transverse magnetic (TM) waves in the structure, numerical simulations reveal noticeable anisotropic properties. This anisotropy is dependent on the lattice rectangularity and reaches over 6% and over 75% along and across the wires respectively for thick wires with the radii about 20 times smaller than the smallest period. This conclusion is confirmed by line-of-current approximation theory. The revealed anisotropy effect is observed when the wavelength at the plasma frequency is comparable to the period of the structure. The effect vanishes in the case of extremely thin wires. A dispersion relation for TM waves in the vicinity of the $\Gamma$-point was obtained in a closed form. This provides an analytical description of the anisotropy effect.</description>
