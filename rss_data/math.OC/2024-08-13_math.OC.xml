      <title>A multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model for supply chain planning of 3D printing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D printing is considered the future of production systems and one of the physical elements of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. 3D printing will significantly impact the product lifecycle, considering cost, energy consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions, leading to the creation of sustainable production systems. Given the importance of these production systems and their effects on the quality of life for future generations, it is expected that 3D printing will soon become one of the global industry's fundamental needs. Although three decades have passed since the emergence of 3D printers, there has not yet been much research on production planning and mass production using these devices. Therefore, we aimed to identify the existing gaps in the planning of 3D printers and to propose a model for planning and scheduling these devices. In this research, several parts with different heights, areas, and volumes have been considered for allocation on identical 3D printers for various tasks. To solve this problem, a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model has been proposed to minimize the earliness and tardiness of parts production, considering their order delivery times, and maximizing machine utilization. Additionally, a method has been proposed for the placement of parts in 3D printers, leading to the selection of the best edge as the height. Using a numerical example, we have plotted the Pareto curve obtained from solving the model using the epsilon constraint method for several parts and analyzed the impact of the method for selecting the best edge as the height, with and without considering it. Additionally, a comprehensive sensitivity and scenario analysis has been conducted to validate the results.</description>

      <title>A new Simheuristics procedure for stochastic combinatorial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ignoring uncertainty in combinatorial optimization leads to suboptimal decisions in practice. Nevertheless, the focus is often on deterministic combinatorial optimization problems, mainly because they are already challenging enough without stochasticity. To make it easier to address stochasticity in combinatorial optimization, Simheuristics have been developed that allow solving stochastic combinatorial optimization problems. We propose a new Simheuristic procedure that dynamically changes the optimization focus between a deterministic and stochastic perspective based upon a statistical model. By doing so, an adequate trade-off is made between exploration and exploitation of the solution space during the optimization. We numerically show that the new Simheuristic procedure solves real-life stochastic scheduling problems more efficiently than standard Simheuristics strategies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an exact algorithm to solve the log-linear continuous (fractional) knapsack problem. The algorithm is based on two lemmas that follow from the application of weak duality theorem and complementary slackness theorem to the linear optimization problem with linear objective function that is associated with any solution of a linear optimization problem with (differentiable) concave objective function.</description>

      <title>Strategic Allocation of Battery Electric Bus Chargers under Stochastic Demand: A Chicago Case Study using Metaheuristic Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bus electrification accelerates the transition towards sustainable urban transportation. Battery-Electric Buses (BEBs) often require periodic recharging intervals between service trips. The strategic placement and allocation of charging equipment are crucial in facilitating operations, optimizing costs, and minimizing downtime. In this study, we develop an optimization framework to address the optimal placement of various charger types at candidate locations under the stochastic charging demand of BEBs. The framework aims to minimize long-term system costs while balancing considerations among station, charger, and value of time expenses. Leveraging existing stochastic location literature, we develop a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) to model the problem. We design an exact solution method to address this computationally challenging problem. The program optimizes the generalized costs associated with building charging stations, allocating charger types, traveling to charging stations, and average queueing and charging times. Queueing dynamics are modeled using an M/M/s queue, with the number of servers as a decision variable at each candidate location and each charger type. The linearization process, which excludes queueing variables, is succeeded by introducing associated constraints through cutting planes. This step guarantees global optimality due to the convexity properties of the problem. To enhance scalability, we implement a genetic algorithm and a simulated annealing metaheuristic and devise heuristic clustering strategies, facilitating the effective resolution of real-world, large-scale instances. Then, we conduct comparative analyses across garage-only, other-only, and mixed-location scenarios.</description>

      <title>Null Controllability of Size-Age Dependent Population Dynamics Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article examines an infinite-dimensional linear control system that describes population models structured by age, size, and spatial position. The control is localized with respect to space, age and size; an estimate of the time required to bring the system to zero is provided. We demonstrate the null controllability of the model using a technique that avoids the explicit use of parabolic Carleman estimates. Instead, this method combines the observability estimates of the final state with the use of characteristics and estimates of the associated semigroup. Furthermore, we extend this work by highlighting the difference in controllability time for two models with different birth kernels.</description>

      <title>Opportunistic Learning for Markov Decision Systems with Application to Smart Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an online method that learns optimal decisions for a discrete time Markov decision problem with an opportunistic structure. The state at time $t$ is a pair $(S(t),W(t))$ where $S(t)$ takes values in a finite set $\mathcal{S}$ of basic states, and $\{W(t)\}_{t=0}^{\infty}$ is an i.i.d. sequence of random vectors that affect the system and that have an unknown distribution. Every slot $t$ the controller observes $(S(t),W(t))$ and chooses a control action $A(t)$. The triplet $(S(t),W(t),A(t))$ determines a vector of costs and the transition probabilities for the next state $S(t+1)$. The goal is to minimize the time average of an objective function subject to additional time average cost constraints. We develop an algorithm that acts on a corresponding virtual system where $S(t)$ is replaced by a decision variable. An equivalence between virtual and actual systems is established by enforcing a collection of time averaged global balance equations. For any desired $\epsilon&gt;0$, we prove the algorithm achieves an $\epsilon$-optimal solution on the virtual system with a convergence time of $O(1/\epsilon^2)$. The actual system runs at the same time, its actions are informed by the virtual system, and its conditional transition probabilities and costs are proven to be the same as the virtual system at every instant of time. Also, its unconditional probabilities and costs are shown in simulation to closely match the virtual system. Our simulations consider online control of a robot that explores a region of interest. Objects with varying rewards appear and disappear and the robot learns what areas to explore and what objects to collect and deliver to a home base.</description>

      <title>Branching with a pre-specified finite list of $k$-sparse split sets for binary MILPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When branching for binary mixed integer linear programs with disjunctions of sparsity level $2$, we observe that there exists a finite list of $2$-sparse disjunctions, such that any other $2$-sparse disjunction is dominated by one disjunction in this finite list. For sparsity level greater than $2$, we show that a finite list of disjunctions with this property cannot exist. This leads to the definition of covering number for a list of splits disjunctions. Given a finite list of split sets $\mathcal{F}$ of $k$-sparsity, and a given $k$-sparse split set $S$, let $\mathcal{F}(S)$ be the minimum number of split sets from the list $\mathcal{F}$, whose union contains $S \cap [0, \ 1]^n$. Let the covering number of $\mathcal{F}$ be the maximum value of $\mathcal{F}(S)$ over all $k$-sparse split sets $S$. We show that the covering number for any finite list of $k$-sparse split sets is at least $\lfloor k/2\rfloor $ for $k \geq 4$. We also show that the covering number of the family of $k$-sparse split sets with coefficients in $\{-1, 0, 1\}$ is upper bounded by $k-1$ for $k \leq 4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the generalized Arimoto-Blahut algorithm to a general function defined over Bregman-divergence system. In existing methods, when linear constraints are imposed, each iteration needs to solve a convex minimization. Exploiting our obtained algorithm, we propose a convex-optimization-free algorithm. This algorithm can be applied to classical and quantum rate-distortion theory. We numerically apply our method to the derivation of the optimal conditional distribution in the rate-distortion theory.</description>

      <title>Approximate Controllability of Fractional Hemivariational Inequalities in Banach Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the approximate controllability of fractional evolution hemivariational inequalities in reflexive Banach spaces involving Caputo fractional derivatives. We first show that the original problem is connected with a fractional differential inclusion problem involving the Clarke subdifferential operator, and then we prove the approximate controllability of the original problem via the approximate controllability of the connected fractional differential inclusion problem. In the meantime, we face the issue of convexity in the multivalued fixed point map due to the nonlinear nature of the duality map in reflexive Banach spaces involved in the expression of the control. We resolve this convexity issue and deduce main result. We also justify the abstract finding of this paper through an example.</description>

      <title>Influence of bovines and rodents in the spread of schistosomiasis across the ricefield-lakescape of Lake Mainit, Philippines: An Optimal Control Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schistosomiasis remains a persistent challenge in tropical freshwater ecosystems, necessitating the development of refined control strategies. Bovines, especially water buffaloes, are commonly used in traditional farming practices across rural areas of the Philippines. Bovines, however, are the biggest reservoir hosts for schistosome eggs, which contribute to the active transmission cycle of schistosomiasis in rice fields. We propose a mathematical model to analyze schistosomiasis dynamics in rice fields near the Lake Mainit in the Philippines, an area known for endemic transmission of schistosomiasis, focusing on human, bovine, and snail populations. Rodents, although considered, were not directly included in the control strategies. Grounded in field data, the model, built on a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, enabled us to derive the basic reproduction number and assess various intervention strategies. The simulation of optimal control scenarios, incorporating chemotherapy, mollusciciding, and mechanical methods, provides a comparative analysis of their efficacies. The results indicated that the integrated control strategies markedly reduced the prevalence of schistosomiasis. This study provides insights into optimal control strategies that are vital for policymakers to design effective, sustainable schistosomiasis control programs, underscored by the necessity to include bovine populations in treatment regimens.</description>

      <title>On the Exactness of SDP Relaxation for Quadratic Assignment Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadratic assignment problem (QAP) is a fundamental problem in combinatorial optimization and finds numerous applications in operation research, computer vision, and pattern recognition. However, it is a very well-known NP-hard problem to find the global minimizer to the QAP. In this work, we study the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) of the QAP and investigate when the SDR recovers the global minimizer. In particular, we consider the two input matrices satisfy a simple signal-plus-noise model, and show that when the noise is sufficiently smaller than the signal, then the SDR is exact, i.e., it recovers the global minimizer to the QAP. It is worth noting that this sufficient condition is purely algebraic and does not depend on any statistical assumption of the input data. We apply our bound to several statistical models such as correlated Gaussian Wigner model. Despite the sub-optimality in theory under those models, empirical studies show the remarkable performance of the SDR. Our work could be the first step towards a deeper understanding of the SDR exactness for the QAP.</description>

      <title>Distributed Computing for Huge-Scale Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study develops an algorithm for distributed computing of linear programming problems of huge-scales. Global consensus with single common variable, multiblocks, and augmented Lagrangian are adopted. The consensus is used to partition the constraints of equality and inequality into multi consensus blocks, and the subblocks of each consensus block are employed to partition the primal variables into $M$ sets of disjoint subvectors. The block-coordinate Gauss-Seidel method, the proximal point method, and ADMM are used to update the primal variables, and descent models used to update the dual. Convergence of the algorithm is analyzed and the rate of convergence of the augmented Lagrangian without penalty to the original constraints, of $O(1/k)$ is obtained.</description>

      <title>The Distributionally Robust Infinite-Horizon LQR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the infinite-horizon Distributionally Robust (DR) linear-quadratic control. While the probability distribution of disturbances is unknown and potentially correlated over time, it is confined within a Wasserstein-2 ball of a radius $r$ around a known nominal distribution. Our goal is to devise a control policy that minimizes the worst-case expected Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR) cost among all probability distributions of disturbances lying in the Wasserstein ambiguity set. We obtain the optimality conditions for the optimal DR controller and show that it is non-rational. Despite lacking a finite-order state-space representation, we introduce a computationally tractable fixed-point iteration algorithm. Our proposed method computes the optimal controller in the frequency domain to any desired fidelity. Moreover, for any given finite order, we use a convex numerical method to compute the best rational approximation (in $H_\infty$-norm) to the optimal non-rational DR controller. This enables efficient time-domain implementation by finite-order state-space controllers and addresses the computational hurdles associated with the finite-horizon approaches to DR-LQR problems, which typically necessitate solving a Semi-Definite Program (SDP) with a dimension scaling with the time horizon. We provide numerical simulations to showcase the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Cislunar Constellation Design for Space Situational Awareness with Time-Expanded Facility Location Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a facility location problem framework for designing satellite constellations to provide Cislunar Space Situational Awareness (CSSA). The problem seeks to find the optimal locations of space-based observers to monitor a user-defined region of cislunar space, represented by a finite set of targets with potentially time-varying observation requirements. The optimization problem is posed as a time-expanded facility location problem (FLP); unlike a traditional FLP that focuses on assigning facilities to clients, the proposed formulation focuses on assigning observers to specific pointing directions from a discretized set. To aid with the solving process of the resulting large-scale binary linear program, a Lagrangean method (LM) based on constraint relaxation and custom heuristics is provided. The performance of the proposed formulation and method is demonstrated with several case studies that obtained CSSA constellations for monitoring the lunar sphere of influence, the cislunar Cone of Shame, and a transit window for low-energy transfers located in the Earth-Moon L2 neck region. The proposed problem formulation, along with the LM, is demonstrated to enable a fast assessment of near-optimal CSSA constellations.</description>

      <title>Complexity of trust-region methods in the presence of unbounded Hessian approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend traditional complexity analyses of trust-region methods for unconstrained, possibly nonconvex, optimization. Whereas most complexity analyses assume uniform boundedness of the model Hessians, we work with potentially unbounded model Hessians. Boundedness is not guaranteed in practical implementations, in particular ones based on quasi-Newton updates such as PSB, BFGS and SR1. Our analysis is conducted for a family of trust-region methods that includes most known methods as special cases. We examine two regimes of Hessian growth: one bounded by a power of the number of successful iterations, and one bounded by a power of the number of iterations. This allows us to formalize and confirm the profound intuition of Powell [IMA J. Numer. Ana. 30(1):289-301,2010], who studied convergence under a special case of our assumptions, but whose proof contained complexity arguments. Specifically, for \(0 \leq p &lt; 1\), we establish sharp \(O(\epsilon^{-2/(1-p)})\) evaluation complexity to find an \(\epsilon\)-stationary point when model Hessians are \(O(k^p)\), where \(k\) is the iteration counter. For \(p = 1\), which is the case studied by Powell, we establish a sharp \(O(\exp(c\epsilon^{-2}))\) evaluation complexity for a certain constant \(c &gt; 0\). This is as Powell suspected and is far worse than other bounds surmised elsewhere in the literature. We establish similar bounds when model Hessians are \(O(|\mathcal{S}_k|^p)\), where \(|\mathcal{S}_k|\) is the number of iterations where the step was accepted, up to iteration \(k\). To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to provide complexity bounds when model Hessians grow linearly with \(|\mathcal{S}_k|\) or at most linearly with \(k\), which covers multiple quasi-Newton approximations.</description>

      <title>A dual notion to BIBO stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider BIBO stability of infinite-dimensional linear state-space systems and the related notion of $L^1$-to-$L^1$ input-output stability (abbreviated LILO). We show that in the case of finite-dimensional input and output spaces, both are equivalent and preserved under duality transformations. In the general case, neither of these properties is satisfied, but BIBO and LILO stability remain dual to each other.</description>

      <title>Optimal Strategy for Stabilizing Protein Folding Intermediates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To manipulate the protein population at certain functional state through chemical stabilizers is crucial for protein-related studies. It not only plays a key role in protein structure analysis and protein folding kinetics, but also affects protein functionality to a large extent and thus has wide applications in medicine, food industry, etc. However, due to concerns about side effects or financial costs of stabilizers, identifying optimal strategies for enhancing protein stability with a minimal amount of stabilizers is of great importance. Here we prove that either for the fixed terminal time (including both finite and infinite cases) or the free one, the optimal control strategy for stabilizing the folding intermediates with a linear strategy for stabilizer addition belongs to the class of Bang-Bang controls. The corresponding optimal switching time is derived analytically, whose phase diagram with respect to several key parameters is explored in detail. The Bang-Bang control will be broken when nonlinear strategies for stabilizer addition are adopted. Our current study on optimal strategies for protein stabilizers not only offers deep insights into the general picture of protein folding kinetics, but also provides valuable theoretical guidance on treatments for protein-related diseases in medicine.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Neural Fog: Interpretable Learning for AC Optimal Power Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) problem is essential for power system operations, but its non-convex nature makes it challenging to solve. A widely used simplification is the linearized DC optimal power flow (DC-OPF) problem, which can be solved to global optimality, but whose optimal solution is always infeasible in the original AC-OPF problem. Recently, neural networks (NN) have been introduced for solving the AC-OPF problem at significantly faster computation times. However, these methods necessitate extensive datasets, are difficult to train, and are often viewed as black boxes, leading to resistance from operators who prefer more transparent and interpretable solutions. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning-based approach that merges simplicity and interpretability, providing a bridge between traditional approximation methods and black-box learning techniques. Our approach not only provides transparency for operators but also achieves competitive accuracy. Numerical results across various power networks demonstrate that our method provides accuracy comparable to, and often surpassing, that of neural networks, particularly when training datasets are limited.</description>

      <title>Gromov's Approximating Tree and the All-Pairs Bottleneck Paths Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a pointed metric space $(X,\mathsf{dist}, w)$ on $n$ points, its Gromov's approximating tree is a 0-hyperbolic pseudo-metric space $(X,\mathsf{dist}_T)$ such that $\mathsf{dist}(x,w)=\mathsf{dist}_T(x,w)$ and $\mathsf{dist}(x, y)-2 \delta \log_2n \leq \mathsf{dist}_T (x, y) \leq \mathsf{dist}(x, y)$ for all $x, y \in X$ where $\delta$ is the Gromov hyperbolicity of $X$. On the other hand, the all pairs bottleneck paths (APBP) problem asks, given an undirected graph with some capacities on its edges, to find the maximal path capacity between each pair of vertices. In this note, we prove:
  $\bullet$ Computing Gromov's approximating tree for a metric space with $n+1$ points from its matrix of distances reduces to solving the APBP problem on an connected graph with $n$ vertices.
  $\bullet$ There is an explicit algorithm that computes Gromov's approximating tree for a graph from its adjacency matrix in quadratic time.
  $\bullet$ Solving the APBP problem on a weighted graph with $n$ vertices reduces to finding Gromov's approximating tree for a metric space with $n+1$ points from its distance matrix.</description>

Abstract: The primary objective of this work is to revisit and revitalize one of the most fundamental models in deterministic inventory management, the continuous-time joint replenishment problem. Our main contribution consists of resolving several long-standing open questions in this context. For most of these questions, we obtain the first quantitative improvement over power-of-$2$ policies and their nearby derivatives, which have been state-of-the-art in terms of provable performance guarantees since the mid-80's.</description>

      <title>Incremental Gauss-Newton Descent for Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a popular technique used to solve problems arising in machine learning. While very effective, SGD also has some weaknesses and various modifications of the basic algorithm have been proposed in order to at least partially tackle them, mostly yielding accelerated versions of SGD. Filling a gap in the literature, we present a modification of the SGD algorithm exploiting approximate second-order information based on the Gauss-Newton approach. The new method, which we call Incremental Gauss-Newton Descent (IGND), has essentially the same computational burden as standard SGD, appears to converge faster on certain classes of problems, and can also be accelerated. The key intuition making it possible to implement IGND efficiently is that, in the incremental case, approximate second-order information can be condensed into a scalar value that acts as a scaling constant of the update. We derive IGND starting from the theory supporting Gauss-Newton methods in a general setting and then explain how IGND can also be interpreted as a well-scaled version of SGD, which makes tuning the algorithm simpler, and provides increased robustness. Finally, we show how IGND can be used in practice by solving supervised learning tasks as well as reinforcement learning problems. The simulations show that IGND can significantly outperform SGD while performing at least as well as SGD in the worst case.</description>

      <title>Exploring Applications of State Space Models and Advanced Training Techniques in Sequential Recommendations: A Comparative Study on Efficiency and Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems aim to estimate the dynamically changing user preferences and sequential dependencies between historical user behaviour and metadata. Although transformer-based models have proven to be effective in sequential recommendations, their state growth is proportional to the length of the sequence that is being processed, which makes them expensive in terms of memory and inference costs. Our research focused on three promising directions in sequential recommendations: enhancing speed through the use of State Space Models (SSM), as they can achieve SOTA results in the sequential recommendations domain with lower latency, memory, and inference costs, as proposed by arXiv:2403.03900 improving the quality of recommendations with Large Language Models (LLMs) via Monolithic Preference Optimization without Reference Model (ORPO); and implementing adaptive batch- and step-size algorithms to reduce costs and accelerate training processes.</description>

      <title>Moderate Exponential-time Quantum Dynamic Programming Across the Subsets for Scheduling Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grover Search is currently one of the main quantum algorithms leading to hybrid quantum-classical methods that reduce the worst-case time complexity for some combinatorial optimization problems. Specifically, the combination of Quantum Minimum Finding (obtained from Grover Search) with dynamic programming has proved particularly efficient in improving the complexity of NP-hard problems currently solved by classical dynamic programming. For these problems, the classical dynamic programming complexity in $\mathcal{O}^*(c^n)$, where $\mathcal{O}^*$ denotes that polynomial factors are ignored, can be reduced by a hybrid algorithm to $\mathcal{O}^*(c_{quant}^n)$, with $c_{quant} &lt; c$. In this paper, we provide a bounded-error hybrid algorithm that achieves such an improvement for a broad class of NP-hard single-machine scheduling problems for which we give a generic description. Moreover, we extend this algorithm to tackle the 3-machine flowshop problem. Our algorithm reduces the exponential-part complexity compared to the best-known classical algorithm, sometimes at the cost of an additional pseudo-polynomial factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the mechanical system associated with rolling a Lorentzian manifold $(M,g)$ of dimension $n+1\geq2$ on flat Lorentzian space $\widehat{M}={\mathbb R}^{n,1}$, without slipping or twisting. Using previous results, it is known that there exists a distribution $\mathcal{D}_R$ of rank $(n+1)$ defined on the configuration space $Q(M,\widehat{M})$ of the rolling system, encoding the no-slip and no-twist conditions. Our objective is to study the problem of complete controllability of the control system associated with $\mathcal{D}_R$. The key lies in examining the holonomy group of the distribution $\mathcal{D}_R$ and, following the approach of \cite{ChKok}, establishing that the rolling problem is completely controllable if and only if the holonomy group of $(M,g)$ equals $SO_0(n,1)$.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification of Spectral Estimator and MLE for Orthogonal Group Synchronization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orthogonal group synchronization aims to recover orthogonal group elements from their noisy pairwise measurements. It has found numerous applications including computer vision, imaging science, and community detection. Due to the orthogonal constraints, it is often challenging to find the least squares estimator in presence of noise. In the recent years, semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and spectral methods have proven to be powerful tools in recovering the group elements. In particular, under additive Gaussian noise, the SDR exactly produces the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), and both MLE and spectral methods are able to achieve near-optimal statistical error. In this work, we take one step further to quantify the uncertainty of the MLE and spectral estimators by considering their distributions. By leveraging the orthogonality constraints in the likelihood function, we obtain a second-order expansion of the MLE and spectral estimator with the leading terms as an anti-symmetric Gaussian random matrix that is on the tangent space of the orthogonal matrix. This also implies state-of-the-art min-max risk bounds as a by-product. Our works provide a general theoretical framework that is potentially useful to find an approximate distribution of the estimators arising from many statistical inference problems with manifold constraints. The numerical experiments confirm our theoretical contribution.</description>

Abstract: We consider an insurance company which faces financial risk in the form of insurance claims and market-dependent surplus fluctuations. The company aims to simultaneously control its terminal wealth (e.g. at the end of an accounting period) and the ruin probability in a finite time interval by purchasing reinsurance. The target functional is given by the expected utility of terminal wealth perturbed by a modified Gerber-Shiu penalty function. We solve the problem of finding the optimal reinsurance strategy and the corresponding maximal target functional via neural networks. The procedure is illustrated by a numerical example, where the surplus process is given by a Cram\'er-Lundberg model perturbed by a mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</description>

Abstract: We study a robust online convex optimization framework, where an adversary can introduce outliers by corrupting loss functions in an arbitrary number of rounds k, unknown to the learner. Our focus is on a novel setting allowing unbounded domains and large gradients for the losses without relying on a Lipschitz assumption. We introduce the Log Exponential Adjusted Robust and iNvex (LEARN) loss, a non-convex (invex) robust loss function to mitigate the effects of outliers and develop a robust variant of the online gradient descent algorithm by leveraging the LEARN loss. We establish tight regret guarantees (up to constants), in a dynamic setting, with respect to the uncorrupted rounds and conduct experiments to validate our theory. Furthermore, we present a unified analysis framework for developing online optimization algorithms for non-convex (invex) losses, utilizing it to provide regret bounds with respect to the LEARN loss, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Scholtes relaxation method for pessimistic bilevel optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.13755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When the lower-level optimal solution set-valued mapping of a bilevel optimization problem is not single-valued, we are faced with an ill-posed problem, which gives rise to the optimistic and pessimistic bilevel optimization problems, as tractable algorithmic frameworks. However, solving the pessimistic bilevel optimization problem is far more challenging than the optimistic one; hence, the literature has mostly been dedicated to the latter class of the problem. The Scholtes relaxation has appeared to be one of the simplest and most efficient ways to solve the optimistic bilevel optimization problem in its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) reformulation or the corresponding more general mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC). Inspired by such a success, this paper studies the potential of the Scholtes relaxation in the context of the pessimistic bilevel optimization problem. To proceed, we consider a pessimistic bilevel optimization problem, where all the functions involved are at least continuously differentiable. Then assuming that the lower-level problem is convex, the KKT reformulation of the problem is considered under the Slater constraint qualification. Based on this KKT reformulation, we introduce the corresponding version of the Scholtes relaxation algorithm. We then construct theoretical results ensuring that the limit of a sequence of global/local optimal solutions (resp. stationary points) of the aforementioned Scholtes relaxation is a global/local optimal solution (resp. stationary point) of the KKT reformulation of the pessimistic bilevel program. The results are accompanied by technical constructions ensuring that the Scholtes relaxation algorithm is well-defined or that the corresponding parametric optimization problem is more tractable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.08579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper deals with concentration inequalities for locally small increments of compound empirical processes. In the asymptotic theory of $m$-estimation such inequalities play an essential role in deriving convergence rates for solutions of the sample average approximation method to solve compound stochastic programs, and in particular for $m$-estimators. We develop inequalities dependent on the sample sizes with explicit terms instead of unspecified universal constants. They are applied to study the Sample Average Approximation method for compound stochastic programs. Nonasymptotic upper estimates for the deviation probabilities of the optimal solutions are derived which are dependent on the sample sizes. They allow to conclude immediately convergence rates for the optimal solutions. In the special case of classical risk neutral stochastic programs, we end up with upper estimates of deviation probabilities for $m$-estimators, and their convergence rates. Moreover, we may also demonstrate how to apply the results to sample average approximation of risk averse stochastic programs. In this respect we consider stochastic programs expressed in terms of absolute semideviations and Average Value at Risk. The investigations are based on concentration inequalities from the recent contribution Kratschmer(2024).</description>

Abstract: Noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers (NISQ computers) are now readily available, motivating many researchers to experiment with Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs). Among them, the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is one of the most popular one studied by the combinatorial optimization community. In this tutorial, we provide a mathematical description of the class of Variational Quantum Algorithms, assuming no previous knowledge of quantum physics from the readers. We introduce precisely the key aspects of these hybrid algorithms on the quantum side (parametrized quantum circuit) and the classical side (guiding function, optimizer). We devote a particular attention to QAOA, detailing the quantum circuits involved in that algorithm, as well as the properties satisfied by its possible guiding functions. Finally, we discuss the recent literature on QAOA, highlighting several research trends.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04790v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the theory of Hilbert direct integrals, we introduce and study a monotonicity-preserving operation, termed the integral resolvent mixture. It combines arbitrary families of monotone operators acting on different spaces and linear operators. As a special case, we investigate the resolvent expectation, an operation which combines monotone operators in such a way that the resulting resolvent is the Lebesgue expectation of the individual resolvents. Along the same lines, we introduce an operation that mixes arbitrary families of convex functions defined on different spaces and linear operators to create a composite convex function. Such constructs have so far been limited to finite families of operators and functions. The subdifferential of the integral proximal mixture is shown to be the integral resolvent mixture of the individual subdifferentials. Applications to the relaxation of systems of composite monotone inclusions are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an enhancement to wholesale electricity markets whereby the exposure of consumers to increasingly large and volatile consumer payments arising as a byproduct of volatile real-time net loads -- i.e., loads minus renewable outputs -- and prices, both compared to day-ahead cleared values. We incorporate a robust estimate of such excess payments into the day-ahead computation and specifically seek to account for volatility in real-time net loads and renewable generation. Our model features a data-driven uncertainty set based on principal component analysis, which accommodates both load and wind production volatility and captures locational correlation of uncertain data. To solve the model more efficiently, we develop a decomposition algorithm that can handle nonconvex subproblems. Our extensive experiments on a realistic NYISO data set show that the risk-aware model protects the consumers from potential high costs caused by adverse circumstances.</description>

This is accomplished by constructing a projection of the gradient of the objective functional onto a subspace tangent to the manifold defined by the constraint. This projection is realized by solving an adjoint problem defined in terms of the same adjoint operator as used in the system employed to determine the gradient, but with a different forcing. We focus on the "optimize-then-discretize" paradigm in the infinite-dimensional setting where the required regularity of both the gradient and of the projection is ensured. The proposed approach is illustrated with two examples: a simple test problem describing optimization of heat transfer in one direction and a more involved problem where an optimal closure is found for a turbulent flow described by the Navier-Stokes system in two dimensions, both considered subject to different state constraints. The accuracy of the gradients and projections computed by solving suitable adjoint systems is carefully verified and the presented computational results show that the solutions of the optimization problems obtained with the proposed approach satisfy the state constraints with a good accuracy, although not exactly.</description>

      <title>An $\alpha$-potential game framework for $N$-player games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes and studies a general form of dynamic $N$-player non-cooperative games called $\alpha$-potential games, where the change of a player's value function upon her unilateral deviation from her strategy is equal to the change of an $\alpha$-potential function up to an error $\alpha$. Analogous to the static potential game (which corresponds to $\alpha=0$), the $\alpha$-potential game framework is shown to reduce the challenging task of finding approximate Nash equilibria for a dynamic game to minimizing the $\alpha$-potential function. Moreover, an analytical characterization of $\alpha$-potential functions is established, with $\alpha$ represented in terms of the magnitude of the asymmetry of value functions' second-order derivatives. For stochastic differential games in which the state dynamic is a controlled diffusion, $\alpha$ is explicitly identified in terms of the number of players, the choice of admissible strategies, and the intensity of interactions and the level of heterogeneity among players. This is achieved by introducing a suitable linear derivative of the value functions with respect to unilateral deviations of strategies and via analyzing the sensitivity processes of state dynamics with respect to controls.
  For games with mean-field type interactions, $\alpha$ is shown to decay to zero as the number of players goes to infinity, even with heterogeneity in state dynamics, cost functions, and admissible strategy classes. For distributed games, if a static potential function can be derived from the cost functions, then $\alpha=0$. For crowd aversion games, $\alpha$ is capable of capturing the subtle difference between the choice of admissible strategies.</description>

      <title>Some Remarks on Controllability of the Liouville Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the work of Roger Brockett on controllability of the Liouville equation, with a particular focus on the following problem: Given a smooth controlled dynamical system of the form $\dot{x} = f(x,u)$ and a state-space diffeomorphism $\psi$, design a feedback control $u(t,x)$ to steer an arbitrary initial state $x_0$ to $\psi(x_0)$ in finite time. This formulation of the problem makes contact with the theory of optimal transportation and with nonlinear controllability. For controllable linear systems, Brockett showed that this is possible under a fairly restrictive condition on $\psi$. We prove that controllability suffices for a much larger class of diffeomorphisms. For nonlinear systems defined on smooth manifolds, we review a recent result of Agrachev and Caponigro regarding controllability on the group of diffeomorphisms. A corollary of this result states that, for control-affine systems satisfying a bracket generating condition, any $\psi$ in a neighborhood of the identity can be implemented using a time-varying feedback control law that switches between finitely many time-invariant flows. We prove a quantitative version which allows us to describe the implementation complexity of the Agrachev-Caponigro construction in terms of a lower bound on the number of switchings.</description>

      <title>Infinite horizon stochastic recursive control problems with jumps: dynamic programming and stochastic verification theorems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of an infinite time horizon stochastic recursive control problem with jumps, where an infinite time horizon stochastic differential equation and backward stochastic differential equation with jumps describes the state process and the cost functional, respectively. By establishing the dynamic programming principle, we relate the value function of the control problem with integral-partial differential equation of HJB type in the sense of viscosity solutions. On the other hand, stochastic verification theorems are also studied to provide sufficient conditions to verify the optimality of the given admissible controls. Such a study is carried out in the framework of classical solutions but also in that of viscosity solutions. Our work emphasizes important differences from the approach for finite time horizon problems. In particular, we have to work in an $L^p$-setting for $p&gt;4$ in order to study the verification theorem in viscosity sense.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Optimization with Coupled Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the decentralized minimization of a separable objective $\sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i(x_i)$, where the variables are coupled through an affine constraint $\sum_{i=1}^n\left(\mathbf{A}_i x_i - b_i\right) = 0$. We assume that the functions $f_i$, matrices $\mathbf{A}_i$, and vectors $b_i$ are stored locally by the nodes of a computational network, and that the functions $f_i$ are smooth and strongly convex.
  This problem has significant applications in resource allocation and systems control and can also arise in distributed machine learning. We propose lower complexity bounds for decentralized optimization problems with coupled constraints and a first-order algorithm achieving the lower bounds. To the best of our knowledge, our method is also the first linearly convergent first-order decentralized algorithm for problems with general affine coupled constraints.</description>

      <title>Volume-preserving geometric shape optimization of the Dirichlet energy using variational neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19064v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the numerical solution of geometric shape optimization problems using neural network-based approaches. This involves minimizing a numerical criterion that includes solving a partial differential equation with respect to a domain, often under geometric constraints like constant volume. Our goal is to develop a proof of concept using a flexible and parallelizable methodology to tackle these problems. We focus on a prototypal problem: minimizing the so-called Dirichlet energy with respect to the domain under a volume constraint, involving a Poisson equation in $\mathbb R^2$. We use physics-informed neural networks (PINN) to approximate the Poisson equation's solution on a given domain and represent the shape through a neural network that approximates a volume-preserving transformation from an initial shape to an optimal one. These processes are combined in a single optimization algorithm that minimizes the Dirichlet energy. One of the significant advantages of this approach is its parallelizable nature, which makes it easy to handle the addition of parameters. Additionally, it does not rely on shape derivative or adjoint calculations. Our approach is tested on Dirichlet and Robin boundary conditions, parametric right-hand sides, and extended to Bernoulli-type free boundary problems. The source code for solving the shape optimization problem is open-source and freely available.</description>

      <title>Efficient Digital Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization Solvers for SAT Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boolean satisfiability (SAT) is a propositional logic problem of determining whether an assignment of variables satisfies a Boolean formula. Many combinatorial optimization problems can be formulated in Boolean SAT logic -- either as k-SAT decision problems or Max k-SAT optimization problems, with conflict-driven (CDCL) solvers being the most prominent. Despite their ability to handle large instances, CDCL-based solvers have fundamental scalability limitations. In light of this, we propose recently-developed quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) solvers as an alternative platform for 3-SAT problems. To utilize them, we implement a 2-step [3-SAT]-[Max 2-SAT]-[QUBO] conversion procedure and present a rigorous proof to explicitly calculate the number of both satisfied and violated clauses of the original 3-SAT instance from the transformed Max 2-SAT formulation. We then demonstrate, through numerical simulations on several benchmark instances, that digital QUBO solvers can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on 78-variable 3-SAT benchmark problems. Our work facilitates the broader use of quantum annealers on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, as well as their quantum-inspired digital counterparts, for solving 3-SAT problems.</description>

      <title>A Single-Loop Finite-Time Convergent Policy Optimization Algorithm for Mean Field Games (and Average-Reward Markov Decision Processes)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of finding an equilibrium of a mean field game (MFG) -- a policy performing optimally in a Markov decision process (MDP) determined by the induced mean field, where the mean field is a distribution over a population of agents and a function of the policy itself. Prior solutions to MFGs are built upon either the contraction assumption on a mean field optimality-consistency operator or strict weak monotonicity. The class of problems satisfying these assumptions represent only a small subset of MFGs, to which any MFG admitting more than one equilibrium does not belong. In this work, we expand the class of solvable MFGs by introducing a "herding condition" and propose a direct gradient-based policy optimization algorithm that provably finds an (not necessarily unique) equilibrium within the class. The algorithm, named Accelerated Single-loop Actor Critic Algorithm for Mean Field Games (ASAC-MFG), is data-driven, single-loop, and single-sample-path. We characterize the finite-time and finite-sample convergence of ASAC-MFG to a mean field equilibrium building on a novel multi-time-scale analysis. We support the theoretical results with illustrative numerical simulations.
  As an additional contribution, we show how the developed novel analysis can benefit the literature on average-reward MDPs. An MFG reduces to a standard MDP when the transition kernel and reward are independent of the mean field. As a byproduct of our analysis for MFGs, we get an actor-critic algorithm for finding the optimal policy in average-reward MDPs, with a convergence guarantee matching the state-of-the-art. The prior bound is derived under the assumption that the Bellman operator is contractive, which never holds in average-reward MDPs. Our analysis removes this assumption.</description>

      <title>Policy Gradient Converges to the Globally Optimal Policy for Nearly Linear-Quadratic Regulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.08431v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear control systems with partial information to the decision maker are prevalent in a variety of applications. As a step toward studying such nonlinear systems, this work explores reinforcement learning methods for finding the optimal policy in the nearly linear-quadratic regulator systems. In particular, we consider a dynamic system that combines linear and nonlinear components, and is governed by a policy with the same structure. Assuming that the nonlinear component comprises kernels with small Lipschitz coefficients, we characterize the optimization landscape of the cost function. Although the cost function is nonconvex in general, we establish the local strong convexity and smoothness in the vicinity of the global optimizer. Additionally, we propose an initialization mechanism to leverage these properties. Building on the developments, we design a policy gradient algorithm that is guaranteed to converge to the globally optimal policy with a linear rate.</description>

      <title>Labeling Methods for Partially Ordered Paths</title>

Abstract: The landscape of applications and subroutines relying on shortest path computations continues to grow steadily. This growth is driven by the undeniable success of shortest path algorithms in theory and practice. It also introduces new challenges as the models and assessing the optimality of paths become more complicated. Hence, multiple recent publications in the field adapt existing labeling methods in an ad hoc fashion to their specific problem variant without considering the underlying general structure: they always deal with multi-criteria scenarios, and those criteria define different partial orders on the paths. In this paper, we introduce the partial order shortest path problem (POSP), a generalization of the multi-objective shortest path problem (MOSP) and in turn also of the classical shortest path problem. POSP captures the particular structure of many shortest path applications as special cases. In this generality, we study optimality conditions or the lack of them, depending on the objective functions' properties. Our final contribution is a big lookup table summarizing our findings and providing the reader with an easy way to choose among the most recent multi-criteria shortest path algorithms depending on their problems' weight structure. Examples range from time-dependent shortest path and bottleneck path problems to the electric vehicle shortest path problem with recharging and complex financial weight functions studied in the public transportation community. Our results hold for general digraphs and, therefore, surpass previous generalizations that were limited to acyclic graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04117v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite Cartesian products of operators play a central role in monotone operator theory and its applications. Extending such products to arbitrary families of operators acting on different Hilbert spaces is an open problem, which we address by introducing the Hilbert direct integral of a family of monotone operators. The properties of this construct are studied and conditions under which the direct integral inherits the properties of the factor operators are provided. The question of determining whether the Hilbert direct integral of a family of subdifferentials of convex functions is itself a subdifferential leads us to introducing the Hilbert direct integral of a family of functions. We establish explicit expressions for evaluating the Legendre conjugate, subdifferential, recession function, Moreau envelope, and proximity operator of such integrals. Next, we propose a duality framework for monotone inclusion problems involving integrals of linearly composed monotone operators and show its pertinence towards the development of numerical solution methods. Applications to inclusion and variational problems are discussed.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Message-Passing and Zeroth-Order Optimization Based Distributed Learning with a Use-Case in Resource Allocation in Communication Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributed learning and adaptation have received significant interest and found wide-ranging applications in machine learning and signal processing. While various approaches, such as shared-memory optimization, multi-task learning, and consensus-based learning (e.g., federated learning and learning over graphs), focus on optimizing either local rewards or a global reward, there remains a need for further exploration of their interconnections. This paper specifically focuses on a scenario where agents collaborate towards a common task (i.e., optimizing a global reward equal to aggregated local rewards) while effectively having distinct individual tasks (i.e., optimizing individual local parameters in a local reward). Each agent's actions can potentially impact other agents' performance through interactions. Notably, each agent has access to only its local zeroth-order oracle (i.e., reward function value) and shares scalar values, rather than gradient vectors, with other agents, leading to communication bandwidth efficiency and agent privacy. Agents employ zeroth-order optimization to update their parameters, and the asynchronous message-passing between them is subject to bounded but possibly random communication delays. This paper presents theoretical convergence analyses and establishes a convergence rate for nonconvex problems. Furthermore, it addresses the relevant use-case of deep learning-based resource allocation in communication networks and conducts numerical experiments in which agents, acting as transmitters, collaboratively train their individual policies to maximize a global reward, e.g., a sum of data rates.</description>

Abstract: We show that buoyancy driven flows can be steered in an arbitrary time towards any state by applying as control only an external temperature profile in a subset of small measure. More specifically, we prove that the 2D incompressible Boussinesq system on the torus is globally approximately controllable via physically localized heating or cooling. In addition, our controls have an explicitly prescribed structure; even without such structural requirements, large data controllability results for Boussinesq flows driven merely by a physically localized temperature profile were so far unknown. The presented method exploits various connections between the model's underlying transport-, coupling-, and scaling mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Distributed Optimization: A Primal-Dual Perspective on Local Steps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In distributed machine learning, efficient training across multiple agents with different data distributions poses significant challenges. Even with a centralized coordinator, current algorithms that achieve optimal communication complexity typically require either large minibatches or compromise on gradient complexity. In this work, we tackle both centralized and decentralized settings across strongly convex, convex, and nonconvex objectives. We first demonstrate that a basic primal-dual method, (Accelerated) Gradient Ascent Multiple Stochastic Gradient Descent (GA-MSGD), applied to the Lagrangian of distributed optimization inherently incorporates local updates, because the inner loops of running Stochastic Gradient Descent on the primal variable require no inter-agent communication. Notably, for strongly convex objectives, (Accelerated) GA-MSGD achieves linear convergence in communication rounds despite the Lagrangian being only linear in the dual variables. This is due to a structural property where the dual variable is confined to the span of the coupling matrix, rendering the dual problem strongly concave. When integrated with the Catalyst framework, our approach achieves nearly optimal communication complexity across various settings without the need for minibatches.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Implicit Gradient Descent for Training Two-Layer Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimization algorithms are crucial in training physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), as unsuitable methods may lead to poor solutions. Compared to the common gradient descent (GD) algorithm, implicit gradient descent (IGD) outperforms it in handling certain multi-scale problems. In this paper, we provide convergence analysis for the IGD in training over-parameterized two-layer PINNs. We first demonstrate the positive definiteness of Gram matrices for some general smooth activation functions, such as sigmoidal function, softplus function, tanh function, and others. Then, over-parameterization allows us to prove that the randomly initialized IGD converges a globally optimal solution at a linear convergence rate. Moreover, due to the distinct training dynamics of IGD compared to GD, the learning rate can be selected independently of the sample size and the least eigenvalue of the Gram matrix. Additionally, the novel approach used in our convergence analysis imposes a milder requirement on the network width. Finally, empirical results validate our theoretical findings.</description>
