      <title>Homological Milnor-Witt modules and Chow-Witt groups over general bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general theory of homological Milnor-Witt cycle modules over an excellent base scheme equipped with a dimension function, extending both Rost's cycle modules and Feld's theory over fields. To any such module we associate a Rost-Schmid type complex whose homology defines a Borel-Moore intersection theory with quadratic coefficients, satisfying homotopy invariance, localization, proper pushforwards, smooth pullbacks, and Gysin morphisms for essentially smoothable lci morphisms.
  Using duality data induced by pinning structures, we define cohomological Milnor-Witt modules and establish a duality equivalence between homological and cohomological theories. As applications, we extend Chow-Witt groups to schemes over general (possibly singular or arithmetic) bases, prove generalized Bloch formulas and representability results, and compute graded Chow-Witt groups over Dedekind schemes of finite type over the integers. In particular, we obtain finiteness results for Chow-Witt and related Milnor-Witt invariants in dimension at most one.</description>

      <title>Additive C*-categories and K-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.14830v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the notions of a multiplier category and the $W^{*}$-envelope of a $C^{*}$-category. We then consider the notion of an orthogonal sum of a (possibly infinite) family of objects in a $C^{*}$-category. Furthermore, we construct reduced crossed products of $C^{*}$-categories with groups. We axiomatize the basic properties of the $K$-theory for $C^{*}$-categories in the notion of a homological functor. We then study various rigidity properties of homological functors in general, and special additional features of the $K$-theory of $C^{*}$-categories. As an application we construct and study interesting functors on the orbit category of a group from $C^{*}$-categorical data.</description>

      <title>Rationality of cycles modulo 2 on products of generically smooth quadrics in characteristic 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A 2022 result of Karpenko establishes a conjecture of Hoffmann-Totaro on the possible values of the first higher isotropy index of an arbitrary anisotropic quadratic form of given dimension over an arbitrary field. For nondegenerate forms, this essentially goes back to a 2003 article of the same author on quadratic forms over fields of characteristic not $2$. To handle the more involved case of degenerate forms in characteristic $2$, Karpenko showed that certain aspects of the algebraic-geometric approach to nondegenerate quadratic forms developed by Karpenko, Merkurjev, Rost, Vishik and others can be adapted to a study of rational cycles modulo $2$ on powers of a given generically smooth quadric. In this paper, we extend this to a broader study of rational cycles modulo $2$ on arbitrary products of generically smooth quadrics in characteristic $2$. A basic objective is to have tools available to study correspondences between general quadrics, in particular, between smooth and non-smooth quadrics. Applications of the theory to the study of degenerate quadratic forms in characteristic $2$ are provided, and a number of open problems on forms of this type are also formulated and discussed.</description>
