      <title>L^2-Betti numbers in prime characteristic and a conjecture of Wise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically study L^2-Betti numbers in zero and prime characteristic and apply them to a conjecture of Wise stating that all towers of a finite 2-complex are non-positive if and only if the second L^2-Betti number vanishes.</description>

      <title>Path homology of circulant digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We organize and extend a set of computations and structural observations about the Grigoryan--Lin--Muranov--Yau (GLMY) path complex of circulant digraphs $\vec{C}_n^S$ and circulant graphs $C_n^S$. Using the shift automorphism $\tau$ and a Fourier decomposition, we reduce many rank computations for the GLMY boundary maps to finite-dimensional $\tau$-eigenspaces. This provides a reusable "symbol-matrix" recipe that highlights (i) the dependence on prime versus composite $n$ and (ii) stability phenomena for certain natural choices of connection sets $S$. Several fully worked examples are included, together with a discussion of how the additive structure of $S$ governs low-dimensional chains and Betti numbers.</description>

      <title>Homological Algebra in Abelian Framed Bicategories: Exact Sequences and Embedding Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce abelian framed bicategories, which are particular framed bicategories that are locally abelian, and show that they are suitable for developing homology and cohomology theories for directed structures. This means in particular that similar exact sequences as the relative homology and Mayer-Vietoris long exact sequences can be shown to hold. Also, for closed monoidal abelian framed bicategories, K\"unneth theorem holds as well. Finally, we prove embedding theorems similar to the Gabriel and Freyd-Mitchell theorems, for particular abelian framed bicategories, allowing to see those as bicategories of bimodules over algebras. This naturally links to the original motivation of this work, which was to generalize directed homology developed in the abelian framed bicategory of bimodules over (path) algebras.</description>

      <title>Rational Homotopy Type of Complements of Submanifold Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05033v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we provide an explicit cdga that controls the rational homotopy type of the complement $X-\cup_i Z_i$, where $X$ is a smooth compact algebraic variety and $\{Z_i\}$ is a collection of subvarieties such that all set-theoretical intersections are smooth. The model is given in terms of the cohomology of all intersections of $Z_i$'s, and the natural maps induced by the inclusions. Our construction is inspired by the work of J.Morgan, who covered the fundamental case where $\{Z_i\}$ is a divisor with normal crossings, and it is built on developments of the theory of mixed Hodge diagrams by Cirici-Horel. We avoid any explicit reduction to the normal crossings divisor case, e.g. via the wonderful compactification of De Concini-Procesi. As an application of our approach we recover and generalize a few separate results on the complements of arrangements in a uniform manner. These include the Kritz-Totaro model for graph configuration spaces, Yuzvinsky's model for affine subspace arrangements and Dupont's model for complements of hypersurfaces with hyperplane-like intersection.</description>

      <title>On the stabilization of the topological complexity of graph braid groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a strong, geometric lower bound on the (sequential) topological complexity of the unordered configuration spaces of a general graph. As an application, we show that, for most graphs, the topological complexity eventually stabilizes at its maximal possible value, a direct analogue of a stability phenomenon in the ordered setting first conjectured by Farber. We estimate the stable range in terms of the number of trivalent vertices.</description>

      <title>Branching space of multipointed d-space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08377v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the notion of short directed path, we introduce the branching space of a multipointed $d$-space. We prove that for any q-cofibrant multipointed $d$-space, it is homeomorphic to the branching space of the q-cofibrant flow obtained by applying the categorization functor. As an application, we deduce a purely topological proof of the invariance of the branching space and of the branching homology of cellular multipointed $d$-spaces up to globular subdivision. By reversing the time direction, the same results are obtained for the merging space and the merging homology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14839v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the notion of short natural directed path, we introduce the homotopy branching space of a precubical set. It is unique only up to homotopy equivalence. We prove that, for any precubical set, it is homotopy equivalent to the branching space of any q-realization, any m-realization and any h-realization of the precubical set as a flow. As an application, we deduce the invariance of the homotopy branching space and of the branching homology up to cubical subdivision. By reversing the time direction, the same results are obtained for the merging space and the merging homology of a precubical set.</description>

      <title>Relative Obstructions and Spectral Diagnostics for Sheaves on Cell Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many structured systems admit locally consistent descriptions that nevertheless fail to globalize when constrained by an ambient reference or feasibility condition. Diagnosing such failures is naturally an evaluative problem: given a fixed model and a grounding, can one determine whether they are structurally compatible, and if not, identify the nature and localization of the obstruction?
  In this work, we introduce a sheaf-theoretic and spectral framework for evaluating structural inconsistency as a \emph{relative} phenomenon. A model is represented by a cellular sheaf $\mathcal F$ on a cell complex, together with a morphism into a grounding sheaf $\mathcal W$ encoding admissible global behavior. Failure of compatibility is captured by the mapping cone of this morphism, whose cohomology computes the relative groups $H^*(K;\mathcal F,\mathcal W)$ and separates intrinsic obstructions from inconsistencies induced by the grounding.
  Beyond exact cohomological classification, we develop \emph{spectral witnesses} derived from regular and mapping-cone Laplacians. The spectra of these operators provide computable, quantitative indicators of inconsistency, encoding both robustness and spatial localization through spectral gaps, integrated energies, and eigenmode support. These witnesses enable comparison of distinct inconsistency mechanisms in fixed systems without learning, optimization, or modification of the underlying representation.
  The proposed framework is domain-agnostic and applies to a broad class of structured models where feasibility is enforced locally but evaluated globally.</description>

      <title>Stable cohomology of universal character varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the universal PGL_n$character variety over M_g whose fiber over a point [C] is the space of PGL_n-local systems on the curve C. We use nonabelian Hodge theory and properties of Saito's mixed Hodge modules to show that the Leray-Serre spectral sequence for the projection to M_g degenerates at E_2. As an application, we prove that the rational cohomology of these varieties stabilizes as g goes to infinity and compute the stable limit. We also deduce similar results for the universal G-character variety over M_{g,1} whose fiber over a punctured curve is the variety of G-local systems with fixed central monodromy around the puncture, for G = GL_n or SL_n.</description>
