      <title>Dynamic link switching induces stable synchronized states in sparse networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flow of information in networked systems composed of multiple interacting elements strongly depends on the level of connectivity among these elements. Sparse connectivity often hinders the emergence of states where information is globally shared, such as fully synchronized states. In this context, dynamically switching the existing network links among the system elements can facilitate the onset of synchronization. However, determining the optimal rate at which links should be switched to ensure asymptotically stable synchronized behavior remains an open question. Here, we address this issue in a double-layer network of FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators with sparse inter-layer connectivity. Specifically, we demonstrate that faster switching of the inter-layer links, which sweeps through a more significant number of oscillators, is more effective in establishing inter-layer synchronization than maintaining links on the identical oscillators for extended durations. We also evaluate the effectiveness of fast-switching links as the layer size increases. In a reduced system, we introduce smooth square-wave functions to emulate link switching, eventually introducing discontinuities into the system dynamics. This approach enables the assessment of the transverse stability of synchronized states induced by switching links.</description>

      <title>The stability of bi-polarization on dynamical directed graphs: an emergent game perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a co-evolutionary model of directed graphs and three opinions, i.e., conservative$(+)$, neutral$(\odot)$ and liberal$(-)$. Agents update both opinions and social relationships with bias. We find that an emergent game suffices to predict the stability of bi-polarization under a rare opinion updating limit and a large system size limit. The bi-polarization is stable if and only if the emergent game has an internal Nash equilibrium. The necessary and sufficient condition is explained by both risk dominance and evolutionary stability. This game approach facilitates us to reveal the stability of bi-polarization in empirical systems. Our work fosters the understanding of opinion formation for controversial topics, and shows a deep connection between opinion dynamics and evolutionary game theory.</description>

      <title>Nonconserved critical dynamics of the two-dimensional Ising model as a surface kinetic roughening process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have revisited the non-conserved (or model A) critical dynamics of the two-dimensional Ising model through numerical simulations of its lattice and continuum formulations --Glauber dynamics and the timedependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equation, respectively--, to analyze them with current tools from surface kinetic roughening. Our study examines two critical quenches, one from an ordered and a different one from a disordered initial state, for both of which we assess the dynamic scaling ansatz, the critical exponent values, and the fluctuation field statistics that occur. Notably, the dynamic scaling ansatz followed by the system strongly depends on the initial condition: a critical quench from the ordered phase follows Family-Vicsek (FV) scaling, while a critical quench from the disordered phase shows an initial overgrowth regime with intrinsic anomalous roughening, followed by relaxation to equilibrium. This behavior is explained in terms of the dynamical instability of the stochastic Ginzburg-Landau equation at the critical temperature, whereby the linearly unstable term is eventually stabilized by nonlinear interactions. For both quenches we have determined the occurrence of probability distribution functions for the field fluctuations, which are time-independent along the non-equilibrium dynamics when suitably normalized by the time-dependent fluctuation amplitude. Additionally, we have developed a related interface model for a field which scales as the space integral of the TDGL field (integral GL model). Numerical simulations of this model reveal either FV or faceted anomalous roughening, depending on the critical quenched performed, as well as an emergent symmetry in the fluctuation statistics for a critical quench from the ordered phase.</description>

      <title>Waveform proportionality and Taylor's law in coupled Lorenz systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10159</link>

Abstract: Taylor's law (TL), a power-law relationship between the mean and variance of a quantity, has been observed across diverse scientific disciplines. Despite its ubiquity, the underlying mechanisms responsible for TL are not yet fully elucidated. In particular, the frequent empirical observation of TL with an exponent 2 warrants further investigation. In a previous study [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 167202 (2025)], we hypothesized that synchronization contributes to the emergence of TL with an exponent 2. To validate this hypothesis, we employed coupled oscillator models, with each oscillator described by a distinct dynamical system: a food chain model, the R\"ossler system, the Brusselator, and the Lorenz system. Our analytical and numerical results demonstrated that strong coupling leads to a form of synchronization wherein time series become proportional to each other, consequently resulting in TL with an exponent 2. Here, we extend our previous findings for the coupled Lorenz system and provide detailed calculations. Our analytical and numerical results demonstrate that, under strong coupling, waveform proportionality and Taylor's law with an exponent 2 emerge not only in the original Lorenz system but also in the generalized and hyperchaotic Lorenz systems.</description>

      <title>Communities in the Kuramoto Model: Dynamics and Detection via Path Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17546v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The behavior of multivariate dynamical processes is often governed by underlying structural connections that relate the components of the system. For example, brain activity, which is often measured via time series is determined by an underlying structural graph, where nodes represent neurons or brain regions and edges cortical connectivity. Existing methods for inferring structural connections from observed dynamics, such as correlation-based or spectral techniques, may fail to fully capture complex relationships in high-dimensional time series in an interpretable way. Here, we propose the use of path signatures, a mathematical framework that encodes geometric and temporal properties of continuous paths, to address this problem. Path signatures provide a reparametrization-invariant characterization of dynamical data and can be used to compute the lead matrix, which reveals lead-lag phenomena. We showcase our approach on time series from coupled oscillators in the Kuramoto model defined on a stochastic block model graph, termed the Kuramoto Stochastic Block Model (KSBM). Using mean-field theory and Gaussian approximations, we analytically derive reduced models of KSBM dynamics in different temporal regimes and theoretically characterize the lead matrix in these settings. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel signature-based community detection algorithm, achieving exact recovery of structural communities from observed time series in multiple KSBM instances. We also explored the performance of our community detection on a stochastic variant of the KSBM as well as on real neuropixels of cortical recordings to demonstrate applicability on real-world data. Our results demonstrate that path signatures provide a novel perspective on analyzing complex neural data and other high-dimensional systems, explicitly exploiting temporal functional relationships to infer underlying structure.</description>

      <title>Dynamical systems on torus related to general Heun equations: phase-lock areas and constriction breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The overdamped Josephson junction in superconductivity is modeled by a family of dynamical systems on two-dimensional torus: the so-called RSJ model. As was discovered by V.M. Buchstaber and S.I. Tertychnyi, this family admits an equivalent description by a family of second order differential equations: special double confluent Heun equations. In the present paper we construct two new families of dynamical systems on torus that can be equivalently described by a family of general Heun equations (GHE), with four singular points, and confluent Heun equations, with three singular points. The first family, related to GHE, is a deformation of the RSJ model, which will be denoted by dRSJ. The phase-lock areas of a family of dynamical systems on torus are those level subsets of the rotation number function that have non-empty interiors. For the RSJ model, V.M. Buchstaber, O.V. Karpov and S.I. Tertychnyi discovered the Rotation Number Quantization Effect: phase-lock areas exist only for integer rotation number values. As was shown by A.V. Klimenko and O.L. Romaskevich, each phase-lock area is a chain of domains separated by points. Those separation points that do not lie in the abscissa axis are called constrictions. In the present paper we study phase-lock areas in the new family dRSJ. The Quantization Effect remains valid in this family. On the other hand, we show that in the new family dRSJ the constrictions break down.</description>
