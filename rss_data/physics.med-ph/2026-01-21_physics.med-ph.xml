      <title>Dose-LET Interactions Predict Capsular Contracture After Proton Postmastectomy Radiation Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pencil beam scanning (PBS) proton therapy provides highly conformal dose distributions that are increasingly leveraged for postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) to reduce cardiopulmonary exposure. However, implant-based reconstruction in the setting of PMRT remains vulnerable to capsular contracture, and biological mechanisms of possible high linear energy transfer (LET) in PBS have not been well characterized. A retrospective case-control study was conducted on consecutive breast cancer patients who underwent mastectomy followed by implant-based reconstruction and proton PMRT (50 Gy in 25 fractions) between 2015 and 2021. Dose-LET volume histograms (DLVHs) were calculated for peri-implant tissue (5-mm shell around the implant). Generalized linear mixed-effects regression (GLMER) was employed to identify DLVH indices significantly associated with capsular contracture. Spearman correlation analysis was used to eliminate redundance. DLVCs were derived from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and validated using support vector machine (SVM)-based normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model. Eight capsular contracture and 16 matched controls patients were analyzed. Three independent and significant DLVH indices were identified(p&lt;0.01). The corresponding DLVCs were: V(55.8 Gy[RBE=1.1], 2.2 keV/{\mu}m) &lt; 0.0033%, V(50.3 Gy[RBE=1.1], 5.4 keV/{\mu}m) &lt; 0.0017%, and V(32.8 Gy[RBE=1.1], 0.9 keV/{\mu}m) &gt; 96.98%. The SVM-based NTCP model achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of 0.867, with 91.7% accuracy, 87.5% sensitivity, and 93.8% specificity. Capsular contracture following proton PMRT is significantly associated with the synergistic interplay between dose and LETd in peri-implant tissue. The derived DLVCs provide actionable dosimetric constraints that can be integrated into treatment planning to minimize capsular contracture risk in proton PMRT.</description>

      <title>Wavefront Shaping of Ultrasound Vortex through the Human Skull Enabled by Binary Acoustic Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound vortices have rapidly expanded their applications to areas like particle trapping, contactless manipulation, acoustic communications. In ultrasonic imaging and therapy involving bone tissues, these vortex beams offer intriguing possibilities but transmitting them through bone (especially the skull) poses challenges. Traditional acoustic lenses were engineered to rectify skull-induced beam aberration, and their capacity was limited to generating only static ultrasound fields within the brain. To overcome this constraint, our study presents a novel method for transcranially steering focused ultrasound vortex using 3D printed binary acoustic metasurfaces (BAMs) with a thickness of 0.8 {\lambda}. We tackled the challenge of skull-induced phase aberration by computing the phase distribution via a time reversal technique, which concurrently enabled the generation of a steerable focused vortex inside an ex vivo human skull by adjusting the operating frequency. Both numerical and simulations experiments were conducted to validate the capabilities of BAMs. Furthermore, we explored the generation of higher-order topological charge acoustic vortices within the brain utilizing the BAM. This development paves the way for designing cost-effective particle-trapping systems, facilitating clot manipulation, and applying acoustic-radiation forces and torques within or across bone structures, thus presenting a new frontier for potential biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>In Vivo Quantification of Arterial Active Mechanics Using Deep Learning-Assisted Pressure-Area Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active arterial mechanics, governed by vascular smooth muscle contraction, are critical to physiological regulation, cardiovascular disease progression, and clinical diagnosis. Although various in vivo methods have been developed to assess arterial stiffness, most cannot distinguish the contribution of smooth muscle tone; therefore, quantitative characterization of arterial activity remains challenging. In this study, we developed a pressure-area analysis framework integrating ultrasound imaging, blood pressure measurement, neural network-based segmentation of arterial cross-sectional area, and biomechanical model-driven inversion to infer active mechanical properties. A total of 233 volunteers (aged 18-65 year) were recruited to acquire cross-sectional ultrasound videos of the right common carotid artery for training the neural network. The segmentation results demonstrate good spatial and temporal performance of the neural network. We further recruited 10 additional volunteers (aged 25 +/- 3 year) to perform a 1-minute step test, followed by pressure-area measurements over a 30-minute recovery period. Using the proposed approach, we quantified post-exercise changes in carotid arterial active mechanics relative to baseline (i.e., the resting state). Results showed that active mechanics remained elevated for approximately 15 minutes compared to baseline (p &lt; 0.05), whereas systolic pressure differed significantly only within the first approximately 5 minutes post-exercise (p &lt; 0.001). These results indicate a dissociation between blood pressure and smooth muscle recovery, which may offer new insight into vascular smooth muscle regulation during physiological stress.</description>

      <title>Toward Ultra-fast Treatments: Large Energy Acceptance Beam Delivery Systems and Opportunities for Proton Beam Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Treatment delivery is largely determined by capabilities of the beam delivery system (BDS), where faster delivery can have many potential benefits including improved dosimetric quality, utility, cost effectiveness, patient throughput and comfort. Despite significant developments in accelerators, delivery methodologies, dose optimisation and more, the energy layer switching time (ELST) is still a persisting limitation in existing BDS. The ELST can contribute significantly to beam delivery time (BDT) and extend treatment times, requiring compensation by optimisation planning approaches, motion mitigation strategies, or active beam modification. This fundamental constraint can be addressed by increasing the narrow energy acceptance range of conventional beamlines to minimise the ELST, enabling ultra-fast delivery. A large energy acceptance (LEA) BDS has the potential to revolutionise PBT through immediate improvements to current treatment delivery and emerging delivery modalities: the complete exploitation of PBT - and unlocking its full potential - can only be made possible with advances in beam delivery technologies. We review the abundant opportunities offered by an ultra-fast BDS: shorter treatment times, reduced motion induced dose degradation, improved effectiveness of motion management techniques, possibilities for volumetric rescanning, bidirectional delivery, further planning optimisation, and novel delivery strategies. We overview the design concepts of several LEA proposals, technology requirements, and also discuss the remaining challenges and considerations with realising a LEA BDS in practice. There are multiple avenues requiring further development and study, however the clinical potential and benefits of this enabling technology are clear: ultra-fast delivery offers both immediate and future improvements to PBT treatments.</description>

      <title>Radio-frequency pulse design in local rotating frame in magnetic resonance imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of spatially selective radio-frequency (RF) pulse design in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is typically stated in the form of determining, analytically or numerically, RF waveforms to be applied in synchrony with one or more predetermined gradient waveforms. In most cases, the dynamics of the nuclear spin magnetization under the RF and gradient fields is described in a global rotating frame that cancels the effect of the static (main) magnetic field B0. In this work, we consider an alternative frame of reference, which can be called a local rotating frame where total longitudinal magnetic field (B0 plus gradient) in every voxel is zero. In this frame, the effect of time-dependent gradient field is integrated out, and the remaining magnetization dynamics, governed by much weaker RF fields, becomes both simpler and slower. We show that recasting existing RF design methods in such a frame provides useful insights and techniques that are not obvious in the conventional description. The methods we consider include (i) two-dimensional spatial RF pulse design in the excitation k-space, (ii) Shinnar-Le Roux RF design, (iii) residual phase calculation in slice-selective excitation, and (iv) iterative and numerical solutions for multi-coil RF pulse design. In particular, we show that the new formalism can substantially reduce the Bloch simulation time which can greatly benefit iterative pulse designs in parallel transmit. In all, the proposed framework provides considerable theoretical insights and practical utility for RF pulse design in MRI.</description>

      <title>Pixelwise Uncertainty Quantification of Accelerated MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parallel imaging techniques reduce magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan time but image quality degrades as the acceleration factor increases. In clinical practice, conservative acceleration factors are chosen because no mechanism exists to automatically assess the diagnostic quality of undersampled reconstructions. This work introduces a general framework for pixel-wise uncertainty quantification in parallel MRI reconstructions, enabling automatic identification of unreliable regions without access to any ground-truth reference image. Our method integrates conformal quantile regression with image reconstruction methods to estimate statistically rigorous pixel-wise uncertainty intervals. We trained and evaluated our model on Cartesian undersampled brain and knee data obtained from the fastMRI dataset using acceleration factors ranging from 2 to 10. An end-to-end Variational Network was used for image reconstruction. Quantitative experiments demonstrate strong agreement between predicted uncertainty maps and true reconstruction error. Using our method, the corresponding Pearson correlation coefficient was higher than 90% at acceleration levels at and above four-fold; whereas it dropped to less than 70% when the uncertainty was computed using a simpler a heuristic notion (magnitude of the residual). Qualitative examples further show the uncertainty maps based on quantile regression capture the magnitude and spatial distribution of reconstruction errors across acceleration factors, with regions of elevated uncertainty aligning with pathologies and artifacts. The proposed framework enables evaluation of reconstruction quality without access to fully-sampled ground-truth reference images. It represents a step toward adaptive MRI acquisition protocols that may be able to dynamically balance scan time and diagnostic reliability.</description>

      <title>VAST: Vascular Flow Analysis and Segmentation for Intracranial 4D Flow MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Four-dimensional (4D) Flow MRI can noninvasively measure cerebrovascular hemodynamics but remains underused clinically because current workflows rely on manual vessel segmentation and yield velocity fields sensitive to noise, artifacts, and phase aliasing. We present VAST (Vascular Flow Analysis and Segmentation), an automated, unsupervised pipeline for intracranial 4D Flow MRI that couples vessel segmentation with physics-informed velocity reconstruction. VAST derives vessel masks directly from complex 4D Flow data by iteratively fusing magnitude- and phase-based background statistics. It then reconstructs velocities via continuity-constrained phase unwrapping, outlier correction, and low-rank denoising to reduce noise and aliasing while promoting mass-consistent flow fields, with processing completing in minutes per case on a standard CPU. We validate VAST on synthetic data from an internal carotid artery aneurysm model across SNR = 2-20 and severe phase wrapping (up to five-fold), on in vitro Poiseuille flow, and on an in vivo internal carotid aneurysm dataset. In synthetic benchmarks, VAST maintains near quarter-voxel surface accuracy and reduces velocity root-mean-square error by up to fourfold under the most degraded conditions. In vitro, it segments the channel within approximately half a voxel of expert annotations and reduces velocity error by 39% (unwrapped) and 77% (aliased). In vivo, VAST closely matches expert time-of-flight masks and lowers divergence residuals by about 30%, indicating a more self-consistent intracranial flow field. By automating processing and enforcing basic flow physics, VAST helps move intracranial 4D Flow MRI toward routine quantitative use in cerebrovascular assessment.</description>

      <title>Circularly polarized light scattering imaging of a cancerous layer creeping under a healthy layer for the diagnosis of early-stage cervical cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Significance: Cervical cancer progresses through cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), which are precursor lesions of cervical cancer. In low-grade CIN, atypical cells generate inside the squamous epithelium, which causes the accuracy of cytodiagnosis for cervical cancer not to be very high. The grade of CIN can be estimated by the depth of atypical cell infiltration from the basal layer to the surface, rather than the abnormality of cells. Therefore, a non-invasive method is required to evaluate the depths of abnormal cells hidden at depths. Aim: Cancerous tissues beneath healthy tissues were experimentally identified by using circularly polarized light scattering (CiPLS). This method enabled the changes in the size of the cell nuclei within the penetration depth in tissue to be investigated. Approach: Artificial unexposed cancerous tissues were prepared that consisted of healthy/cancerous/healthy layers with various thicknesses of the topmost healthy layer and the cancerous layer. A polarization imaging camera with a quarter-wave plate was used to create distribution images of the circular polarization of the scattered light. Results: CiPLS images indicated that the thickness variation of the top healthy layer (the depth of the cancerous layer) caused significant changes in the degree of circular polarization. Conclusions: The depth of unexposed cancer lying within the optical penetration depth can be evaluated using a circular polarization imaging system based on the CiPLS method. These findings will lead to the development of a non-invasive optical diagnostic method for early-stage cervical cancer, potentially improving early detection and treatment outcomes.</description>
