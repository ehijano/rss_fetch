      <title>Abstract computation over first-order structures. Part IIa: Moschovakis' operator and other non-determinisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BSS RAMs over first-order structures help to characterize algorithms for processing objects by means of useful operations and relations. They are the result of a generalization of several types of abstract machines. We want to discuss whether this concept that allows a machine-oriented characterization of algorithms is sufficiently general for describing also other models of computation. Yiannis N. Moschovakis introduced a concept of abstract computability of functions on the basis of recursive definability over first-order structures. Moschovakis' search operator is the counterpart to the operator introduced by Stephen C. Kleene and suitable for structures without computable minima. To compare our concept with Moschovakis' generalization of the theory of recursive functions, we extend the abilities of BSS RAMs by an operator that makes it possible to provide information about computable functions and their inverses in a non-deterministic way. In Part IIb, we compare several non-determinisms, summarize effects resulting from the restriction of guesses to constants, and take into account properties such as the semi-decidability of oracle sets, the semi-decidability of the identity relation, and the recognizability of constants.</description>

      <title>Invariant Bridges Between Four Successive Points: A New Tool for Data Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a simple yet powerful invariant relation connecting four successive terms of a class of exponentially decaying alternating functions. Specifically, for the sequence defined by f(n) = ((1/2)^n + (-1)^n) / n, we prove that the combination [(n-2)f(n-2) + (n-3)f(n-3)] / [n f(n) + (n-1)f(n-1)] is universally equal to 4 for all integers n &gt;= 4. This invariant bridge across four points opens new possibilities for predictive coding, data compression, and error detection. We demonstrate how the relation can be used to reconstruct missing data, verify data integrity, and reduce redundancy in data streams with minimal computational overhead. The simplicity and universality of this invariant make it a promising tool for a wide range of applications in information theory and coding systems.</description>

      <title>A Categorical Integration of Quantifiers:A Higher Category Theoretic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new framework for integrating quantifiers with other logical connectives in a higher-categorical setting. Our method systematically incorporates key coherence conditions-including those akin to the Beck-Chevalley property-and exploits the potential of 2-adjunctions and pseudo-limits. In particular, Theorem 2.1 and Lemma 3.4 establish the central results, showing how the usual view of quantifiers as adjoint functors lifts naturally into a bicategorical context, while Theorem 4.2 and Lemma 4.3 illustrate how this perspective extends to dependent type theories. By making explicit the interplay between substitution and variable binding, we resolve the limitations of conventional approaches and ensure coherence up to canonical isomorphisms. Detailed constructions, coherence diagrams, and a unified schematic overview further highlight the theoretical advantages of our approach, leading to simpler proofs and more robust model integration in categorical logic.</description>

      <title>Classifying group actions on hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a given group $G$, it is natural to ask whether one can classify all isometric $G$-actions on Gromov hyperbolic spaces. We propose a formalization of this problem utilizing the complexity theory of Borel equivalence relations. In this paper, we focus on actions of general type, i.e., non-elementary actions without fixed points at infinity. Our main result is the following dichotomy: for every countable group $G$, either all general type actions of $G$ on hyperbolic spaces can be classified by an explicit invariant ranging in an infinite dimensional projective space or they are unclassifiable in a very strong sense. In terms of Borel complexity theory, we show that the equivalence relation associated with the classification problem is either smooth or $K_\sigma$ complete. Special linear groups $SL_2(F)$, where $F$ is a countable field of characteristic $0$, satisfy the former alternative, while non-elementary hyperbolic (and, more generally, acylindrically hyperbolic) groups satisfy the latter. In the course of proving our main theorem, we also obtain results of independent interest that offer new insights into algebraic and geometric properties of groups admitting general type actions on hyperbolic spaces.</description>

      <title>The Principles of Probability: From Formal Logic to Measure Theory to the Principle of Indifference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a formal system of inductive logic. It uses an infinitary language that allows for countable conjunctions and disjunctions. It is based on a set of nine syntactic rules of inductive inference, and contains classical first-order logic as a special case. We also provide natural, probabilistic semantics, and prove both $\sigma$-compactness and completeness.
  We show that the whole of measure-theoretic probability theory is embedded in this system of inductive logic. The semantic models of inductive logic are probability measures on sets of structures. (Structures are the semantic models of finitary, deductive logic.) Moreover, any probability space, together with a set of its random variables, can be mapped to such a model in a way that gives each outcome, event, and random variable a logical interpretation. This embedding, however, is proper. There are scenarios that are expressible in this system of logic which cannot be formulated in a measure-theoretic probability model.
  The principle of indifference is an idea originating with Laplace. It says, roughly, that if we are "equally ignorant" about two possibilities, then we should assign them the same probability. The principle of indifference has no rigorous formulation in probability. It exists only as a heuristic. Moreover, its use has a problematic history and is prone to apparent paradoxes. Within inductive logic, however, we formulate it rigorously and illustrate its use through a number of examples.
  Many of the ideas in inductive logic have counterparts in measure theory. The principle of indifference, however, does not. Its formulation requires the structure of inductive logic, both its syntactic structure and the semantic structures embedded in its models. As such, it exemplifies the fact that inductive logic is a strictly broader theory of probability than any that is based on measure theory alone.</description>

      <title>Complexities of Well-Quasi-Ordered Substructural Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Substructural logics are formal logical systems that omit familiar structural rules of classical and intuitionistic logic such as contraction, weakening, exchange (commutativity), and associativity. This leads to a resource-sensitive logical framework that has proven influential beyond mathematical logic and its algebraic semantics, across theoretical computer science, linguistics, and philosophical logic. The set of theorems of a substructural logic is recursively enumerable and, in many cases, recursive. These logics also possess an intricate mathematical structure that has been the subject of research for over six decades.
  We undertake a comprehensive study of substructural logics possessing an underlying well-quasi-order (wqo), using established ordinal-indexed fast-growing complexity classes to classify the complexity of their deducibility (quasiequational) and provability (equational) problems. This includes substructural logics with weak variants of contraction and weakening, and logics with weak or even no exchange. We further consider infinitely many axiomatic extensions over the base systems.
  We establish a host of decidability and complexity bounds, many of them tight, by developing new techniques in proof theory, well-quasi-order theory (contributing new length theorems), the algebraic semantics of substructural logics via residuated lattices, algebraic proof theory, and novel encodings of counter machines. Classifying the computational complexity of substructural logics (and the complexity of the word problem and of the equational theory of their algebraic semantics) reveals how subtle variations in their design influence their algorithmic behavior, with the decision problems often reaching Ackermannian or even hyper-Ackermannian complexity.</description>

      <title>On the consistency of NF via Fuzzy Forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a proof of the consistency of the set theory \emph{New Foundations} ($\mathit{NF}$). $\mathit{NF}$'s main idea is to permit very large sets (including the universal set) by restricting set formation to stratified formulas, thereby avoiding the classic set-theoretic paradoxes. Our proof employs the Universal Fuzzy Consistency Theorem ($\mathit{UFCT}$), a new forcing method incorporating concepts from fuzzy logic. A brief outline of the proof can be as follows: (1) we extend $ZF$ to \emph{Fuzzy} $\mathit{ZF}$ with a membership function $\mu$ over $D=\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]$; (2) we define \emph{Unrestricted Fuzzy} $\mathit{NF}$ as $\Sigma$, and (3) we derive a crisp $\mathrm{N}$ model of \emph{Classic} $NF$. Our proof does not depend on Holmes' Tangled Type Theory ($\mathit{TTT}$). It establishes that if $\mathit{ZF}$ is consistent, then $\mathit{NF}$ is also consistent. It achieves that via the chain $\mathit{ZF} \rightarrow$ \emph{Fuzzy} $\mathit{ZF} \rightarrow \Sigma \rightarrow \mathit{NF}$. This method offers a novel perspective connecting fuzzy logic with classic set theory.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of Borel graphs and cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a cohomological criterion for certain decomposition of Borel graphs, which is an analog of Dunwoody's work on accessibility of groups. As an application, we prove that a Borel graph $(X,G)$ with uniformly bounded degrees of cohomological dimension one is Lipschitz equivalent to a Borel acyclic graph on $X$. This gives a new proof of a result of Chen-Poulin-Tao-Tserunyan on Borel graphs with components quasi-isometric to trees.</description>
