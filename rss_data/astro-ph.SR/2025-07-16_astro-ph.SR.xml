      <title>Machine-learning inference of stellar properties using integrated photometric and spectroscopic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar astrophysics relies on diverse observational modalities-primarily photometric light curves and spectroscopic data-from which fundamental stellar properties are inferred. While machine learning (ML) has advanced analysis within individual modalities, the complementary information encoded across modalities remains largely underexploited. We present DESA (Dual Embedding model for Stellar Astrophysics), a novel multi-modal foundation model that integrates light curves and spectra to learn a unified, physically meaningful latent space for stars. DESA first trains separate modality-specific encoders using a hybrid supervised/self-supervised scheme, and then aligns them through DualFormer, a transformer-based cross-modal integration module tailored for astrophysical data. DualFormer combines cross- and self-attention, a novel dual-projection alignment loss, and a projection-space eigendecomposition that yields physically structured embeddings. We demonstrate that DESA significantly outperforms leading unimodal and self-supervised baselines across a range of tasks. In zero- and few-shot settings, DESA's learned representations recover stellar color-magnitude and Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams with high fidelity ($R^2 = 0.92$ for photometric regressions). In full fine-tuning, DESA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for binary star detection (AUC = $0.99$, AP = $1.00$) and stellar age prediction (RMSE = $0.94$ Gyr). As a compelling case, DESA naturally separates synchronized binaries from young stars, two populations with nearly identical light curves, purely from their embedded positions in UMAP space, without requiring external kinematic or luminosity information. DESA thus offers a powerful new framework for multimodal, data-driven stellar population analysis, enabling both accurate prediction and novel discovery.</description>

      <title>Rotation Periods of Candidate Single Late-M Dwarfs in TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the angular momentum evolution of late-M and brown dwarfs differs from the well-known spin-down evolution of hotter stars. Characterizing the distribution of rotation periods of these objects in the solar neighborhood can help elucidate this evolutionary pathway just above, at, and below the hydrogen burning limit. In this paper, we examine 399 candidate single late-M dwarfs with $G - G_{RP} \geq 1.4$ mag ($\gtrsim$M6) using TESS light curves. To determine rotation periods, we employed Lomb-Scargle Periodograms to provide a first estimate of the period, then refined them with a Gaussian Process approach, requiring multi-sector confirmation when available. We found 133 rotation periods, ranging from 2 hours to 6 days, and amplitudes between 0.08% and 2.71%. We find that the observed variability fraction in late-M dwarfs rises with the number of available TESS sectors, approaching an apparent ceiling of ~50%. This likely reflects a detection limit determined by viewing geometry and supports the idea that spot-induced variability is common across the late-M and brown dwarf population. In our comparison with previously published late-M dwarf rotation periods reported, we found consistent results, confirming or updating 31 periods. Our findings expand the number of previously known late-M dwarf periods under 1 day by 76%. Combined with published rotation periods for a broader range of spectral types, we find a lower envelope on the rotation period decreasing from 5 hours at early-M dwarfs to 1 hour at L, T, and Y dwarfs.</description>

      <title>The Rosetta Stone project. III. ALMA synthetic observations of fragmentation in high-mass star-forming clumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical mechanisms that regulate the collapse of high-mass parsec-scale clumps and allow them to form clusters of new stars represent a crucial aspect of star formation. To investigate these mechanisms, we developed the Rosetta Stone project: an end-to-end (simulations-observations) framework that is based on the systematic production of realistic synthetic observations of clump fragmentation and their comparison with real data. In this work, we compare ALMA 1.3mm continuum dust emission observations from the SQUALO survey with a new set of 24 radiative magnetohydrodynamical simulations of high-mass clump fragmentation, post-processed using the CASA software to mimic the observing strategy of SQUALO. The simulations were initialized combining typical values of clump mass (500,1000 solar masses) and radius (~0.4pc) with two levels of turbulence (Mach number of 7,10) and three levels of magnetization (mass-to-flux ratio of ~3,10,100). Following the clump evolution over time with two random seeds projected along three orthogonal directions, we produced a collection of 732 synthetic fields. The synthetic observations of clump fragmentation at ~7000AU revealed between 2 and 14 fragments per field. Among the initial conditions of the simulations, magnetic fields have the largest impact on the fragment multiplicity at these scales. In advanced stages of clump evolution, a lower number of fragments is preferentially associated with magnetized clumps. Fragments identified at ~7000AU correspond to individual or multiple sink particles in ~75% of the cases, suggesting that not all fragments are actively forming stars. Both sinks and fragments accrete mass throughout the whole clump evolution, favoring a scenario in which fragments are not isolated from the environment. Our study demonstrates the importance of synthetic observations in interpreting results from interferometric observations.</description>

      <title>Inactive longitude and superflare in the active single-lined pre-main sequence binary V2279 Cyg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young, solar-like stars in the pre-main sequence (PMS) stage exhibit vigorous magnetic activity that significantly influences their circumstellar environments and the processes of planetary formation and evolution. In binary systems, tidal forces and magnetic interactions can further shape the magnetic geometry. We report a longitudinal preference of star spots, chromospheric activities, and flares in the active single-lined spectroscopic PMS binary system V2279 Cyg, based on long-term photometric observations from \textit{Kepler} and \textit{TESS} alongside spectroscopic data from LAMOST. The system is classified as a weak-line T Tauri binary, with component masses estimated at 0.86 $M_\odot$ and 0.27 $M_\odot$. V2279 Cyg's nearly circular orbit is synchronized with its 4.126-day rotational period. Observations reveal large star spot regions clustered near the far-side hemisphere. Spectroscopic data show strong, double-peak H$\alpha$ emission, the strength of which is highly correlated with star spot distribution, indicating the presence of an active longitude on the primary star. We also mapped the prominence structure co-rotating with the primary star, suggesting a dense structure close to the near-side hemisphere. Furthermore, we identify an inactive longitude of flares during the 4-year \textit{Kepler} observations, where the frequency of flare activity is significantly reduced after the superior conjunction, marking the first such identification in active binary systems. Additionally, a white light superflare, releasing energy of $2.5 \times 10^{37}$ erg, was detected in \textit{TESS} observations. These findings provide valuable insights into the magnetic field geometry and dynamo processes in PMS binaries, underscoring the critical role of tidal interactions in shaping magnetic activities.</description>

      <title>A new framework of multidimensional pulsating stellar envelopes I.: Properties of turbulent convection in static RR Lyrae envelope models with SPHERLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The one-dimensional treatment of turbulent convection had large successes until the early 2000s. However, the recent abundance and precision of observational data shows that this problem is far from solved. A modern approach should be developed by using multidimensional models.
  Aims. We established a new theoretical framework for comparison between one-dimensional and multidimensional convection models by mapping the two-dimensional structure of the convective zone and optimizing the modeling parameters of the SPHERLS code.
  Methods. We constructed a series of static envelope models for the same RR Lyrae stars, but with different horizontal sizes and resolutions. We then used a series of statistical methods to quantify the sizes of convective eddies, map the energy cascade, and describe the different structural parts of the convective zone. These include integral length scales, Fourier series, and the determination of the convective flux through horizontal averaging.
  Results. The structure of the convective zone depends significantly on the model size, below an angular size of $9^\circ$. The horizontal resolution of earlier studies is adequate to describe the granulation pattern in the large eddy simulation approach. In quasi-static RR Lyrae stars, the convective zone consists of two distinct dynamically unstable regions that are loosely connected. Approximately half of the convective flux is supplied by the transport of ionization energy in the partial hydrogen ionization zone.
  Conclusions. The 2D models presented in this work with the described size and resolution parameters can be used for comparison against 1D models. The structure of the convective zone urges reconsideration of some recent approaches to describe the convective flux currently used in radial stellar pulsation codes, which will be addressed in a separate paper.</description>

      <title>Transition radiation in dusty novae with non-thermal radio emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition radiation is produced when a relativistic charged particle enters or leaves a solid medium. The electrons that produce synchrotron radiation may interact with the dust in circumstellar environments, leading to the emission of transition radiation. We explore the production of transition radiation in dusty novae that also display synchrotron radiation emission. Transition radiation is emitted in the hard ultra-violet/X-ray range. We suggest that, even when the transition radiation is not itself directly observable, it may have a role in determining the ionisation balance of, and grain heating in, nova ejecta. Furthermore, it may be important in other dusty environments (such as supernova remnants) with non-thermal radio emission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note complements the article on X-ray and infrared variability of the X-ray binary Cyg X-3 (WR+c), published by me and my co-authors (ApJ, v.926, p. 123, 2022). In that paper, a compact IR source was discovered in the system, located in the vicinity of the X-ray source associated with the relativistic companion. In the current note I refine the possible location of the IR source based on simple qualitative considerations.</description>

      <title>Oscillations of hypothetical strange stars as an efficient source ultra-high-energy particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical behavior of strange quark matter (SQM) objects, such as stars and planets, when subjected to radial oscillations induced by tidal interactions in stellar systems. Our study demonstrates that SQM objects can efficiently convert mechanical energy into hadronic energy due to the critical mass density at their surfaces of 4.7*10^{14} g/cm^3, below which SQM becomes unstable and decays into photons, hadrons, and leptons. We show that even small-amplitude radial oscillations, with a radius change of as little as 0.1%, can result in significant excitation energies near the surface of SQM stars. This excitation energy is rapidly converted into electromagnetic energy over short timescales approximately 1 ms, potentially leading to observable astrophysical phenomena. Higher amplitude oscillations may cause fragmentation or dissolution of SQM stars, which has important implications for the evolution of binary systems containing SQM objects and the emission of gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Mass Inclination Degeneracy of Radial Velocity Measurements via Monitoring von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai Cycles: Implications in the HD 41004 System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical stability of the S-type planet in the compact binary HD 41004. Using $N$-body simulations, we find that the planet could be dynamically stable at a mutual angle inclination up to $\sim75^\circ$. The von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (vZLK) mechanism becomes active when the mutual inclination is greater than 39.2$^\circ$. High-inclination orbits exhibit coupled oscillations in eccentricity and inclination, along with apsidal precession. Synthetic radial velocity (RV) modeling shows that these secular variations produce measurable signatures across a broad range of timescales, from full vZLK cycles to observationally accessible decades. For instance, a high mutual inclination at 75$^\circ$ can induce RV drifts exceeding 5 m s$^{-1}$ per planetary orbit ($\sim 1.9 \,\text{m s}^{-1}\, \text{yr}^{-1}$) in circular binary configurations. The presence of eccentric vZLK further accelerates these drifts, enhancing the detectability. Long-term RV observations of this system offer a unique pathway to dynamically constrain the orbital inclination, and thus determine the true mass of HD 41004 Ab. The degeneracy of mass-inclination is well known when using RV measurements alone. Our results highlight that HD 41004Ab and potentially other S-type planets in compact binaries are promising targets for breaking such a degeneracy by studying the dynamics induced by the vZLK mechanism through long-term high-precision RV monitoring.</description>

      <title>Absolute Calibration of Cluster Mira Variables to Provide a New Anchor for the Hubble Constant Determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mira variables in globular clusters can provide an accurate and precise absolute calibration of their period-luminosity relations (PLRs) to independently anchor the cosmic distance scale and determine the Hubble constant. We present homogeneous near-infrared ($JHK_s$) time-series photometric observations of a sample of 55 candidate long-period variables in 18 globular clusters covering a wide metallicity range ($-1.7 &lt; \textrm{[Fe/H]} &lt; -0.1$ dex). The Gaia proper motions, long-period variability information, and optical-infrared colors are used to identify 41 Oxygen-rich Miras as members of the globular clusters. Mean luminosities of Miras in the $JHK_s$ bands are independently calibrated using the recommended distances and mean parallaxes to their host clusters. Cluster Mira PLRs exhibit scatter comparable to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) variables and do not show any dependence on iron-abundance for a wide range of metallicities. We establish the accuracy of cluster Miras as independent anchors by determining a distance modulus to the LMC, $18.45 \pm 0.04$ mag, in agreement with the 1.2\% precise geometric distance. Our $H$-band photometry is transformed to derive {\it Hubble Space Telescope} F160W PLR for cluster Miras providing a three-anchor baseline with the LMC and NGC 4258. We employ three-anchor solution to determine distances to two type Ia supernovae host galaxies, NGC 1559 ($31.39\pm0.05$ mag) and M101 ($29.07\pm0.04$ mag), and provide a $3.7\%$ measurement of the Hubble constant, $H_0 = 73.06\pm 2.67$ km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$. Similar to Cepheids, our independent baseline solution results in a local $H_0$ determination that is systematically larger than its inference from the early universe probes, further supporting the ongoing Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>The Discovery of Little Red Dots in the Local Universe: Signatures of Cool Gas Envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST observations have revealed a population of high-redshift "little red dots" (LRDs) that challenge conventional AGN models. We report the discovery of three local LRDs at $z = 0.1-0.2$, initially selected from the SDSS database, with follow-up optical/near-IR spectroscopy and photometry. They exhibit properties fully consistent with those of high-redshift LRDs, including broad hydrogen and helium emission lines, compact morphologies, V-shaped UV-optical SED, declining near-IR continua, and no significant variability. Two sources were targeted but not detected in X-rays with statistical significance. All three sources show blue-shifted He I absorption, while two exhibit H$\alpha$ and Na D absorption lines. We detect full Balmer and Paschen line series in all three objects, along with abundant narrow [Fe II] emission in two. The emission line analyses suggest narrow lines originate from AGN-powered metal-poor regions with minimal dust; broad lines come from inner regions with exceptionally high density or atypical dust properties; and [Fe II] emission arises from dense gas between broad and narrow-line regions. One of our objects, J1025+1402 (nicknamed "The Egg"), shows extremely high equivalent width Na D, K I, Fe II, and Ca II triplet absorption lines, suggesting the presence of a cool ($\sim$5000 K), metal-enriched gas envelope. The optical/near-IR continua of these LRDs are also consistent with theoretical models featuring an atmosphere around black holes. The WISE-detected IR emission is consistent with weak dust emission of $T \sim 10^2-10^3$ K. We propose a conceptual model consisting of a largely thermalized cool-gas envelope surrounding the central black hole and an extended emission line region with high-density outflowing gas to explain the observed properties of these local LRDs.</description>

      <title>Accretion from a Shock-Inflated Companion: Spinning Down Neutron Stars to Hour-Long Periods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations have unveiled a population of pulsars with spin periods of a few minutes to hours that lie beyond the traditional ``death line.'' If they originate from neutron stars (NSs), the existence of such ultra-long period pulsars (ULPs) challenges our current understanding of NS evolution and emission. In this work, we propose a new channel for disk formation based on NSs born in close binaries with main-sequence companion stars. Using a hydrodynamic simulation of supernova-companion interactions, we show that a newborn NS may gravitationally capture gas as it moves through the complex density field shaped by the explosion. For a binary separation of $20\rm~R_\odot$ and a companion mass of $4\rm~M_\odot$, we find the occurrence fraction for disk formation around unbound NSs to be $\sim10\%$. By modeling the disk evolution and its interaction with the NS, we find a bimodal distribution in spin periods: canonical pulsars with $P\lesssim10\rm\,s$ are the ones who lack disks or whose magnetospheres never interacted with the disk, and ULPs with $10^3\lesssim P&lt;10^5\rm\,s$ are produced when the system undergoes a short-lived ``propeller'' phase during which the NS undergoes rapid spin-down. Such ULPs are formed under strong initial dipolar magnetic field strengths $B_0\gtrsim10^{14}\rm\,G$, with a formation rate of $10^{-4}\rm\,yr^{-1}$ in the Milky Way. We also find that a small population of pulsars with moderate magnetic field strengths ($10^{13}\lesssim~B_0\lesssim10^{14}\rm\,G$) and relatively slow initial periods ($P_0\gtrsim0.1\rm\,s$) evolve to $P\sim10^2\rm\,s$, filling the gap between the bimodal distribution. Thus, our model provides a unified explanation for pulsars beyond the ``death line.''</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Evolution of the Unstratified Polydisperse Dust Settling Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The Dust Settling Instabilty (DSI) is a member of the Resonant Drag Instabilities (RDI) family, and is thus related to the Streaming Instability (SI). Linear calculations found that the unstratified monodisperse DSI has growth rates much higher than the SI even with lower initial dust to gas ratios. However, recent nonlinear investigation found no evidence of strong dust clumping at the saturation level. Aims. To investigate the nonlinear saturation of the mono- and polydisperse DSI. We examine the convergence behaviour wrt. both the numerical resolution and the number of species. By characterising the morphology of the dust evolution triggered by the DSI, we can shed more light on its role in planetesimal formation. Methods. We perform a suite of 2D shearing box hydro simulations with the code Idefix, both in the mono- and polydisperse regimes. We focus on the time evolution of the maximum dust density, noting the time at which the instability is triggered, as well as analyse the morphology of the resultant structure. Results. In our monodisperse simulations, the maximum dust density increases and the instability saturates earlier with higher spatial resolution, with no signs of convergence. The polydisperse simulations do seem to converge with the number of species and produce maximum dust densities that are comparable to, albeit lower than, the monodisperse simulations. Different dust species tend to form adjacent but separate dust filaments, which may have implications on dust growth and further clumping. Conclusions. The monodisperse DSI produces dust structure at densities high enough that likely leads to clumping. The polydisperse DSI produces lower but comparable dust densities. Our idealised treatment suggests that the DSI is important for planetesimal formation, as it suffers less than the SI from including a dust size distribution.</description>

      <title>Effect of Galactic Chemical Evolution on Exoplanet Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We couple a simplified model for the galactic chemical evolution, with software that models the condensation of dust in protoplanetary disks and software that models the interior structure of planets in order to estimate the effects that the galactic chemical evolution has on the properties of planets as they form over time. We find that the early abundance of elements formed from the evolution and death of high-mass stars (such as Oxygen, Silicon, and Magnesium) yields planets with larger mantles and smaller cores. The later addition of elements produced in low-mass stars (such as Iron and Nickel) causes the planet cores to become relatively larger. The result is planets that orbit older stars are less dense than planets orbiting younger stars. These results are broadly consistent with recent observations of planet properties from stars of varying ages.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamical simulations of the vertical shear instability with dynamic dust and cooling rates in protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence in protoplanetary disks affects dust evolution and planetesimal formation. The vertical shear instability (VSI) is one of the candidate turbulence-driving mechanisms in the outer disk region. Since the VSI requires rapid gas cooling, dust grains in disks can influence and potentially control VSI-driven turbulence. However, VSI-driven turbulence has strong vertical motion, causing vertical dust diffusion. As a result, it remains unclear how turbulent structures and dust distributions form. We aim to clarify whether the VSI can achieve a quasi-steady dust profile under cooling rate evolution associated with turbulently diffusing dust. We also elucidate the dependence of the dust size and dust-to-gas mass ratio on the realization and persistence of the equilibrium state. We perform global two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of an axisymmetric disk to investigate how the VSI drives turbulence and maintains a balance between dust settling and diffusion. These simulations account for the dynamic interplay between dust distribution, cooling rates, and turbulence. We find that VSI mixing, dust settling, and local cooling reach an equilibrium, forming a thick dust layer with a dimensionless vertical mixing coefficient of approximately 10^{-3}. The ability of the VSI to sustain this state also depends on the dust size and dust-to-gas mass ratio. Larger grains or lower mass ratios weaken turbulence, leading to dust settling. The condition of equilibrium state existence is consistent with the prediction of the semi-analytic model presented by Fukuhara &amp; Okuzumi (2024). Our results indicate that efficient turbulent dust mixing and efficient cooling can occur simultaneously. They also imply that turbulence in VSI-dominated disks has different intensity levels depending on the grain size. This suggests that the efficiency of dust growth can depend on the VSI in protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Extensions of Brown Hamiltonian-II. Analytical study on the modified von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In triple systems of weak hierarchies, nonlinear perturbations arising from the periodic oscillations associated with the inner and outer binaries play a crucial role in shaping their long-term dynamical evolution. In this context, we have developed an extended Brown Hamiltonian in Paper I, which serves as a fundamental model for describing the modified von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) oscillations. The present work aims to analyze the characteristics of ZLK oscillations within this extended framework, focusing on phase-space structures, the location of ZLK center, the maximum eccentricity reached, the boundaries of librating cycles, and the critical inclination required to trigger ZLK resonance. Under the extended Hamiltonian, we introduce the Lidov integral C_ZLK, which is a combination of the Hamiltonian and the z-component of angular momentum, to characterize the modified ZLK properties. It is found that the librating and circulating cycles are separated by C_ZLK=0, which is consistent with the classical theory. Furthermore, we derive analytical expressions of these ZLK properties using perturbation techniques. Analytical predictions are compared to numerical results, showing an excellent agreement between them. Notably, the results reveal that ZLK characteristics in prograde and retrograde regimes are no longer symmetric under the influence of Brown corrections. At last, we conduct $N$-body integrations about millions of orbits to generate dynamical maps, where the numerical structures are well captured by the analytical solutions derived from the extended model.</description>

      <title>On Hot Jupiters and Stellar Clustering: The Role of Host Star Demographics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The variation in hot Jupiter (HJ) occurrence across stellar environments holds clues as to the dominant formation channels of these extreme planets. Recent studies suggest HJ hosts preferentially reside in regions of high phase space density, possibly reflecting natal environmental conditions. These regions are kinematically cold (|v| &lt; 40 km/s), prompting the alternative hypothesis that the correlation reflects an age bias: planetary systems in overdensities are systematically younger and therefore less likely to have undergone tidal inspiral and destruction. We test whether the apparent excess of HJs in phase space overdensities arises from differences in intrinsic host properties -- mass, metallicity, age -- which may correlate with phase space density or whether there is evidence for an additional environmental effect. We derive homogeneous estimates for the mass, metallicity, and age of planet-hosting stars using 2MASS and Gaia DR3 photometry, parallaxes, and self-consistent spectroscopic and spectrophotometric observables. In a sample of 2265 confirmed exoplanet hosts, we find a significant relative excess of HJs orbiting stars in overdense regions. However, we also find that overdensities preferentially host younger, more massive, and more metal-rich stars compared to underdensities. After correcting for these differences, either by detrending the phase space density against age or by matching host properties across subsamples, we find no significant differences in the HJ populations between over- and underdense regions. Our results suggest that the previously reported correlation between HJ occurrence and phase space density is driven by underlying differences in host star demographics rather than an intrinsic environmental effect.</description>

      <title>Caveats about measuring carbon abundances in stars using the CH band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deriving accurate carbon abundance estimates for a wide variety of stars is still complex due to the difficulties in properly measuring it from atomic and molecular lines. The aim of this paper is to analyse the carbon abundance determination for the large empirical X-shooter Spectral Library (XSL), commonly used as a benchmark for the development of stellar population models. The analysis was performed over strong molecular CH bands in the G-band region. We used the GAUGUIN automated spectrum synthesis code, and adopted two different grids of reference synthetic spectra separately, each with the same [C/Fe] abundance coverage. We carried out a detailed comparison between both grids to evaluate the accuracy and the model dependence of the measured [C/Fe] abundances. We obtained a large and precise unbiased [C/Fe] abundance catalogue from both theoretical grids, well distributed in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram and with no trend with the stellar parameters. We also measured compatible values from each independent CH band, with a high-quality [C/Fe] abundance estimate for both dwarfs and giants indistinctly. We observed a dispersed flat trend around [C/Fe] = 0.0 dex all along the metallicity regime, in agreement with some literature studies. However, we reported variations up to 0.8 dex in the [C/Fe] composition of the star depending on the adopted grid. We did not find such differences in the $\alpha$-element measurements. This behaviour implies a strong model dependence in the [C/Fe] abundance estimate. Potential sources of error could be associated with the use of spectral synthesis methods to derive stellar carbon abundances in the CH4300A band. Intrinsic small differences in the synthetic models over this crowded and blended region may induce a large disparity in the precise abundance estimate for any stellar type, leading to inaccurate carbon measurements without being noticed</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Proto-White Dwarf with a Massive Unseen Companion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of SDSS~J022932.28+713002.7, a nascent extremely low-mass (ELM) white dwarf (WD) orbiting a massive ($&gt; 1\,M_\odot$ at 2$\sigma$ confidence) companion with a period of 36 hours. We use a combination of spectroscopy, including data from the ongoing SDSS-V survey, and photometry to measure the stellar parameters for the primary pre-ELM white dwarf. %Because of the degeneracy between inclination, mass of the companion and lack of constraints on the inclination, mass of the companion is uncertain. The lightcurve of the primary WD exhibits ellipsoidal variation, which we combine with radial velocity data and $\tt{PHOEBE}$ binary simulations to estimate the mass of the invisible companion. We find that the primary WD has mass $M_1$ = $0.18^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ M$_\odot$ and the unseen secondary has mass $M_2$ = $1.19^{+0.21}_{-0.14}$ M$_\odot$. The mass of the companion suggests that it is most likely a near-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf or a neutron star. It is likely that the system recently went through a Roche lobe overflow from the visible primary onto the invisible secondary. The dynamical configuration of the binary is consistent with the theoretical evolutionary tracks for such objects, and the primary is currently in its contraction phase. The measured orbital period puts this system on a stable evolutionary path which, within a few Gyrs, will lead to a contracted ELM white dwarf orbiting a massive compact companion.</description>

      <title>Zero-polarization candidate regions for calibration of wide-field optical polarimeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Calibration of optical polarimeters relies on the use of stars with negligible polarization (unpolarized standard stars) for determining the instrumental polarization zero-point. For wide-field polarimeters, calibration is often done by imaging the same star over multiple positions in the field of view - a process which is time-consuming. A more effective technique is to target fields containing multiple standard stars. While this method has been used for fields with highly polarized stars, there are no such sky regions with well-measured unpolarized standard stars. Aims. We aim to identify sky regions with tens of stars exhibiting negligible polarization, which are suitable for zero-point calibration of wide-field polarimeters. Methods. We selected stars in regions with extremely low reddening, located at high Galactic latitudes. We targeted four ~ 400 x 400 fields in the northern, and eight in the southern Equatorial hemisphere. Observations were carried out at the Skinakas Observatory and the South African Astronomical Observatory respectively. Results. We find two fields in the North and seven in the South with mean polarization lower than p &lt; 0.1%. Conclusions. At least nine out of twelve fields can be used for zero-point calibration of wide-field polarimeters.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Main Sequence: Binary Evolution Pathways to Blue Stragglers in the Gaia Era I. Galactic Open and Globular Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. The study of blue straggler stars (BSS) provides insight into the mechanisms of stellar mass exchange during binary stellar evolution and the complex gravitational interactions within dense stellar systems. In combination, they enhance our understanding of the possible life cycles of stars and the evolutionary pathways of star clusters.
  Aim. We study the populations of BSSs in 41 globular clusters (GCs) and 42 open clusters (OCs) adopting photometry, proper motion, and parallax from the Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3), confirming their cluster membership. We find a total of 4399 BSSs: all GCs show the presence of BSSs (3965 or ~90% of the sample), whereas only 42 out of 129 studied OCs show the presence of BSSs (434 or ~10% of the sample). Clusters younger than ~500 Myr do not host any BSSs.
  Methods. We derive their astrophysical parameters such as effective temperature, surface gravity, and mass based on color-temperature relations, isochrone models and Gaia DR3 spectroscopy (if available). We find values for $T_{\rm eff}=(6800 \pm 585) \ {\rm K}$ and $(7570 \pm 1400) \ {\rm K}$; and an average mass of $\langle M_{\rm BSS} \rangle = (1.02 \pm 0.1) \ {M_\odot}$ and $\langle M_{\rm BSS} \rangle = (1.75 \pm 0.45) \ {M_\odot}$ for GCs and OCs, respectively. We finally compute the difference of the BSS mass and the main sequence turn-off (MSTO) mass of its respective cluster, normalized by the MSTO mass, for every identified BSS.
  Results. Based on this parameter and BSSs ages derived from isochrone models, we find: i) GC BSSs that are most likely to be formed through collisions show a "boost" for ages ~ 1-2 Gyr, in agreement with ages for core-collapse events in GCs reported in previous studies; ii) a double sequence for GC BSSs that could indicate the hint of a pre/post-merger or close-binary scenario.</description>

      <title>A systematic method to identify runaways from star clusters produced from single-binary interactions: A case study of M67</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06252v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One hypothesis for runaway stars (RSs) is that they are ejected from star clusters with high velocities relative to the cluster center-of-mass motion. There are two competing mechanisms for their production: supernova-based ejections in binaries, where one companion explodes, leaves no remnant, and launches the other companion at the instantaneous orbital velocity, and the disintegration of triples (or higher-order multiples), which produces a recoiled runaway binary (RB) and an RS. We search for RS candidates using data from the Gaia DR3 survey with a focus on triple disintegration since in this case the product is always a binary and a single star that should be moving in opposite directions. We created a systematic methodology to look for candidate RS-RB runaway pairs produced from the disintegration of bound three-body systems formed from single-binary interactions based on momentum conservation and causality. The method we use is general and can be applied to any cluster with a 5D kinematic data set. We used our criteria to search for these pairs in a 150 pc circular field of view surrounding the open cluster M67, which we used as a benchmark cluster to test the robustness of our method. Our results reveal only one RS-RB pair that is consistent with all of our selection criteria out of an initial sample of $10^8$ pairs.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Webs in Stellar Radiative Zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotational evolution of stellar radiative zones is an old puzzle. We argue that angular momentum transport by turbulent processes induced by differential rotation is insufficient, and propose that a key role is played by ``magnetic webs." We define magnetic webs as stable magnetic configurations that enforce corotation of their coupled mass shells, and discuss their resistance to differential torques that occur in stars. Magnetic webs are naturally expected in parts of radiative zones that were formerly convective, retaining memory of extinguished dynamos. For instance, red giants with moderate masses $M\gtrsim 1.3M_\odot$ likely contain a magnetic web deposited on the main sequence during the retreat of the central convective zone. The web couples the helium core to the hydrogen envelope of the evolving red giant and thus reduces spin-up of the contracting core. The magnetic field and the resulting slower rotation of the core are both consistent with asteroseismic observations, as we illustrate with a stellar evolution model with mass $1.6M_\odot$. Evolved massive stars host more complicated patterns of convective zones that may leave behind many webs, transporting angular momentum towards the surface. Efficient web formation likely results in most massive stars dying with magnetized and slowly rotating cores.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Spacecraft Analysis of Type III Radio Burst Electron Beam Deceleration and electron deceleration model in the inhomegeneous plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron beams accelerated in solar flares and escaping from the Sun along open magnetic field lines can trigger intense radio emissions known as type III solar radio bursts. Utilizing observations by Parker Solar Probe (PSP), STEREO-A (STA), Solar Orbiter (SolO), and Wind spacecrafts, the speeds and accelerations of type III exciters are derived for simple and isolated type III solar bursts. For the first time, simultaneous four spacecraft observations allow to determine positions, and correct the resulting velocities and accelerations for the location between the spacecraft and the apparent source. We observe velocities and acceleration to change as $u(r) \propto r^{-0.37 \pm 0.14}$ and $a(r) \propto r^{-1.71 \pm 0.20}$ with radial distance from the Sun $r$. To explain the electron beam deceleration, we develop a simple gas-dynamic description of the electron beam moving through plasma with monotonically decreasing density. The model predicts that the beam velocity decreases as $u(f)\propto f^{1/4}(r)$, so the acceleration changes $\propto r^{-1.58}$ (and speed as $\propto r^{-0.29}$) for the plasma density profile $n(r)\propto r^{-2.3}$. The deceleration is consistent with the average observation values corrected for the type III source locations. Intriguingly, the observations also show differences in velocity and acceleration of the same type III observed by different spacecrafts. We suggest the difference could be related to the additional time delay caused by radio-wave scattering between the spacecraft and the source.</description>

      <title>A Be Star + He Star Binary as an Indicator of a Binary Mass Transfer Phase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid rotation of Be stars is supposed to mainly originate from binary evolution. In recent years, more and more Be stars with helium (He) star companions have been discovered, which provides a significant opportunity to study binary interaction physics. In this work, we perform binary population synthesis with an updated binary mass transfer stability criterion and try to understand the details of mass transfer processes by constructing a series of Be star + He star (BeHe) binary populations. We found that the simulations and the observations can be divided into two groups according to the masses of components, corresponding to the two distinct evolutionary processes during the mass transfer. In particular, we found that the mass ratios of BeHe binaries may be taken as a probe of the initial mass ratios of the primordial binaries. Moreover, the results suggest that a higher mass transfer efficiency ($\gtrsim 0.5$) supports the observations better. The simulations predicted too many Be star binaries experiencing Case B mass transfer, which conflicts with the observations. The reason is due to either observational selection effects or unclear physical factors.</description>

      <title>Astronomical Cardiology: A Search For Heartbeat Stars Using $\textit{Gaia}$ and $\textit{TESS}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heartbeat stars are a subclass of binary stars with short periods, high eccentricities, and phase-folded light curves that resemble an electrocardiogram. We start from the $\textit{Gaia}$ catalogs of spectroscopic binaries and use $\textit{TESS}$ photometry to identify 112 new heartbeat star systems. We fit their phase-folded light curves with an analytic model to measure their orbital periods, eccentricities, inclinations, and arguments of periastron. We then compare these orbital parameters to the $\textit{Gaia}$ spectroscopic orbital solution. Our periods and eccentricities are consistent with the $\textit{Gaia}$ solutions for 85$\%$ of the single-line spectroscopic binaries but only 20$\%$ of the double-line spectroscopic binaries. For the two double-line spectroscopic binary heartbeat stars with consistent orbits, we combine the $\textit{TESS}$ phase-folded light curve and the $\textit{Gaia}$ velocity semi-amplitudes to measure the stellar masses and radii with $\texttt{PHOEBE}$. In a statistical analysis of the heartbeat star population, we find that non-giant heartbeat stars have evolved off the main sequence and that the fraction of the systems that are heartbeat stars rises rapidly with effective temperature.</description>

      <title>Solar Flare Prediction Using Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) and Decomposition-LSTM with Sliding Window Pattern Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Decomposition-LSTM (DLSTM) networks, combined with an ensemble algorithm, to predict solar flare occurrences using time-series data from the GOES catalog. The dataset spans from 2003 to 2023 and includes 151,071 flare events. Among approximately possible patterns, 7,552 yearly pattern windows are identified, highlighting the challenge of long-term forecasting due to the Sun's complex, self-organized criticality-driven behavior. A sliding window technique is employed to detect temporal quasi-patterns in both irregular and regularized flare time series. Regularization reduces complexity, enhances large flare activity, and captures active days more effectively. To address class imbalance, resampling methods are applied. LSTM and DLSTM models are trained on sequences of peak fluxes and waiting times from irregular time series, while LSTM and DLSTM, integrated with an ensemble approach, are applied to sliding windows of regularized time series with a 3-hour interval. Performance metrics, particularly TSS (0.74), recall (0.95) and the area under the curve (AUC=0.87) in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), indicate that DLSTM with an ensemble approach on regularized time series outperforms other models, offering more accurate large-flare forecasts with fewer false errors compared to models trained on irregular time series. The superior performance of DLSTM is attributed to its ability to decompose time series into trend and seasonal components, effectively isolating random noise. This study underscores the potential of advanced machine learning techniques for solar flare prediction and highlights the importance of incorporating various solar cycle phases and resampling strategies to enhance forecasting reliability.</description>

      <title>Why Machine Learning Models Systematically Underestimate Extreme Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A persistent challenge in astronomical machine learning is a systematic bias where predictions compress the dynamic range of true values-high values are consistently predicted too low while low values are predicted too high. Understanding this bias has important consequences for astronomical measurements and our understanding of physical processes in astronomical inference. Through analytical examination of linear regression, we show that this bias arises naturally from measurement uncertainties in input features and persists regardless of training sample size, label accuracy, or parameter distribution. In the univariate case, we demonstrate that attenuation becomes important when the ratio of intrinsic signal range to measurement uncertainty ($\sigma_{\text{range}}/\sigma_x$) is below $O(10)$-a regime common in astronomy. We further extend the theoretical framework to multivariate linear regression and demonstrate its implications using stellar spectroscopy as a case study. Even under optimal conditions-high-resolution APOGEE-like spectra ($R=24,000$) with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR=100) and multiple correlated features-we find percent-level bias. The effect becomes even more severe for modern-day low-resolution surveys like LAMOST and DESI due to the lower SNR and resolution. These findings have broad implications, providing a theoretical framework for understanding and addressing this limitation in astronomical data analysis with machine learning.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Equilibrium with Steady Flow and Relativistic Local Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A relativistic self-gravitating equilibrium system with steady flow as well as spherical symmetry is discovered. The energy-momentum tensor contains the contribution of a current related to the flow and the metric tensor does an off-diagonal component to balance with the flow momentum. The presence of the off-diagonal component of the metric implies the radial motion of the reference frame, which gives rise to a problem how the relativistic effect is included in thermodynamic observables for such a general relativistic system. This problem is solved by taking an instantaneously rest frame in which geometric thermodynamic observables read as previously and giving them the special relativistic effect emerged from the inverse transformation to the original frame pointwise. The solution of the thermodynamic observables in accord with the laws of thermodynamics and the theory of relativity is presented. Finally the relativistic structure equations for the equilibrium are derived, from which the general relativistic Poisson equation as well as the heat conduction one are developed exactly.</description>

      <title>The Open Cluster Chemical Abundances and Mapping Survey: VIII. Galactic Chemical Gradient and Azimuthal Analysis from SDSS/MWM DR19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Open Cluster Chemical Abundances and Mapping (OCCAM) survey seeks to curate a large, comprehensive, uniform dataset of open clusters and member stars to constrain key Galactic parameters. This eighth entry from the OCCAM survey, based on the newly released SDSS-V/MWM Data Release 19 (DR19), has established a sample of 164 high quality open clusters that are used to constrain the radial and azimuthal gradients of the Milky Way. The DR19 cluster sample [Fe/H] abundances are roughly consistent with measurements from other large-scale spectroscopic surveys. However, the gradients we calculate deviate considerably for some elements. We find an overall linear Galactic radial [Fe/H] gradient of $-0.075 \pm 0.006$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ using the cluster's current Galactocentric Radius ($R_{GC}$) and a gradient of $-0.068 \pm 0.005$ dex kpc$^-1$ with respect to the cluster's guiding center radius. We do not find strong evidence for significant evolution of the differential element gradients ([X/Fe]) investigated here (O, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Na, Al, K, Ce, Nd). For the first time using the OCCAM sample we have sufficient numbers of clusters to investigate Galactic azimuthal variations. In this work, we do find evidence of azimuthal variations in the measured radial abundance gradient in the Galactic disk using our open cluster sample.</description>
