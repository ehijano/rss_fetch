      <title>A Synchrophasor Estimator Characterized by Attenuated Self-Interference and Robustness Against DC Offsets: the DCSOGI Interpolated DFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The second-order generalized integrator (SOGI), which can be used to attenuate the self-interference of the fundamental tone, is unable to reject DC offsets on the input signal. Consequently, the performance of any SOGI based synchrophasor estimation (SE) technique might be compromised in the presence of such DC components. The current work presents a SE algorithm which adopts and enhanced SOGI formulation, robust against DC, combined with a three-point IpDFT and a Hanning window. Two alternative formulations relying respectively on the use of two and three nominal fundamental period observation windows are proposed and assessed for simultaneous compliance with both phasor measurement unit (PMU) P and M performance classes. This is done by means of a simulated environment where all the operating conditions defined by the IEC/IEEE Std. 60255-118-1-2018 are evaluated simultaneously combined with a $10\%$ static DC and under two different noise levels. Furthermore, both formulations adopt a dedicated mechanism for the detection and correction of low amplitude $2^{nd}$ harmonic tones to ensure their compliance with the standard can be maintained in the presence of such disturbances even under off-nominal frequency conditions. Finally the resilience of both methods against multiple simultaneous harmonic interferences is also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Domain-Factored Untrained Deep Prior for Spectrum Cartography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectrum cartography (SC) focuses on estimating the radio power propagation map of multiple emitters across space and frequency using limited sensor measurements. Recent advances in SC have shown that leveraging learned deep generative models (DGMs) as structural constraints yields state-of-the-art performance. By harnessing the expressive power of neural networks, these structural "priors" capture intricate patterns in radio maps. However, training DGMs requires substantial data, which is not always available, and distribution shifts between training and testing data can further degrade performance. To address these challenges, this work proposes using untrained neural networks (UNNs) for SC. UNNs, commonly applied in vision tasks to represent complex data without training, encode structural information of data in neural architectures. In our approach, a custom-designed UNN represents radio maps under a spatio-spectral domain factorization model, leveraging physical characteristics to reduce sample complexity of SC. Experiments show that the method achieves performance comparable to learned DGM-based SC, without requiring training data.</description>

      <title>A Root Extension to the Propagator Algorithm for Direction of Arrival Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an extension to the Propagator algorithm for source bearing estimation by performing root decomposition which eliminates the need for spectral search over angles. Further the propagator spatial spectrum is reused after performing the polynomial rooting to alleviate the observed drawback of an increase in RMSE at lower SNRs for estimating the directions-of-arrival of signals impinging on a linear array of sensors. Our proposed algorithm achieves a 98% reduction in computational complexity compared to Propagator alongside an improved angular resolution suitable for real time DOA estimation for wireless communications.</description>

      <title>WaveMax: Radar Waveform Design via Convex Maximization of FrFT Phase Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ambiguity function (AF) is a critical tool in radar waveform design, representing the two-dimensional correlation between a transmitted signal and its time-delayed, frequency-shifted version. Obtaining a radar signal to match a specified AF magnitude is a bi-variate variant of the well-known phase retrieval problem. Prior approaches to this problem were either limited to a few classes of waveforms or lacked a computable procedure to estimate the signal. Our recent work provided a framework for solving this problem for both band- and time-limited signals using non-convex optimization. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach WaveMax that formulates waveform recovery as a convex optimization problem by relying on the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT)-based AF. We exploit the fact that AF of the FrFT of the original signal is equivalent to a rotation of the original AF. In particular, we reconstruct the radar signal by solving a low-rank minimization problem, which approximates the waveform using the leading eigenvector of a matrix derived from the AF. Our theoretical analysis shows that unique waveform reconstruction is achievable with a sample size no more than three times the signal frequencies or time samples. Numerical experiments validate the efficacy of WaveMax in recovering signals from noiseless and noisy AF, including scenarios with randomly and uniformly sampled sparse data.</description>

      <title>STAR-RIS-Enabled Multi-Path Beam Routing with Passive Beam Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can be densely deployed in the environment to create multi-reflection line-of-sight (LoS) links for signal coverage enhancement. However, conventional reflection-only RISs can only achieve half-space reflection, which limits the LoS path diversity. In contrast, simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RISs (STAR-RISs) can achieve full-space reflection and transmission, thereby creating more LoS paths. Hence, in this paper, we study a new multi-STAR-RIS-aided communication system, where a multi-antenna base station (BS) transmits to multiple single-antenna users by exploiting the signal beam routing over a set of cascaded LoS paths each formed by multiple STAR-RISs. To reveal essential insights, we first consider a simplified single-user case, aiming to maximize its received signal power by jointly optimizing the active beamforming at the BS, the BS's power allocation over different paths, the number of selected beam-routing paths, the selected STAR-RISs for each path, as well as their amplitude and phase shifts for transmission/reflection. However, this problem is difficult to be optimally solved as different paths may be intricately coupled at their shared STAR-RISs. To tackle this difficulty, we first derive the optimal solution to this problem in closed-form for a given set of paths. The clique-based approach in graph theory is then applied to solve the remaining multi-path selection problem efficiently. Next, we extend the proposed clique-based method to the multi-user case to maximize the minimum received signal power among all users, subject to additional constraints on the disjointness of the selected paths for different users. Simulation results show that our proposed STAR-RIS-enabled beam routing outperforms the conventional beam routing with reflection-only RISs in both single- and multi-user cases.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Progressive Attention Graph Neural Network for EEG Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, numerous neuroscientific studies have shown that human emotions are closely linked to specific brain regions, with these regions exhibiting variability across individuals and emotional states. To fully leverage these neural patterns, we propose an Adaptive Progressive Attention Graph Neural Network (APAGNN), which dynamically captures the spatial relationships among brain regions during emotional processing. The APAGNN employs three specialized experts that progressively analyze brain topology. The first expert captures global brain patterns, the second focuses on region-specific features, and the third examines emotion-related channels. This hierarchical approach enables increasingly refined analysis of neural activity. Additionally, a weight generator integrates the outputs of all three experts, balancing their contributions to produce the final predictive label. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets (SEED, SEED-IV and MPED) demonstrate that the proposed method enhances EEG emotion recognition performance, achieving superior results compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Human Activity Recognition with a 6.5 GHz Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface for Wi-Fi 6E</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is the identification and classification of static and dynamic human activities, which find applicability in domains like healthcare, entertainment, security, and cyber-physical systems. Traditional HAR approaches rely on wearable sensors, vision-based systems, or ambient sensing, each with inherent limitations such as privacy concerns or restricted sensing conditions. Recently, Radio Frequency (RF)-based HAR has emerged, relying on the interaction of RF signals with people to infer activities. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) offers significant potential in this domain by enabling dynamic control over the wireless environment, thus enhancing the information extracted from RF signals. We present an Hand Gesture Recognition (HGR) approach that employs our own 6.5 GHz RIS design to manipulate the RF medium in an area of interest. We validate the capability of our RIS to control the medium by characterizing its steering response, and further we gather and publish a dataset for HGR classification for three different hand gestures. By employing two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) models trained on data gathered under random and optimized RIS configuration sequences, we achieved classification accuracies exceeding 90%.</description>

      <title>Scene Understanding Enabled Semantic Communication with Open Channel Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As communication systems transition from symbol transmission to conveying meaningful information, sixth-generation (6G) networks emphasize semantic communication. This approach prioritizes high-level semantic information, improving robustness and reducing redundancy across modalities like text, speech, and images. However, traditional semantic communication faces limitations, including static coding strategies, poor generalization, and reliance on task-specific knowledge bases that hinder adaptability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel system combining scene understanding, Large Language Models (LLMs), and open channel coding, named \textbf{OpenSC}. Traditional systems rely on fixed domain-specific knowledge bases, limiting their ability to generalize. Our open channel coding approach leverages shared, publicly available knowledge, enabling flexible, adaptive encoding. This dynamic system reduces reliance on static task-specific data, enhancing adaptability across diverse tasks and environments. Additionally, we use scene graphs for structured semantic encoding, capturing object relationships and context to improve tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA). Our approach selectively encodes key semantic elements, minimizing redundancy and improving transmission efficiency. Experimental results show significant improvements in both semantic understanding and efficiency, advancing the potential of adaptive, generalizable semantic communication in 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Wearable slot antenna at 2.45 GHz for off-body radiation: analysis of efficiency, frequency shift and body absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of body worn antennas with the human body causes a significant decrease in the antenna efficiency and a shift in the resonant frequency. A resonant slot in a small conductive box placed on the body has been shown to reduce these effects. The specific absorption rate (SAR) is less than international health standards for most wearable antennas due to the small transmitter power. This paper reports the linear relationship between the power absorbed by biological tissues at different locations on the body, and the radiation efficiency based on numerical modeling (r = 0.99). While the -10 dB bandwidth of the antenna remains constant and equal to 12.5%, the maximum frequency shift occurs when the antenna is close to the elbow (6.61%) and on the thigh (5.86%). The smallest change was found on the torso (4.21%). Participants with body-mass index (BMI) between 17 and 29 kg/m2 took part in experimental measurements, where the maximum frequency shift was 2.51%. Measurements show better agreement with simulations on the upper arm. These experimental results demonstrate that the BMI for each individual has little effect on the performance of the antenna.</description>

      <title>Calibrating Wireless AI via Meta-Learned Context-Dependent Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern software-defined networks, such as Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) systems, rely on artificial intelligence (AI)-powered applications running on controllers interfaced with the radio access network. To ensure that these AI applications operate reliably at runtime, they must be properly calibrated before deployment. A promising and theoretically grounded approach to calibration is conformal prediction (CP), which enhances any AI model by transforming it into a provably reliable set predictor that provides error bars for estimates and decisions. CP requires calibration data that matches the distribution of the environment encountered during runtime. However, in practical scenarios, network controllers often have access only to data collected under different contexts -- such as varying traffic patterns and network conditions -- leading to a mismatch between the calibration and runtime distributions. This paper introduces a novel methodology to address this calibration-test distribution shift. The approach leverages meta-learning to develop a zero-shot estimator of distribution shifts, relying solely on contextual information. The proposed method, called meta-learned context-dependent weighted conformal prediction (ML-WCP), enables effective calibration of AI applications without requiring data from the current context. Additionally, it can incorporate data from multiple contexts to further enhance calibration reliability.</description>

      <title>Harmonization of Noise Measurement Methods: Measurements of radio impulsive noise from a specific source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article describes a procedure for measuring and evaluating radio impulsive noise (IN) from a specific source. A good knowledge of the noise caused by different sources is essential to plan radio services and to ensure good quality of service. Moreover, it is necessary to harmonize noise measurement methods to achieve results that can be mutually compared. This article not only provides steps that should be followed to make proper measurements, but also specifies appropriate parameters to characterize the IN when it is generated by a principal source. A detailed description of parameter calculation is presented, based on the recommendations of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). This answers the request made in an ITU-R 214-4/3 question, which suggests determining the appropriate parameters to describe the noise when it has an impulsive characteristic.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of exposure to non-ionising electromagnetic fields in the Spanish INMA birth cohort: Study protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysis of the association between exposure to electromagnetic fields of non-ionising radiation (EMF-NIR) and health in children and adolescents is hindered by the limited availability of data, mainly due to the difficulties on the exposure assessment. This study protocol describes the methodologies used for characterising exposure of children to EMF-NIR in the INMA (INfancia y Medio Ambiente- Environment and Childhood) Project, a prospective cohort study. Indirect (proximity to emission sources, questionnaires on sources use and geospatial propagation models) and direct methods (spot and fixed longer-term measurements and personal measurements) were conducted in order to assess exposure levels of study participants aged between 7 and 18 years old. The methodology used varies depending on the frequency of the EMF-NIR and the environment (homes, schools and parks). Questionnaires assessed the use of sources contributing both to Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) and Radiofrequency (RF) exposure levels. Geospatial propagation models (NISMap) are implemented and validated for environmental outdoor sources of RFs using spot measurements. Spot and fixed longer-term ELF and RF measurements were done in the environments where children spend most of the time. Moreover, personal measurements were taken in order to assess individual exposure to RF. The exposure data are used to explore their relationships with proximity and/or use of EMF-NIR sources.</description>

      <title>Joint Precoder and Reflector Design for RIS-assisted Multi-user OAM Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) can enhance the spectral efficiency by multiplying a set of orthogonal modes on the same frequency channel. To maintain the orthogonal among different OAM modes, perfect alignments between transmitters and receivers are strictly required. However, in multi-user OAM communications, the perfect alignments between the transmitter and all the receivers are impossible. The phase turbulence, caused by misaligned transmitters and receivers, leads to serious inter-mode interference, which greatly degrades the capacity of OAM transmissions. To eliminate the negative effects of phase turbulence and further enhance the transmission capacity, we introduce RIS into the system, and propose a joint precoder and reflector design for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multi-user OAM communication systems. Specifically, we propose a three-layer design at the transmitter side, which includes inter-user OAM mode interference cancellation, inter-mode self-interference elimination and the power allocation among different users. By analyzing the characteristics of the overall channels, we are able to give the specific expressions of the precoder designs, which significantly reduce the optimization complexity. We further leverage RIS to guarantee the line-ofsight (LoS) transmissions between the transmitter and users for better sum rate performance. To verify the superiority of the proposed multi-user OAM transmission system, we compare it with traditional MIMO transmission schemes, numerical results have shown that our proposed design can achieve better sum rate performance due to the well-designed orthogonality among different users and OAM modes.</description>

      <title>Channel-Aware Constellation Design for Digital OTA Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) computation has emerged as a promising technique for efficiently aggregating data from massive numbers of wireless devices. OTA computations can be performed by analog or digital communications. Analog OTA systems are often constrained by limited function adaptability and their reliance on analog amplitude modulation. On the other hand, digital OTA systems may face limitations such as high computational complexity and limited adaptability to varying network configurations. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel digital OTA computation system with a channel-aware constellation design for demodulation mappers. The proposed system dynamically adjusts the constellation based on the channel conditions of participating nodes, enabling reliable computation of various functions. By incorporating channel randomness into the constellation design, the system prevent overlap of constellation points, reduces computational complexity, and mitigates excessive transmit power consumption under poor channel conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that the system achieves reliable NMSE performance across a range of scenarios, offering valuable insights into the choice of signal processing methods and weighting strategies under varying computation point configurations, node counts, and quantization levels. This work advances the state of digital OTA computation by addressing critical challenges in scalability, transmit power consumption, and function adaptability.</description>

Abstract: Future applications such as intelligent vehicles, the Internet of Things and holographic telepresence are already highlighting the limits of existing fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks. These limitations relate to data throughput, latency, reliability, availability, processing, connection density and global coverage, whether terrestrial, submarine or space-based. To remedy this, research institutes have begun to look beyond IMT2020, and as a result, 6G should provide effective solutions to 5G shortcomings. 6G will offer high quality of service and energy efficiency to meet the demands of future applications that are unimaginable to most people. In this article, we present the future applications and services promised by 6G.</description>

      <title>CSI-Free Low-Complexity Remote State Estimation over Wireless MIMO Fading Channels using Semantic Analog Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate low-complexity remote system state estimation over wireless multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channels without requiring prior knowledge of channel state information (CSI). We start by reviewing the conventional Kalman filtering-based state estimation algorithm, which typically relies on perfect CSI and incurs considerable computational complexity. To overcome the need for CSI, we introduce a novel semantic aggregation method, in which sensors transmit semantic measurement discrepancies to the remote state estimator through analog aggregation. To further reduce computational complexity, we introduce a constant-gain-based filtering algorithm that can be optimized offline using the constrained stochastic successive convex approximation (CSSCA) method. We derive a closed-form sufficient condition for the estimation stability of our proposed scheme via Lyapunov drift analysis. Numerical results showcase significant performance gains using the proposed scheme compared to several widely used methods.</description>

      <title>Joint System Latency and Data Freshness Optimization for Cache-enabled Mobile Crowdsensing Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) networks enable large-scale data collection by leveraging the ubiquity of mobile devices. However, frequent sensing and data transmission can lead to significant resource consumption. To mitigate this issue, edge caching has been proposed as a solution for storing recently collected data. Nonetheless, this approach may compromise data freshness. In this paper, we investigate the trade-off between re-using cached task results and re-sensing tasks in cache-enabled MCS networks, aiming to minimize system latency while maintaining information freshness. To this end, we formulate a weighted delay and age of information (AoI) minimization problem, jointly optimizing sensing decisions, user selection, channel selection, task allocation, and caching strategies. The problem is a mixed-integer non-convex programming problem which is intractable. Therefore, we decompose the long-term problem into sequential one-shot sub-problems and design a framework that optimizes system latency, task sensing decision, and caching strategy subproblems. When one task is re-sensing, the one-shot problem simplifies to the system latency minimization problem, which can be solved optimally. The task sensing decision is then made by comparing the system latency and AoI. Additionally, a Bayesian update strategy is developed to manage the cached task results. Building upon this framework, we propose a lightweight and time-efficient algorithm that makes real-time decisions for the long-term optimization problem. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the achievable rate-exponent region of integrated sensing and communication systems in the presence of variable-length coding with feedback. This scheme is fundamentally different from earlier studies, as the coding methods that utilize feedback impose different constraints on the codewords. The focus herein is specifically on the Gaussian channel, where three achievable regions are analytically derived and numerically evaluated. In contrast to a setting without feedback, we show that a trade-off exists between the operations of sensing and communications.</description>

      <title>Channel Independent Precoder for OFDM-based Systems over Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose an independent channel precoder for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems over fading channels. The design of the precoder is based on the information redistribution of the input modulated symbols amongst the output precoded symbols. The proposed precoder decreases the variance of the instantaneous noise power at the receiver produced by the channel variability. The employment of an interleaver together with a precoding matrix whose size does not depend on the number of data carriers in an OFDM symbol allows different configurations of time-frequency diversity which can be easily adapted to the channel conditions. The precoder is evaluated with a modified Zero Forcing (ZF) equalizer whose maximum gain is constrained by means of a clipping factor. Thus, the clipping factor limits the noise power transfer in the receiver deprecoding block in low SNR conditions.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Selection in Spectral Graph Neural Networks: An Error-Sum of Function Slices Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectral graph neural networks are proposed to harness spectral information inherent in graph-structured data through the application of polynomial-defined graph filters, recently achieving notable success in graph-based web applications. Existing studies reveal that various polynomial choices greatly impact spectral GNN performance, underscoring the importance of polynomial selection. However, this selection process remains a critical and unresolved challenge. Although prior work suggests a connection between the approximation capabilities of polynomials and the efficacy of spectral GNNs, there is a lack of theoretical insights into this relationship, rendering polynomial selection a largely heuristic process.
  To address the issue, this paper examines polynomial selection from an error-sum of function slices perspective. Inspired by the conventional signal decomposition, we represent graph filters as a sum of disjoint function slices. Building on this, we then bridge the polynomial capability and spectral GNN efficacy by proving that the construction error of graph convolution layer is bounded by the sum of polynomial approximation errors on function slices. This result leads us to develop an advanced filter based on trigonometric polynomials, a widely adopted option for approximating narrow signal slices. The proposed filter remains provable parameter efficiency, with a novel Taylor-based parameter decomposition that achieves streamlined, effective implementation. With this foundation, we propose TFGNN, a scalable spectral GNN operating in a decoupled paradigm. We validate the efficacy of TFGNN via benchmark node classification tasks, along with an example graph anomaly detection application to show its practical utility.</description>

      <title>Desynchronization Index: a New Approach for Exploring Complex Epileptogenic Networks in Stereoelectroencephalography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective. In this work, we propose a new computational framework to assist neurophysiologists in Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) analysis, with the final aim of improving the definition of the Epileptogenic Zone (EZ) in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Method. We consider the Phase Transfer Entropy (PTE) model to estimate the effective connectivity between SEEG channels. Hence, we design an algorithm, named the Desynchronization Index (DI), that classifies as epileptogenic the channels that show independent behavior with respect to the rest of the network during the seconds preceding the seizure propagation. Results. We test the proposed DI algorithm against Epileptogenic Index (EI) on a clinical dataset of 11 patients, considering the neurophysiological evaluation of the EZ as the clinical ground truth. Our results denote that DI overcomes EI in terms of area under the ROC curve (AUC=0.80 vs AUC=0.74), while combining the two algorithms as a unique tool leads to the best performance (AUC=0.87). Conclusions. The DI algorithm underscores connectivity dynamics that can hardly be identified with a pure visual analysis, increasing the accuracy in the EZ definition compared to traditional methods. Significance. The integration of connectivity- and energy-based metrics, as the one we propose, can lead to the definition of a new effective biomarker of the EZ, reducing the burden required by the SEEG review in the case of extensive implants and improving our understanding of the dynamics leading to the generation of seizures.</description>

      <title>Localization Accuracy Improvement in Multistatic ISAC with LoS/NLoS Condition using 5G NR Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is anticipated to play a crucial role in sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication networks. A significant challenge in ISAC systems is the degradation of localization accuracy due to poor propagation conditions, such as multipath effects and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. These conditions result in outlier measurements that can severely impact localization performance. This paper investigates the enhancement of target localization accuracy in multistatic ISAC systems under both line-of-sight (LoS) and NLoS conditions. We leverage positioning reference signal (PRS), which is currently employed in fifth-generation (5G) new radio (NR) for user equipment (UE) positioning, as the sensing signal. We introduce a novel algorithm to improve localization accuracy by mitigating the impact of outliers in range measurements, while also accounting for errors due to PRS range resolution. Eventually, through simulation results, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over previous approaches. Indeed, we achieve up to 28% and 20% improvements in average localization error over least squares (LS) and iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) methods, respectively. Additionally, we observe up to 16% and 13% enhancements in the 90th percentile of localization error compared to LS and IRLS, respectively. Our simulation is based on 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards, ensuring the applicability of our results across diverse environments, including urban and indoor areas.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming and Position Optimization for Fluid RIS-aided ISAC Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fluid reconfigurable intelligent surface (fRIS)-aided integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system is proposed to enhance multi-target sensing and multi-user communication. Unlike the conventional RIS, the fRIS incorporates movable elements whose positions can be flexibly adjusted to provide extra spatial degrees of freedom. In this system, a joint optimization problem is formulated to minimize sensing beampattern mismatch and communication symbol estimation error by optimizing the symbol estimator, transmit beamformer, fRIS phase shifts, and element positions. To solve this problem, an algorithm based on alternating minimization is devised, where subproblems are solved leveraging augmented Lagrangian method, quadratic programming, semidefinite-relaxation, and majorization-minimization techniques. A key challenge exists that the fRIS element positions affect both the incident and reflective channels, leading to the high-order composite functions regarding the positions. As a remedy, it is proved that the high-order terms can be transformed to linear and linear-difference forms using the characteristics of fRIS and structural channels, which facilitates the position optimization. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme as compared to the conventional RIS-aided ISAC systems and other benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Destructive and constructive RIS beamforming in an ISAC-multi-user MIMO network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11314v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has already established itself as a promising solution to the spectrum scarcity problem, even more so when paired with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), as RISs can shape the propagation environment by adjusting their phase-shift coefficients. Albeit the potential performance gain, a RIS is also a potential security threat to the system. In this paper, we explore both the positive and negative sides of having a RIS in a multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ISAC network. We first develop an alternating optimization algorithm, obtaining the active and passive beamforming vectors that maximize the sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints for the communication users and finite power budget. We also investigate the destructive potential of the RIS by devising a RIS phase-shift optimization algorithm that minimizes the sensing SNR while preserving the same minimum communication SINR previously guaranteed by the system. We further investigate the impact of the RIS's individual element failures on the system performance. The simulation results show that the RIS performance-boosting potential is as good as its destructive one and that both of our optimization strategies are hindered by the investigated impairments.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented Status Updating for Real-time Remote Inference over Networks with Two-Way Delay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a setting where an intelligent model (e.g., a pre-trained neural network) predicts the real-time value of a target signal using data samples transmitted from a remote source according to a scheduling policy. The scheduler decides on i) the age of the samples to be sent, ii) when to send them, and iii) the length of each packet (i.e., the number of samples contained in each packet). The dependence of inference quality on the Age of Information (AoI) for a given packet length is modeled by a general relationship. Previous work assumed i.i.d. transmission delays with immediate feedback or were restricted to the case where inference performance degrades as the input data ages. Our formulation, in addition to capturing non-monotone age dependence, also covers Markovian delay on both forward and feedback links. We model this as an infinite-horizon average-cost Semi-Markov Decision Process. We obtain a closed-form solution that decides on (i) and (ii) for any constant packet length. The solution for when to send is an index-based threshold policy, where the index function is expressed in terms of the delay state and AoI at the receiver. The age of the packet selected is a function of the delay state. We separately optimize the value of the constant length. We also develop an index-based threshold policy for the variable length case, which allows a complexity reduction. In simulation results, we observe that our goal-oriented scheduler drops inference error down to one sixth with respect to age-based scheduling of unit-length packets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic neurons are extremely efficient hardware for solving a large class of problems and usually come in two varieties -- "binary" where the neuronal statevaries randomly between two values of -1, +1 and "analog" where the neuronal state can randomly assume any value between -1 and +1. Both have their uses in neuromorphic computing and both can be implemented with low- or zero-energy-barrier nanomagnets whose random magnetization orientations in the presence of thermal noise encode the binary or analog state variables. In between these two classes is n-ary stochastic neurons, mainly ternary stochastic neurons (TSN) whose state randomly assumes one of three values (-1, 0, +1), which have proved to be efficient in pattern classification tasks such as recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST data set or patterns from the CIFAR-10 data set. Here, we show how to implement a TSN with a zero-energy-barrier (shape isotropic) magnetostrictive nanomagnet subjected to uniaxial strain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven Wi-Fi localization and tracking have shown great promise due to their lower reliance on specialized hardware compared to model-based methods. However, most existing data collection techniques provide only coarse-grained ground truth or a limited number of labeled points, significantly hindering the advancement of data-driven approaches. While systems like lidar can deliver precise ground truth, their high costs make them inaccessible to many users. To address these challenges, we propose LoFi, a vision-aided label generator for Wi-Fi localization and tracking. LoFi can generate ground truth position coordinates solely from 2D images, offering high precision, low cost, and ease of use. Utilizing our method, we have compiled a Wi-Fi tracking and localization dataset using the ESP32-S3 and a webcam, which will be open-sourced along with the code upon publication.</description>
