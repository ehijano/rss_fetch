      <title>On local non-tangential growth of the resolvent of a banded Toeplitz operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the growth of the resolvent of a Hardy--Toeplitz operator $T_b$ with a Laurent polynomial symbol (\emph{i.e., } the matrix $T_b$ is banded), at the neighborhood of a point $w_0\in\partial(\sigma(T_b))$ on the boundary of its spectrum. We show that such growth is inverse linear in some non-tangential domains at the vertex $w_0$, provided that $w_0$ does not belong to a certain finite set on the complex plane.</description>

      <title>Higher order spectral shift of Euclidean Callias operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Dirac-Schr\"odinger operators over odd-dimensional Euclidean space. The conditions for the potential are based on those of C. Callias in his famous paper on the corresponding index problem. However, we treat the case where the potential can take values in unbounded operators of a separable Hilbert space, and crucially, we also do not assume that the potential needs to be invertible outside a compact region. Hence, the Dirac-Schr\"odinger operator is not necessarily Fredholm. In the setup we discuss, it however still admits a related trace formula in terms of the underlying potential.
  In this paper we express the trace formula for these Callias-type operators in terms of higher order spectral shift functions, leading to a functional equation which generalizes a known functional equation found first by A. Pushnitski.
  To the knowledge of the author, this paper presents the first multi-dimensional non-Fredholm extension of the Callias index theorem involving higher order spectral shift functions. More precisely, we also show that under a Lebesgue point condition on the higher order spectral shift function associated to the potential, the Callias-type operator admits a regularized index, even in non-Fredholm settings. This corresponds to a known Witten index result in the one-dimensional case shown by A. Carey et al.
  The regularized index that we introduce is a minor extension of the classical Witten index, and we present an index formula, which generalizes the classical Callias index theorem. As an example, we treat the case of $(d+1)$-massless Dirac-Schr\"odinger operators, for which we calculate the associated higher order spectral shift functions.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction techniques for inverse Sturm-Liouville problems with complex coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variety of inverse Sturm-Liouville problems is considered, including the two-spectrum inverse problem, the problem of recovering the potential from the Weyl function, as well as the recovery from the spectral function. In all cases the potential in the Sturm-Liouville equation is assumed to be complex valued. A unified approach for the approximate solution of the inverse Sturm-Liouville problems is developed, based on Neumann series of Bessel functions (NSBF) representations for solutions and their derivatives. Unlike most existing approaches, it allows one to recover not only the complex-valued potential but also the boundary conditions of the Sturm-Liouville problem. Efficient accuracy control is implemented. The numerical method is direct. It involves only solving linear systems of algebraic equations for the coefficients of the NSBF representations, while eventually the knowledge only of the first NSBF coefficients leads to the recovery of the Sturm-Liouville problem. Numerical efficiency is illustrated by several test examples.</description>

      <title>Bernstein-Markov measures and Toeplitz theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that Toeplitz operators associated with a Bernstein-Markov measure on a compact complex manifold endowed with a big line bundle form an algebra under composition. As an application, we derive a Szeg\H{o}-type spectral equidistribution result for this class of operators. A key component of our approach is the off-diagonal asymptotic analysis of the Bergman kernel, also known as the Christoffel-Darboux kernel.</description>

      <title>Spectral asymptotics for Robin Laplacians on Lipschitz sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove two-term spectral asymptotics for the Riesz means of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on a Lipschitz domain with Robin boundary conditions. The second term is the same as in the case of Neumann boundary conditions. This is valid for Riesz means of arbitrary positive order. For orders at least one and under additional assumptions on the function determining the boundary conditions we derive leading order asymptotics for the difference between Riesz means of Robin and Neumann eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Detecting eigenvalues in a fourth-order nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a non-regular Maslov box</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Maslov index to study the eigenvalue problem arising from the linearisation about solitons in the fourth-order cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE). Our analysis is motivated by recent work by Bandara et al., in which the fourth-order cubic NLSE was shown to support infinite families of multipulse solitons. Using a homotopy argument, we prove that the Morse indices of two selfadjoint fourth-order operators appearing in the linearisation may be computed by counting conjugate points, as well as a lower bound for the number of real unstable eigenvalues of the linearisation. We also give a Vakhitov-Kolokolov type stability criterion. The interesting aspects of this problem as an application of the Maslov index are the instances of non-regular crossings, which feature crossing forms with varying ranks of degeneracy. We handle such degeneracies directly via higher order crossing forms, using a definition of the Maslov index developed by Piccione and Tausk.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional magnetic Schr\"odinger operator with the potential supported in a tube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19365v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the following magnetic Schr\"odinger operator in $\mathbb{R}^3$: \[ H=(i \nabla +A)^2- \tilde{V}, \] where $\tilde{V}$ is non-negative potential supported over the tube built along a curve which is a local deformation of a straight one, and $B:=\mathrm{rot}(A)$ is a non-zero and local (i.e., a compact supported) magnetic field. Based on some new strategies, we first prove that the magnetic field does not change the essential spectrum of this system. Finally, in the last section of this paper, we establish the sufficient condition such that the discrete spectrum is empty.</description>

      <title>Perturbative partial moment matching and gradient-flow adaptive importance sampling transformations for Bayesian leave one out cross-validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08151v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Importance sampling (IS) allows one to approximate leave one out (LOO) cross-validation for a Bayesian model, without refitting, by inverting the Bayesian update equation to subtract a given data point from a model posterior. For each data point, one computes expectations under the corresponding LOO posterior by weighted averaging over the full data posterior. This task sometimes requires weight stabilization in the form of adapting the posterior distribution via transformation. So long as one is successful in finding a suitable transformation, one avoids refitting. To this end, we motivate the use of bijective perturbative transformations of the form $T(\boldsymbol{\theta})=\boldsymbol{\theta} + h Q(\boldsymbol{\theta}),$ for $0&lt;h\ll 1,$ and introduce two classes of such transformations: 1) partial moment matching and 2) gradient flow evolution. The former extends prior literature on moment-matching under the recognition that adaptation for LOO is a small perturbation on the full data posterior. The latter class of methods define transformations based on relaxing various statistical objectives: in our case the variance of the IS estimator and the KL divergence between the transformed distribution and the statistics of the LOO fold. Being model-specific, the gradient flow transformations require evaluating Jacobian determinants. While these quantities are generally readily available through auto-differentiation, we derive closed-form expressions in the case of logistic regression and shallow ReLU activated neural networks. We tested the methodology on an $n\ll p$ dataset that is known to produce unstable LOO IS weights.</description>

      <title>A microlocal Cauchy problem through a crossing point of Hamiltonian flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13693v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider $2\times 2$ matrix-valued pseudodifferential equations in which the two characteristic sets intersect with finite contact order. We show that the asymptotic behavior of its solution changes dramatically before and after the crossing point, and provide a precise asymptotic formula. This is a generalization of the previous results for matrix-valued Schr\"odinger operators and Landau-Zener models. The proof relies on a normal form reduction and a detailed analysis of a simple first-order system.</description>
