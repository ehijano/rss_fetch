      <title>Layer skyrmions for ideal Chern bands and twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ideal $C=1$ Chern bands exhibit a Landau level correspondence: they factorize as a lowest Landau levels and a spinor wavefunction that spans the layer index. We demonstrate that, in single Dirac moir\'e models, the spinor develops generally a Skyrme texture in real space with an associated Berry phase which compensates exactly the magnetic phase of the Landau level. For ideal bands with higher Chern numbers $C&gt;1$, we find that $C$ color Landau levels are carried by $C$ spinors with Skyrme textures. We identify a SU(C) gauge symmetry in the color space of spinors and an emergent non-Abelian connection in real space intimately linked to the Pontryagin winding index of the layer skyrmions. They result in a total real-space Chern number of $-1$, screening the magnetic phase, irrespective of $C$ and of the number of layers. The topologically robust Skyrme texture remains remarkably intact in twisted bilayer graphene, even far from the chiral limit, and for realistic values of corrugation, making it an experimentally testable feature. We verify our predictions at the first magic angle of twisted bilayer, trilayer, and monolayer-bilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Tunable contributions from rectification and momentum transfer to 1D Coulomb Drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coulomb drag is a powerful tool to study interactions in coupled low-dimensional systems. Historically, Coulomb drag has been attributed to a frictional force arising from momentum transfer whose direction is dictated by the current flow. However recent findings in one-dimensional systems have also identified a rectified contribution that is independent of the current flow direction. In this work, we present Coulomb drag measurements between vertically coupled GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wires separated vertically by a hard barrier only 15 nm wide where both momentum transfer and rectified Coulomb drag signals are observed simultaneously, and whose relative magnitude are temperature and gate tunable. Our study opens up the possibility of studying the physical mechanisms behind the onset of both momentum transfer and charge rectification drag simultaneously in a single device, ultimately leading to a better understanding of Luttinger liquids in multi-channel wires and paving the way for the creation of energy harvesting devices.</description>

      <title>Progress in superconductor-semiconductor topological Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majorana bound states (MBSs) are quasiparticles which are their own antiparticles. They are predicted to emerge as zero-energy modes localized at the boundary of a topological superconductor. No intrinsic topological superconductor is known to date. However, by interfacing conventional superconductors and semiconductors with strong spin--orbit coupling it is possible to create a system hosting topological states. Hence epitaxial superconductors and semiconductors have emerged as an attractive materials system with atomically sharp interfaces and broad flexibility in device fabrications incorporating Josephson junctions. We discuss the basics of topological superconductivity and provide insight on how to go beyond current state-of-the-art experiments. We argue that the ultimate success in realizing MBS physics requires the observation of non-Abelian braiding and fusion experiments.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved sensing of electromagnetic fields with single-electron interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing quantum states of the electromagnetic field at microwave frequencies requires fast and sensitive detectors that can simultaneously probe the field time-dependent amplitude and its quantum fluctuations. In this work, we demonstrate a quantum sensor that exploits the phase of a single electron wavefunction, measured in an electronic Fabry-Perot interferometer, to detect a classical time-dependent electric field. The time resolution, limited by the temporal width of the electronic wavepacket, is a few tens of picoseconds. The interferometry technique provides a voltage resolution of a few tens of microvolts, corresponding to a few microwave photons. Importantly, our detector simultaneously probes the amplitude of the field from the phase of the measured interference pattern and its fluctuations from the interference contrast. This capability paves the way for on-chip detection of quantum radiation, such as squeezed or Fock states.</description>

      <title>Electronic interferometry with ultrashort plasmonic pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic flying qubits offer an interesting alternative to photonic qubits: electrons propagate slower, hence easier to control in real time, and Coulomb interaction enables direct entanglement between different qubits. While their coherence time is limited, picosecond-scale control would make them competitive in terms of number of possible coherent operations. The key challenge lies in achieving the dynamical regime, where the injected plasmonic pulse width is shorter than the quantum device dimensions. Here we reach this new regime in a quantum nanoelectronic system by injecting ultrashort single electron plasmonic pulses into a 14-micrometer-long Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Our findings reveal that quantum coherence is preserved for ultrashort plasmonic pulses, exhibiting enhanced contrast of coherent oscillations compared to the DC regime. Moreover, this coherence remains robust even under large bias voltages. This milestone demonstrates the feasibility of flying qubits as a promising alternative to localized qubit architectures, offering reduced hardware footprint, increased connectivity, and potential for scalable quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Energy-efficient field-free unconventional spin-orbit torque magnetization switching dynamics in van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure of emerging two-dimensional (2D) quantum materials, with control over their quantum geometries, crystal symmetries, spin-orbit coupling, and magnetic anisotropies, provides a new platform for generating unconventional nonlinear Hall effects, spin polarization and efficiently controlling the magnetization dynamics for non-volatile spin-based computing. However, so far, the generation of a large out-of-plane spin polarization is limited to achieve energy-efficient field-free magnetization switching and spin dynamics measurements in all-2D vdW heterostructure are so far missing, where the interplay between spins and magnetization dynamics should enable the design of ultrafast spintronic devices. Here, we demonstrate magnetization dynamics and energy-efficient field-free spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching of out-of-plane magnet Fe3GaTe2 due to unconventional Berry curvature-induced out-of-plane spin polarization from a topological Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4 in a vdW heterostructure at room temperature. We observed a large non-linear 2nd harmonic Hall signal at room temperature and evaluated the SOT-induced magnetization dynamics with a large damping-like torque. Deterministic field-free SOT magnetization switching in vdW heterostructure of TaIrTe4/Fe3GaTe2 is observed at room temperature with a low current and power density, which is an order of magnitude better than that of conventional systems. From the magnetization switching experiments, a large SOT efficiency and a very large spin Hall conductivity. These findings on all-vdW heterostructures offer a promising route to energy-efficient and external field-free ultrafast spintronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Theory of ac magnetoelectric transport in normal-metal $-$ magnetic-insulator heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-magnon coupling at the interface between a normal metal and a magnetically ordered insulator modifies the electrical conductivity of the normal metal, an effect known as spin-Hall magnetoresistance. It can also facilitate magnon-mediated current drag, the nonlocal electric current response of two normal metal layers separated by a magnetic insulator. In this article, we present a theory of these two spintronic effects and their nonlinear counterparts for time-dependent applied electric fields $E(\omega)$, with driving frequencies $\omega$ up to the THz regime. We compare various mechanisms leading to a quadratic-in-$E$ response $-$ Joule heating, spin-torque diode effect, and magnonic unidirectional spin-Hall magnetoresistance $-$ and show how these can be disentangled by their characteristic dependences on $\omega$ and the magnetization direction.</description>

      <title>The Kondo impurity in the large spin limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kondo problem, which describes the interaction of a spin $s$ magnetic impurity with a free Fermi gas, is a classic example of strongly coupled physics. Historically, the problem has been solved by Wilson's numerical renormalization group and later by Bethe ansatz. In this paper, we present an alternate analytic solution of the Kondo problem that combines an expansion in $1/s$ with the renormalization group. We study both the case of an impurity interacting with a single channel $K=1$ of fermions in the $s \rightarrow \infty$ limit and the case with $K$ channels in the double-scaling limit $K \rightarrow \infty$, $s \to \infty$, $K/s$ fixed. Our approach allows us to describe analytically intermediate scales of the Kondo problem at large $s$ and compute thermodynamic observables such as the impurity entropy and susceptibility. We find these observables to agree with the Bethe ansatz results. We also compute the impurity spectral function, finite temperature resistivity and the Kondo screening cloud profile, properties that are not easily accessible from Bethe ansatz. Notably, in the regime $K &gt; 2s$ we access the "non-Fermi-liquid" overscreened fixed point of the multichannel Kondo problem.</description>

      <title>A General Framework for Gradient-Based Optimization of Superconducting Quantum Circuits using Qubit Discovery as a Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineering the Hamiltonian of a quantum system is fundamental to the design of quantum systems. Automating Hamiltonian design through gradient-based optimization can dramatically accelerate this process. However, computing the gradients of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a Hamiltonian--a large, sparse matrix--relative to system properties poses a significant challenge, especially for arbitrary systems. Superconducting quantum circuits offer substantial flexibility in Hamiltonian design, making them an ideal platform for this task. In this work, we present a comprehensive framework for the gradient-based optimization of superconducting quantum circuits, leveraging the SQcircuit software package. By addressing the challenge of calculating the gradient of the eigensystem for large, sparse Hamiltonians and integrating automatic differentiation within SQcircuit, our framework enables efficient and precise computation of gradients for various circuit properties or custom-defined metrics, streamlining the optimization process. We apply this framework to the qubit discovery problem, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying qubit designs with superior performance metrics. The optimized circuits show improvements in a heuristic measure of gate count, upper bounds on gate speed, decoherence time, and resilience to noise and fabrication errors compared to existing qubits. While this methodology is showcased through qubit optimization and discovery, it is versatile and can be extended to tackle other optimization challenges in superconducting quantum hardware design.</description>

      <title>Month-long-lifetime microwave spectral holes in an erbium-doped scheelite crystal at millikelvin temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare-earth-ion (REI) ensembles in crystals have remarkable optical and spin properties characterized by narrow homogeneous linewidths relative to the inhomogeneous ensemble broadening. This makes it possible to precisely tailor the ensemble spectral density and therefore the absorption profile by applying narrow-linewidth radiation to transfer population into auxiliary levels, a process broadly known as spectral hole burning (SHB). REI-doped crystals find applications in information processing, both classical (pattern recognition, filtering, spectral analysis) and quantum (photon storage), all protocols requiring suitable ensemble preparation by SHB as a first step. In Er$^{3+}$-doped materials, the longest reported hole lifetime is one minute, and longer lifetimes are desirable. Here, we report SHB and accumulated echo measurements in a scheelite crystal of CaWO$_4$ by pumping the electron spin transition of Er$^{3+}$ ions at microwave frequencies and millikelvin temperatures, with nuclear spin states of neighboring $^{183}$W atoms serving as the auxiliary levels. The lifetime of the holes and accumulated echoes rises steeply as the sample temperature is decreased, exceeding a month at 10 mK. Our results demonstrate that millikelvin temperatures can be beneficial for signal processing applications requiring long spectral hole lifetimes.</description>

      <title>Surface plasmon-mediated photoluminescence boost in graphene-covered CsPbBr$_3$ quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical properties of graphene (Gr)-covered CsPbBr$_3$  quantum dots (QDs) were investigated using micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy, revealing a remarkable three-orders-of-magnitude enhancement in photoluminescence (PL) intensity compared to bare CsPbBr$_3$  QDs. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we combined experimental techniques with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. DFT simulations showed that the graphene layer generates interfacial electrostatic potential barriers when in contact with the CsPbBr$_3$  surface, impeding carrier leakage from perovskite to graphene and enhancing radiative recombination. Additionally, graphene passivates CsPbBr$_3$  surface defect states, suppressing nonradiative recombination of photo-generated carriers. Our study also revealed that graphene becomes n-doped upon contact with CsPbBr$_3$  QDs, activating its plasmon mode. This mode resonantly couples with photo-generated excitons in the perovskite. The momentum mismatch between graphene plasmons and free-space photons is resolved through plasmon scattering at Gr/CsPbBr$_3$  interface corrugations, facilitating the observed super-bright emission. These findings highlight the critical role of graphene as a top contact in dramatically enhancing CsPbBr$_3$  QDs' PL. Our work advances the understanding of graphene-perovskite interfaces and opens new avenues for designing high-efficiency optoelectronic devices. The multifaceted enhancement mechanisms uncovered provide valuable insights for future research in nanophotonics and materials science, potentially leading to breakthroughs in light-emitting technologies.</description>

      <title>Identifying band structure changes of FePS3 across the antiferromagnetic phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic 2D materials enable novel tuning options of magnetism. As an example, the van der Waals material FePS3, a zigzag-type intralayer antiferromagnet, exhibits very strong magnetoelastic coupling due to the different bond lengths along different ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic coupling directions enabling elastic tuning of magnetic properties. The likely cause of the length change is the intricate competition between direct exchange of the Fe atoms and superexchange via the S and P atoms. To elucidate this interplay, we study the band structure of exfoliated FePS3 by mu m scale ARPES (Angular Resolved Photoelectron Spectroscopy), both, above and, for the first time, below the Neel temperature TN. We find three characteristic changes across TN. They involve S 3p-type bands, Fe 3d-type bands and P 3p-type bands, respectively, as attributed by comparison with density functional theory calculations (DFT+U). This highlights the involvement of all the atoms in the magnetic phase transition providing independent evidence for the intricate exchange paths.</description>

      <title>Assessing the nature of nanoscale ferroelectric domain walls in lead titanate multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of unexpected polarisation textures such as vortices, skyrmions and merons in various oxide heterostructures has challenged the widely accepted picture of ferroelectric domain walls as being Ising-like. Bloch components in the 180{\deg} domain walls of PbTiO3 have recently been reported in PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices and linked to domain wall chirality. While this opens exciting perspectives, the ubiquitous nature of this Bloch component remains to be further explored. In this work, we present a comprehensive investigation of domain walls in PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices, involving a combination of first- and second-principles calculations, phase-field simulations, diffuse scattering calculations, and synchrotron based diffuse x-ray scattering. Our theoretical calculations highlight that the previously predicted Bloch polarisation in the 180{\deg} domain walls in PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices might be more sensitive to the boundary conditions than initially thought and is not always expected to appear. Employing diffuse scattering calculations for larger systems we develop a method to probe the complex structure of domain walls in these superlattices via diffuse x-ray scattering measurements. Through this approach, we investigate depolarization-driven ferroelectric polarization rotation at the domain walls. Our experimental findings, consistent with our theoretical predictions for realistic domain periods, do not reveal any signatures of a Bloch component in the centres of the 180{\deg} domain walls of PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices, suggesting that the precise nature of domain walls in the ultrathin PbTiO3 layers is more intricate than previously thought and deserves further attention.</description>

Abstract: Mercury telluride is an intriguing compound that is well known for the first realization of topological states. Despite being known for a long time, a quantitative understanding of its electronic properties remains challenging due to the presence of many concomitant subtle effects. By combining accurate first principles calculations and $k.p$ modelling, we investigate the topological phase diagram of mercury telluride as a function of strain. Our research demonstrates the significance of including the linearly $k$-dependent higher-order $C_4$ strain terms into the usual $k.p$ treatment. In particular, we report a unique $k$-dependence of the sub-band splitting, which arises from the interplay between strain and the standard bulk inversion asymmetry terms within our $k.p$ model. The impact of this phenomenon is explored in relation to the camel's back shape during the tensile strain phase and its implications for the Weyl semimetal state in the compressive strain case are discussed.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of structural phase transformations during continuous phosphorus deposition on Cu(111)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blue phosphorene -- two-dimensional, hexagonal-structured, semiconducting phosphorus -- has gained attention as it is considered easier to synthesize on metal surfaces than its allotrope, black phosphorene. Recent studies report different structures of phosphorene, for example, on Cu(111), but the underlying mechanisms of their formation are not known. Here, using a combination of in situ ultrahigh vacuum low-energy electron microscopy and in vacuo scanning tunneling microscopy, we determine the time-evolution of the surface structure and morphology during the deposition of phosphorus on single-crystalline Cu(111). We find that during early stages of deposition, phosphorus intermixes with Cu, resulting in copper phosphide structures. With increasing surface concentration of phosphorus, the phosphide phase disappears and a blue phosphorene layer forms, followed by self-assembly of highly ordered phosphorus clusters that eventually grow into multilayer islands. We attribute the unexpected transformation of stable phosphide to a phosphorene layer, and the previously unreported multilayer growth, to the presence of a large concentration of P2 dimers on the surface. Our results constitute direct evidence for a new growth mode leading to a phosphorene layer via an intermediary phase, which could underpin the growth of other 2D materials on strongly interacting substrates.</description>

      <title>Terahertz phonon engineering with van der Waals heterostructures</title>

Abstract: Phononic engineering at gigahertz (GHz) frequencies form the foundation of microwave acoustic filters, acousto-optic modulators, and quantum transducers. Terahertz (THz) phononic engineering could lead to acoustic filters and modulators at higher bandwidth and speed, as well as quantum circuits operating at higher temperatures. Despite its potential, methods for engineering THz phonons have been limited due to the challenges of achieving the required material control at sub-nanometer precision and efficient phonon coupling at THz frequencies. Here, we demonstrate efficient generation, detection, and manipulation of THz phonons through precise integration of atomically thin layers in van der Waals heterostructures. We employ few-layer graphene (FLG) as an ultrabroadband phonon transducer, converting femtosecond near-infrared pulses to acoustic phonon pulses with spectral content up to 3 THz. A monolayer WSe$_2$ is used as a sensor, where high-fidelity readout is enabled by the exciton-phonon coupling and strong light-matter interactions. Combining these capabilities in a single heterostructure and detecting responses to incident mechanical waves, we perform THz phononic spectroscopy. Using this platform, we demonstrate high-Q THz phononic cavities and show that a monolayer WSe$_2$ embedded in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) can efficiently block the transmission of THz phonons. By comparing our measurements to a nanomechanical model, we obtain the force constants at the heterointerfaces. Our results could enable THz phononic metamaterials for ultrabroadband acoustic filters and modulators, and open novel routes for thermal engineering.</description>

      <title>Purity-dependent Lorenz number, electron hydrodynamics and electron-phonon coupling in WTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study of electrical and thermal transport in Weyl semimetal WTe$_2$ down to 0.3 K. The Wiedemann-Franz law holds below 2 K and a downward deviation starts above. The deviation is more pronounced in cleaner samples, as expected in the hydrodynamic picture of electronic transport, where a fraction of electron-electron collisions conserve momentum. Phonons are the dominant heat carriers and their mean-free-path do not display a Knudsen minimum. This is presumably a consequence of weak anharmonicity, as indicated by the temperature dependence of the specific heat. Frequent momentum exchange between phonons and electrons leads to quantum oscillations of the phononic thermal conductivity. Bloch-Gr\"uneisen picture of electron-phonon scattering breaks down at low temperature when Umklapp ph-ph collisions cease to be a sink for electronic flow of momentum. Comparison with semi-metallic Sb shows that normal ph-ph collisions are amplified by anharmonicity. In both semimetals, at cryogenic temperature, e-ph collisions degrade the phononic flow of energy but not the electronic flow of momentum.</description>

      <title>Electric-field-tuned binding energies of trions in silicene, germanene, and stanene monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We predict the formation of intravalley controllable trions in buckled two-dimensional (2D) materials such as silicene, germanene, and stanene monolayers in an external electric field. Performing a study within the framework of a nonrelativistic potential model using the method of hyperspherical harmonics (HH), the three-body Schr\"{o}dinger equation is solved with the Rytova-Keldysh potential by expanding the wave functions of a trion in terms of the HH. Then, we numerically solve a resultant system of coupled differential equations. The ground state energies of intravalley trions controlled by the external electric field are presented. The dependencies of the binding energy (BE) of trions in silicene, germanene, and stanene as a function of the electric field are shown to be qualitatively similar. BEs of trions formed by $A$ and $B$ excitons have a non-negligible difference that increases slightly as the electric field increases. We demonstrate that trion BEs can be controlled by the external electric field.</description>

      <title>Visualization of Atomic Structures on Faceted and Non-Flat Surfaces by Difference-of-Gaussians Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detailed analysis of scanning probe microscopy (SPM) data acquired for faceted and non-flat surfaces is usually complicated due to the presence of a large number of surface areas tilted by large/variable angles relative to the scanning plane. As a consequence, standard methods of elimination of global or local slopes by either a plane subtraction or numerical differentiation seem to be ineffective. We demonstrate that a simple difference-of-Gaussians procedure provides output data corresponding to projection of a considered surface onto the scanning plane without undesirable contrast modifications. This method allows us to suppress small-scale noise, minimize effects of finite slopes in the SPM images along both fast and slow scanning directions and removes surface ripples without active participation of the operator. This method can be applied for fast on-the-fly visualization of experimental data, and for more detailed analysis, including high-precision determination of lattice parameters and angles between translation vectors for surface reconstruction of different terraces or surface domains. In order to estimate geometrical distortions introduced by our procedure, we compare the results obtained by the difference-of-Gaussians approach for the tilted surfaces with direct image rotation in 3D space.</description>
