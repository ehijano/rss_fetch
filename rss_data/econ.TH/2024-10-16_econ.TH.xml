      <title>The Pond Dilemma with Heterogeneous Relative Concerns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores team formation when workers differ in skills and their desire to out-earn co-workers. I cast this question as a two-dimensional assignment problem with imperfectly transferable utility and show that equilibrium sorting optimally trades off output maximisation with the need to match high-skill workers to co-workers with weak relative concerns. This can lead to positive (negative) assortative matching in skill even with submodular (supermodular) production functions. Under supermodular production, this heterogeneity in preferences benefits all workers and reduces wage inequality. With submodular production, the distributional consequences are ambiguous, and some workers become worse off. The model reveals that skill-biased technological change (SBTC) incentivises domestic outsourcing, as firms seek to avoid detrimental social comparisons between high- and low-skill workers, thus providing a compelling explanation for the long-term increase in outsourcing. Finally, the benefits of SBTC can trickle down to low-skill workers-but only those whose relative concerns are weak.</description>

      <title>Time-Varyingness in Auction Breaks Revenue Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Auction is one of the most representative buying-selling systems. A celebrated study shows that the seller's expected revenue is equal in equilibrium, regardless of the type of auction, typically first-price and second-price auctions. Here, however, we hypothesize that when some auction environments vary with time, this revenue equivalence may not be maintained. In second-price auctions, the equilibrium strategy is robustly feasible. Conversely, in first-price auctions, the buyers must continue to adapt their strategies according to the environment of the auction. Surprisingly, we prove that revenue equivalence can be broken in both directions. First-price auctions bring larger or smaller revenue than second-price auctions, case by case, depending on how the value of an item varies. Our experiments also demonstrate revenue inequivalence in various scenarios, where the value varies periodically or randomly. This study uncovers a phenomenon, the breaking of revenue equivalence by the time-varyingness in auctions, that likely occurs in real-world auctions, revealing its underlying mechanism.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning and Free-riding in a Competitive Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a collaborative technique for training large-scale models while protecting user data privacy. Despite its substantial benefits, the free-riding behavior raises a major challenge for the formation of FL, especially in competitive markets. Our paper explores this under-explored issue on how the free-riding behavior in a competitive market affects firms' incentives to form FL. Competing firms can improve technologies through forming FL to increase the performance of their products, which in turn, affects consumers' product selection and market size. The key complication is whether the free-riding behavior discourages information contribution by participating firms and results in the decomposition of FL, and even free riding does not discourage information contribution, this does not necessarily mean that a firm wants to form FL in a competitive market because free riding may reshape the competition positions of each participating firm and thus forming FL may not be profitable. We build a parsimonious game theoretical model that captures these interactions and our analyses show several new findings. First, even in the presence of the free-riding behavior, competing firms under FL find it optimal to contribute all its available information. Second, the firm with less amount of information always finds it profitable to free ride; whether its rival (with more amount of information) have an incentive to form FL only when the level of competition or when the gap in information volume is not high. Third, when FL is formed, there exists an "All-Win" situation in which all stakeholders (participating firms, consumers, and social planner) benefit. Last, subsidizing by the free-riding firm can align its rival's incentive to form FL only when the level of competition is intermediate.</description>

      <title>Obvious Manipulations in Matching without and with Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores many-to-one matching models, both with and without contracts, where doctors' preferences are private and hospitals' preferences are public and substitutable. It is known that any stable-dominating mechanism --which is either stable or individually rational and Pareto-dominates (from the doctors' perspective) a stable mechanism--, is susceptible to manipulation by doctors. Our study focuses on \textit{obvious manipulations} and identifies stable-dominating mechanisms that prevent them. Without contracts, we show that more efficient mechanisms are less likely to be obviously manipulable and that any stable-dominating mechanism is not obviously manipulable. However, with contracts, none of these results hold. While we demonstrate that the Doctor-Proposing Deferred Acceptance (DA) Mechanism remains not obviously manipulable, we show that the Hospital-Proposing DA Mechanism and any efficient mechanism that Pareto-dominates the Doctor-Proposing DA Mechanism become (very) obviously manipulable, in the model with contracts.</description>

      <title>Quota Mechanisms: Finite-Sample Optimality and Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quota mechanism links together multiple decisions by imposing a quota across decisions. We analyze the performance of quota mechanisms when the number of linked decisions is finite and the designer has imperfect knowledge of the type distribution; previously, only asymptotic results were known. Using a new optimal transport approach, we derive an ex-post decision error guarantee for quota mechanisms. This guarantee cannot be improved by any mechanisms without transfers. We quantify the sensitivity of quota mechanisms to errors in the designer's estimate of the type distribution. Finally, we show that quotas are robust to agents' beliefs about each other.</description>

      <title>Consistent Conjectures in Dynamic Matching Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a framework to study stability notions for two-sided dynamic matching markets in which matching is one-to-one and irreversible. The framework gives center stage to the set of matchings an agent anticipates would ensue should they remain unmatched, which we refer to as the agent's conjectures. A collection of conjectures, together with a pairwise stability and individual rationality requirement given the conjectures, defines a solution concept for the economy. We identify a sufficient condition--consistency--for a family of conjectures to lead to a nonempty solution (cf. Hafalir, 2008). As an application, we introduce two families of consistent conjectures and their corresponding solution concepts: continuation-value-respecting dynamic stability, and the extension to dynamic markets of the solution concept in Hafalir (2008), sophisticated dynamic stability.</description>

      <title>Robust Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The maxmin approach to distributional robustness evaluates each mechanism according to its payoff guarantee over all priors in an ambiguity set. We propose a refinement: the guarantee must be approximately satisfied at priors near the ambiguity set (in the weak topology). We call such a guarantee robust. The payoff guarantees from some maxmin-optimal mechanisms in the literature are not robust. We show, however, that over certain standard ambiguity sets (such as continuous moment sets), every mechanism's payoff guarantee is robust. We give a behavioral characterization of our refined robustness notion by imposing a new continuity axiom on maxmin preferences.</description>
