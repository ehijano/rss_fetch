      <title>Dynamical localization for random scattering zippers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article establishes a proof of dynamical localization for a random scattering zipper model. The scattering zipper operator is the product of two unitary by blocks operators, multiplicatively perturbed on the left and right by random unitary phases. One of the operator is shifted so that this configuration produces a random 5-diagonal unitary operator per blocks. To prove the dynamical localization for this operator, we use the method of fractional moments. We first prove the continuity and strict positivity of the Lyapunov exponents in an annulus around the unit circle, which leads to the exponential decay of a power of the norm of the products of transfer matrices. We then establish an explicit formulation of the coefficients of the finite resolvent from the coefficients of the transfer matrices using Schur's complement. From this we deduce, through two reduction results, the exponential decay of the resolvent, from which we get the dynamical localization after proving that it also implies the exponential decay of moments of order $2$ of the resolvent.</description>

      <title>On asymptotics of Robin eigenvalues in the Dirichlet limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian with homogeneous Robin boundary conditions, when the (positive) Robin parameter is diverging. In this framework, since the convergence of the Robin eigenvalues to the Dirichlet ones is known, we address the question of quantifying the rate of such convergence. More precisely, in this work we identify the proper geometric quantity representing (asymptotically) the first term in the expansion of the eigenvalue variation: it is a novel notion of torsional rigidity. Then, by performing a suitable asymptotic analysis of both such quantity and its minimizer, we prove the first-order expansion of any Robin eigenvalue, in the Dirichlet limit. Moreover, the convergence rate of the corresponding eigenfunctions is obtained as well. We remark that all our spectral estimates are explicit and sharp, and cover both the cases of convergence to simple and multiple Dirichlet eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Spectral inclusions of perturbed normal operators and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12550v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a normal operator $T$ on a Hilbert space $H$. Under various assumptions on the spectrum of $T$, we give bounds for the spectrum of $T+A$ where $A$ is $T$-bounded with relative bound less than 1 but we do not assume that $A$ is symmetric or normal. If the imaginary part of the spectrum of $T$ is bounded, then the spectrum of $T+A$ is contained in the region between certain hyperbolas whose asymptotic slope depends on the $T$-bound of $A$. If the spectrum of $T$ is contained in a bisector, then the spectrum of $T+A$ is contained in the area between certain rotated hyperbola. The case of infinite gaps in the spectrum of $T$ is studied. Moreover, we prove a stability result for the essential spectrum of $T+A$. If $A$ is even $p$-subordinate to $T$, then we obtain stronger results for the localisation of the spectrum of $T+A$.</description>

      <title>Lightning graph matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14701v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph matching aims to find correspondences between two graphs. It is a fundamental task in pattern recognition. The classical spectral matching algorithm has time complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ and space complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^4)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes. Such a complexity limits the applicability to large-scale graph matching tasks. This paper proposes an efficient redesign of spectral matching by transforming the graph matching problem into a 1D linear assignment problem, which can be solved efficiently by sorting two $n \times 1$ vectors. The resulting algorithm is named the lightning spectral assignment method (LiSA), which enjoys a complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and the theoretical analysis of the strategy.</description>
