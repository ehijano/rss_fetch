      <title>A sufficient condition for the existence of smooth solutions of the relativistic cold plasma equations on any given time interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In terms of initial data, a sufficient condition for the smoothness of the solution to the Cauchy problem for one-dimensional relativistic cold plasma equations over any given time interval is found. Unlike the non-relativistic case, such sufficient conditions take into account the smallness properties of not only the derivatives of the initial data but also the initial data themselves. The accuracy of the obtained initial condition is investigated using a numerical experiment. The structure of the emerging singularities is also studied.</description>

      <title>A formula for the edge density $\sqrt{n}$-correction for two-dimensional Coulomb systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In connection with recent work on smallest gaps, C.~Charlier proves that the 1-point function of a suitable planar Coulomb system $\{z_j\}_1^n$, in the determinantal case with respect to an external potential $Q(z)$, admits the expansion, as $n\to\infty$, $$R_n\bigg(z_0+\frac t {\sqrt{2n\partial\bar{\partial} Q(z_0)}}\nu(z_0)\bigg)=n\partial\bar{\partial} Q(z_0)\frac {\operatorname{erfc} t}2+\sqrt{n\partial\bar{\partial} Q(z_0)}\,C(z_0;t)+\mathcal{O}(\log^3 n).$$ Here $t$ is a real parameter, $z_0$ is a regular boundary point of the (connected) Coulomb droplet and $\nu(z_0)$ is the outwards unit normal; the coefficient $C(z_0;t)$ has an apriori structure depending on a number of parameters.
  In this note we identify the parameters and obtain a formula for $C(z_0;t)$ in potential theoretic and geometric terms. Our formula holds for a large class of potentials such that the droplet is connected with smooth boundary. Our derivation uses the well known expectation of fluctuations formula.</description>

      <title>Superintegrability of $q,t$-matrix models and quantum toroidal algebra recursions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $q,t$-deformed matrix models give rise to representations of the deformed Virasoro algebra and more generally of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_1$ algebra. These representations are described in terms of finite difference equations that induce recursion relations for correlation functions. Under suitable assumptions, these recursions admit unique solutions expressible through "superintegrability" formulas, i.e. explicit closed formulas for averages of Macdonald polynomials. In this paper, we discuss examples arising from localization of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories, which include $q,t$-deformation of well known classical ensembles: Gaussian, Laguerre and Jacobi. We explain how relations in the quantum toroidal algebra can be used to give a new and universal proof of the known superintegrability formulas, as well as to derive new formulas for models that have not been previously studied in the literature. Finally, we make some remarks regarding the relation between superintegrability and orthogonal polynomials.</description>

      <title>Causal Coverage in Ordered Locales and Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop relativistic causality theory in the setting of point-free topology by introducing a notion of causal coverage in ordered locales, generalising their canonical coverage relation to incorporate causal structure. This improves Christensen and Crane's construction of `causal sites'. We connect to sheaf theory by showing that causal coverages can be interpreted as a generalised Grothendieck topology, and the sheaf condition as a type of deterministic time evolution. To develop these notions, we introduce and study parallel ordered locales. Causal coverage naturally induces a notion of domain of dependence. Comparing the localic and curve-wise definitions in spacetimes, the localic domains strictly contain the classical ones.</description>

      <title>On a Class of Berndt-type Integrals and Related Barnes Multiple Zeta Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a class of special Berndt-type integral calculations where the integrand contains only hyperbolic cosine functions. The research approach proceeds as follows: Firstly, through contour integration methods, we transform the integral into a Ramanujan-type hyperbolic infinite series. Subsequently, we introduce a $\theta$-parameterized auxiliary function and apply the residue theorem from complex analysis to successfully simplify mixed-type denominators combining hyperbolic cosine and sine terms into a normalized Ramanujan-type hyperbolic infinite series with denominators containing only single hyperbolic function terms. For these simplified hyperbolic infinite series, we combine properties of Jacobi elliptic functions with composite analytical techniques involving Fourier series expansion and Maclaurin series expansion. This ultimately yields an explicit expression as a rational polynomial combination of $\Gamma(1/4)$ and $\pi^{-1/2}$. Notably, this work establishes a connection between the integral and Barnes multiple zeta functions, providing a novel research pathway for solving related problems.</description>

      <title>Near-Equilibrium Propagation training in nonlinear wave systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backpropagation learning algorithm, the workhorse of modern artificial intelligence, is notoriously difficult to implement in physical neural networks. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is an alternative with comparable efficiency and strong potential for in-situ training. We extend EP learning to both discrete and continuous complex-valued wave systems. In contrast to previous EP implementations, our scheme is valid in the weakly dissipative regime, and readily applicable to a wide range of physical settings, even without well defined nodes, where trainable inter-node connections can be replaced by trainable local potential. We test the method in driven-dissipative exciton-polariton condensates governed by generalized Gross-Pitaevskii dynamics. Numerical studies on standard benchmarks, including a simple logical task and handwritten-digit recognition, demonstrate stable convergence, establishing a practical route to in-situ learning in physical systems in which system control is restricted to local parameters.</description>

      <title>Spectral Chebyshev Approximation of Cosmic Expansion in $f(R)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical framework to study the cosmological background evolution in $f(R)$ gravity by employing a \textit{spectral Chebyshev collocation approach}. Unlike standard integration methods such as Runge--Kutta that often encounter stiffness and accuracy issues, this formulation expands the normalized Hubble function $E(z) = H(z)/H_0$ as a finite Chebyshev series. The modified Friedmann equation is then enforced at selected Chebyshev--Gauss--Lobatto points, converting the original nonlinear differential equation into a system of algebraic relations for the series coefficients. This transformation yields exponentially convergent and numerically stable solutions over the entire redshift domain, $0&lt;z&lt;z_{max}$, eliminating the need for adaptive step-size control. We apply the method to two widely studied $f(R)$ models, Hu--Sawicki and Starobinsky, and perform a combined analysis using cosmic chronometer $H(z)$ data and the Union~3.0 supernova compilation. The reconstructed expansion histories match observations to within $2\sigma$ over $0 &lt; z &lt; 2$, producing best-fit parameters of approximately $(\Omega_{m0}, H_0, \Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}) \simeq (0.29, 68, 1.2\text{--}2.5\,H_0^2)$. These results indicates that both models reproduce the observed late-time acceleration while permitting small geometric corrections to $\Lambda$CDM. Overall, the spectral Chebyshev method provides a precise and computationally efficient framework for probing modified-gravity cosmologies in the precision-data era.</description>

      <title>Commuting Embeddings for Parallel Strategies in Non-local Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-local games (NLGs) provide a versatile framework for probing quantum correlations and for benchmarking the power of entanglement. In finite dimensions, the standard method for playing several games in parallel requires a tensor product of the local Hilbert spaces, which scales additively in the number of qubits. In this work, we show that this additive cost can be reduced by exploiting algebraic embeddings. We introduce two forms of compressions. First, when a referee selects one game from a finite collection of games at random, the game quantum strategy can be implemented using a maximally entangled state of dimension equal to the largest individual game, thereby eliminating the need for repeated state preparations. Second, we establish conditions under which several games can be played simultaneously in parallel on fewer qubits than the tensor product baseline. These conditions are expressed in terms of commuting embeddings of the game algebras. Moreover, we provide a constructive framework for building such embeddings. Using tools from Lie theory, we show that aligning the various game algebras into a common Cartan decomposition enables such a qubit reduction. Beyond the theoretical contribution, our framework casts NLGs as algebraic primitives for distributed and resource constrained quantum computations and suggested NLGs as a comparable device independent dimension witness.</description>

      <title>Predictability of Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of complex systems has attracted widespread attention from researchers in the fields of natural sciences, social sciences, and engineering. Prediction is one of the central issues in this field. Although most related studies have focused on prediction methods, research on the predictability of complex systems has received increasing attention across disciplines--aiming to provide theories and tools to address a key question: What are the limits of prediction accuracy? Predictability itself can serve as an important feature for characterizing complex systems, and accurate estimation of predictability can provide a benchmark for the study of prediction algorithms. This allows researchers to clearly identify the gap between current prediction accuracy and theoretical limits, thereby helping them determine whether there is still significant room to improve existing algorithms. More importantly, investigating predictability often requires the development of new theories and methods, which can further inspire the design of more effective algorithms. Over the past few decades, this field has undergone significant evolution. In particular, the rapid development of data science has introduced a wealth of data-driven approaches for understanding and quantifying predictability. This review summarizes representative achievements, integrating both data-driven and mechanistic perspectives. After a brief introduction to the significance of the topic in focus, we will explore three core aspects: the predictability of time series, the predictability of network structures, and the predictability of dynamical processes. Finally, we will provide extensive application examples across various fields and outline open challenges for future research.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic Wave Excitation by Laser Pulse in a Magnetized Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the study of plasma, particularly in applications involving strong laser-plasma interactions, the propagation of a strong electromagnetic wave induces relativistic velocities in the electron flow. Given such conditions, the wave propagating through the plasma experiences modulational instability. In this paper, we investigate this instability using magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. In the relativistic limit, the motion of ions can be neglected due to their significant inertia, allowing us to treat the ions as a background fluid. This simplification enables us to apply perturbation techniques to the electron fluid equations, leading to the derivation of the nonlinear wave equation in the form of the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation (NLSE). We also explore the relationship between wave dispersion and the conditions for instability. We derive the maximum growth rate of the modulational instability and analyze its dependence on plasma parameters and wave intensity in the context of relativistic magnetized plasma, providing quantitative insights into the instability dynamics. Finally, we examine aspects of the perturbed NLSE using the Bogoliubov-Mitropolsky perturbation approach, treating real and imaginary coefficients separately, which explicitly incorporates both Nonlinear Landau Damping (NLLD) and growth-damping effects.</description>

      <title>High-order temporal parametric finite element methods for simulating solid-state dewetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a class of temporally high-order parametric finite element methods for simulating solid-state dewetting of thin films in two dimensions using a sharp-interface model. The process is governed by surface diffusion and contact point migration, along with appropriate boundary conditions. By incorporating the predictor-corrector strategy and the backward differentiation formula for time discretization into the energy-stable parametric finite element method developed by Zhao et al. (2021), we successfully construct temporally high-order schemes. The resulting numerical scheme is semi-implicit, requiring the solution of a linear system at each time step. The well-posedness of the fully discretized system is established. Moreover, the method maintains the long-term mesh equidistribution property. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve the desired temporal accuracy, measured by the manifold distance, while maintaining good mesh quality throughout the evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive an explicit BRST-exact operator identity for the bulk Hamiltonian in quantum gravity, working within a BRST-invariant quantization of General Relativity, treated as a low-energy effective field theory. We show that, up to a boundary term, the Hamiltonian can be written elegantly as the anticommutator of the BRST charge and the temporal ghost field. This form makes manifest that the Hamiltonian flow acts as a time-reparameterization on the correlation functions of the physical degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that the BRST-exactness of the bulk Hamiltonian does not trivialize the time evolution of gravitational backgrounds or bulk correlators, nor does it trivialize scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for divergences, free energies, and Fokker-Planck equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many efforts have been made to explore systems that show significant deviations from predictions related to the standard statistical mechanics. The present work introduces a unified formalism that connects divergences, generalized free energies, generalized Fokker-Planck equations, and H-theorem. This framework is applied here in a range of scenarios, illustrating both established and novel results. In many cases, the approach begins with a free energy functional that explicitly includes a potential energy term, leading to a direct relation between this energy and the stationary solution. Conversely, when a divergence is used as free energy, the associated Fokker-Planck-like equation lacks any explicit dependence on the potential energy, depending instead on the stationary solution. To restore a potential-based interpretation, an additional relation between the stationary solution and the potential energy must be imposed. This duality underlines the flexibility of the formalism and its capacity to adapt to systems where the potential energy is unknown or unnecessary.</description>

      <title>Successive generation of nontrivial Riemann zeros from a Wu-Sprung type potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A series of numerical experiments are performed, where a symmetric potential is generated for the 1D time-independent Schr\"odinger equation, with an eigenspectrum that matches the imaginary part of the first nontrivial zeros of the Riemann Zeta Function. The potential is generated as a series of correction functions, where the starting point is a potential that matches the smooth Riemann -- von Mangoldt approximation. It is found that the correction functions display a clear pattern that can be explained in simple terms, almost entirely dependent on the approximation error in the Riemann -- von Mangoldt formula. This also provides an explanation for the fractal pattern in the potential that was observed by Wu and Sprung.</description>

Translations and Carroll boosts, associated with two independent globally defined solutions of a Sturm-Liouville equation allow us to describe the motions. The Displacement Memory Effect arises for particular choices of the parameters which yield trajectories with zero momentum. We illustrate our general statements by the P\"oschl-Teller profile.</description>

      <title>Efficient High-Accuracy PDEs Solver with the Linear Attention Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural operators offer a powerful data-driven framework for learning mappings between function spaces, in which the transformer-based neural operator architecture faces a fundamental scalability-accuracy trade-off: softmax attention provides excellent fidelity but incurs quadratic complexity $\mathcal{O}(N^2 d)$ in the number of mesh points $N$ and hidden dimension $d$, while linear attention variants reduce cost to $\mathcal{O}(N d^2)$ but often suffer significant accuracy degradation. To address the aforementioned challenge, in this paper, we present a novel type of neural operators, Linear Attention Neural Operator (LANO), which achieves both scalability and high accuracy by reformulating attention through an agent-based mechanism. LANO resolves this dilemma by introducing a compact set of $M$ agent tokens $(M \ll N)$ that mediate global interactions among $N$ tokens. This agent attention mechanism yields an operator layer with linear complexity $\mathcal{O}(MN d)$ while preserving the expressive power of softmax attention. Theoretically, we demonstrate the universal approximation property, thereby demonstrating improved conditioning and stability properties. Empirically, LANO surpasses current state-of-the-art neural PDE solvers, including Transolver with slice-based softmax attention, achieving average $19.5\%$ accuracy improvement across standard benchmarks. By bridging the gap between linear complexity and softmax-level performance, LANO establishes a scalable, high-accuracy foundation for scientific machine learning applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a scalar conservation law on the torus in which the flux $\mathbf{j}$ is composed of a Coulomb interaction and a nonlinear mobility: $\mathbf{j} = -u^m\nabla\mathsf{g}\ast u$. We prove existence of entropy solutions and a weak-strong uniqueness principle. We also prove several properties shared among entropy solutions, in particular a lower barrier in the fast diffusion regime $m\lt 1$. In the porous media regime $m\ge 1$, we study the decreasing rearrangement of solutions, which allows to prove an instantaneous growth of the support and a waiting time phenomenon. We also show exponential convergence of the solutions towards the spatial average in several topologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an extended kinematics of nominally elastic continuum solids allowing one to describe their mechanical interaction with micro-scale loading devices. The main new ingredient is the concept of a micro-displacement tensor which extends the conventional description of the deforming elastic solids in terms of macroscopic displacement vectors. We show that micro-displacement tensors are particularly useful in dealing with active incompatibility acquisition and its subsequent passive relaxation. We use the proposed approach to describe the energetics of surface deposition while accounting for the presence of micro-mechanical controls.To illustrate the effectiveness of the new conceptual scheme we present two case studies: crystallization from a melt resulting in pre-stress, and winding of a coil with controlled pre-stretch.</description>

      <title>Single-letter Chain Rule for Quantum Relative Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relative entropy is the standard measure of distinguishability in classical and quantum information theory. In the classical case, its loss under channels admits an exact chain rule, while in the quantum case only asymptotic, regularized chain rules are known. We establish new chain rules for quantum relative entropy that apply already in the single-copy regime. The first inequality is obtained via POVM decompositions, extending the point distributions in the classical chain rule to quantum ensemble partitions. The second gives a sufficient condition for the most natural extension of the classical result, which uses projectors as a analog for the classical point distributions. We additionally find a semiclassical chain rule where the point distributions are replaced with the projectors of the initial states, and, finally, we find a relation to previous works on strengthened data processing inequalities and recoverability. These results show that meaningful chain inequalities are possible already at the single-copy level, but they also highlight that tighter bounds remain to be found.</description>

      <title>Modified open Toda chain and quasi-integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of a quasi-integrable deformation of the three-particle open Toda chain, constructed by introducing a translation-invariant three-body interaction terms. Although this modification explicitly breaks the exact integrability of the standard Toda model, it retains fundamental structural properties, including energy and momentum conservation. Furthermore, we show that under a specific time-reflection and discrete symmetry among the chain coordinates, the system admits a quasi-conserved higher-order integral. Through analytic and numerical analysis of the deformed dynamics, we demonstrate the emergence and long-time persistence of quasi-conserved quantities, thereby establishing a controlled realization of quasi-integrability in a minimal nonlinear chain. Given the central role of integrable systems in elucidating the dynamics of classical and quantum models, this framework provides a concrete setting to investigate the mechanisms underlying the gradual breakdown of integrability and the onset of quasi-integrability in few-body systems.</description>

      <title>Periodic limit for non-autonomous Lagrangian systems and applications to a Kuramoto type model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the asymptotic properties of non-autonomous Lagrangian systems, assuming that the associated Tonelli Lagrangian converges to a time-periodic function. Specifically, given a continuous initial condition, we provide a suitable construction of a Lax-Oleinik semigroup such that it converges toward a periodic solution of the equation. Moreover, the graph of its gradient converges as time tends to infinity to the graph of the gradient of the periodic limit function with respect to the Hausdorff distance. Finally, we apply this result to a Kuramoto-type model, proving the existence of an invariant torus given by the graph of the gradient of the limiting periodic solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation.</description>

      <title>Hopf BiGalois Theory for Hopf Algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of Hopf BiGalois extensions for Hopf algebroids. We understand these to be left bialgebroids (whose left module categories are monoidal categories) fulfilling a condition that is equivalent to being Hopf in the case of ordinary bialgebras, but does not entail the existence of an antipode map. The immediate obstacle to developing a full biGalois theory for such Hopf algebroids is simple: The condition to be a left Hopf Galois extension can be defined in complete analogy to the Hopf case, but the Galois map for a right comodule algebra is not a well defined map. We find that this obstacle can be circumvented using bialgebroids fulfilling a condition that still does not entail the existence of an antipode, but is equivalent, for ordinary bialgebras, to being Hopf with bijective antipode. The key technical tool is a result of Chemla allowing to switch left and right comodule structures under flatness conditions much like one would do using an antipode. Using this, we arrive at a left-right symmetric theory of biGalois extensions, including the construction of an Ehresmann Hopf algebroid making a one-sided Hopf-Galois extension into a biGalois one. Moreover, we apply a more general 2-cocycle twist theory to Ehresmann Hopf algebroids. As the 2-cocycle is only left linear over the base, the base algebra is also twisted. We also study the Ehresmann Hopf algebroids of quantum Hopf fibrations and quantum homogeneous space as examples.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Sum Rule from Higher-Form Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an entanglement sum rule for $(d{-}1)$-dimensional quantum lattice models with finite abelian higher-form symmetries, obtained by minimally coupling a sector on $p$-simplices carrying a $p$-form $G$ symmetry to a sector on $(p{+}1)$-simplices carrying the dual $(d{-}p{-}2)$-form $\widehat G$ symmetry (with $\widehat G$ the Pontryagin dual of $G$). The coupling is introduced by conjugation with a symmetry-preserving operator $\mathcal{U}$ that dresses symmetry-invariant operators with appropriate Wilson operators. On the symmetry-invariant subspace, $\mathcal{U}$ is well-defined and unitary, and the coupled Hamiltonian is obtained from the decoupled one by conjugation with $\mathcal{U}$. Our main result concerns symmetric eigenstates of the coupled model that arise by acting with $\mathcal{U}$ on direct-product, symmetric eigenstates of the decoupled model: provided a topological criterion formulated via the Mayer--Vietoris sequence holds for the chosen bipartition, $\mathcal{U}$ factorizes across the cut when acting on the symmetric state, and the bipartite entanglement entropy equals the sum of the entropies of the two sectors. The framework explains and generalizes known examples in fermion-$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, identifies when topology obstructs the factorization, and provides a procedure to construct new examples by gauging higher-form symmetries.</description>

      <title>Tagged vector space, Part I: Dirac notation as originally intended</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A generalization is provided for the notion of tags, as used in various formulations of physical scenarios. It leads to the definition of tagged vector spaces, based on a set of axioms for tags and their extractors. As an application, such a tagged vector space is used to provide, in the context of quantum optics, a formal mathematical description for the Dirac notation that is closer to its intended usage compared to current mathematical formulations: it provides a one-to-one mapping between kets and bras and allows operators to operate either to the left or to the right. The canonical commutation relations for the quadrature and ladder operators are derived as consequences of the axioms of the tagged vector space. These axioms also lead to a symplectic phase space with the Wigner function and the Weyl transform emerging naturally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that super Gromov-Witten invariants can be defined and computed by methods of tropical geometry. When the target is a point, the super invariants are descendant invariants on the moduli space of curves, which can be computed tropically. When the target is a convex, toric variety $X$, we describe a procedure to compute the tropical Euler class of the SUSY normal bundle $\overline{N}_{n, \beta}$ on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n}(X, \beta)$, assuming it is locally tropicalizable in the sense of [CG], [CGM]. Then, we define the tropical, genus-0, $n$-marked, super Gromov-Witten invariant of $X$, and compute an example. This gives a tropical interpretation of super Gromov-Witten invariants of convex, toric varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the last passage time in geometric last passage percolation (LPP). As the system size increases, we derive precise large deviation probabilities -- up to and including the constant terms -- for both the lower and upper tails. A key step in proving these results is to establish a duality formula that reformulates the LPP problem in terms of the largest eigenvalue in the Jacobi unitary ensemble (JUE). In addition, we establish a second duality formula, which relates the LPP problem to the truncated unitary ensemble (TUE). Using this, we also derive asymptotics for the moments of the absolute value of characteristic polynomials of the TUE, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanics Relative to a Quantum Reference System: Relative State Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an intrinsic or background-independent quantum framework based on entangled state rather than absolute quantum state, it describes a quantum relative state between the under-study quantum system and the quantum measuring apparatus as a quantum reference system, without relying on any external absolute parameter. The paper focuses on a simple example, in which a quantum object's one-dimensional position as an under-study quantum system, and a quantum clock as a quantum reference system or quantum measuring apparatus. The evolution equation of the state of the quantum object's position with respect to the state of the quantum clock is given, which is found to be a complex Gauss-Codazzi type equation of the total quantum state space coming from the Ricci-flat Kahler-Einstein equation. In a linear and non-relativistic approximation, the framework recovers the equation of the standard quantum mechanics, in which an intrinsic potential related to some "inertial force" is automatically incorporated in the covariant derivative. A physical relative probability interpretation and a geometric non-trivial fiber bundle interpretation of the entangled state in this intrinsic quantum framework are given. Furthermore, some non-inertial effects, such as the "inertial force", coming from the general covariance of the intrinsic quantum framework are also discussed. Compared with the functional integral approach which is more easily to generalize the quantum clock to the quantum spacetime reference frame and study quantum gravity, the relative state approach as a canonical description is more suitable for conceptually demonstrating the connections to the standard formalism and interpretation of the quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The second law of thermodynamics constitutes a fundamental principle of physics, precluding the existence of perpetual motion machines and providing a natural definition of the arrow of time. Its scope extends across virtually all areas of physical theory. Nonetheless, certain systems are known to admit negative absolute temperatures under well-defined conditions, a phenomenon that has been experimentally observed. In this work, we formulate an \textit{extended} version of the first and second laws, which recovers the conventional statement for positive temperatures and extends its applicability to the negative-temperature domain. Illustrative examples are discussed in the contexts of quantum cosmology and Onsager's vortices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the Unruh state for a free scalar quantum field on Kerr-de Sitter under the assumption of mode stability. We summarise the proof of its Hadamard property that was previously given in [Klein:2023] for sufficiently small black-hole rotation and cosmological constant and show how it can be generalised to any subextreme black-hole angular momentum in the same range of the cosmological constant. This is done by extending a geometric analysis of the trapped set of the Kerr spacetime [H\"afner, Klein:2024] to Kerr-de Sitter. Moreover, we discuss the application of this state in the numerical study of quantum effects at the inner horizon [Klein, Soltani, Casals, Hollands:2024], and describe a universality result for these effects [Hintz, Klein: 2024].</description>

Abstract: In the paper, we prove the existence of a positive and essentially bounded solution to a Lichnerowicz equation in the Einstein-scalar field theory on a closed manifold with non-constant mean curvature. In particular, the non-constant mean curvature gives rise to supercritical terms in the equation, on top of singular ones. We employ a recent fixed-point argument, which involves sub- and supersolutions. Additionally, we provide several conditions on the coefficients in the equation that prevent the existence of positive classical solutions.</description>

      <title>Matrix Correlators as Discrete Volumes of Moduli Space I: Recursion Relations, the BMN-limit and DSSYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show certain correlators in generic one-matrix models define a notion of ``discrete'' volumes of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, generalizing the connection between random matrices and JT gravity. We prove they obey a discrete, Mirzakhani-like recursion relation. Their fundamental discreteness crucially relies upon studying these matrix integrals away from the usual double-scaling limit. In a BMN-like limit of large traces, this recursion universally goes over to a continuous one, and the correlators asymptote to the volumes of Kontsevich. Finally, we demonstrate that the ETH matrix integral for DSSYK furnishes a discrete, $q$-analog of the Weil--Petersson volumes, thereby proving a conjecture due to K. Okuyama.</description>

      <title>Aharonov-Casher theorems for Dirac operators on manifolds with boundary and APS boundary condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Aharonov-Casher theorem is a result on the number of the so-called zero modes of a system described by the magnetic Pauli operator in $\mathbb{R}^2$. In this paper we address the same question for the Dirac operator on a flat two-dimensional manifold with boundary and Atiyah-Patodi-Singer boundary condition. More concretely we are interested in the plane and a disc with a finite number of circular holes cut out. We consider a smooth compactly supported magnetic field on the manifold and an arbitrary magnetic field inside the holes.</description>

      <title>A highly accurate procedure for computing globally optimal Wannier functions in one-dimensional crystalline insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04369v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A standard task in solid state physics and quantum chemistry is the computation of localized molecular orbitals known as Wannier functions. In this manuscript, we propose a new procedure for computing Wannier functions in one-dimensional crystalline materials. Our approach proceeds by first performing parallel transport of the Bloch functions using numerical integration. Then a simple analytically computable correction is introduced to yield the optimally localized Wannier function. The resulting scheme is rapidly convergent and is proven to yield real-valued Wannier functions that achieve global optimality. The analysis in this manuscript can also be viewed as a proof of the existence of exponentially localized Wannier functions in one dimension. We illustrate the performance of the scheme by a number of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>The Wehrl-type entropy conjecture for symmetric $SU(N)$ coherent states: cases of equality and stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10940v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lieb and Solovej proved that, for the symmetric $SU(N)$ representations, the corresponding Wehrl-type entropy is minimized by symmetric coherent states. However, the uniqueness of the minimizers remained an open problem when $N\geq 3$. In this note, we complete the proof of the Wehrl entropy conjecture for such representations by showing that symmetric coherent states are, in fact, the only minimizers. We also provide an application to the maximum concentration of holomorphic polynomials and deduce a corresponding Faber-Krahn inequality. A sharp quantitative form of the bound by Lieb and Solovej is also proved.</description>

Abstract: A linear quantum harmonic oscillator factors into one dimensional oscillators and can be solved using creation and annihilation operators. We consider a spherical analogue. This analogue does not factor. The two dimensional case is critical, and we compute the spectrum and partition function. This is of interest because the spherical oscillator is potentially relevant to chiral models in 2d quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Area Law for the entanglement entropy of free fermions in nonrandom ergodic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper deals with the asymptotic behavior of one of the widely used characteristics of correlations in large quantum systems. The correlations are known as quantum entanglement, the characteristic is called the entanglement entropy, and as large systems we consider an ideal gas of spinless lattice fermions. The system is determined by its one-body Hamiltonian. As shown in \cite{EPS}, if the Hamiltonian is an ergodic finite difference operator with exponentially decaying spectral projection, then the asymptotic form of the entanglement entropy is the so-called Area Law. However, the only one-body Hamiltonian for which this spectral condition is verified is the $d$-dimensional discrete Schr\"odinger operators with random potential. In the present paper, we prove that the same asymptotic form of the entanglement entropy holds for a wide class of Schr\"odinger operators whose potentials are ergodic but nonrandom. We start with the quasiperiodic and limit periodic operators, and then pass to the interesting and highly non-trivial case of the potentials generated by subshifts of finite type. They arose in the theory of dynamical systems in the study of non-random chaotic phenomena. As it turns out, obtaining the asymptotics of the entanglement entropy of free fermions requires a quite involved spectral analysis of the corresponding Schr\"odinger operator. Specifically, we prove for this class two important and interesting in itself spectral properties, known as exponential dynamic localisation in expectation and the exponential decay of the eigenfunction correlator, implying the Area Law for the entanglement entropy.</description>

Abstract: We study polygon equations and their connections to simplex equations, which generalize the pentagon and Yang--Baxter equations, respectively. First, we show that certain "commutative" pairs of solutions of (dual) polygon equations give rise to solutions of higher polygon equations. Next, we define an explicit compatibility condition between solutions of the $n$-gon and dual $n$-gon equations and use it to construct solutions of the $(n-2)$- and $(n-1)$-simplex equations. This extends earlier work by Kashaev--Sergeev and Dimakis--M\"uller-Hoissen.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1308.1076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been proven that locally the inertial frames and gauge states of the electromagnetic field are equivalent. This proof is valid for Einstein-Maxwell theories in four-dimensional Lorentzian spacetimes. Use will be made of theorems proved in a previous manuscript. These theorems state that locally the group of electromagnetic gauge transformations is isomorphic to the local group of Lorentz transformations of a special set of tetrad vectors. The tetrad that locally and covariantly diagonalizes any non-null electromagnetic stress-energy tensor. Two isomorphisms, one for each orthogonal plane of stress-energy eigenvectors. We will discuss the opposite problem in this paper. What happens with local electromagnetic gauge when the test object under study is boosted by any mechanical means. We will prove that boosting matter is indistinguishable from introducing an appropriate local electromagnetic gauge transformation.</description>

      <title>Optimal Convergence Rate of Lie-Trotter Approximation for Quantum Thermal Averages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05188v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lie--Trotter product formula is a foundational approximation for the quantum partition function, yet obtaining rigorous error bounds for the unbounded Hamiltonians common in physics remains a significant challenge. This paper provides a quantitative error analysis for this approximation across two key systems. For a particle in a smooth, periodic potential, we establish an optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal O(1/N^2)$ for both the partition function and thermal averages, where $N$ is the number of imaginary time steps. We then extend this analysis to the more challenging case of a confining potential on $\mathbb R$, proving a nearly optimal rate of $\mathcal O((\log N+1)^{\frac32}/N^2)$. The derived error bounds provide a firm mathematical foundation for the high-order accuracy of path integral simulations in quantum statistical mechanics.</description>

Abstract: We discuss anyon condensation in mixed-state topological order. The phases were recently conjectured to be classified by pre-modular fusion categories. Just like anyon condensation in pure-state topological order, a bootstrap analysis shows condensable anyons are given by connected \'etale algebras. We explain how to perform generic anyon condensation including non-invertible anyons and successive condensations. Interestingly, some condensations lead to pure-state topological orders. We clarify when this happens. We also compute topological invariants of equivalence classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The measured relative entropies of quantum states and channels find operational significance in quantum information theory as achievable error rates in hypothesis testing tasks. They are of interest in the near term, as they correspond to hybrid quantum--classical strategies with technological requirements far less challenging to implement than required by the most general strategies allowed by quantum mechanics. In this paper, we prove that these measured relative entropies can be calculated efficiently by means of semi-definite programming, by making use of variational formulas for the measured relative entropies of states and semi-definite representations of the weighted geometric mean and the operator connection of the logarithm. Not only do the semi-definite programs output the optimal values of the measured relative entropies of states and channels, but they also provide numerical characterizations of optimal strategies for achieving them, which is of significant practical interest for designing hypothesis testing protocols.</description>

Abstract: Let $A$ be a commutative algebra in a braided monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$; e.g., $A$ could be an extension of a vertex operator algebra (VOA) $V$ in a category $\mathcal{C}$ of $V$-modules. We study when the category $\mathcal{C}_A$ of $A$-modules in $\mathcal{C}$ and its subcategory $\mathcal{C}_A^{\text{loc}}$ of local modules inherit rigidity from $\mathcal{C}$, and then we find conditions for $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{C}_A$ to inherit rigidity from $\mathcal{C}_A^{\text{loc}}$. First, we assume $\mathcal{C}$ is a braided finite tensor category and prove rigidity of $\mathcal{C}_A$ and $\mathcal{C}_A^{\text{loc}}$ under conditions based on criteria of Etingof-Ostrik for $A$ to be an exact algebra in $\mathcal{C}$. As a corollary, we show that if $A$ is a simple $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$-graded VOA with a strongly rational vertex operator subalgebra $V$, then $A$ is strongly rational, without requiring the categorical dimension of $A$ as a $V$-module to be non-zero. Next, we assume $\mathcal{C}$ is a Grothendieck-Verdier category, i.e., $\mathcal{C}$ admits a weaker duality structure than rigidity. We first prove $\mathcal{C}_A$ is also a Grothendieck-Verdier category. Using this, we prove that if $\mathcal{C}_A^{\text{loc}}$ is rigid, then so is $\mathcal{C}$ under conditions such as a mild non-degeneracy assumption on $\mathcal{C}$, an assumption that every simple object of $\mathcal{C}_A$ is local, and that induction from $\mathcal{C}$ to $\mathcal{C}_A$ commutes with duality. These conditions are motivated by free field-like VOA extensions $V\subseteq A$ where $A$ is often an indecomposable $V$-module, so our result will make it more feasible to prove rigidity for many vertex algebraic monoidal categories. In a follow-up work, our result will be used to prove rigidity of the category of weight modules for the simple affine VOA of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at any admissible level.</description>

      <title>Continuous majorization in quantum phase space for Wigner-positive states and proposals for Wigner-negative states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19698v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum resource theory, one is often interested in identifying which states serve as the best resources for particular quantum tasks. If a relative comparison between quantum states can be made, this gives rise to a partial order, where states are ordered according to their suitability to act as a resource. In the literature, various different partial orders for a variety of quantum resources have been proposed. In discrete variable systems, vector majorization of Wigner functions in discrete phase space provides a natural partial order between quantum states. In the continuous variable case, a natural counterpart would be continuous majorization of Wigner functions in quantum phase space. Indeed, this concept was recently proposed and explored (mostly restricting to the single-mode case) in Van Herstraeten, Jabbour, Cerf, Quantum 7, 1021 (2023). In this work, we develop the theory of continuous majorization in the general $N$-mode case. In addition, we propose extensions to include states with finite Wigner negativity. For the special case of the convex hull of $N$-mode Gaussian states, we prove a conjecture made by Van Herstraeten, Jabbour and Cerf. We also prove a phase space counterpart of Uhlmann's theorem of majorization.</description>

      <title>$q$-deformation of random partitions, determinantal structure, and Riemann-Hilbert problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $q$-deformation of probability measures on partitions, i.e., $q$-deformed random partitions. We in particular consider the $q$-Plancherel measure and show a determinantal formula for the correlation function using a $q$-deformation of the discrete Bessel kernel. We also investigate Riemann-Hilbert problems associated with the corresponding orthogonal polynomials and obtain $q$-Painlev\'{e} equations from the $q$-difference Lax formalism.</description>

      <title>Strong local uniqueness for the vacant set of random interlacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the the vacant set $\mathcal{V}^u$ of random interlacements on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ in dimensions $d \ge 3$. For varying intensity $u &gt; 0$, the connectivity properties of $\mathcal V^u$ undergo a percolation phase transition across a critical parameter $u_* \in (0,\infty)$. In this article, we prove that this phase transition is sharp in the supercritical phase $u &lt; u_*$. This follows from a certain strong local uniqueness property (SLU) introduced in the present work, which we prove $\mathcal{V}^u$ satisfies. In itself, this property furnishes the missing ingredient needed to deduce a number of desirable quenched results characterizing the large-scale geometry of the infinite cluster. Moreover, SLU entails a sought-after local and monotone criterion amenable to renormalization arguments below $u_*$.</description>

      <title>Many facets of cohomology: Differential complexes and structure-aware formulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22813v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complexes and cohomology, traditionally central to topology, have emerged as fundamental tools across applied mathematics and the sciences. This survey explores their roles in diverse areas, from partial differential equations and continuum mechanics to reformulations of the Einstein equations and network theory. Motivated by advances in compatible and structure-preserving discretisation such as Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC), we examine how differential complexes encode critical properties such as existence, uniqueness, stability and rigidity of solutions to differential equations. We demonstrate that various fundamental concepts and models in solid and fluid mechanics are essentially formulated in terms of differential complexes.</description>

      <title>Dressed fields for Quantum Chromodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20641v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: String-localized QFT allows to explain Standard Model interactions in an autonomous way, committed to quantum principles rather than a "gauge principle", thus avoiding an indefinite state space and compensating ghosts. The resulting perturbative scattering matrix is known (at tree-level) to be insensitive to the non-locality of the auxiliary "string-localized fields" used in the construction. For the examples of Yang-Mills and QCD, we prove that it is actually equivalent to the perturbative S-matrix of gauge theory, restricted to physical particle states. The role of classical gauge invariance is revealed along the way. The main tool are "dressed fields", that are intermediate between free fields and interacting fields, and for which we give explicit formulas at all orders. The renormalization of loops, as well as non-perturbative issues are not adressed, but we hint at the possibility, enabled by our approach, that qualitative traces of confinement may be visible already at the level of the dressed fields.</description>

      <title>Classical Dirac particle I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08794v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we produce a classical Lagrangian description of an elementary spinning particle which satisfies Dirac equation when quantized. We call this particle a classical Dirac particle. We analyze in detail the way we arrive to this model and how the different observables and constants of the motion can be expressed in terms of the degrees of freedom and their derivatives, by making use of Noether's theorem. The main feature is that the particle has a center of charge r, moving at the speed of light, that satisfies fourth-order diferential equations and all observables can be expressed only in terms of this point and their time derivatives. The particle has also a center of mass q, that is a different point than the center of charge. This implies that two different spin observables can be defined, one S with respect to the point r and another SCM with respect to the point q, that satisfy different dynamical equations. The spin S satisfies the same dynamical equation than Dirac's spin operator. The fourth-order differential equations for the point r can be transformed into a system of second-order ordinary differential equations for the center of charge and center of mass. The dynamics can be described in terms of dimensionless variables. The possible interaction Lagrangians are described and we devote the main part of the work to the electromagnetic interaction of the Dirac particle with uniform and oscillating electric and magnetic fields. The numerical integrations of the dynamical equations are performed with different Mathematica notebooks that are available for the interested reader.</description>

      <title>Moduli of stable supermaps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the notion of stable supermap from SUSY curves to a fixed target superscheme, and prove that when the target is (super)projective, stable supermaps are parameterized by a Deligne-Mumford superstack with superschematic and separated diagonal. We characterize the bosonic reduction of this moduli superstack and see that it has a surjective morphism onto the moduli stack of stable maps from spin curves to the bosonic reduction of the target, whose fibers are linear schemes; for this reason, the moduli superstack of stable supermaps is not proper unless such linear schemes reduce to a point. Using Manin-Penkov-Voronov's super Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem we also make a formal computation of the virtual dimension of the moduli superstack, which agrees with the characterization of the bosonic reduction just mentioned and with the dimension formula for the case of bosonic target existing in the literature.</description>

      <title>Generalized Jensen's inequality motivated from thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the work of P.T.Landsberg\cite{web1,web2} and S.S.Sidhu\cite{web3} by providing an inequality that has its main motivation from the laws of thermodynamics, in the form of a theorem which is quite useful in generating different inequalities such as the weighted AM-GM-HM inequality, the p-th power inequality , Jensen's inequality and many other inequalities.In this paper, we have not only given the thermodynamic motivation behind the inequality but we have given the required mathematical justification in the form of a straightforward rigorous proof using basic real analysis , which was not present in the works of Landsberg and Sidhu. In fact, the first statement of the theorem mathematically proves the uniqueness of the equilibrium temperature that is attained when n different bodies at different temperatures are brought in contact. The second statement of the theorem gives a mathematical proof of the fact that the process in which n bodies at different temperatures when brought in contact equilibriate to a common temperature is spontaneous,i.e., entropically favourable. Thus, this article motivates the students to come up with different mathematical results by observing the phenomena already existing in nature and also helps them to appreciate the conventional inequalities taught to them at the secondary school and undergraduate level by associating relevant physical phenomena with those inequalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stationary potential scattering admits a formulation in terms of the quantum dynamics generated by a non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian. We use this formulation to give a proof of the reciprocity theorem in two and three dimensions that does not rely on the properties of the scattering operator, Green's functions, or Green's identities. In particular, we identify reciprocity with an operator identity satisfied by an integral operator $\widehat{\mathbf{M}}$, called the fundamental transfer matrix. This is a multi-dimensional generalization of the transfer matrix $\mathbf{M}$ of potential scattering in one dimension that stores the information about the scattering amplitude of the potential. We use the property of $\widehat{\mathbf{M}}$ that is responsible for reciprocity to identify the analog of the relation, $\det{\mathbf{M}}=1$, in two and three dimensions, and establish a generic anti-pseudo-Hermiticity of the scattering operator. Our results apply for both real and complex potentials.</description>

      <title>Logical Dependence of Physical Determinism on Set-theoretic Metatheory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Baroque questions of set-theoretic foundations are widely assumed to be irrelevant to physics. In this article, I demonstrate that this assumption is incorrect. I show that the fundamental physical question of whether a theory is deterministic, whether it fixes a unique future given the present, can depend on choice of set-theoretic axiom candidates over which there is intractable disagreement. This dependence is not confined to hypothetical examples. It reaches into mainstream, discrete, and frontier physics, including the dynamics of Kerr black hole interiors. One upshot is that either physical theories must be relativized to set-theoretic metatheories (in which case physics itself becomes relative), or the search for new axioms to settle undecidables may admit of empirical input.</description>

Abstract: Off-shell actions for massless higher-spin $\mathcal{N}=1$ supermultiplets in five dimensions (5D) are constructed in harmonic superspace in terms of unconstrained prepotentials. Cubic couplings of these supermultiplets to the $q$-hypermultiplet are derived. We also provide a detailed derivation of the unconstrained prepotential for the 5D Weyl supermultiplet which has been used within the conformal superspace approach to $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity-matter systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher information matrix via its classical counterpart from random measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preconditioning with the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM) is a popular approach in quantum variational algorithms. Yet the QFIM is costly to obtain directly, usually requiring more state preparation than its classical counterpart: the classical Fisher information matrix (CFIM). By revealing its relation to covariant measurement in quantum metrology, we show that averaging the classical Fisher information matrix over Haar-random measurement bases yields $\mathbb{E}_{U\sim\mu_H}[F^U(\boldsymbol{\theta})] = \frac{1}{2}Q(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ for pure states in $\mathbb{C}^N$. Furthermore, we obtain the variance of CFIM ($O(N^{-1})$) and establish non-asymptotic concentration bounds ($\exp(-\Theta(N)t^2)$), demonstrating that using few random measurement bases is sufficient to approximate the QFIM accurately, especially in high-dimensional settings. This work establishes a solid theoretical foundation for efficient quantum natural gradient methods via randomized measurements.</description>

      <title>Non-universal Thermal Hall Responses in Fractional Quantum Hall Droplets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14058v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analytically compute the thermal Hall conductance (THC) of fractional quantum Hall droplets under realistic conditions that go beyond the idealized linear edge theory with conformal symmetry. Specifically, we consider finite-size effects at low temperature, nonzero self-energies of quasiholes, and general edge dispersions. We derive measurable corrections in THC that are consistent with the experimental observables. Although the quantized THC is commonly regarded as a topological invariant that is independent of edge confinement, our results show that this quantization remains robust only for arbitrary edge dispersion in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, the THC contributed by Abelian modes can become extremely sensitive to finite-size effects and irregular confining potentials in any realistic experimental system. In contrast, non-Abelian modes show robust THC signatures under perturbations, indicating an intrinsic stability of non-Abelian anyons.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of Chern-Simons Wilson Loops via Flux Quantization in Cohomotopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the practice of physics model building, the process of renormalization, resummation, and anomaly cancellation is to incrementally repair initially ill-defined Lagrangian quantum field theories. Impressive as this is, one would rather have concisely defined complete theories to begin with, and understand these choices as emergent from fundamental principles. As an instructive example, we recall renormalization choices for Wilson loop observables in abelian Chern-Simons theory. Then we show that these emerge in a novel non-Lagrangian topological completion of 5D Maxwell-Chern-Simons QFT, by means of proper flux quantization in 2-Cohomotopy. This result is a modest cousin, with applications to topologically ordered quantum materials, of the more ambitious flux quantization of 11D supergravity in 4-Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis H").</description>

      <title>Stable Evaluation of Lefschetz Thimble Intersection Numbers: Towards Real-Time Path Integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a robust numerical method for determining intersection numbers of Lefschetz thimbles in multivariable settings. Our approach employs the multiple shooting method to solve the upward flow equations from the saddle points to the original integration cycle, which also enables us to determine the signs of the intersection numbers. The method demonstrates stable and reliable performance, and has been tested for systems with up to $20$ variables, which can be further extended by adopting quadruple-precision arithmetic. We determine intersection numbers for several complex saddle points in a discretized path integral, providing new insights into the structure of real-time path integrals. The proposed method is broadly applicable to a wide range of problems involving oscillatory integrals in physics and mathematics.</description>

      <title>Accelerated and fast magnetic reconnection through enhanced resistive dissipation for MHD equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the phenomenon of magnetic reconnection, namely a change in the topology of magnetic lines, for sufficiently regular solutions of the three-dimensional periodic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. We provide examples where magnetic reconnection occurs on time scales shorter than the resistive one, due to enhanced dissipation emerging from advective effects. This is the first analytical result where the advection term plays an active role in the reconnection process. A key aspect of our approach is a new estimate for enhanced diffusion of high Sobolev norms, which is of independent interest beyond its application to the MHD equations.</description>

      <title>Near-critical Ornstein--Zernike theory for the planar random-cluster model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an Ornstein--Zernike theory for the two-dimensional random-cluster model with $1 \leq q &lt;4$ that also applies in its near-critical regime. In particular, we prove an asymptotic formula for the two-point function which holds uniformly for~$p &lt; p_c$ and blends the subcritical and near-critical behaviours of the model.
  The analysis is carried out by studying the renewal properties of a subcritical percolation cluster, \emph{at the scale of the correlation length}. More precisely, we explore sequentially the cluster in a given direction, by slices of thickness comparable to the correlation length. We show that this exploration satisfies the properties of a {\em killed Markov renewal process} -- a class of processes that may be analysed independently and have Brownian behaviour. In addition to the two-point function estimate, we derive other consequences of the Ornstein--Zernike theory such as an invariance principle for the rescaled cluster and the strict convexity of the inverse correlation length -- all at the scale of the correlation length, uniformly in~$p&lt;p_c$.
  Finally, our approach differs from that of earlier papers of Campanino, Ioffe, Velenik and others, with the cluster being dynamically explored rather than constructed from its diamond decomposition.</description>
