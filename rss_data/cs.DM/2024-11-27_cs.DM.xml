      <title>Enabling Skip Graphs to Process K-Dimensional Range Queries in a Mobile Sensor Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A skip graph is a resilient application-layer routing structure that supports range queries of distributed k-dimensional data. By sorting deterministic keys into groups based on locally computed random membership vectors, nodes in a standard skip graph can optimize range query performance in mobile networks such as unmanned aerial vehicle swarms. We propose a skip graph extension that inverts the key and membership vector roles and bases group membership on deterministic vectors derived from the z-ordering of k-dimensional data and sorting within groups is based on locally computed random keys.</description>

      <title>C sequential optimization numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work establishes a definition that is more basic than the previous ones, for the Stirling numbers of first kind, which is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the previous definition. Based on this definition and a combinatorial problem, we discover C sequential optimization numbers, where C is a k+1-tuple vector. For C= (0,1), we prove that C sequential optimization numbers are the unsigned Stirling numbers of first kind. We can deduce the properties of C sequential optimization numbers by following the properties of the Stirling numbers of first kind and we give specific examples such as the recurrence formula and an instance of C sequential optimization numbers. We also give specific new properties such as an explicit upper bound of them. We prove the probability that the unsigned Stirling numbers of first kind are concentrated in O(logn) is nearly 100%.</description>

      <title>Special orientable sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analogously to de Bruijn sequences, Orientable sequences have application in automatic position-location applications and, until recently, studies of these sequences focused on the binary case. In recent work by Alhakim et al., recursive methods of construction were described for orientable sequences over arbitrary finite alphabets, requiring 'starter sequences' with special properties. Some of these methods required as input special orientable sequences, i.e. orientable sequences which were simultaneously negative orientable. We exhibit methods for constructing special orientable sequences with properties appropriate for use in two of the recursive methods of Alhakim et al. As a result we are able to show how to construct special orientable sequences for arbitrary sizes of alphabet (larger than a small lower bound) and for all window sizes. These sequences have periods asymptotic to the optimal as the alphabet size increases.</description>

      <title>Computational methods for finding bi-regular cages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An $(\{r,m\};g)$-graph is a (simple, undirected) graph of girth $g\geq3$ with vertices of degrees $r$ and $m$ where $2 \leq r &lt; m$ . Given $r,m,g$, we seek the $(\{r,m\};g)$-graphs of minimum order, called $(\{r,m\};g)$-cages or bi-regular cages, whose order is denoted by $n(\{r,m\};g)$. In this paper, we use computational methods for finding $(\{r,m\};g)$-graphs of small order. Firstly, we present an exhaustive generation algorithm, which leads to $\unicode{x2013}$ previously unknown $\unicode{x2013}$ exhaustive lists of $(\{r,m\};g)$-cages for 24 different triples $(r,m,g)$. This also leads to the improvement of the lower bound of $n(\{4,5\};7)$ from 66 to 69. Secondly, we improve 49 upper bounds of $n(\{r,m\};g)$ based on constructions that start from $r$-regular graphs. Lastly, we generalize a theorem by Aguilar, Araujo-Pardo and Berman [arXiv:2305.03290, 2023], leading to 73 additional improved upper bounds.</description>

      <title>A Fixed-Parameter Algorithm for the Kneser Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.06761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kneser graph $K(n,k)$ is defined for integers $n$ and $k$ with $n \geq 2k$ as the graph whose vertices are all the $k$-subsets of $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ where two such sets are adjacent if they are disjoint. A classical result of Lov\'asz asserts that the chromatic number of $K(n,k)$ is $n-2k+2$. In the computational Kneser problem, we are given an oracle access to a coloring of the vertices of $K(n,k)$ with $n-2k+1$ colors, and the goal is to find a monochromatic edge. We present a randomized algorithm for the Kneser problem with running time $n^{O(1)} \cdot k^{O(k)}$. This shows that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the parameter $k$. The analysis involves structural results on intersecting families and on induced subgraphs of Kneser graphs.
  We also study the Agreeable-Set problem of assigning a small subset of a set of $m$ items to a group of $\ell$ agents, so that all agents value the subset at least as much as its complement. As an application of our algorithm for the Kneser problem, we obtain a randomized polynomial-time algorithm for the Agreeable-Set problem for instances that satisfy $\ell \geq m - O(\frac{\log m}{\log \log m})$. We further show that the Agreeable-Set problem is at least as hard as a variant of the Kneser problem with an extended access to the input coloring.</description>
