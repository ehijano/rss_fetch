      <title>Real-Time-Capable Betatron Tune Measurement from Schottky Spectra Using Deep Learning and Uncertainty-Aware Kalman Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Betatron tune measurement is essential for beam control in compact proton-therapy synchrotrons, yet conventional peak-detection techniques are not robust under the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions typical of these machines. This work presents a lightweight convolutional neural network that performs real-time tune extraction from Schottky spectra with sub-millisecond inference latency and calibrated uncertainty estimates. The model uses attention-based pooling for reliable peak localization and a dual-branch architecture that jointly predicts the tune and its associated uncertainty. Trained with a Laplace negative log-likelihood loss, it produces uncertainty estimates whose magnitude tracks the instantaneous prediction error, which enables uncertainty-aware Kalman filtering for temporal smoothing. Experiments on a large synthetic dataset spanning SNR levels from 0 to $-20$\,dB demonstrate substantial performance gains over traditional peak-detection baselines, while the Kalman filter further suppresses transient outliers in time-series operation. Preliminary validation on operational beam data confirms stable tune tracking without retraining. With only about $2.0\times 10^{4}$ trainable parameters and real-time inference on commodity GPU hardware, the proposed diagnostic offers a practical solution for rapid and accurate betatron tune monitoring in compact medical synchrotrons and similar accelerators.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Cooling Enhanced Steady-State Microbunching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose to combine two promising research topics in accelerator physics, i.e., optical stochastic cooling (OSC) and steady-state microbunching (SSMB). Our study shows that such an OSC-SSMB storage ring with a circumference of 50 m and beam energy of several hundred MeVs using present technology can deliver kilowatt radiation at 100 nm wavelength. A more ambitious application of OSC in an SSMB ring can push the radiation wavelength to an even shorter wavelength, such as EUV and soft X-ray. Such a powerful compact light source could benefit fundamental science research and industry applications.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) frameworks for the Accelerator Control System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As particle accelerator control systems evolve in complexity and scale, the need for responsive, scalable, and cost-effective computational infrastructure becomes increasingly critical. Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) offers an alternative to traditional monolithic architecture by enabling event-driven execution, automatic scaling, and fine-grained resource utilization. This paper explores the applicability and performance of FaaS frameworks in the context of a modern particle accelerator control system, with the objective of evaluating their suitability for short lived and triggered workloads. In this paper, we evaluate prominent open-source FaaS platforms in executing functional logic, triggers, and diagnostics routines. Evaluation metrics consist of cold-start latency, scalability, performance, integration with other open-source tools like Kafka. Experimental workloads were designed to simulate real-world control tasks when implemented as stateless FaaS functions. These workloads were benchmarked under various invocation loads and network conditions. Self-hosted FaaS platforms, when deployed within accelerator networks, offer greater control over execution environment, better integration with legacy systems, and support for real-time guarantees when paired with message queues. Based on lessons learned and evaluation metrics, this paper describes reliability of the FaaS framework for the Accelerator Control Systems (ACS).</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization of Laser-Wakefield Acceleration via Spectral Pulse Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effect of spectral pulse shaping of the laser driver on the performance of channel-guided, laser-plasma accelerators. The study was carried out with the assistance of Bayesian optimization using particle-in-cell simulations. We used a realistic plasma profile based on a novel optical-field-ionized channel technique with ionization injection and low on-axis plasma densities to maximize the energy gain of the electron bunch trailing the laser. Spectral shaping allows us to modify the temporal profile of the laser driver while keeping the laser energy constant, affecting the acceleration and injection processes. Given the complexity and breadth of the parameter space in question, we used numerical optimization to identify high performers. In particular, we found laser profiles with additional spectral content that, when used with optimal plasma channel parameters, result in charge content an order of magnitude higher than the baseline Gaussian case while also increasing the mean energy of the electron bunch.</description>

      <title>Photon emission by vortex particles accelerated in a linac</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the photon emission by charged spinless particles with phase vortices and an orbital angular momentum (OAM) projection in longitudinal electric and magnetic fields within the scalar QED. A realistic wave packet of an electron or ion accelerated by a radio-frequency wave locally feels a constant and spatially homogeneous field, which allows us to develop an effective model for losing the angular momentum of the vortex particle due to photon emission. For the fields typical for accelerator facilities, we find that an effective lifetime of the vortex state greatly exceeds the acceleration time. This proves that the acceleration of vortex electrons, ions, muons, and so forth to relativistic energies is possible in conventional linacs, as well as in the wake-field accelerators with higher field gradients, the OAM losses due to the photon emission are mostly negligible, and that the vortex quantum state is highly robust against these losses.</description>

      <title>Diffraction by Circular and Triangular Apertures as a Diagnostic Tool of Twisted Matter Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00826v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study diffraction of twisted matter waves (electrons and light ions carrying orbital angular momentum $\ell/\hbar=0,\pm1,\pm2,\ldots$ by circular and triangular apertures. Within the scalar Kirchhoff-Fresnel framework, circular apertures preserve cylindrical symmetry and produce ringlike far-field profiles whose radii and widths depend on $|\ell|$ but are insensitive to its sign. In contrast, equilateral triangles break axial symmetry and yield structured patterns that encode both the magnitude and the sign of $\ell$. A transparent Fraunhofer mapping links detector coordinates to the Fourier plane, explaining the $(|\ell|+1)$-lobe rule and the sign-dependent rotation of the pattern. We validate these results for both ideal Bessel beams and localized Laguerre-Gaussian packets, and we cross-check them by split-step Fourier propagation of the time-dependent Schr"odinger equation. From these analyses we extract practical design rules (Fraunhofer distance, lattice pitch, detector sampling) relevant to OAM diagnostics with moderately relativistic electrons with $E_{\rm kin}\sim0.1$ to $5$ MeV and light ions with $E_{\rm kin}\sim0.1$ to $1$ MeV/u. Our results establish triangular diffraction as a simple, passive, and robust method for reading out the OAM content of structured quantum beams.</description>

      <title>High-OAM Deep Ultraviolet Twisted Light Generation for RF-Photoinjector Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the generation and characterization of ultraviolet (wavelength 266 nm) twisted light with high orbital angular momentum (OAM) using three types of fabricated diffractive optical elements (DOEs): a reflective fork grating, a high-charge spiral phase plate (SPP), and binary axicons. All elements were integrated into a drive-laser beamline of an electron RF-photoinjector, enabling direct evaluation under accelerator-relevant conditions. The SPP produced a high-purity Laguerre-Gaussian mode with OAM l = 64 and a measured conversion efficiency of approximately 80%. Binary axicons generated quasi-Bessel twisted light with topological charges up to m = 10, exhibiting low divergence and stable multi-lobe ring structures. The fork grating reliably produced lower-order modes, l = 2-8, with good agreement between simulations and cylindrical-lens diagnostics. These results constitute, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive experimental demonstration of deep-UV high-OAM beams generated with fabricated DOEs and validated through mode-conversion measurements. The demonstrated techniques are compatible with high-power UV laser systems used in RF-photoinjectors and offer a practical route toward structured photocathode illumination and the generation of relativistic vortex electrons at a particle accelerator facility.</description>
