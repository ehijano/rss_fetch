      <title>Force field optimization by end-to-end differentiable atomistic simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accuracy of atomistic simulations depends on the precision of force fields. Traditional numerical methods often struggle to optimize the empirical force field parameters for reproducing target properties. Recent approaches rely on training these force fields based on forces and energies from first-principle simulations. However, it is unclear whether these approaches will enable capturing complex material responses such as vibrational, or elastic properties. To this extent, we introduce a framework, employing inner loop simulations and outer loop optimization, that exploits automatic differentiation for both property prediction and force-field optimization by computing gradients of the simulation analytically. We demonstrate the approach by optimizing classical Stillinger-Weber and EDIP potentials for silicon systems to reproduce the elastic constants, vibrational density of states, and phonon dispersion. We also demonstrate how a machine-learned potential can be fine-tuned using automatic differentiation to reproduce any target property such as radial distribution functions. Interestingly, the resulting force field exhibits improved accuracy and generalizability to unseen temperatures than those fine-tuned on energies and forces. Finally, we demonstrate the extension of the approach to optimize the force fields towards multiple target properties. Altogether, differentiable simulations, through the analytical computation of their gradients, offer a powerful tool for both theoretical exploration and practical applications toward understanding physical systems and materials.</description>

      <title>Learning Ordering in Crystalline Materials with Symmetry-Aware Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have become a machine learning workhorse for screening the chemical space of crystalline materials in fields such as catalysis and energy storage, by predicting properties from structures. Multicomponent materials, however, present a unique challenge since they can exhibit chemical (dis)order, where a given lattice structure can encompass a variety of elemental arrangements ranging from highly ordered structures to fully disordered solid solutions. Critically, properties like stability, strength, and catalytic performance depend not only on structures but also on orderings. To enable rigorous materials design, it is thus critical to ensure GCNNs are capable of distinguishing among atomic orderings. However, the ordering-aware capability of GCNNs has been poorly understood. Here, we benchmark various neural network architectures for capturing the ordering-dependent energetics of multicomponent materials in a custom-made dataset generated with high-throughput atomistic simulations. Conventional symmetry-invariant GCNNs were found unable to discern the structural difference between the diverse symmetrically inequivalent atomic orderings of the same material, while symmetry-equivariant model architectures could inherently preserve and differentiate the distinct crystallographic symmetries of various orderings.</description>

      <title>Generalized Representative Structures for Atomistic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new method is presented to generate atomic structures that reproduce the essential characteristics of arbitrary material systems, phases, or ensembles. Previous methods allow one to reproduce the essential characteristics (e.g. chemical disorder) of a large random alloy within a small crystal structure. The ability to generate small representations of random alloys, with the restriction to crystal systems, results from using the fixed-lattice cluster correlations to describe structural characteristics. A more general description of the structural characteristics of atomic systems is obtained using complete sets of atomic environment descriptors. These are used within for generating representative atomic structures without restriction to fixed lattices. A general data-driven approach is provided utilizing the atomic cluster expansion(ACE) basis. The N-body ACE descriptors are a complete set of atomic environment descriptors that span both chemical and spatial degrees of freedom and are used within for describing atomic structures. The generalized representative structure(GRS) method presented within generates small atomic structures that reproduce ACE descriptor distributions corresponding to arbitrary structural and chemical complexity. It is shown that systematically improvable representations of crystalline systems on fixed parent lattices, amorphous materials, liquids, and ensembles of atomic structures may be produced efficiently through optimization algorithms. We highlight reduced representations of atomistic machine-learning training datasets that contain similar amounts of information and small 40-72 atom representations of liquid phases. The ability to use GRS methodology as a driver for informed novel structure generation is also demonstrated. The advantages over other data-driven methods and state-of-the-art methods restricted to high-symmetry systems are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Two Distinct Oxidation Dispersion Mechanisms in Pd-CeO2 Mediated by Thermodynamic and Kinetic Behaviors of Single Pd Species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dispersion process of supported catalysts is crucial for synthesizing atomic-level dispersed catalysts and precisely manipulating their chemical state. However, the underlying dispersion mechanism remains elusive due to the lack of atomic-level evidence during the dispersion process. Herein, by employing spherical aberration-corrected environmental scanning transmission electron microscopy (ESTEM), first-principles calculations, and a global optimization algorithm, we unraveled the pre-oxidation dispersion and direct dispersion mechanisms in the Pd/CeO2 (100) system, mediated by the thermodynamic and kinetic behaviors of single Pd species. We discovered that at lower temperatures, the Pd nanoparticles first undergo oxidation followed by the dispersion of PdO, while at higher temperatures, the entire dispersion process of Pd remains in a metallic state. The distinct dispersion mechanisms at different temperatures are driven by the thermodynamic and kinetic differences of environment-dependent single Pd species. The nonmobile Pd1O4 species stabilized at lower temperatures obstructs the direct dispersion of Pd nanoparticles, instead triggering a sequence of pre-oxidation followed by limited dispersion. In contrast, the highly mobile Pd1O2 species at higher temperatures facilitates the complete and direct dispersion of Pd nanoparticles. This research illuminates the essential physical mechanisms of oxidative dispersion from both thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives, potentially enabling strategies for precisely controlling the state of highly dispersed catalysts.</description>

      <title>Near-field-assisted capacity of spoof-plasmonic channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Establishing universal features of spoof-plasmonic systems beyond spectral properties is challenging due to the complexity of the specific physical realizations of spoof-plasmonic channels. We introduce a simple 1D scalar model reproducing the key properties of spoof-plasmonic channels and investigate manifestations of plasmonic-like features when only a few local resonances are present. We show that the channel between the source applied to the interior of the structure and the terminal ends (output ports) effectively comprises two subchannels. The activation of one of the subchannels depends on the spatial variation of the source, and therefore, the contribution of this subchannel in conventional systems is small if the source occupies a subwavelength region. We show that, in spoof-plasmonic structures, the activation of this subchannel can enhance significantly in the frequency region where the spoof-plasmonic effects are prominent. This demonstrates that even a few local scattering resonances may strongly impact the flow of wave-carried information.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning algorithms for optimization of magnetocaloric effect in all-d-metal Heusler alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the application of machine learning algorithms, specifically the Random Forest regression model, to optimize the magnetocaloric effect in all-d-metal Heusler alloys. The model was trained using descriptors related to the mean properties of individual atoms, the properties of simple compounds in their ground state, and measures of chemical disorder. It demonstrated high accuracy in predicting structural properties, while exhibiting moderate accuracy in predicting magnetic properties. To identify optimal alloy compositions, a genetic algorithm was used to find those with the greatest differences in magnetization during martensitic transitions. Using this combined approach, the Ni-Co-Mn-Ti alloy system was thoroughly explored, resulting in the discovery of an alloy with a maximum magnetization difference. These results are consistent with previous research based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) and highlight the effectiveness of integrating machine learning with genetic algorithms for the discovery of new materials with outstanding magnetocaloric properties. The study emphasizes the need for further refinement of models capable of accurately predicting complex magnetic interactions, which is essential for fully leveraging the potential of all-d-metal Heusler alloys in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Oscillating Magnetic Effect in BiFeO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of electric vehicles has led to a growing need for more efficient and environmentally friendly batteries. As a result, there is significant interest in researching new materials and techniques to enhance battery efficiency. One such material being explored is bismuth ferrite (BiFeO$_3$ or BFO), a perovskite with versatile properties. Researchers are particularly intrigued by the potential to control its antiferromagnetic magnetization using magnetic or electric fields. Here, a comprehensive analysis of BFO was conducted, with a focus on its behavior when subjected to oscillating magnetic fields. The research revealed that BFO is sensitive to the frequency and shape of these magnetic fields, leading to the discovery of a new effect related to the transmission of electromagnetic signals on its surface. This effect resulted in a significant increase in the power of the electromagnetic signal, representing a major technological breakthrough. According to the findings, this gain in power has not been observed in any system of this kind before. The study also demonstrated that BFO has the ability to detect magnetic fields through electrical output signals and vice versa, which is crucial for assessing the state and efficiency of batteries, thus contributing to significant advancements in energy storage technology.</description>

      <title>Decoding the hidden dynamics of super-Arrhenius hydrogen diffusion in multi-principal element alloys via machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding atomic hydrogen (H) diffusion in multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) is essential for advancing clean energy technologies such as H transport, storage, and nuclear fusion applications. However, the vast compositional space and the intricate chemical environments inherent in MPEAs pose significant obstacles. In this work, we address this challenge by developing a multifaceted machine learning framework that integrates machine-learning force field, neural network-driven kinetic Monte Carlo, and machine-learning symbolic regression. This framework allows for accurate investigation of H diffusion across the entire compositional space of body-centered cubic (BCC) refractory MoNbTaW alloys, achieving density functional theory accuracy. For the first time, we discover that H diffusion in MPEAs exhibits super-Arrhenius behavior, described by the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann model, where the Vogel temperature correlates with the 5th percentile of H solution energy spectrum. We also derive robust analytical expressions that can be used to predict H diffusivity in general BCC MPEAs. Our findings further elucidate that chemical short-range order (SRO) generally does not impact H diffusion, except it enhances diffusion when "H-favoring" elements (notably Nb and Ta) are present in low concentrations. These findings not only enhance our understanding of H diffusion dynamics in general MPEAs but also guide the development of advanced MPEAs in H-related applications by manipulating element type, composition and SRO.</description>

      <title>Many-body perturbation theory with hybrid density functional theory starting points accelerated by adaptively compressed exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the use of the adaptively compressed exchange (ACE) operator to accelerate many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) calculations, including G$_0$W$_0$ and the Bethe Salpeter equation (BSE), for hybrid density functional theory starting points. We show that by approximating the exact exchange operator with the low-rank ACE operator, substantial computational savings can be achieved with systematically controllable errors in the quasiparticle energies computed with full-frequency G$_0$W$_0$ and the vertical excitation energies and optical absorption spectra computed by solving the BSE within density matrix perturbation theory. Our implementation makes use of the ACE-accelerated electronic Hamiltonian to carry out both G$_0$W$_0$ and BSE without explicitly computing empty states. We show the robustness of the approach and present the computational gains obtained on both CPU and GPU nodes. Our work will facilitate the exploration and evaluation of fine-tuned hybrid starting points aimed at enhancing the accuracy of MBPT calculations.</description>

      <title>Valley polarization in 2D tetragonal altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The altermagnetism caused by alternating crystal environment provides a unique opportunity for designing new type of valley polarization. Here, we propose a way to realize valley polarization in two-dimensional (2D) tetragonal altermagnetism by regulating the direction of magnetization. The valley polarization along with spin polarization will arise when the orientation of magnetization breaks the $C_{4z}$ lattice rotational symmetry, particularly in the conventional in-plane $x$ or $y$ directions. When the direction of magnetization switches between the $x$ and $y$ direction, the valley and spin polarizations will be reversed. This is different from the widely studied valley polarization, which occurs in out-of-plane hexagonal magnetic materials with valley physics at -K/K point. Followed by first-principles calculations, our proposal is demonstrated in a 2D Janus tetragonal altermagnetic $\mathrm{Fe_2MoS_2Se_2}$ monolayer with good stability but very small valley splitting of 1.6 meV. To clearly see the feasibility of our proposal, an unrealistic material $\mathrm{Ru_2MoS_2Se_2}$ is used to show large valley splitting of 90 meV. In fact, our proposal can be readily extended to 2D tetragonal ferromagnetic (FM) materials, for example FM $\mathrm{Fe_2I_2}$ monolayer. Our findings can enrich the valley physics, and provide new type of valley materials.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Control of Linear and Nonlinear Magno-Phononics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent manipulation of magnetism through the lattice provides unprecedented opportunities for controlling spintronic functionalities on the ultrafast timescale. Such nonthermal control conventionally involves nonlinear excitation of Raman-active phonons which are coupled to the magnetic order. Linear excitation, in contrast, holds potential for more efficient and selective modulation of magnetic properties. However, the linear channel remains uncharted, since it is conventionally considered forbidden in inversion symmetric quantum materials. Here, we harness strong coupling between magnons and Raman-active phonons to achieve both linear and quadratic excitation regimes of magnon-polarons, magnon-phonon hybrid quasiparticles. We demonstrate this by driving magnon-polarons with an intense terahertz pulse in the van der Waals antiferromagnet $\mathrm{FePS_3}$. Such excitation behavior enables a unique way to coherently control the amplitude of magnon-polaron oscillations by tuning the terahertz field strength and its polarization. The polarimetry of the resulting coherent oscillation amplitude breaks the crystallographic $C_2$ symmetry due to strong interference between different excitation channels. Our findings unlock a wide range of possibilities to manipulate material properties, including modulation of exchange interactions by phonon-Floquet engineering.</description>

      <title>Highly coherent grain boundaries induced by local pseudo-mirror symmetry in $\beta$-Ga2O3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain boundaries have extensive influence on the performance of crystal materials. However, the atomic-scale structure and its relation with local and crystallographic symmetries remain elusive in low-symmetry crystals. Herein, we find that the local pseudo-mirror-symmetric atomic layer is the common physical origin of a series of highly coherent grain boundaries in the low-symmetry $\beta$-Ga2O3 crystal. These include the (100) twin boundary and an emerging series of $(h-1'0'2)/(h+1'0'\bar{2})$ coherent asymmetric grain boundaries (CAGBs). Owing to the local pseudo-mirror symmetry and the special geometric relation of the $\beta$-Ga2O3 conventional cell, these CAGBs place 80% of the boundary atoms in pseudo-coincident sites, exhibiting high coherence under the coincident-site lattice model. With a combination of density functional theory calculations, Czochralski growth experiment, and atomic-scale characterizations, the structure and stability of the $(002)/(20\bar{2})$-A CAGB are confirmed, with a boundary energy density as low as 0.36 J/m2. This CAGB is responsible for the spontaneous formation of a twinned defect facet at the surface steps during the epitaxy growth of $\beta$-Ga2O3, warranting a substrate orientation selection rule for $\beta$-Ga2O3. Through this study, we provide insights into the grain boundary physics in the low-symmetry $\beta$-Ga2O3 crystal while emphasizing the importance of the local pseudo-symmetries in the low-symmetry crystals.</description>

      <title>Domino-like magnetic phase transition induced by a bias voltage in FeRh thin film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first-order magnetic phase transition (MPT) usually happens with a very wide magnetic field range about tens of thousands Oersted which hinders its applications. In this work, we induce a domino-like MPT via introducing a bias voltage in FeRh thin film and thus realize a large narrowing of transition magnetic field range from 6*10^4 Oe to lower than 2*10^3 Oe at room temperature. Furthermore, the critical condition and phase diagram for domino-like MPTs are obtained in theory and our experiments support it well. Our works not only benefit the studies and applications of MPT-based devices but also are significant in the applications of the phase transition systems with resistance change.</description>

Abstract: We performed first-principles calculations at finite temperatures to investigate the temperature dependence of the magnetic properties, such as exchange stiffness constants and Curie temperatures, of Co2MnZ (Z= Si, Al) assuming L21 and B2 structures. In L21 structures, we confirmed a relatively high Curie temperature for Co2MnAl, compatible with that of Co2MnSi; however, its exchange stiffness constant and single site magnetic excitation energy at zero temperature are much smaller than those of Co2MnSi. This might indicate that the Curie temperature of itinerant magnets cannot be determined by the exchange interaction at zero temperature. We also investigated the temperature dependence of the exchange stiffness constants of both alloys, and we found robustness in the temperature dependence of the exchange stiffness constant for Co2MnAl, assuming an L21 structure. This might lead to a high Curie temperature, contrary to the small exchange stiffness constant. Finally, we examined the temperature dependence of the electronic structure to investigate the origin of the behavior of the exchange stiffness constant at finite temperatures. We confirmed that the spin polarization at chemical potential effectively increases with an increasing temperature due to the altered electronic structure induced by the spin disorder. This might contribute to the robustness of the exchange stiffness constant at finite temperatures. Our results might indicate that renomarization of the electronic structure due to spin disorder at finite temperature influences the exchange interactions of Co2MnAl.</description>

      <title>Creation of independently controllable and long lifetime polar skyrmion textures in ferroelectric-metallic heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological textures like vortices, labyrinths and skyrmions formed in ferroic materials have attracted extensive interests during the past decade for their fundamental physics, intriguing topology, and technological prospects. So far, polar skyrmions remain scarce in ferroelectrics as they require a delicate balance between various dipolar interactions. Here, we report that PbTiO3 thin films in a metallic contact undergo a topological phase transition and stabilize a broad family of skyrmion-like textures (e.g., skyrmion bubbles, multiple {\pi}-twist target skyrmions, and skyrmion bags) with independent controllability, analogous to those reported in magnetic systems. Weakly-interacted skyrmion arrays with a density over 300 Gb/inch2 are successfully written, erased and read-out by local electrical and mechanical stimuli of a scanning probe. Interestingly, in contrast to the relatively short lifetime &lt;20 hours of the skyrmion bubbles, the multiple {\pi}-twist target skyrmions and skyrmion bags show topology-enhanced stability with lifetime over two weeks. Experimental and theoretical analysis implies the heterostructures carry electric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction mediated by oxygen octahedral tiltings. Our results demonstrate ferroelectric-metallic heterostructures as fertile playground for topological states and emergent phenomena.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear field dependence of Hall effect and high-mobility multi-carrier transport in an altermagnet CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a promising candidate for altermagnet, CrSb possesses a distinctive compensated spin split band structure that could bring groundbreaking concepts to the field of spintronics. In this work, we have grown high-quality CrSb single crystals and comprehensively investigated their electronic and magneto-transport properties. We have observed large, positive, and non-saturated magnetoresistance (MR) in CrSb, which well obeys Kohler's rule, indicating its classic Lorentz scattering origins. Remarkably, a nonlinear magnetic field dependence of Hall effect resembling the spontaneous anomalous Hall is identified over a wide temperature range. After careful analysis of the transport data, we conclude the non-linearity mainly stems from the incorporation of different carriers in the magnetoconductivity. According to the Fermi surface analyses of CrSb, we applied the three-carrier model to fit the conductivity data, yielding good agreement. The extracted carrier concentration and mobility indicates that CrSb behaves more like a semimetal, with the highest mobility reaching 3*103 cm2V-1s-1. Furthermore, calculations using the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory have successfully reproduced the main features of the experimental MR and Hall effect in CrSb. These exceptional transport properties make CrSb unique for applications in spintronics as an altermagnet.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Machine Learning for High-Strength High-Entropy Alloy Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are metallic materials with solid solutions stabilized by high mixing entropy. Some exhibit excellent strength, often accompanied by additional properties such as magnetic, invar, corrosion, or cryogenic response. This has spurred efforts to discover new HEAs, but the vast compositional search space has made these efforts challenging. Here we present a framework to predict and optimize the yield strength of face-centered cubic (FCC) HEAs, using CoCrFeMnNi-based alloys as a case study due to abundant available data. Our novel Residual Hybrid Learning Model (RELM) integrates Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, enhanced by material attribute data, to handle sparse, skewed datasets for real-world alloys. A hybrid Generative Adversarial Network-Variational Autoencoder model explores new alloy compositions beyond existing datasets. By incorporating processing parameters, which determine the microstructure and thus strength, RELM achieves an R$^2$ score of 0.915, surpassing traditional models. SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and Partial Dependencies enhance interpretability, revealing composition-processing-property relationships, as validated by experiments, including X-ray diffraction, SEM analysis, and tensile testing. The model discovered two novel Co$_{20}$Cr$_{16}$Fe$_{20}$Mn$_{16}$Ni$_{24}$Al$_4$ and Co$_{24}$Cr$_{12}$Fe$_{12}$Mn$_{16}$Ni$_{28}$Al$_4$Si$_4$ HEAs with a maximum possible yield strength of 842 and 937 MPa, significantly exceeding previously reported values for these alloy systems. This study pioneers interpretable machine learning in alloy design, providing a rigorous, data-driven approach to discovering, processing, and optimizing real-world materials. The findings highlight the critical role of both compositional and post-fabrication processing parameters in advancing the understanding of composition-processing-property relationships.</description>

      <title>Structural, micro-structural/morphological and magnetic properties of RECrO3 (RE = La, Nd, Sm, Eu and Gd) Orthocromites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report here the structural, micro-structural/morphological and detailed magnetic properties of RECrO3 (RE = La, Nd, Sm, Eu and Gd) Orthocromites. A series of RECrO3 (RE = La, Nd, Sm, Eu and Gd) Orthocromites polycrystalline samples with uniform particle size were synthesized via standard solid-state reaction method. LaCrO3 (LCO), NdCrO3 (NCO), SmCrO3(SCO), and EuCrO3 (ECO) crystallizes in single phase of orthorhombic structure with Pnma (No.62) space group while GdCrO3 (GCO) found to crystallize in orthorhombic phase with Pbnm space group. SEM images confirms the systematic growth of all studied samples grain growth takes place during the sintering process and images shows the polyhedral shape with varying average grain size ranging from approximately 1.0{\mu}m to 3{\mu}m confirm the bulk synthesis of studied RECrO3. Lowest average grain size (~ 1.1{\mu}m) was observed for LaCrO3 and maximum (~ 2.8{\mu}m) for EuCrO3. The shapes of the grain size changes because of crystal lattice distortion induced by various rare earths (La, Nd, Sm, Eu and Gd) at A site. Energy dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDAX) reveals the elements confirmation in different studied RECrO3 samples. Within the detection limit of EDAX no impurity elements were observed in different as synthesized RECrO3 samples. Temperature dependent DC magnetization (M-T) studies showed an antiferromagnetic transition (TN) attributed to Cr3+ spins in all samples at different temperature. At low temperature spin-reorientation (TSR) of rare earth ion was also observed in NCO, SCO at around 50K and the same is observed at around 30K in ECO and the same was missing in GCO because of large moment of Gd3+ ions attributed by ground state spectroscopic term 8S7/2 by external applied magnetic field. The magnetization versus applied magnetic field (M-H) loops exhibited ferromagnetic like behavior at 10K and 100K and paramagnetic at 300K for GCO.</description>

      <title>Phonon-mediated renormalization of exciton energies and absorption spectra in polar semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of vibrational screening on the excitonic and optical properties of solids based on first-principles electronic-structure calculations. We solve the Bethe-Salpeter equation - the state-of-the-art description of excitons - by explicitly accounting for phonon-assisted screening effects in the screened Coulomb interaction. In the examples of the polar semiconductors ZnS, MgO, and GaN, the exciton binding energies at the absorption onset are found to be renormalized by a few tens of meV. Similar effects are also found for higher-lying unbound electron-hole pairs, leading to red-shifts of the absorption peaks by up to 50 meV. Our analysis reveals that vibrational screening is dictated by long-range Fr\"ohlich coupling involving polar longitudinal optical phonons, whereas the remaining vibrational degrees of freedom are negligible. Overall, by elucidating the influence of phonon screening on the excitonic states and absorption spectra of these selected ionic semiconductors, this study contributes to advancing the ab initio methodology and the fundamental understanding of exciton-phonon coupling in solids.</description>

      <title>GPU-Accelerated Solution of the Bethe-Salpeter Equation for Large and Heterogeneous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a massively parallel, GPU-accelerated implementation of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) for the calculation of the vertical excitation energies (VEEs) and optical absorption spectra of condensed and molecular systems, starting from single-particle eigenvalues and eigenvectors obtained with density functional theory. The algorithms adopted here enable one to circumvent the slowly converging sums over empty and occupied states and the inversion of large dielectric matrices, through a density matrix perturbation theory approach and a low-rank decomposition of the screened Coulomb interaction, respectively. In addition, we achieve computational savings by exploiting the nearsightedness of the density matrix of semiconductors and insulators, and we scale our calculations to thousands of GPUs with a hierarchical loop- and data-distribution strategy. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by computing the VEEs of several spin defects in wide band-gap materials, and we show that supercells with up to 1000 atoms are necessary to obtain converged results. We discuss the validity of common approximations, e.g., the solution of the BSE with truncated sums over empty and occupied states. We then apply our GW-BSE implementation to a diamond lattice with 1727 atoms to study the symmetry breaking of triplet states caused by the interaction of a point defect with an extended line defect.</description>

      <title>Electrical Conductivity of Warm Dense Hydrogen from Ohm's Law and Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the electrical conductivity of warm dense hydrogen is critical for both fundamental physics and applications in planetary science and inertial confinement fusion. We demonstrate how to calculate the electrical conductivity using the continuum form of Ohm's law, with the current density obtained from real-time time-dependent density functional theory. This approach simulates the dynamic response of hydrogen under warm dense matter conditions, with temperatures around 30,000 K and mass densities ranging from 0.02 to 0.98 g/cc. We systematically address finite-size errors in real-time time-dependent density functional theory, demonstrating that our calculations are both numerically feasible and reliable. Our results show good agreement with other approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of this method for modeling electronic transport properties from ambient to extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Meta-Generalized-Gradient Approximation made Magnetic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jacob's ladder of density functional theory (DFT) proposes the compelling view that by extending the form of successful approximations -- being guided by exact conditions and selected (least empirical) norms -- upper rungs will do better than the lower, thus allowing to balance accuracy and computational effort. Meta-generalized-gradient-approximations (MGGA) belong to the last rung of the semi-local approximations before hybridization with non-local wave function theories. The performance of MGGAs on {\em non} magnetic systems greatly improves upon that of GGAs from the lower rung. Instead, failures of MGGAs on magnetic materials are daunting and make GGAs more reliable for magnetism. This raises the question as to whether consistent improvements can be achieved for magnetism along the lines of the Jacob's ladder. Here, we present a solution from first principles: departing from the standard approach (i.e. collinear spin-DFT), we exploit the U(1)$\times$SU(2) gauge symmetry of the exact functional of spin-current-DFT to access an extended set of building blocks for approximations. Crucially, this allows us to treat broken symmetry ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states. For these states, we derive a collinear MGGA that performs well for prototypical magnets and make it available in an implementation in the \textsc{Crystal} electronic structure package.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking in the Superionic Phase of Silver-Iodide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the superionic phase of silver iodide, we observe a distorted tetragonal structure characterized by symmetry breaking in the cation distribution. This phase competes with the well known bcc phase, with a symmetric cation distribution at an energetic cost of only a few meV/atom. The small energy difference suggests that these competing structures may both be thermally accessible near the superionic transition temperature. We also find that the distribution of silver ions depends on the low-temperature parent polymorph, with memory persisting in the superionic phase on the nanosecond time scales accessible in our simulations. Furthermore, simulations on the order 100ns reveal that even at temperatures where the bcc phase is stable, significant fluctuations toward the tetragonal lattice structure remain. Our results are consistent with many "anomalous" experimental observations and offer a molecular mechanism for the "memory effect" in silver iodide.</description>

      <title>Effect of valence electrons on the core level x-ray photoelectron spectra of niobium oxide thin films prepared by molecular beam epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a versatile tool for identifying the chemical and electronic state of an element. However, the presence of various initial- and final-state effects makes the interpretation of XPS spectra tricky and erroneous. Metal oxides show multipeak XPS spectra when the charge carriers are coupled with the core hole of the photoion after photoemission. The extra peaks are often misconstrued to originate from other oxidation states of the cation. With a systematic approach to the analysis of Nb 3d XPS spectra of partially oxidized NbOx thin films prepared by molecular beam epitaxy, we found that the valence band electrons close to the Fermi level contribute to a satellite peak in Nb-oxides. Insulating Nb-oxide containing Nb5+ (d0) with no or fewer electrons near the Fermi level has no such peaks; on the other hand, Nb5+ containing thin films exhibit this satellite peak when sufficient surface charge carriers contribute to the core hole-electron coupling.</description>

      <title>TopoChat: Enhancing Topological Materials Retrieval With Large Language Model and Multi-Source Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated impressive performance in the text generation task, showing the ability to understand and respond to complex instructions. However, the performance of naive LLMs in speciffc domains is limited due to the scarcity of domain-speciffc corpora and specialized training. Moreover, training a specialized large-scale model necessitates signiffcant hardware resources, which restricts researchers from leveraging such models to drive advances. Hence, it is crucial to further improve and optimize LLMs to meet speciffc domain demands and enhance their scalability. Based on the condensed matter data center, we establish a material knowledge graph (MaterialsKG) and integrate it with literature. Using large language models and prompt learning, we develop a specialized dialogue system for topological materials called TopoChat. Compared to naive LLMs, TopoChat exhibits superior performance in structural and property querying, material recommendation, and complex relational reasoning. This system enables efffcient and precise retrieval of information and facilitates knowledge interaction, thereby encouraging the advancement on the ffeld of condensed matter materials.</description>

      <title>Origin and stability of generalized Wigner crystallinity in triangular moir\'e systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized Wigner crystals (GWC) on triangular moir\'e superlattices, formed from stacking two layers of transition metal chalcogenides, have been recently observed at multiple fractional fillings of the moir\'e unit cell [Nature 587, 214 - 218 (2020), Nat. Phys. 17, 715 - 719 (2021), Nature 597, 650 - 654 (2021)]. Motivated by these experiments, tied with the need for an accurate microscopic description of these materials, we explore the theoretical origins of GWC at $n=1/3$ and $2/3$ filling. We demonstrate the limitations of theoretical descriptions of these moir\'e GWCs relying on truncated (finite-range) electron-electron interactions instead of a long-range Coulomb interaction. We validate our findings by studying both classical and quantum mechanical effects at zero and finite temperatures. More generally, we discuss the role of charge frustration in the theoretical extended Hubbard-model phase diagram, identifying a "pinball" phase, a partially quantum melted generalized Wigner crystal with coexisting solid and liquid-like features, with no classical analog. Quantum effects also explain the small, but experimentally detectable, asymmetry in the transition temperatures of the $n=1/3$ and $2/3$ crystals. Our calculations reveal that the charge ordering temperature and the magnetic crossover temperature predicted using the long-range Coulomb interaction are correctly captured with appropriately renormalized nearest-neighbor interactions. The effective nearest-neighbor interaction strength is significantly weaker than previously reported, placing it close to a metal-insulator phase boundary. This observation has implications for future experiments that we discuss. We conclude by studying the dependence of melting temperatures on gate-to-sample separation and we also predict temperature scales at which magnetic crossovers should be observed.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Neural Networks for Prediction of Electronic Excitation Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a machine learning based approach which can learn the time-dependent electronic excitation dynamics of small molecules subjected to ion irradiation. Ensembles of recurrent neural networks are trained on data generated by time-dependent density functional theory to relate atomic positions to occupations of molecular orbitals. New data is incrementally and efficiently added to the training data using an active learning process, thereby improving model accuracy. Predicted changes in orbital occupations made by the recurrent neural network ensemble are found to have errors and one standard deviation uncertainties which are two orders of magnitude smaller than the typical values of the orbital occupation numbers. The trained recurrent neural network ensembles demonstrate a limited ability to generalize to molecules not used to train the models. In such cases, the models are able to identify key qualitative features, but struggle to match the quantitative values. The machine learning procedure developed here is potentially broadly applicable and has the potential to enable study of broad ranges of both materials and dynamical processes by drastically lowering the computational cost and providing surrogate model for multiscale simulations.</description>

      <title>Pressure-dependent magnetism of the Kitaev candidate Li$_2$RhO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use magnetization measurements under pressure along with \textit{ab initio} and cluster many-body calculations to investigate magnetism of the Kitaev candidate Li$_2$RhO$_3$. Hydrostatic compression to 4.2~GPa leads to a decrease in the magnitude of the ferromagnetic Kitaev coupling $K$ and the corresponding increase in the off-diagonal anisotropy $\Gamma$, whereas the experimental Curie-Weiss temperature changes from negative to positive with the slope of +40~K/GPa. On the other hand, spin freezing persists up to at least 3.25~GPa with the almost constant freezing temperature of $5.5-6.0$~K that does not follow the large changes in the exchange couplings and indicates the likely extrinsic origin of spin freezing. Magnetic frustration in Li$_2$RhO$_3$ is mainly related to the interplay between ferromagnetic $K$ and antiferromagnetic $\Gamma$, along with the weakness of the third-neighbor coupling $J_3$ that would otherwise stabilize zigzag order. The small $J_3\simeq 0.1$\,meV distinguishes Li$_2$RhO$_3$ from other Kitaev candidates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The monograph summarizes the studies of the temperature limits for the existence of a supercooled liquid phase of the components of nanodisperse structures. Original in situ methods for studying supercooling during crystallization in nanodispersed systems are proposed. The results of long-term studies of the features of crystallization of particles on different substrates, or as part of layered film systems are presented. The influence of the interaction at the melt-substrate (matrix) interface, as well as the conditions of preparation of the samples on the values of the limiting supercooling are determined.</description>

      <title>Scattering of CO from vacant-MoSe$_2$ with O adsorbates: is CO$_2$ formed?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, based on density functional theory that also accounts for van der Waals interactions, we study the oxidation of gas phase CO on MoSe$_2$ with a Se vacancy and oxygen coverage of 0.125~ML. In the equilibrium configuration, one of the O atoms is adsorbed on the vacancy and the other one atop one Se atom. Recombination of the CO molecule with the second of these O atoms to form CO$_2$ is a highly exothermic reaction, with an energy gain of around 3~eV. The likeliness of the CO oxidation reaction on this surface is next examined by calculating hundreds of AIMD trajectories for incidence energies that suffice to overcome the energy barriers in the entrance channel of the CO oxidative recombination. In spite of it, no CO$_2$ formation event is obtained. In most of the calculated trajectories the incoming CO molecule is directly reflected and in some cases, mainly at low energies, the molecules remain trapped at the surface but without reacting. As important conclusion, our AIMD simulations show that the recombination of CO molecules with adsorbed O atoms is a very unlikely reaction in this system, despite its large exothermicity.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Performance and Robustness of LLMs in Materials Science Q&amp;A and Property Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize scientific research, yet their robustness and reliability in domain-specific applications remain insufficiently explored. This study conducts a comprehensive evaluation and robustness analysis of LLMs within the field of materials science, focusing on domain-specific question answering and materials property prediction. Three distinct datasets are used in this study: 1) a set of multiple-choice questions from undergraduate-level materials science courses, 2) a dataset including various steel compositions and yield strengths, and 3) a band gap dataset, containing textual descriptions of material crystal structures and band gap values. The performance of LLMs is assessed using various prompting strategies, including zero-shot chain-of-thought, expert prompting, and few-shot in-context learning. The robustness of these models is tested against various forms of 'noise', ranging from realistic disturbances to intentionally adversarial manipulations, to evaluate their resilience and reliability under real-world conditions. Additionally, the study uncovers unique phenomena of LLMs during predictive tasks, such as mode collapse behavior when the proximity of prompt examples is altered and performance enhancement from train/test mismatch. The findings aim to provide informed skepticism for the broad use of LLMs in materials science and to inspire advancements that enhance their robustness and reliability for practical applications.</description>

Abstract: Nano-positioning plays a very important role in applications such as scanning probe microscopy and optics. We report the development of low-cost home-built inertial nanopositioner along with fully computer interfaced electronics, and its use in our fully automated needle-anvil type Point Contact Andreev Reflection (PCAR) apparatus. We have discussed the design of the nano-positioner along with the PCAR probe. We have also presented the fully automated operational procedures using LabVIEW interface with our home-built electronics set up for piezo step control. The point contact spectroscopy probe has been successfully used to perform spectroscopic measurements on elemental superconductors at low temperatures and high vacuum. Expanding the probe's capabilities to include measurements like scanning tunnelling microscopy makes this design versatile for various research and industrial purposes.</description>

      <title>Slowly Quenched, High Pressure Glassy B$_2$O$_3$ at DFT Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling inorganic glasses requires an accurate representation of interatomic interactions, large system sizes to allow for intermediate-range structural order, and slow quenching rates to eliminate kinetically trapped structural motifs. Neither first principles- nor force field-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations satisfy these three criteria unequivocally. Herein, we report the development of a machine learning potential (MLP) for a classic glass, B$_2$O$_3$, which meets these goals well. The MLP is trained on condensed phase configurations whose energies and forces on the atoms are obtained using periodic quantum density functional theory. Deep potential MD (DPMD) simulations based on this MLP accurately predict the equation of state and the densification of the glass with slower quenching from the melt. At ambient conditions, quenching rates larger than 10$^{11}$ K/s are shown to lead to artifacts in the structure. Pressure-dependent X-ray and neutron structure factors from the simulations compare excellently with experimental data. High-pressure simulations of the glass show varied coordination geometries of boron and oxygen, which concur with experimental observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metallic glasses have mechanical properties, which exhibit avalanches in the disguise of stress drops. We study these phenomena in a classical metallic glass system CuZrAl by athermal quasistatic shear and varying the element concentrations and for pure CuZr 50/50 case the cooling rate. The resulting mechanical properties are close to the behaviour found experimentally. At small strains, the pristine systems are akin to other glassy systems with a so-called gap distribution with a small positive exponent. Critical avalanching behaviour is found only approaching the yield point. The post-yield stress drops are universal, and the gap distribution becomes flat.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop off-lattice simulations of semiflexible polymer chains subjected to applied mechanical forces using Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Our approach models the polymer as a chain of fixed-length bonds, with configurations updated through adaptive non-local Monte Carlo moves. This proposed method enables precise calculation of a polymer's response to a wide range of mechanical forces, which traditional on-lattice models cannot achieve. Our approach has shown excellent agreement with theoretical predictions of persistence length and end-to-end distance in quiescent states, as well as stretching distances under tension. Moreover, our model eliminates the orientational bias present in on-lattice models, which significantly impacts calculations such as the scattering function, a crucial technique for revealing polymer conformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.16507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The long-sought Chern insulators that manifest quantum anomalous Hall effect are typically considered to occur solely in ferromagnets. Here, we theoretically predict the realizability of Chern insulators in antiferromagnets, of which the magnetic sublattices are connected by symmetry operators enforcing zero net moment. Our symmetry analysis provides comprehensive magnetic layer point groups that allow antiferromagnetic (AFM) Chern insulators, and reveals that in-plane magnetic configuration is required. Followed by first-principles calculations, such design principles naturally lead to two categories of material candidates, exemplified by monolayer RbCr4S8 and bilayer Mn3Sn with collinear and noncollinear AFM orders, respectively. We further show that the Chern number could be tuned by slight ferromagnetic canting as an effective pivot. Our work elucidates the nature of Chern-insulator phase in AFM systems, paving a new avenue for the search and design of quantum anomalous Hall insulators with the integration of non-dissipative transport and the promising advantages of the AFM order.</description>

Abstract: Spin textures, i.e., the distribution of spin polarization vectors in reciprocal space, exhibit diverse patterns determined by symmetry constraints, resulting in a variety of spintronic phenomena. Here, we propose a universal theory to comprehensively describe the nature of spin textures by incorporating three symmetry flavors of reciprocal wavevector, atomic orbital and atomic site. Such approach enables us to establish a complete classification of spin textures constrained by the little co-group and predict unprecedentedly reported spin texture types, such as Zeeman-type spin splitting in antiferromagnets and quadratic spin texture. To illustrate the influence of atomic orbitals and sites on spin textures, we predict orbital-dependent spin texture and anisotropic spin-momentum-site locking effects, and corresponding material candidates validated through first-principles calculations. The comprehensive classification and the predicted new spin textures in realistic materials are expected to trigger future spin-based functionalities in electronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14196v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent X-ray scattering (CXS) techniques are capable of interrogating dynamics of nano- to mesoscale materials systems at time scales spanning several orders of magnitude. However, obtaining accurate theoretical descriptions of complex dynamics is often limited by one or more factors -- the ability to visualize dynamics in real space, computational cost of high-fidelity simulations, and effectiveness of approximate or phenomenological models. In this work, we develop a data-driven framework to uncover mechanistic models of dynamics directly from time-resolved CXS measurements without solving the phase reconstruction problem for the entire time series of diffraction patterns. Our approach uses neural differential equations to parameterize unknown real-space dynamics and implements a computational scattering forward model to relate real-space predictions to reciprocal-space observations. This method is shown to recover the dynamics of several computational model systems under various simulated conditions of measurement resolution and noise. Moreover, the trained model enables estimation of long-term dynamics well beyond the maximum observation time, which can be used to inform and refine experimental parameters in practice. Finally, we demonstrate an experimental proof-of-concept by applying our framework to recover the probe trajectory from a ptychographic scan. Our proposed framework bridges the wide existing gap between approximate models and complex data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Defects can significantly degrade the thermal conductivity of ThO2, an advanced nuclear fuel material as well as a surrogate for other fluorite-structured materials. We investigate how point defects in ThO2 impact phonon mode-resolved thermal transport. By incorporating phonon modes from lattice dynamics, we decompose the trajectory and heat flux to phonon normal mode space and extract key phonon properties, including phonon relaxation times and their contributions to thermal conductivity. We implement two methods. The first method is based on the Green Kubo formalism to resolve the contribution of each phonon mode to thermal conductivity. The second resolves the lifetime of individual phonon modes and the thermal conductivity is calculated using the Boltzmann transport equation within relaxation time approximation. Notably, a lower contribution of acoustic modes is revealed compared to perturbative approaches considering only three phonon scattering processes. The effects of four types of point defects are evaluated. The strongest impact on a reduction in thermal conductivity is from Th interstitials, followed by Th vacancies. O interstitials/vacancies have a similar impact, albeit smaller than defects on the thorium sublattice. These observations are consistent with previous studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) have emerged as promising materials for light-emitting diode applications. In this study, by using time-of-flight neutron spectroscopy we identified and quantitatively separated the lattice vibrational and molecular rotational dynamics of two perovskites, butylammonium lead iodide (BA)$_{2}$PbI$_{4}$ and phenethyl-ammonium lead iodide (PEA)$_{2}$PbI$_{4}$. By examining the corresponding temperature dependence, we found that the lattice vibrations, as evidenced by neutron spectra, are consistent with the lattice dynamics obtained from Raman scattering. We revealed that the rotational dynamics of organic molecules in these materials tend to suppress their photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) while the vibrational dynamics did not show predominant correlations with the same. Additionally, we observed photoluminescence emission peak splitting for both systems, which becomes prominent above certain critical temperatures where the suppression of PLQY begins. This study suggests that the rotational motions of polarized molecules may lead to a reduction in exciton binding energy or the breaking of degeneracy in exciton binding energy levels, enhancing non-radiative recombination rates, and consequently reducing photoluminescence yield. These findings offer a deeper understanding of fundamental interactions in 2D HOIPs and could guide the design of more efficient light-emitting materials for advanced technological applications.</description>

      <title>Texture tomography with high angular resolution utilizing sparsity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel approach to the reconstruction of scanning probe x-ray diffraction tomography data with anisotropic poly crystalline samples. The method involves reconstructing a voxel map containing an orientation distribution function in each voxel of an extended 3D sample. This method differs from existing approaches by not relying on a peak-finding and is therefore applicable to sample systems consisting of small and highly mosaic crystalline domains that are not handled well by existing methods. Samples of interest include bio-minerals and a range of small-graines microstructures common in engineering metals. By choosing a particular kind of basis functions, we can effectively utilize non-negativity in orientation-space for samples with sparse texture. This enables us to achieve stable solutions at high angular resolutions where the problem would otherwise be under determined. We demonstrate the new approach using data from a shot peened martensite sample where we are able to map the twinning micro structure in the interior of a bulk sample without resolving the individual lattice domains. We also demonstrate the approach on a piece of gastropods shell with a mosaic micro structure.</description>

Abstract: Topology and superconductivity, two distinct phenomena offer unique insight into quantum properties and their applications in quantum technologies, spintronics, and sustainable energy technologies if system can be found where they coexist. Tin (Sn) plays a pivotal role here as an element due to its two structural phases, $\alpha$-Sn and $\beta$-Sn, exhibiting topological characteristics ($\alpha$-Sn) and superconductivity ($\beta$-Sn). In this study we show how precise control of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases of Sn thin films can be achieved by using molecular beam epitaxy grown buffer layers with systematic control over the lattice parameter. The resulting Sn films showed either $\beta$-Sn or $\alpha$-Sn phases as the lattice constant of the buffer layer was varied from 6.10 A to 6.48 A, covering the range between GaSb (closely matched to InAs) and InSb. The crystal structures of the $\alpha$- and $\beta$-Sn films were characterized by x-ray diffraction and confirmed by Raman spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy. The smooth and continuous surface morphology of the Sn films was validated using atomic force microscopy. The characteristics of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-Sn phases were further verified using electrical transport measurements by observing resistance drop near 3.7 K for superconductivity of the $\beta$-Sn phase and Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations for the $\alpha$-Sn phase. Density functional theory calculations showed that the stability of the Sn phases is highly dependent on lattice strain, with $\alpha$-Sn being more stable under tensile strain and $\beta$-Sn becoming favorable under compressive strain, which is in good agreement with experimental observations. Hence, this study sheds light on controlling Sn phases through lattice engineering, enabling innovative applications in quantum technologies and beyond.</description>

      <title>Zeoformer: Coarse-Grained Periodic Graph Transformer for OSDA-Zeolite Affinity Prediction</title>

Abstract: To date, the International Zeolite Association Structure Commission (IZA-SC) has cataloged merely 255 distinct zeolite structures, with millions of theoretically possible structures yet to be discovered. The synthesis of a specific zeolite typically necessitates the use of an organic structure-directing agent (OSDA), since the selectivity for a particular zeolite is largely determined by the affinity between the OSDA and the zeolite. Therefore, finding the best affinity OSDA-zeolite pair is the key to the synthesis of targeted zeolite. However, OSDA-zeolite pairs frequently exhibit complex geometric structures, i.e., a complex crystal structure formed by a large number of atoms. Although some existing machine learning methods can represent the periodicity of crystals, they cannot accurately represent crystal structures with local variability. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called Zeoformer, which can effectively represent coarse-grained crystal periodicity and fine-grained local variability. Zeoformer reconstructs the unit cell centered around each atom and encodes the pairwise distances between this central atom and other atoms within the reconstructed unit cell. The introduction of pairwise distances within the reconstructed unit cell more effectively represents the overall structure of the unit cell and the differences between different unit cells, enabling the model to more accurately and efficiently predict the properties of OSDA-zeolite pairs and general crystal structures. Through comprehensive evaluation, our Zeoformer model demonstrates the best performance on OSDA-zeolite pair datasets and two types of crystal material datasets.</description>

      <title>Exploring possible magnetic monopoles-induced magneto-electricity in spin ices</title>

Abstract: The possibilities of combining several degrees of freedom inside a unique material have recently been highlighted in their dynamics and proposed as information carriers in quantum devices where their cross-manipulation by external parameters such as electric and magnetic fields could enhance their functionalities. An emblematic example is that of electromagnons, spin-waves dressed with electric dipoles, that are fingerprints of multiferroics. Point-like objects have also been identified, which may take the form of excited quasiparticles. This is the case for magnetic monopoles, the exotic excitations of spin ices, that have been recently proposed to carry an electric dipole although experimental evidences remain elusive. Presently, we investigate the electrical signature of a classical spin ice and a related compound that supports quantum fluctuations. Our in-depth study clearly attributes magnetoelectricity to the correlated spin ice phase distinguishing it from extrinsic and single-ion effects. Our calculations show that the proposed model conferring magnetoelectricity to monopoles is not sufficient, calling for higher order contributions.</description>

      <title>Electronic thermal resistivity and quasi-particle collision cross-section in semi-metals</title>

Abstract: Electron-electron collisions lead to a T-square component in the electrical resistivity of Fermi liquids. The case of liquid $^3$He illustrates that the \textit{thermal} resitivity of a Fermi liquid has a T-square term, expressed in m$\cdot$W$^{-1}$. Its natural units are $\hbar/k_FE_F^2$. Here, we present a high-resolution study of the thermal conductivity in bismuth, employing magnetic field to extract the tiny electronic component of the total thermal conductivity and resolving signals as small as $\approx 60 \mu$K. We find that the electronic thermal resistivity follows a T-square temperature dependence with a prefactor twice larger than the electric T-square prefactor. Adding this information to what has been known for other semi-metals, we find that the prefactor of the T-square thermal resistivity scales with the square of the inverse of the Fermi temperature, implying that the dimensionless fermion-fermion collision cross-section is roughly proportional to the Fermi wavelength, indicating that it is not simply set by the strength of the Coulomb interaction.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature valley-selective emission in Si-MoSe2 heterostructures enabled by high-quality-factor chiroptical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09806</link>

Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) possess valley pseudospin, allowing photon spin to be coupled to electron spin and enabling initialization and readout of both classical and quantum information. Rapid valley-dephasing processes have impeded the development of scalable, high-performance valleytronic devices operating at room temperature. Here we demonstrate that a chiral resonant metasurface can enable room-temperature valley-selective emission, even with linearly polarized excitation. This platform provides circular eigen-polarization states with a high quality factor (Q-factor) and strong chiral near-field enhancement, resulting in unitary emission circular dichroism (i.e. single-handed circularly polarized emission). Our fabricated Si chiral metasurfaces exhibit chiral electromagnetic modes with Q-factors up to 450 at visible wavelengths, spectrally tuned to the exciton energy of MoSe2 monolayers. Using spatially- and spectrally-resolved mapping from temperatures of 100 K to 294 K, we demonstrate degrees of circular polarization (DOP) as high as 0.5 at room temperature. Reciprocal space mapping of the exciton emission reveals the chiral q-BIC localizes valley-selective emission in the vicinity of the photonic gamma-point. Photon-spin and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements show that the high DOP can be attributed to the significantly increased chiroptical local density of states provided by the metasurface, which enhances valley-specific radiative transition rates by a factor of approximately 13, with lifetimes as short as 189 ps. Our work could facilitate the development of compact chiral classical and quantum light sources and the creation of molecular chiral polaritons for quantum enantioselective synthesis.</description>
