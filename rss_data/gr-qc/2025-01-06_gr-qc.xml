      <title>Maximum force conjecture in curved spacetimes of stable self-gravitating matter configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gibbons and Schiller have raised the physically interesting conjecture that forces in general relativity are bounded from above by the mathematically compact relation ${\cal F}\leq c^4/4G$. In the present compact paper we explicitly prove, using the non-linearly coupled Einstein-matter field equations, that the force function ${\cal F}\equiv 4\pi r^2 p(r)$ in {\it stable} self-gravitating horizonless matter configurations is characterized by the upper bound ${\cal F}\leq c^4/G$ [here $p(r)$ is the radial pressure inside the self-gravitating matter configuration].</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Scattering From the Sun and Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General relativity predicts that massless waves should scatter from the Riemann curvature of their backgrounds. These scattered waves are sometimes called $\textit{tails}$ and have never been directly observed. Here we calculate the gravitational waves scattered in the backward direction (scattering angle $\vartheta=\pi$) from the weak-field curvature of an extended massive object, finding close agreement with previous results in the long-wavelength limit. These long-wavelength results are then applied to gravitational waves in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) sensitivity band scattering from the Sun and planets. We estimate that scattering from the Sun and the planets from Jupiter to Neptune could contribute a $10^{-3}$ amplitude modulation to LISA observations when these objects almost intersect the line of sight between LISA and the source, leading to forward scattering with $\vartheta\simeq0$. These conditions should be realized for the Sun during the lifetime of LISA if the detection rate of long-duration sources is not much smaller than a thousand per year.</description>

      <title>More on Analytically Approximate Solution to Quadratic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we obtain the analytically approximation of static, spherically symmetric black hole solutions to Einstein$-$Weyl squared gravity by using the continued fraction expansion method. The black hole solutions are found for various relations between near horizon parameters with positive Weyl's coupling constant $\alpha$. Black hole solutions associated with different near-horizon constants are compared with the numerical ones. We obtain four branches of the black hole solutions with positive Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass. A non-Schwarzschild solution appears when the integration constant reaches a certain value for arbitrary values of the coupling constant {$\alpha$}. In addition, we study the thermodynamic and dynamical stability of the black hole solutions by considering thermodynamic quantities and the quasinormal frequencies.</description>

      <title>Non-Standard Thermal History and Formation of Primordial Black Holes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inflation provides a suitable environment for the formation of Primordial Black Holes(PBHs). In this article, we examine the formation of primordial black holes in the Mutated Hilltop inflation model coupled with the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet term. A suitable choice of the coupling function with adjusted parameters can produce the USR regime during the inflationary phase, which lasts for some number of e-folds. The scalar field in this regime remains almost unchanged, and the first slow-roll parameter $\epsilon_1$ drops dramatically, leading to a significant enhancement to the curvature power spectrum for small scales so that it grows up to order of $\mathcal{O}(0.01)$; a crucial feature for producing PBH and secondary gravitational waves (GWs). We investigate the formation of PBHs for different sets of parameters. By considering the behavior of the scalar power spectrum, it is realized that the peak in the scalar power spectrum occurs in different scales. Then, the presented model is capable of predicting PBH formation in a wide range mass, from $\mathcal{O}(10^{-14})M_{\odot}$ to $\mathcal{O}(10)M_{\odot}$, which are compatible with the LIGO-Virgo data. PBHs with mass $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})M_{\odot}$ can account for the micro-lensing event in OGLE as well as the asteroid masses $\mathcal{O}(10^{-15})M_{\odot}-\mathcal{O}(10^{-12})M_{\odot}$ PBH can be attributed to $100\% $ dark matter present in the universe. The generated perturbations during inflation re-enter the horizons after the end of inflation, where the universe may be in a non-standard epoch rather than the radiation-dominant phase, with an equation of state $1/3&lt; \omega \leq 1$...</description>

      <title>Constraining the Gravitational Wave Speed in the Early Universe via Gravitational Cherenkov Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar particles traveling faster than a subluminal gravitational wave generate gravitons via gravitational Cherenkov radiation. In this paper, we investigate graviton production by the primordial plasma within the framework of modified gravity in the early Universe, generating a relic graviton background. We find that for the minimal model, where only the speed of gravitational waves is modified and a standard model plasma minimally couples to gravity, the relic graviton background can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude, but still agrees with the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound in most cases. Moreover, we also find that for Horndeski theories, such as Galileon theory, the relic background produced by the thermalized scalar field can reach significant amplitudes, exceeding the BBN bound for a region of the parameter space. By requiring the relic graviton background to remain consistent with the BBN constraint, we derive limits on the gravitational wave speed at early times in these modified gravity theories.</description>

      <title>A New Approach to the Analysis of Cosmological Parameters in Multifield Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, a method has been developed for the cosmological inflation model with a single scalar field to calculate cosmological parameters such as the power spectrum of scalar and tensor perturbations, their spectral indices, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio. However, for a multifield configuration, a definitive method for calculating cosmological parameters has not yet been established.
  We propose a new effective algorithm for determining cosmological parameters within the tensor-multi-scalar theory of gravity, which describes the early inflationary epoch of the Universe. Our approach is based on utilizing a specific analytical solution within a multifield cosmological model to establish functional relationships between fields. This method enables the computation of cosmological parameters and their comparison with observational data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10903v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove through path integral Monte Carlo computer experiments that the affine quantization of the $\varphi_4^4$ scaled Euclidean covariant relativistic scalar field theory is a valid quantum field theory with a well defined continuum limit of the one- and two-point-function. Affine quantization leads to a completely satisfactory quantization of field theories using situations that involve scaled behavior leading to an unexpected, $\hbar^2/\varphi^2$ which arises only in the quantum aspects.</description>

      <title>Lie, Noether, Kosmann, and Diffeomorphism Anomalies Redux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03667v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Noether procedure carries an inherent ambiguity due to the necessary local extension, no longer a symmetry, of the global symmetry. The gauging should fix the ambiguity once and for all, however, and, for translations, the general covariance demands us to use the Lie derivative. We argue that, with this alone and without any further tweaking, the Noether energy-momentum $\hat{\mathbb{T}}$ must equal the symmetric counterpart, $T$, inevitably and show the equality explicitly for general tensors. For spinors, a subtlety with the Lie derivative itself enters the issue and leads us to the Kosmann lift, often unnoticed by the physics community, from which $T=\hat{\mathbb{T}}$ again emerges straightforwardly and in a naturally symmetric form. Finally, we address how the same Kosmann lift affects the anomaly computations and show that the diffeomorphism anomaly from the seminal paper must be halved, while the venerable anomaly polynomials themselves stand unaffected. We discuss the ramifications of these findings.</description>

      <title>Stellar Physics and General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The general theory of relativity is currently established as the most precise theory of gravity supported by observations, and its application is diverse ranging from astronomy to cosmology, while its application to astrophysics has been restricted only to compact stars due to the assumption that the Newtonian approximation is sufficient for celestial bodies with medium density such as the sun. Surprisingly, the recent research of the author has implied that this long-held assumption is not valid, and that non-perturbative effects significantly change relevant results obtained by Newtonian gravity. In particular, local physical quantities inside the sun are newly predicted to exhibit power law differently from the so-called standard solar model. This surprising result is reviewed including brief discussion of physics behind the discrepancy and a new application of the new mass formula to gas planets.</description>

      <title>A microscopic realization of dS$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a precise duality between pure de Sitter quantum gravity in 2+1 dimensions and a double-scaled matrix integral. This duality unfolds in two distinct aspects. First, by carefully quantizing the gravitational phase space, we arrive at a novel proposal for the quantum state of the universe at future infinity. We compute cosmological correlators of massive particles in the universe specified by this wavefunction. Integrating these correlators over the metric at future infinity yields gauge-invariant observables, which are identified with the string amplitudes of the complex Liouville string arXiv:2409.17246. This establishes a direct connection between integrated cosmological correlators and the resolvents of the matrix integral dual to the complex Liouville string, thereby demonstrating one aspect of the dS$_3$/matrix integral duality. The second aspect concerns the cosmological horizon of the dS static patch and the Gibbons-Hawking entropy it is conjectured to encode. We show that this entropy can be reproduced exactly by counting the entries of the matrix.</description>

      <title>Algebraic perturbation theory: traversable wormholes and generalized entropy beyond subleading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The crossed product has recently emerged as an important tool in high-energy theory. We combine this with another powerful tool, namely pertubation theory, and study the crossed product algebra of a system under a deformation, relating the structure of deformed observables to that of the undeformed theory. In particular, we derive the change in the von Neumann entropy of the type II algebras, and demonstrate that our approach allows one to formally compute this to arbitrarily high orders in perturbation theory. As a concrete example, we apply this machinery to the case of a double-trace deformation of the thermofield double state in AdS/CFT, which is dual to a traversable wormhole in the bulk, obtaining several new contributions to the generalized entropy relative to the original work by Gao, Jafferis, and Wall. We comment on the relevance of this framework for black hole evaporation and interiors, as well as on the applicability of the algebraic approach to quantum gravity more generally.</description>

      <title>Multi-Tracer Correlated Stacking: A Novel Way to Discover Anisotropy in nano-Hz Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The isotropic stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) generated by a population of supermassive black hole binaries (BHBs) provides a unique window into their cosmic evolution. In addition to the isotropic power spectrum, the anisotropic component of the signal carries additional information about the supermassive black holes (BHs) and host galaxy connection. The measurement of this signal is usually carried out by angular power spectra, which is only a sufficient measure for a Gaussian and statistically isotropic distribution. In contrast, the contribution from supermassive BHBs in nano-hertz SGWB will be hosted by fewer massive galaxies, making the nano-hertz background anisotropic and non-Gaussian. As a result, the performance of angular power spectra in extracting the underlying physics is limited. In this work, we propose a novel technique called the Multi-Tracer Correlated Stacking, which enables the detection of anisotropies in the SGWB by stacking the signal from regions of the sky with tracers of BHs such as active galactic nucleus (AGNs), quasars, bright galaxies, etc., that can be mapped up to high redshift. We demonstrate this technique on a simulated supermassive BHBs distribution using an AGN catalog, which maps the underlying matter distribution approximately up to redshift $z=5$. This stacking technique uniquely distinguishes between isotropic and anisotropic distributions of SGWB source, surpassing the capabilities of angular power spectrum-based methods in detecting anisotropic signals. This highlights the effectiveness of this technique in detecting anisotropic SGWB signals and in the future, this technique can play a crucial role in its discovery.</description>

      <title>Scrambling in charged hairy black holes and the Kasner interior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze how the axion parameter, the Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar coupling constant, and charge density from Maxwell field affect the chaotic feature of a charged hairy black hole, as characterized by the quantum Lyapunov exponent. Due to relevant deformation in the boundary theory coming from a scalar bulk field, the bulk solution flows into more general Kasner spacetime in the interior of the black hole, near the singularity. We inject charged shock waves from the asymptotic boundary and calculate the out-of-time-ordered correlators holographically, which can probe chaos. The ratio of the quantum Lyapunov exponent with respect to the surface gravity is reduced as the deformation parameter increased, while the Lyapunov exponent of the deformed geometry can be greater than the axion Reissner-Nordstr\"om case when the deformation parameter is large enough. We also study how this deformation, along with the added parameters, affect other chaotic properties such as the butterfly velocity and the scrambling time delay. Furthermore, we also analyze the region where Kasner spacetime undergoes Kasner inversion/transition deeper inside the black hole.</description>

Abstract: Stueckelberg introduced an axion like scalar field to provide mass to the gauge electromagnetic field without breaking gauge invariance. This can be considered as a precursor to the spontaneously broken abelian Higgs model. We will consider its role in cosmology to provide a novel candidate to the dark matter question. In addition its implications to deeper issues will be pointed out.</description>

Abstract: We consider the theory of a generic rank-2 tensor field in three spacetime dimensions, which involves a symmetric tensor field transforming under infinitesimal diffeomorphisms, and a vector field, whose gauge transformation depends on a local vector parameter. The gauge fixing shows a non-trivial structure, and some non-intuitive possibilities are listed. Despite the fact that the theory is not topological, the energy-momentum tensor vanishes on-shell, which justifies the quasi-topological appellation we give to this theory. We show that the theory has three degrees of freedom. Moreover we find an interesting physical interpretation, which consists in a generalized planar electromagnetism and in the emergence of two vector charges with restricted mobility. These are typical fractonic behaviours which can be related to the so called traceless scalar and vector charge theories.</description>

      <title>Recipes for computing radiation from a Kerr black hole using a generalized Sasaki-Nakamura formalism: Homogeneous solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Central to black hole perturbation theory calculations is the Teukolsky equation that governs the propagation and the generation of radiation emitted by Kerr black holes. However, it is plagued by a long-ranged potential associated with the perturbation equation and hence a direct numerical integration of the equation is challenging. Sasaki and Nakamura devised a formulation that transforms the equation into a new equation that is free from the issue for the case of outgoing gravitational radiation. The formulation was later generalized by Hughes to work for any type of radiation. In this work, we revamp the Generalized Sasaki-Nakamura (GSN) formalism and explicitly show the transformations that convert solutions between the Teukolsky and the GSN formalism for both in- and outgoing radiation of scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational type. We derive all necessary ingredients for the GSN formalism to be used in numerical computations. In particular, we present a new numerical implementation of the formalism, GeneralizedSasakiNakamura.jl, that computes homogeneous solutions to both perturbation equations in the Teukolsky and the GSN formalism. The code works well at low frequencies and is even better at high frequencies by leveraging the fact that black holes are highly permeable to waves at high frequencies. This work lays the foundation for an efficient scheme to compute gravitational radiation from Kerr black holes and an alternative way to compute quasinormal modes of Kerr black holes.</description>

      <title>Exploring Black Hole Mimickers: Electromagnetic and Gravitational Signatures of AdS Black Shells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study electromagnetic and gravitational properties of AdS black shells (also referred to as AdS black bubbles) -- a class of quantum gravity motivated black hole mimickers, that in the classical limit are described as ultra compact shells of matter. We find that their electromagnetic properties are remarkably similar to black holes. We then discuss the extent to which these objects are distinguishable from black holes, both for intrinsic interest within the black shell model, and as a guide for similar efforts in other sub-classes of exotic compact objects (ECOs). We study photon rings and lensing band characteristics, relevant for very large baseline inteferometry (VLBI) observations, as well as gravitational wave observables -- quasinormal modes in the eikonal limit and the static tidal Love number for non-spinning shells -- relevant for ongoing and upcoming gravitational wave observations.</description>

Abstract: We present a family of charged rotating wormhole solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations, supported by anisotropic matter fields. We first revisit the charged static cases and analyze the conditions for the solution to represent a wormhole geometry. The rotating geometry is obtained by applying and modifying the Newman-Janis algorithm to the static geometry. We show the solutions to Maxwell equations in detail. We believe that our wormhole geometry offers a geometric realization corresponding to the concept of `charge without charge'.</description>

      <title>Polarization modes of gravitational waves in general Einstein-vector theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the polarization modes of gravitational waves in general Einstein-vector theory with an arbitrary constant background vector field under a Minkowski background. We compare these polarization modes with those of other vector-tensor theories and constrain the parameter spaces based on the gravitational-wave event GW170817 with its electromagnetic counterpart GRB170817A and observations of pulsar timing arrays. The presence of the background vector field leads to the anisotropy of space and a rich variety of gravitational wave contents. Our results reveal that the polarization modes of gravitational waves depend on the parameter spaces. There are at least two and at most five independent polarization modes in one parameter space. In different parameter spaces, some mixture modes are allowed, including tensor-vector, tensor-scalar, tensor-vector-scalar, vector-scalar, and scalar-scalar mixture modes, as well as five independent modes (excluding $P_l$): $P_+$, $P_{\times}$, $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_b$. In all regions of the parameter spaces, there are always two tensor modes, which can be either independent of or mixed with other modes. The independent $P_b$ mode consistently exhibits the same speed as light. If the speed of tensorial gravitational waves strictly equals that of light, only the $P_+$, $P_{\times}$, and $P_b$ modes are permitted. Furthermore, through comparisons of some vector-tensor theories and based on the observations of gravitational waves, the $P_b$ mode is expected to be allowed.</description>

      <title>Cosmological dynamics of interacting dark energy and dark matter in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the behavior of interacting dark energy and dark matter within a model of $f(Q)$ gravity, employing a standard framework of dynamical system analysis. We consider the power-law $f(Q)$ model incorporating with two different forms of interacting dark energy and dark matter: $3\alpha H\rho_m$ and $\frac{\alpha}{3H}\rho_m \rho_{DE}$. The evolution of $\Omega_m, \Omega_r, \Omega_{DE}, q$, and $\omega$ for different values of the model parameter $n$ and the interaction parameter $\alpha$ has been examined. Our results show that the universe was dominated by matter in the early stages and will be dominated by dark energy in later stages. Using the observational data, the fixed points are found to be stable and can be represented the de Sitter and quintessence acceleration solutions. We discover that the dynamical profiles of the universe in $f(Q)$ dark energy models are influenced by both the interaction term and the relevant model parameters.</description>

      <title>Parameterized quasinormal frequencies and Hawking radiation for axial gravitational perturbations of a holonomy-corrected black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the fingerprints of black holes, quasinormal modes are closely associated with many properties of black holes. Especially, the ringdown phase of gravitational waveforms from the merger of compact binary components can be described by quasinormal modes. Serving as a model-independent approach, the framework of parameterized quasinormal frequencies offers a universal method for investigating quasinormal modes of diverse black holes. In this work, we first obtain the Schr\"{o}dinger-like master equation of the axial gravitational perturbation of a holonomy-corrected black hole. We calculate the corresponding quasinormal frequencies using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation and asymptotic iteration methods. We investigate the numerical evolution of an initial wave packet on the background spacetime. Then, we deduce the parameterized expression of the quasinormal frequencies and find that $r_0 \leq 10^{-2}$ is a necessary condition for the parameterized approximation to be valid. We also study the impact of the quantum parameter $r_0$ on the greybody factor and Hawking radiation. With more ringdown signals of gravitational waves detected in the future, our research will contribute to the study of the quantum properties of black holes.</description>

      <title>Euclidean actions and static black hole entropy in teleparallel theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that the results by Bekenstein, Gibbons and Hawking on the thermodynamics of black holes can be reproduced quite simply in the Euclidean path integral approach to Quantum Gravity. The corresponding partition function is obtained semiclassically, ultimately requiring only the on-shell Einstein-Hilbert action with opportune asymptotic subtractions. We elaborate on the fact that the same expressions for the thermodynamical quantities can be obtained within teleparallel equivalent theories, based on either torsion or nonmetricity, by employing quasilocal relations. Notably, the bulk integrals of these theories do not vanish on-shell but rather result in boundary terms themselves. Asymptotic subtractions of the latter are able to cancel out the divergences, ultimately leading to Bekenstein-Gibbons-Hawking's results. As a non-trivial cross-check, we compute the bulk integrals directly without reference to the boundary terms. While the result agrees with the previous method for the torsion-based teleparallel theory, it differs for the nonmetricity theory. Specifically, upon regularizing the bulk integral using a fiducial reference frame, we find that the semiclassical partition function vanishes. To address this problem, we propose a simple prescription for Schwarzschild black holes, which involves keeping the nonmetric connection arbitrary and imposing thermal equilibrium. Generalizations of the results to more general modified gravity theories with antisymmetric degrees of freedom are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16891v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A mechanism is found that explains how matter falling into the future event horizon of a black hole leaves information there, which it sends to the past event horizon, and there it determines how particles are emitted. This way information must be conserved. The mechanism is a calculable gravitational effect. We also show how it is avoided that the "hidden region" of the black hole gets involved, which has been standing out as a problem ever since Hawking found that particles must be emitted. The most striking consequence of our mechanism is that the radiation temperature is not what Hawking calculated, but twice that value. This is a direct consequence of the fact that the hidden region is not there.</description>

      <title>Doppler correlation-driven vetoes for the Frequency Hough analysis in continuous gravitational-wave searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an improved method for vetoing candidates of continuous gravitational-wave sources during all-sky searches utilizing the Frequency Hough pipeline. This approach leverages linear correlations between source parameters induced by the Earth Doppler effect, which can be effectively identified through the Hough Transform. Candidates that do not align with these patterns are considered spurious and can thus be vetoed, enhancing the depth and statistical significance of follow-up analyses. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive explanation of the method calibration, which intrinsically linked to the total duration of the observing run. On average, the procedure successfully vetoes $56\%$ of candidates. To assess the method performance, we conducted a Monte-Carlo simulation injecting fake continuous-wave signals into data from the third observing run of the LIGO detectors. This analysis allowed us to infer strain amplitude upper limits at a $90\%$ confidence level. We found that the optimal sensitivity is $h_0^{90\%} = 3.62^{+0.23}_{-0.22}\times 10^{-26}$ in the [128, 200] Hz band, which is within the most sensible frequency band of the LIGO detectors.</description>

Abstract: With non-perturbative de Sitter gravity and holography in mind, we deduce the genus expansion of de Sitter Jackiw-Teitelboim (dS JT) gravity. We find that this simple model of quantum cosmology has an effective string coupling which is pure imaginary. This imaginary coupling gives rise to alternating signs in the genus expansion of the dS JT S-matrix, which as a result appears to be Borel-Le Roy resummable. Furthermore dS JT gravity is formally an analytic continuation of AdS JT gravity, and behaves like a matrix integral with a negative number of degrees of freedom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave detectors have unveiled a population of massive black holes that do not resemble those observed in the Milky Way and whose origin is debated. According to one possible explanation, these black holes may have formed from density fluctuations in the early Universe (primordial black holes), and they should comprise from several to 100% of dark matter to explain the observed black hole merger rates. If such black holes existed in the Milky Way dark matter halo, they would cause long-timescale gravitational microlensing events lasting years. The previous experiments were not sufficiently sensitive to such events. Here we present the results of the search for long-timescale microlensing events among the light curves of nearly 80 million stars located in the Large Magellanic Cloud that were monitored for 20 years by the OGLE survey. We did not find any events with timescales longer than one year, whereas all shorter events detected may be explained by known stellar populations. We find that compact objects in the mass range from $1.8 \times 10^{-4}$ to $6.3\,M_{\odot}$ cannot compose more than 1% of dark matter, and those in the mass range from $1.3 \times 10^{-5}$ to $860\,M_{\odot}$ cannot make up more than 10% of dark matter. Thus, primordial black holes in this mass range cannot simultaneously explain a significant fraction of dark matter and gravitational wave events.</description>

      <title>Conditions for separability in multiqubit systems with an accelerating qubit using a conditional entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the separability in multiqubit pure and mixed Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and W states with an accelerating qubit using the Abe-Rajagopal (AR) $ q $-conditional entropy. We observe that the pure multiqubit GHZ and W states in the inertial : non-inertial bipartition with one of their qubits accelerated will remain non-separable irrespective of the qubit's acceleration. In these systems, we captured the variation of their non-separability with respect to the acceleration of the qubit and the AR $ q $-conditional entropy parameter $ q $. However, in the corresponding multiqubit mixed states obtained by introducing a global noise to the above pure states, one could get stronger conditions on their separability in the inertial : non-inertial bipartition, in terms of the acceleration of the qubit, noise parameter, and the number of qubits in the system, in the asymptotic limit of parameter $ q $. These conditions obtained from the AR $ q $-conditional entropy serve as necessary conditions for separability in such multiqubit states with a relativistic qubit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03648v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the most generic Carrollian higher derivative free scalar field theory intrinsically on a Carrollian manifold. The solutions to these theories are massless free particles propagating with speeds depending on the coupling constants in the Lagrangian, thus, allowing interference solutions which are not allowed on a Lorentzian manifold. This demonstrates that the set of solutions to the Carrollian theories is much larger than that of their Lorentzian counterparts. We also show that Carrollian higher derivative theories are more resistant to Ostrogradsky's instabilities. These instabilities can be resolved by choosing the coupling constants appropriately in the Carrollian Lagrangian, something that was proven to be impossible in Lorentzian theories.</description>

We reveal that the cylindrical Q-string exhibits dynamical instability to perturbations with wavelengths exceeding a threshold $\lambda&gt;\lambda_{c}$. This instability can destroy the invariance in the cylindrical direction, as a generation mechanism for Q-balls, similar to the formation of droplets. As the interface of the Q-string approaches a thin wall, this long-wavelength instability degenerates into the Rayleigh-Plateau instability with a threshold related only to the geometric radius $\lambda_{c}=2\pi R$. Such results indicate that Q-strings, like black strings, resemble low-viscosity fluids with surface tension.</description>
