      <title>Infrastructure-enabled risk assessment of hazardous road conditions on rural roads during inclement weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rural roadways often expose Commercial Motor Vehicle (CMV) drivers to hazardous conditions, such as heavy fog, rain, snow, black ice, and flash floods, many of which remain unreported in real time. This lack of timely information, coupled with limited infrastructure in rural areas, significantly increases the risk of crashes. Although various sensing technologies exist to monitor individual hazards like low visibility or surface friction, they rarely assess the combined driving risk posed by multiple simultaneous hazards, nor do they provide actionable recommendations such as safe advisory speeds. To address this critical gap, in this study, we present a roadway hazard risk assessment framework that provides an approach to quantify the probability and severity of crash occurrences due to specific roadway hazards. To evaluate this framework, we presented a case study by constructing a synthetic "year-long" dataset that encompasses every possible pairing of road surface and visibility conditions. Our analysis confirms that the combined ProbabilitySeverity scoring yields a coherent, stepwise risk profile across all hazard scenarios. These results validate the practicality of our risk assessment approach and provide a foundation for deploying graduated safety measures in real-world roadway operations.</description>

      <title>An assessment of estimation models and investment gaps for the deployment of high-speed broadband networks in NUTS3 regions to meet the objectives of the European Gigabit Society</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyses the deployment of high speed broadband networks in the European Union (EU). Its aim is to assess the investment required to meet the targets set by the European Commission (EC) for 2025, within the framework of the European Gigabit Society (EGS). This plan aims to ensure the availability and take up of very high capacity fixed and wireless networks, in both urban and rural areas, among households and the main socioeconomic drivers. The estimation model presented here uses a methodology supported by data at the local (NUTS3) level to give a bottom up estimation of the investment gap for each of the EGS objectives, using three different scenarios depending on the mix of wired and wireless technologies offered. The methodology and estimation model used in the paper are examined against other examples and assumptions available in the literature. We also offer a dynamic perspective on the analysis of the evolution of this investment gap over the years 2017 2019, which includes an assessment of the usefulness of these estimation models.</description>

      <title>Multi-field decomposed hyper-reduced order modeling of damage-plasticity simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a multi-field decomposed approach for hyper-reduced order modeling to overcome the limitations of traditional model reduction techniques for gradient-extended damage-plasticity simulations. The discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) and the energy-conserving sampling and weighting method (ECSW) are extended to account for the multi-field nature of the problem. Both methods yield stable reduced order simulations, while significantly reducing the computational cost compared to full-order simulations. Two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance and limitations of the proposed approaches. The decomposed ECSW method has overall higher accuracy and lower computational cost than the decomposed DEIM method.</description>

      <title>From stand-up to start-up: exploring entrepreneurship competences and STEM womens intention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study seeks to explore the relationship between entrepreneurship competencies and intention (EI) of a sample of potential STEM entrepreneurs in order to assess the conventional assumption on women exhibiting lower rates of entrepreneurship intention than men and that the lack of competence perceived is a higher barrier to be an entrepreneur for them. The model used for the analysis takes as reference the Entrepreneurship Competences Framework (EntreComp) proposed by the European Commission (EC) as a common guide to inspire entrepreneurship education. Data gathering is based on a structured questionnaire. The conducted analysis uses Students t test means comparison and factor analysis to define the model of competences, and a multiple regression model to study the relationship between competences and skill factors in EI. Findings do not validate the hypothesis that women have fewer entrepreneurship intentions than men. Also, slight differences on the self-perceived competences are obtained by gender. In addition, the study confirms the hypothesis of a positive relationship between competences and EI, but here gender is not a moderating factor. Results are expected to contribute to the entrepreneurship competences debate and provide useful insights of application in entrepreneurship education with orientation towards the business creation.</description>

      <title>Epistemic Trade-Off: An Analysis of the Operational Breakdown and Ontological Limits of "Certainty-Scope" in AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floridi's conjecture offers a compelling intuition about the fundamental trade-off between certainty and scope in artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This exploration remains crucial, not merely as a philosophical exercise, but as a potential compass for guiding AI investments, particularly in safety-critical industrial domains where the level of attention will surely be higher in the future. However, while intellectually coherent, its formalization ultimately freezes this insight into a suspended epistemic truth, resisting operationalization within real-world systems. This paper is a result of an analysis arguing that the conjecture's ambition to provide insights to engineering design and regulatory decision-making is constrained by two critical factors: first, its reliance on incomputable constructs - rendering it practically unactionable and unverifiable; second, its underlying ontological assumption of AI systems as self-contained epistemic entities - separating it from the intricate and dynamic socio-technical environments in which knowledge is co-constructed. We conclude that this dual breakdown - an epistemic closure deficit and an embeddedness bypass - prevents the conjecture from transitioning into a computable and actionable framework suitable for informing the design, deployment, and governance of real-world AI hybrid systems. In response, we propose a contribution to the framing of Floridi's epistemic challenge, addressing the inherent epistemic burdens of AI within complex human-centric domains.</description>

      <title>AMM-based DEX on the XRP Ledger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13749v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated Market Maker (AMM)-based Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) are crucial in Decentralized Finance (DeFi), but Ethereum implementations suffer from high transaction costs and price synchronization challenges. To address these limitations, we compare the XRP Ledger (XRPL)-AMM-Decentralized Exchange (DEX), a protocol-level implementation, against a Generic AMM-based DEX (G-AMM-DEX) on Ethereum, akin to Uniswap's V2 AMM implementation, through agent-based simulations using real market data and multiple volatility scenarios generated via Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM). Results demonstrate that the XRPL-AMM-DEX achieves superior price synchronization, reduced slippage, and improved returns due to XRPL's lower fees and shorter block times, with benefits amplifying during market volatility. The integrated Continuous Auction Mechanism (CAM) further mitigates impermanent loss by redistributing arbitrage value to Liquidity Providers (LPs). To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first comparative analysis between protocol-level and smart contract AMM-based DEX implementations and the first agent-based simulation validating theoretical auction mechanisms for AMM-based DEXs.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Reliability of Goal-Oriented Error Estimates for Galerkin Finite Element Methods with Nonlinear Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider estimating the discretization error in a nonlinear functional $J(u)$ in the setting of an abstract variational problem: find $u \in \mathcal{V}$ such that $B(u,\varphi) = L(\varphi) \; \forall \varphi \in \mathcal{V}$, as approximated by a Galerkin finite element method. Here, $\mathcal{V}$ is a Hilbert space, $B(\cdot,\cdot)$ is a bilinear form, and $L(\cdot)$ is a linear functional. We consider well-known error estimates $\eta$ of the form $J(u) - J(u_h) \approx \eta = L(z) - B(u_h, z)$, where $u_h$ denotes a finite element approximation to $u$, and $z$ denotes the solution to an auxiliary adjoint variational problem. We show that there exist nonlinear functionals for which error estimates of this form are not reliable, even in the presence of an exact adjoint solution solution $z$. An estimate $\eta$ is said to be reliable if there exists a constant $C \in \mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$ independent of $u_h$ such that $|J(u) - J(u_h)| \leq C|\eta|$. We present several example pairs of bilinear forms and nonlinear functionals where reliability of $\eta$ is not achieved.</description>
