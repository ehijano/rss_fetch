      <title>Quantifying correlations between information overload and fake news during COVID-19 pandemic: a Reddit study with BERT model approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information overload (IOL) is a well-known and devastating phenomenon that alters the performance of carrying out all types of tasks. It has been shown that in the media space, IOL can contribute to news fatigue and news avoidance, which often leads to the proliferation of fake news posts on social networks. However, there is a lack of automatic methods that can be used to track IOL in large datasets. In this study, we investigate whether the Gini index calculated from the distribution of topics obtained via the BERTopic model can be considered a proxy for IOL. We test our assumptions on a set of Reddit communities related to the COVID-19 pandemic and obtain a significant global correlation between the Gini index and the fraction of fake news detected by the FakeBERT classifier. However, at the community level, the correlation analysis results are ambiguous.</description>

      <title>Impact of Clustering on the Observability and Controllability of Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing complexity and interconnectedness of systems across various fields have led to a growing interest in studying complex networks, particularly Scale-Free (SF) networks, which best model real-world systems. This paper investigates the influence of clustering on the observability and controllability of complex SF networks, framing these characteristics in the context of structured systems theory. In this paper, we show that densely clustered networks require fewer driver and observer nodes due to better information propagation within clusters. This relationship is of interest for optimizing network design in applications such as social networks and intelligent transportation systems. We first quantify the network observability/controllability requirements, and then, through Monte-Carlo simulations and different case studies, we show how clustering affects these metrics. Our findings offer practical insights into reducing control and observer nodes for sensor/actuator placement, particularly in resource-constrained setups. This work contributes to the understanding of network observability/controllability and presents techniques for improving these features through alterations in network structure and clustering.</description>

      <title>Effects of Limited Field of View on Musical Collaboration Experience with Avatars in Extended Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During musical collaboration, visual cues are essential for communication between musicians. Extended Reality (XR) applications, often used with head-mounted displays like Augmented Reality (AR) glasses, can limit the field of view (FOV) of players. We conducted a study to investigate the effects of limited FOV on co-presence, gesture recognition, overall enjoyment, and reaction time.
  Initially, we observed experienced musicians collaborating informally with and without visual occlusion, noting that collaboration suffered with limited FOV. We then conducted a within-subjects study with 19 participants, comparing an unrestricted FOV holographic setup called HoloJam to Nreal AR glasses with a 52$^{\circ}$ limited FOV. In the AR setup, we tested two conditions: standard AR with a 52$^{\circ}$ FOV and a modified AR notification system called Mini Musicians.
  Results showed that HoloJam provided higher co-presence, quicker gesture recognition, and greater enjoyment. The Mini Musicians application reduced reaction time and maintained enjoyment compared to the standard AR setup. We conclude that limited FOV impacts musical collaboration, but notifications can improve reaction time and should be considered in future XR music collaborations.</description>

      <title>Modeling Epidemic Dynamics of Mutant Strains with Evolutionary Game-based Vaccination Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The outbreak of mutant strains and vaccination behaviors have been the focus of recent epidemiological research, but most existing epidemic models failed to simultaneously capture viral mutation and consider the complexity and behavioral dynamics of vaccination. To address this gap, we develop an extended SIRS model that distinguishes infections with the original strain and a mutant strain, and explicitly introduces a vaccinated compartment state. At the behavioral level, we employ evolutionary game theory to model individual vaccination decisions, where strategies are determined by both neighbors' choices and the current epidemiological situation. This process corresponds to the time-varying vaccination rate of susceptible individuals transitioning to vaccinated individuals at the epidemic spreading level. We then couple the epidemic and vaccination behavioral processes through the microscopic Markov chain approach (MMCA) and finally investigate the evolutionary dynamics via numerical simulations. The results show that our framework can effectively mitigate outbreaks across different disease scenarios. Sensitivity analysis further reveals that vaccination uptake is most strongly influenced by vaccine cost, efficacy, and perceived risk of side effects. Overall, this behavior-aware modeling framework captures the co-evolution of viral mutation and vaccination behavior, providing quantitative and theoretical support for designing effective public health vaccination policies.</description>

      <title>GA-S$^3$: Comprehensive Social Network Simulation with Group Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social network simulation is developed to provide a comprehensive understanding of social networks in the real world, which can be leveraged for a wide range of applications such as group behavior emergence, policy optimization, and business strategy development. However, billions of individuals and their evolving interactions involved in social networks pose challenges in accurately reflecting real-world complexities. In this study, we propose a comprehensive Social Network Simulation System (GA-S3) that leverages newly designed Group Agents to make intelligent decisions regarding various online events. Unlike other intelligent agents that represent an individual entity, our group agents model a collection of individuals exhibiting similar behaviors, facilitating the simulation of large-scale network phenomena with complex interactions at a manageable computational cost. Additionally, we have constructed a social network benchmark from 2024 popular online events that contains fine-grained information on Internet traffic variations. The experiment demonstrates that our approach is capable of achieving accurate and highly realistic prediction results. Code is open at https://github.com/AI4SS/GAS-3.</description>

      <title>Quantum Intelligence Meets BD-RIS-Enabled AmBC: Challenges, Opportunities, and Practical Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) is an innovative type of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) that has recently been proposed and is considered a revolutionary advancement in wave manipulation. Unlike the mutually disconnected arrangement of elements in traditional RISs, BD-RIS creates cost-effective and simple inter-element connections, allowing for greater freedom in configuring the amplitude and phase of impinging waves. However, there are numerous underlying challenges in realizing the advantages associated with BD-RIS, prompting the research community to actively investigate cutting-edge schemes and algorithms in this direction. Particularly, the passive beamforming design for BD-RIS under specific environmental conditions has become a major focus in this research area. In this article, we provide a systematic introduction to BD-RIS, elaborating on its functional principles concerning architectural design, promising advantages, and classification. Subsequently, we present recent advances and identify a series of challenges and opportunities. Additionally, we consider a specific case study where beamforming is designed using four different algorithms, and we analyze their performance with respect to sum rate and computation cost. To augment the beamforming capabilities in 6G BD-RIS with quantum enhancement, we analyze various hybrid quantum-classical machine learning (ML) models to improve beam prediction performance, employing real-world communication Scenario 8 from the DeepSense 6G dataset. Consequently, we derive useful insights about the practical implications of BD-RIS.</description>

      <title>Towards Open Diversity-Aware Social Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social Media and the Internet have catalyzed an unprecedented potential for exposure to human diversity in terms of demographics, talents, opinions, knowledge, and the like. However, this potential has not come with new, much-needed, instruments and skills to harness it. This paper presents our work on promoting richer and deeper social relations through the design and development of the "Internet of Us", an online platform that uses diversity-aware Artificial Intelligence to mediate and empower human social interactions. We discuss the multiple facets of diversity in social settings, the multidisciplinary work that is required to reap the benefits of diversity, and the vision for a diversity-aware hybrid human-AI society.</description>
