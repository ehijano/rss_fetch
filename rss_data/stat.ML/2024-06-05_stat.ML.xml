      <title>An efficient Wasserstein-distance approach for reconstructing jump-diffusion processes using parameterized neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the Wasserstein distance ($W$-distance) between two probability distributions associated with two multidimensional jump-diffusion processes. Specifically, we analyze a temporally decoupled squared $W_2$-distance, which provides both upper and lower bounds associated with the discrepancies in the drift, diffusion, and jump amplitude functions between the two jump-diffusion processes. Then, we propose a temporally decoupled squared $W_2$-distance method for efficiently reconstructing unknown jump-diffusion processes from data using parameterized neural networks. We further show its performance can be enhanced by utilizing prior information on the drift function of the jump-diffusion process. The effectiveness of our proposed reconstruction method is demonstrated across several examples and applications.</description>

      <title>An efficient solution to Hidden Markov Models on trees with coupled branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are powerful tools for modeling sequential data, where the underlying states evolve in a stochastic manner and are only indirectly observable. Traditional HMM approaches are well-established for linear sequences, and have been extended to other structures such as trees. In this paper, we extend the framework of HMMs on trees to address scenarios where the tree-like structure of the data includes coupled branches -- a common feature in biological systems where entities within the same lineage exhibit dependent characteristics. We develop a dynamic programming algorithm that efficiently solves the likelihood, decoding, and parameter learning problems for tree-based HMMs with coupled branches. Our approach scales polynomially with the number of states and nodes, making it computationally feasible for a wide range of applications and does not suffer from the underflow problem. We demonstrate our algorithm by applying it to simulated data and propose self-consistency checks for validating the assumptions of the model used for inference. This work not only advances the theoretical understanding of HMMs on trees but also provides a practical tool for analyzing complex biological data where dependencies between branches cannot be ignored.</description>

      <title>Fearless Stochasticity in Expectation Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expectation propagation (EP) is a family of algorithms for performing approximate inference in probabilistic models. The updates of EP involve the evaluation of moments -- expectations of certain functions -- which can be estimated from Monte Carlo (MC) samples. However, the updates are not robust to MC noise when performed naively, and various prior works have attempted to address this issue in different ways. In this work, we provide a novel perspective on the moment-matching updates of EP; namely, that they perform natural-gradient-based optimisation of a variational objective. We use this insight to motivate two new EP variants, with updates that are particularly well-suited to MC estimation; they remain stable and are most sample-efficient when estimated with just a single sample. These new variants combine the benefits of their predecessors and address key weaknesses. In particular, they are easier to tune, offer an improved speed-accuracy trade-off, and do not rely on the use of debiasing estimators. We demonstrate their efficacy on a variety of probabilistic inference tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining the merits of both denoising diffusion probabilistic models and gradient boosting, the diffusion boosting paradigm is introduced for tackling supervised learning problems. We develop Diffusion Boosted Trees (DBT), which can be viewed as both a new denoising diffusion generative model parameterized by decision trees (one single tree for each diffusion timestep), and a new boosting algorithm that combines the weak learners into a strong learner of conditional distributions without making explicit parametric assumptions on their density forms. We demonstrate through experiments the advantages of DBT over deep neural network-based diffusion models as well as the competence of DBT on real-world regression tasks, and present a business application (fraud detection) of DBT for classification on tabular data with the ability of learning to defer.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Causal Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimates of causal parameters such as conditional average treatment effects and conditional quantile treatment effects play an important role in real-world decision making. Given this importance, one should ensure these estimators are calibrated. While there is a rich literature on calibrating estimators of non-causal parameters, very few methods have been derived for calibrating estimators of causal parameters, or more generally estimators of quantities involving nuisance parameters.
  In this work, we provide a general framework for calibrating predictors involving nuisance estimation. We consider a notion of calibration defined with respect to an arbitrary, nuisance-dependent loss $\ell$, under which we say an estimator $\theta$ is calibrated if its predictions cannot be changed on any level set to decrease loss. We prove generic upper bounds on the calibration error of any causal parameter estimate $\theta$ with respect to any loss $\ell$ using a concept called Neyman Orthogonality. Our bounds involve two decoupled terms - one measuring the error in estimating the unknown nuisance parameters, and the other representing the calibration error in a hypothetical world where the learned nuisance estimates were true. We use our bound to analyze the convergence of two sample splitting algorithms for causal calibration. One algorithm, which applies to universally orthogonalizable loss functions, transforms the data into generalized pseudo-outcomes and applies an off-the-shelf calibration procedure. The other algorithm, which applies to conditionally orthogonalizable loss functions, extends the classical uniform mass binning algorithm to include nuisance estimation. Our results are exceedingly general, showing that essentially any existing calibration algorithm can be used in causal settings, with additional loss only arising from errors in nuisance estimation.</description>

      <title>Causal Effect Identification in LiNGAM Models with Latent Confounders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the generic identifiability of causal effects in linear non-Gaussian acyclic models (LiNGAM) with latent variables. We consider the problem in two main settings: When the causal graph is known a priori, and when it is unknown. In both settings, we provide a complete graphical characterization of the identifiable direct or total causal effects among observed variables. Moreover, we propose efficient algorithms to certify the graphical conditions. Finally, we propose an adaptation of the reconstruction independent component analysis (RICA) algorithm that estimates the causal effects from the observational data given the causal graph. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in estimating the causal effects.</description>

      <title>Online Learning and Information Exponents: On The Importance of Batch size, and Time/Complexity Tradeoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of the batch size $n_b$ on the iteration time $T$ of training two-layer neural networks with one-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on multi-index target functions of isotropic covariates. We characterize the optimal batch size minimizing the iteration time as a function of the hardness of the target, as characterized by the information exponents. We show that performing gradient updates with large batches $n_b \lesssim d^{\frac{\ell}{2}}$ minimizes the training time without changing the total sample complexity, where $\ell$ is the information exponent of the target to be learned \citep{arous2021online} and $d$ is the input dimension. However, larger batch sizes than $n_b \gg d^{\frac{\ell}{2}}$ are detrimental for improving the time complexity of SGD. We provably overcome this fundamental limitation via a different training protocol, \textit{Correlation loss SGD}, which suppresses the auto-correlation terms in the loss function. We show that one can track the training progress by a system of low-dimensional ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Finally, we validate our theoretical results with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>On the Recoverability of Causal Relations from Temporally Aggregated I.I.D. Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the effect of temporal aggregation on instantaneous (non-temporal) causal discovery in general setting. This is motivated by the observation that the true causal time lag is often considerably shorter than the observational interval. This discrepancy leads to high aggregation, causing time-delay causality to vanish and instantaneous dependence to manifest. Although we expect such instantaneous dependence has consistency with the true causal relation in certain sense to make the discovery results meaningful, it remains unclear what type of consistency we need and when will such consistency be satisfied. We proposed functional consistency and conditional independence consistency in formal way correspond functional causal model-based methods and conditional independence-based methods respectively and provide the conditions under which these consistencies will hold. We show theoretically and experimentally that causal discovery results may be seriously distorted by aggregation especially in complete nonlinear case and we also find causal relationship still recoverable from aggregated data if we have partial linearity or appropriate prior. Our findings suggest community should take a cautious and meticulous approach when interpreting causal discovery results from such data and show why and when aggregation will distort the performance of causal discovery methods.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks Do Not Always Oversmooth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for processing relational data in applications. However, GNNs suffer from the problem of oversmoothing, the property that the features of all nodes exponentially converge to the same vector over layers, prohibiting the design of deep GNNs. In this work we study oversmoothing in graph convolutional networks (GCNs) by using their Gaussian process (GP) equivalence in the limit of infinitely many hidden features. By generalizing methods from conventional deep neural networks (DNNs), we can describe the distribution of features at the output layer of deep GCNs in terms of a GP: as expected, we find that typical parameter choices from the literature lead to oversmoothing. The theory, however, allows us to identify a new, nonoversmoothing phase: if the initial weights of the network have sufficiently large variance, GCNs do not oversmooth, and node features remain informative even at large depth. We demonstrate the validity of this prediction in finite-size GCNs by training a linear classifier on their output. Moreover, using the linearization of the GCN GP, we generalize the concept of propagation depth of information from DNNs to GCNs. This propagation depth diverges at the transition between the oversmoothing and non-oversmoothing phase. We test the predictions of our approach and find good agreement with finite-size GCNs. Initializing GCNs near the transition to the non-oversmoothing phase, we obtain networks which are both deep and expressive.</description>

      <title>Composite Quantile Regression With XGBoost Using the Novel Arctan Pinball Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the use of XGBoost for composite quantile regression. XGBoost is a highly popular model renowned for its flexibility, efficiency, and capability to deal with missing data. The optimization uses a second order approximation of the loss function, complicating the use of loss functions with a zero or vanishing second derivative. Quantile regression -- a popular approach to obtain conditional quantiles when point estimates alone are insufficient -- unfortunately uses such a loss function, the pinball loss. Existing workarounds are typically inefficient and can result in severe quantile crossings. In this paper, we present a smooth approximation of the pinball loss, the arctan pinball loss, that is tailored to the needs of XGBoost. Specifically, contrary to other smooth approximations, the arctan pinball loss has a relatively large second derivative, which makes it more suitable to use in the second order approximation. Using this loss function enables the simultaneous prediction of multiple quantiles, which is more efficient and results in far fewer quantile crossings.</description>

      <title>System-2 Recommenders: Disentangling Utility and Engagement in Recommendation Systems via Temporal Point-Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems are an important part of the modern human experience whose influence ranges from the food we eat to the news we read. Yet, there is still debate as to what extent recommendation platforms are aligned with the user goals. A core issue fueling this debate is the challenge of inferring a user utility based on engagement signals such as likes, shares, watch time etc., which are the primary metric used by platforms to optimize content. This is because users utility-driven decision-processes (which we refer to as System-2), e.g., reading news that are relevant for them, are often confounded by their impulsive decision-processes (which we refer to as System-1), e.g., spend time on click-bait news. As a result, it is difficult to infer whether an observed engagement is utility-driven or impulse-driven. In this paper we explore a new approach to recommender systems where we infer user utility based on their return probability to the platform rather than engagement signals. Our intuition is that users tend to return to a platform in the long run if it creates utility for them, while pure engagement-driven interactions that do not add utility, may affect user return in the short term but will not have a lasting effect. We propose a generative model in which past content interactions impact the arrival rates of users based on a self-exciting Hawkes process. These arrival rates to the platform are a combination of both System-1 and System-2 decision processes. The System-2 arrival intensity depends on the utility and has a long lasting effect, while the System-1 intensity depends on the instantaneous gratification and tends to vanish rapidly. We show analytically that given samples it is possible to disentangle System-1 and System-2 and allow content optimization based on user utility. We conduct experiments on synthetic data to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Self-Improving Robust Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01660v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both online and offline RLHF methods such as PPO and DPO have been extremely successful in aligning AI with human preferences. Despite their success, the existing methods suffer from a fundamental problem that their optimal solution is highly task-dependent (i.e., not robust to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks). Here we address this challenge by proposing Self-Improving Robust Preference Optimization SRPO, a practical and mathematically principled offline RLHF framework that is completely robust to the changes in the task. The key idea of SRPO is to cast the problem of learning from human preferences as a self-improvement process, which can be mathematically expressed in terms of a min-max objective that aims at joint optimization of self-improvement policy and the generative policy in an adversarial fashion. The solution for this optimization problem is independent of the training task and thus it is robust to its changes. We then show that this objective can be re-expressed in the form of a non-adversarial offline loss which can be optimized using standard supervised optimization techniques at scale without any need for reward model and online inference. We show the effectiveness of SRPO in terms of AI Win-Rate (WR) against human (GOLD) completions. In particular, when SRPO is evaluated on the OOD XSUM dataset, it outperforms the celebrated DPO by a clear margin of 15% after 5 self-revisions, achieving WR of 90%.</description>

      <title>A Diffusion Model Framework for Unsupervised Neural Combinatorial Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning to sample from intractable distributions over discrete sets without relying on corresponding training data is a central problem in a wide range of fields, including Combinatorial Optimization. Currently, popular deep learning-based approaches rely primarily on generative models that yield exact sample likelihoods. This work introduces a method that lifts this restriction and opens the possibility to employ highly expressive latent variable models like diffusion models. Our approach is conceptually based on a loss that upper bounds the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and evades the requirement of exact sample likelihoods. We experimentally validate our approach in data-free Combinatorial Optimization and demonstrate that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art on a wide range of benchmark problems.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the Optimal Weighted Average: Efficient Distributed Sparse Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While distributed training is often viewed as a solution to optimizing linear models on increasingly large datasets, inter-machine communication costs of popular distributed approaches can dominate as data dimensionality increases. Recent work on non-interactive algorithms shows that approximate solutions for linear models can be obtained efficiently with only a single round of communication among machines. However, this approximation often degenerates as the number of machines increases. In this paper, building on the recent optimal weighted average method, we introduce a new technique, ACOWA, that allows an extra round of communication to achieve noticeably better approximation quality with minor runtime increases. Results show that for sparse distributed logistic regression, ACOWA obtains solutions that are more faithful to the empirical risk minimizer and attain substantially higher accuracy than other distributed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Non-Asymptotic Analysis for Single-Loop (Natural) Actor-Critic with Compatible Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Actor-critic (AC) is a powerful method for learning an optimal policy in reinforcement learning, where the critic uses algorithms, e.g., temporal difference (TD) learning with function approximation, to evaluate the current policy and the actor updates the policy along an approximate gradient direction using information from the critic. This paper provides the \textit{tightest} non-asymptotic convergence bounds for both the AC and natural AC (NAC) algorithms. Specifically, existing studies show that AC converges to an $\epsilon+\varepsilon_{\text{critic}}$ neighborhood of stationary points with the best known sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ (up to a log factor), and NAC converges to an $\epsilon+\varepsilon_{\text{critic}}+\sqrt{\varepsilon_{\text{actor}}}$ neighborhood of the global optimum with the best known sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$, where $\varepsilon_{\text{critic}}$ is the approximation error of the critic and $\varepsilon_{\text{actor}}$ is the approximation error induced by the insufficient expressive power of the parameterized policy class. This paper analyzes the convergence of both AC and NAC algorithms with compatible function approximation. Our analysis eliminates the term $\varepsilon_{\text{critic}}$ from the error bounds while still achieving the best known sample complexities. Moreover, we focus on the challenging single-loop setting with a single Markovian sample trajectory. Our major technical novelty lies in analyzing the stochastic bias due to policy-dependent and time-varying compatible function approximation in the critic, and handling the non-ergodicity of the MDP due to the single Markovian sample trajectory.

      <title>How Does Gradient Descent Learn Features -- A Local Analysis for Regularized Two-Layer Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability of learning useful features is one of the major advantages of neural networks. Although recent works show that neural network can operate in a neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime that does not allow feature learning, many works also demonstrate the potential for neural networks to go beyond NTK regime and perform feature learning. Recently, a line of work highlighted the feature learning capabilities of the early stages of gradient-based training. In this paper we consider another mechanism for feature learning via gradient descent through a local convergence analysis. We show that once the loss is below a certain threshold, gradient descent with a carefully regularized objective will capture ground-truth directions. Our results demonstrate that feature learning not only happens at the initial gradient steps, but can also occur towards the end of training.</description>

      <title>Towards the Transferability of Rewards Recovered via Regularized Inverse Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to infer a reward from expert demonstrations, motivated by the idea that the reward, rather than the policy, is the most succinct and transferable description of a task [Ng et al., 2000]. However, the reward corresponding to an optimal policy is not unique, making it unclear if an IRL-learned reward is transferable to new transition laws in the sense that its optimal policy aligns with the optimal policy corresponding to the expert's true reward. Past work has addressed this problem only under the assumption of full access to the expert's policy, guaranteeing transferability when learning from two experts with the same reward but different transition laws that satisfy a specific rank condition [Rolland et al., 2022]. In this work, we show that the conditions developed under full access to the expert's policy cannot guarantee transferability in the more practical scenario where we have access only to demonstrations of the expert. Instead of a binary rank condition, we propose principal angles as a more refined measure of similarity and dissimilarity between transition laws. Based on this, we then establish two key results: 1) a sufficient condition for transferability to any transition laws when learning from at least two experts with sufficiently different transition laws, and 2) a sufficient condition for transferability to local changes in the transition law when learning from a single expert. Furthermore, we also provide a probably approximately correct (PAC) algorithm and an end-to-end analysis for learning transferable rewards from demonstrations of multiple experts.</description>

      <title>Online Control in Population Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of population dynamics originated with early sociological works (Malthus, 1872) but has since extended into many fields, including biology, epidemiology, evolutionary game theory, and economics. Most studies on population dynamics focus on the problem of prediction rather than control. Existing mathematical models for population control are often restricted to specific, noise-free dynamics, while real-world population changes can be complex and adversarial.
  To address this gap, we propose a new framework based on the paradigm of online control. We first characterize a set of linear dynamical systems that can naturally model evolving populations. We then give an efficient gradient-based controller for these systems, with near-optimal regret bounds with respect to a broad class of linear policies. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for population control even in non-linear models such as SIR and replicator dynamics.</description>

      <title>Long-term foehn reconstruction combining unsupervised and supervised learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foehn winds, characterized by abrupt temperature increases and wind speed changes, significantly impact regions on the leeward side of mountain ranges, e.g., by spreading wildfires. Understanding how foehn occurrences change under climate change is crucial. Unfortunately, foehn cannot be measured directly but has to be inferred from meteorological measurements employing suitable classification schemes. Hence, this approach is typically limited to specific periods for which the necessary data are available. We present a novel approach for reconstructing historical foehn occurrences using a combination of unsupervised and supervised probabilistic statistical learning methods. We utilize in-situ measurements (available for recent decades) to train an unsupervised learner (finite mixture model) for automatic foehn classification. These labeled data are then linked to reanalysis data (covering longer periods) using a supervised learner (lasso or boosting). This allows to reconstruct past foehn probabilities based solely on reanalysis data. Applying this method to ERA5 reanalysis data for six stations across Switzerland and Austria achieves accurate hourly reconstructions of north and south foehn occurrence, respectively, dating back to 1940. This paves the way for investigating how seasonal foehn patterns have evolved over the past 83 years, providing valuable insights into climate change impacts on these critical wind events.</description>

      <title>Causal Discovery with Fewer Conditional Independence Tests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many questions in science center around the fundamental problem of understanding causal relationships. However, most constraint-based causal discovery algorithms, including the well-celebrated PC algorithm, often incur an exponential number of conditional independence (CI) tests, posing limitations in various applications. Addressing this, our work focuses on characterizing what can be learned about the underlying causal graph with a reduced number of CI tests. We show that it is possible to a learn a coarser representation of the hidden causal graph with a polynomial number of tests. This coarser representation, named Causal Consistent Partition Graph (CCPG), comprises of a partition of the vertices and a directed graph defined over its components. CCPG satisfies consistency of orientations and additional constraints which favor finer partitions. Furthermore, it reduces to the underlying causal graph when the causal graph is identifiable. As a consequence, our results offer the first efficient algorithm for recovering the true causal graph with a polynomial number of tests, in special cases where the causal graph is fully identifiable through observational data and potentially additional interventions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic natural gradient variational inference (NGVI) is a popular posterior inference method with applications in various probabilistic models. Despite its wide usage, little is known about the non-asymptotic convergence rate in the \emph{stochastic} setting. We aim to lessen this gap and provide a better understanding. For conjugate likelihoods, we prove the first $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{T})$ non-asymptotic convergence rate of stochastic NGVI. The complexity is no worse than stochastic gradient descent (\aka black-box variational inference) and the rate likely has better constant dependency that leads to faster convergence in practice. For non-conjugate likelihoods, we show that stochastic NGVI with the canonical parameterization implicitly optimizes a non-convex objective. Thus, a global convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{T})$ is unlikely without some significant new understanding of optimizing the ELBO using natural gradients.</description>

      <title>Explicitly Encoding Structural Symmetry is Key to Length Generalization in Arithmetic Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the success of Transformers on language understanding, code generation, and logical reasoning, they still fail to generalize over length on basic arithmetic tasks such as addition and multiplication. A major reason behind this failure is the vast difference in structure between numbers and text; For example, the numbers are typically parsed from right to left, and there is a correspondence between digits at the same position across different numbers. In contrast, for text, such symmetries are quite unnatural. In this work, we propose to encode these semantics explicitly into the model via modified number formatting and custom positional encodings. Empirically, our method allows a Transformer trained on numbers with at most 5-digits for addition and multiplication to generalize up to 50-digit numbers, without using additional data for longer sequences. We further demonstrate that traditional absolute positional encodings (APE) fail to generalize to longer sequences, even when trained with augmented data that captures task symmetries. To elucidate the importance of explicitly encoding structure, we prove that explicit incorporation of structure via positional encodings is necessary for out-of-distribution generalization. Finally, we pinpoint other challenges inherent to length generalization beyond capturing symmetries, in particular complexity of the underlying task, and propose changes in the training distribution to address them.</description>

      <title>Variable importance measure for spatial machine learning models with application to air pollution exposure prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exposure assessment is fundamental to air pollution cohort studies. The objective is to predict air pollution exposures for study subjects at locations without data in order to optimize our ability to learn about health effects of air pollution. In addition to generating accurate predictions to minimize exposure measurement error, understanding the mechanism captured by the model is another crucial aspect that may not always be straightforward due to the complex nature of machine learning methods, as well as the lack of unifying notions of variable importance. This is further complicated in air pollution modeling by the presence of spatial correlation. We tackle these challenges in two datasets: sulfur (S) from regulatory United States national PM2.5 sub-species data and ultrafine particles (UFP) from a new Seattle-area traffic-related air pollution dataset. Our key contribution is a leave-one-out approach for variable importance that leads to interpretable and comparable measures for a broad class of models with separable mean and covariance components. We illustrate our approach with several spatial machine learning models, and it clearly highlights the difference in model mechanisms, even for those producing similar predictions. We leverage insights from this variable importance measure to assess the relative utilities of two exposure models for S and UFP that have similar out-of-sample prediction accuracies but appear to draw on different types of spatial information to make predictions.</description>

      <title>Adaptive and Optimal Second-order Optimistic Methods for Minimax Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose adaptive, line search-free second-order methods with optimal rate of convergence for solving convex-concave min-max problems. By means of an adaptive step size, our algorithms feature a simple update rule that requires solving only one linear system per iteration, eliminating the need for line search or backtracking mechanisms. Specifically, we base our algorithms on the optimistic method and appropriately combine it with second-order information. Moreover, distinct from common adaptive schemes, we define the step size recursively as a function of the gradient norm and the prediction error in the optimistic update. We first analyze a variant where the step size requires knowledge of the Lipschitz constant of the Hessian. Under the additional assumption of Lipschitz continuous gradients, we further design a parameter-free version by tracking the Hessian Lipschitz constant locally and ensuring the iterates remain bounded. We also evaluate the practical performance of our algorithm by comparing it to existing second-order algorithms for minimax optimization.</description>

      <title>On the Mode-Seeking Properties of Langevin Dynamics</title>

Abstract: The Langevin Dynamics framework, which aims to generate samples from the score function of a probability distribution, is widely used for analyzing and interpreting score-based generative modeling. While the convergence behavior of Langevin Dynamics under unimodal distributions has been extensively studied in the literature, in practice the data distribution could consist of multiple distinct modes. In this work, we investigate Langevin Dynamics in producing samples from multimodal distributions and theoretically study its mode-seeking properties. We prove that under a variety of sub-Gaussian mixtures, Langevin Dynamics is unlikely to find all mixture components within a sub-exponential number of steps in the data dimension. To reduce the mode-seeking tendencies of Langevin Dynamics, we propose Chained Langevin Dynamics, which divides the data vector into patches of constant size and generates every patch sequentially conditioned on the previous patches. We perform a theoretical analysis of Chained Langevin Dynamics by reducing it to sampling from a constant-dimensional distribution. We present the results of several numerical experiments on synthetic and real image datasets, supporting our theoretical results on the iteration complexities of sample generation from mixture distributions using the chained and vanilla Langevin Dynamics.

      <description>arXiv:2406.02052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reversible architectures have been shown to be capable of performing on par with their non-reversible architectures, being applied in deep learning for memory savings and generative modeling. In this work, we show how reversible architectures can solve challenges in parallelizing deep model training. We introduce PETRA, a novel alternative to backpropagation for parallelizing gradient computations. PETRA facilitates effective model parallelism by enabling stages (i.e., a set of layers) to compute independently on different devices, while only needing to communicate activations and gradients between each other. By decoupling the forward and backward passes and keeping a single updated version of the parameters, the need for weight stashing is also removed. We develop a custom autograd-like training framework for PETRA, and we demonstrate its effectiveness on CIFAR-10, ImageNet32, and ImageNet, achieving competitive accuracies comparable to backpropagation using ResNet-18, ResNet-34, and ResNet-50 models.</description>

      <title>Kernel vs. Kernel: Exploring How the Data Structure Affects Neural Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a vast amount of literature has focused on the "Neural Collapse" (NC) phenomenon, which emerges when training neural network (NN) classifiers beyond the zero training error point. The core component of NC is the decrease in the within class variability of the network's deepest features, dubbed as NC1. The theoretical works that study NC are typically based on simplified unconstrained features models (UFMs) that mask any effect of the data on the extent of collapse. In this paper, we provide a kernel-based analysis that does not suffer from this limitation. First, given a kernel function, we establish expressions for the traces of the within- and between-class covariance matrices of the samples' features (and consequently an NC1 metric). Then, we turn to focus on kernels associated with shallow NNs. First, we consider the NN Gaussian Process kernel (NNGP), associated with the network at initialization, and the complement Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), associated with its training in the "lazy regime". Interestingly, we show that the NTK does not represent more collapsed features than the NNGP for prototypical data models. As NC emerges from training, we then consider an alternative to NTK: the recently proposed adaptive kernel, which generalizes NNGP to model the feature mapping learned from the training data. Contrasting our NC1 analysis for these two kernels enables gaining insights into the effect of data distribution on the extent of collapse, which are empirically aligned with the behavior observed with practical training of NNs.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Federated Learning with Bayesian Pseudocoresets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization-based techniques for federated learning (FL) often come with prohibitive communication cost, as high dimensional model parameters need to be communicated repeatedly between server and clients. In this paper, we follow a Bayesian approach allowing to perform FL with one-shot communication, by solving the global inference problem as a product of local client posteriors. For models with multi-modal likelihoods, such as neural networks, a naive application of this scheme is hampered, since clients will capture different posterior modes, causing a destructive collapse of the posterior on the server side. Consequently, we explore approximate inference in the function-space representation of client posteriors, hence suffering less or not at all from multi-modality. We show that distributed function-space inference is tightly related to learning Bayesian pseudocoresets and develop a tractable Bayesian FL algorithm on this insight. We show that this approach achieves prediction performance competitive to state-of-the-art while showing a striking reduction in communication cost of up to two orders of magnitude. Moreover, due to its Bayesian nature, our method also delivers well-calibrated uncertainty estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gumbel-Softmax probability distribution allows learning discrete tokens in generative learning, while the Gumbel-Argmax probability distribution is useful in learning discrete structures in discriminative learning. Despite the efforts invested in optimizing these probability models, their statistical properties are under-explored. In this work, we investigate their representation properties and determine for which families of parameters these probability distributions are complete, i.e., can represent any probability distribution, and minimal, i.e., can represent a probability distribution uniquely. We rely on convexity and differentiability to determine these statistical conditions and extend this framework to general probability models, such as Gaussian-Softmax and Gaussian-Argmax. We experimentally validate the qualities of these extensions, which enjoy a faster convergence rate. We conclude the analysis by identifying two sets of parameters that satisfy these assumptions and thus admit a complete and minimal representation. Our contribution is theoretical with supporting practical evaluation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many machine learning applications are naturally formulated as optimization problems on Riemannian manifolds. The main idea behind Riemannian optimization is to maintain the feasibility of the variables while moving along a descent direction on the manifold. This results in updating all the variables at every iteration. In this work, we provide a general framework for developing computationally efficient coordinate descent (CD) algorithms on matrix manifolds that allows updating only a few variables at every iteration while adhering to the manifold constraint. In particular, we propose CD algorithms for various manifolds such as Stiefel, Grassmann, (generalized) hyperbolic, symplectic, and symmetric positive (semi)definite. While the cost per iteration of the proposed CD algorithms is low, we further develop a more efficient variant via a first-order approximation of the objective function. We analyze their convergence and complexity, and empirically illustrate their efficacy in several applications.</description>

      <title>On the Limitations of Fractal Dimension as a Measure of Generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bounding and predicting the generalization gap of overparameterized neural networks remains a central open problem in theoretical machine learning. Neural network optimization trajectories have been proposed to possess fractal structure, leading to bounds and generalization measures based on notions of fractal dimension on these trajectories. Prominently, both the Hausdorff dimension and the persistent homology dimension have been proposed to correlate with generalization gap, thus serving as a measure of generalization. This work performs an extended evaluation of these topological generalization measures. We demonstrate that fractal dimension fails to predict generalization of models trained from poor initializations. We further identify that the $\ell^2$ norm of the final parameter iterate, one of the simplest complexity measures in learning theory, correlates more strongly with the generalization gap than these notions of fractal dimension. Finally, our study reveals the intriguing manifestation of model-wise double descent in persistent homology-based generalization measures. This work lays the ground for a deeper investigation of the causal relationships between fractal geometry, topological data analysis, and neural network optimization.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning with Lookahead Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) problems in which agents observe the reward or transition realizations at their current state before deciding which action to take. Such observations are available in many applications, including transactions, navigation and more. When the environment is known, previous work shows that this lookahead information can drastically increase the collected reward. However, outside of specific applications, existing approaches for interacting with unknown environments are not well-adapted to these observations. In this work, we close this gap and design provably-efficient learning algorithms able to incorporate lookahead information. To achieve this, we perform planning using the empirical distribution of the reward and transition observations, in contrast to vanilla approaches that only rely on estimated expectations. We prove that our algorithms achieve tight regret versus a baseline that also has access to lookahead information - linearly increasing the amount of collected reward compared to agents that cannot handle lookahead information.</description>

      <title>Generative Conditional Distributions by Neural (Entropic) Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning conditional distributions is challenging because the desired outcome is not a single distribution but multiple distributions that correspond to multiple instances of the covariates. We introduce a novel neural entropic optimal transport method designed to effectively learn generative models of conditional distributions, particularly in scenarios characterized by limited sample sizes. Our method relies on the minimax training of two neural networks: a generative network parametrizing the inverse cumulative distribution functions of the conditional distributions and another network parametrizing the conditional Kantorovich potential. To prevent overfitting, we regularize the objective function by penalizing the Lipschitz constant of the network output. Our experiments on real-world datasets show the effectiveness of our algorithm compared to state-of-the-art conditional distribution learning techniques. Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/nguyenngocbaocmt02/GENTLE.</description>

      <title>Label-wise Aleatoric and Epistemic Uncertainty Quantification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to uncertainty quantification in classification tasks based on label-wise decomposition of uncertainty measures. This label-wise perspective allows uncertainty to be quantified at the individual class level, thereby improving cost-sensitive decision-making and helping understand the sources of uncertainty. Furthermore, it allows to define total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty on the basis of non-categorical measures such as variance, going beyond common entropy-based measures. In particular, variance-based measures address some of the limitations associated with established methods that have recently been discussed in the literature. We show that our proposed measures adhere to a number of desirable properties. Through empirical evaluation on a variety of benchmark data sets -- including applications in the medical domain where accurate uncertainty quantification is crucial -- we establish the effectiveness of label-wise uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>Temporal Graph Rewiring with Expander Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02362v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolving relations in real-world networks are often modelled by temporal graphs. Graph rewiring techniques have been utilised on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve expressiveness and increase model performance. In this work, we propose Temporal Graph Rewiring (TGR), the first approach for graph rewiring on temporal graphs. TGR enables communication between temporally distant nodes in a continuous time dynamic graph by utilising expander graph propagation to construct a message passing highway for message passing between distant nodes. Expander graphs are suitable candidates for rewiring as they help overcome the oversquashing problem often observed in GNNs. On the public tgbl-wiki benchmark, we show that TGR improves the performance of a widely used TGN model by a significant margin. Our code repository is accessible at https://github.com/kpetrovicc/TGR.git .</description>

      <title>Online Fair Allocation of Perishable Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a practically motivated variant of the canonical online fair allocation problem: a decision-maker has a budget of perishable resources to allocate over a fixed number of rounds. Each round sees a random number of arrivals, and the decision-maker must commit to an allocation for these individuals before moving on to the next round. The goal is to construct a sequence of allocations that is envy-free and efficient. Our work makes two important contributions toward this problem: we first derive strong lower bounds on the optimal envy-efficiency trade-off that demonstrate that a decision-maker is fundamentally limited in what she can hope to achieve relative to the no-perishing setting; we then design an algorithm achieving these lower bounds which takes as input $(i)$ a prediction of the perishing order, and $(ii)$ a desired bound on envy. Given the remaining budget in each period, the algorithm uses forecasts of future demand and perishing to adaptively choose one of two carefully constructed guardrail quantities. We demonstrate our algorithm's strong numerical performance - and state-of-the-art, perishing-agnostic algorithms' inefficacy - on simulations calibrated to a real-world dataset.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Variance-Reduced Forward-Reflected Methods for Root-Finding Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel class of Nesterov's stochastic accelerated forward-reflected-based methods with variance reduction to solve root-finding problems under $\frac{1}{L}$-co-coerciveness. Our algorithm is single-loop and leverages a new family of unbiased variance-reduced estimators specifically designed for root-finding problems. It achieves both $\mathcal{O}(L^2/k^2)$ and $o(1/k^2)$-last-iterate convergence rates in terms of expected operator squared norm, where $k$ denotes the iteration counter. We instantiate our framework for two prominent estimators: SVRG and SAGA. By an appropriate choice of parameters, both variants attain an oracle complexity of $\mathcal{O}( n + Ln^{2/3}\epsilon^{-1})$ to reach an $\epsilon$-solution, where $n$ represents the number of summands in the finite-sum operator. Furthermore, under $\mu$-strong quasi-monotonicity, our method achieves a linear convergence rate and an oracle complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n+ \kappa n^{2/3}\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$, where $\kappa := \frac{L}{\mu}$. We extend our approach to solve a class of finite-sum monotone inclusions, demonstrating that our schemes retain the same theoretical guarantees as in the equation setting. Finally, numerical experiments validate our algorithms and demonstrate their promising performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Reweighted Solutions for Weighted Low Rank Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weighted low rank approximation (WLRA) is an important yet computationally challenging primitive with applications ranging from statistical analysis, model compression, and signal processing. To cope with the NP-hardness of this problem, prior work considers heuristics, bicriteria, or fixed parameter tractable algorithms to solve this problem. In this work, we introduce a new relaxed solution to WLRA which outputs a matrix that is not necessarily low rank, but can be stored using very few parameters and gives provable approximation guarantees when the weight matrix has low rank. Our central idea is to use the weight matrix itself to reweight a low rank solution, which gives an extremely simple algorithm with remarkable empirical performance in applications to model compression and on synthetic datasets. Our algorithm also gives nearly optimal communication complexity bounds for a natural distributed problem associated with this problem, for which we show matching communication lower bounds. Together, our communication complexity bounds show that the rank of the weight matrix provably parameterizes the communication complexity of WLRA. We also obtain the first relative error guarantees for feature selection with a weighted objective.</description>

      <title>Coresets for Multiple $\ell_p$ Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A coreset of a dataset with $n$ examples and $d$ features is a weighted subset of examples that is sufficient for solving downstream data analytic tasks. Nearly optimal constructions of coresets for least squares and $\ell_p$ linear regression with a single response are known in prior work. However, for multiple $\ell_p$ regression where there can be $m$ responses, there are no known constructions with size sublinear in $m$. In this work, we construct coresets of size $\tilde O(\varepsilon^{-2}d)$ for $p&lt;2$ and $\tilde O(\varepsilon^{-p}d^{p/2})$ for $p&gt;2$ independently of $m$ (i.e., dimension-free) that approximate the multiple $\ell_p$ regression objective at every point in the domain up to $(1\pm\varepsilon)$ relative error. If we only need to preserve the minimizer subject to a subspace constraint, we improve these bounds by an $\varepsilon$ factor for all $p&gt;1$. All of our bounds are nearly tight.
  We give two application of our results. First, we settle the number of uniform samples needed to approximate $\ell_p$ Euclidean power means up to a $(1+\varepsilon)$ factor, showing that $\tilde\Theta(\varepsilon^{-2})$ samples for $p = 1$, $\tilde\Theta(\varepsilon^{-1})$ samples for $1 &lt; p &lt; 2$, and $\tilde\Theta(\varepsilon^{1-p})$ samples for $p&gt;2$ is tight, answering a question of Cohen-Addad, Saulpic, and Schwiegelshohn. Second, we show that for $1&lt;p&lt;2$, every matrix has a subset of $\tilde O(\varepsilon^{-1}k)$ rows which spans a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximately optimal $k$-dimensional subspace for $\ell_p$ subspace approximation, which is also nearly optimal.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learners for Partially-Identified Treatment Effects Across Multiple Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) from observational data is relevant for many applications such as personalized medicine. Here, we focus on the widespread setting where the observational data come from multiple environments, such as different hospitals, physicians, or countries. Furthermore, we allow for violations of standard causal assumptions, namely, overlap within the environments and unconfoundedness. To this end, we move away from point identification and focus on partial identification. Specifically, we show that current assumptions from the literature on multiple environments allow us to interpret the environment as an instrumental variable (IV). This allows us to adapt bounds from the IV literature for partial identification of CATE by leveraging treatment assignment mechanisms across environments. Then, we propose different model-agnostic learners (so-called meta-learners) to estimate the bounds that can be used in combination with arbitrary machine learning models. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our meta-learners across various experiments using both simulated and real-world data. Finally, we discuss the applicability of our meta-learners to partial identification in instrumental variable settings, such as randomized controlled trials with non-compliance.</description>

Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo methods have become popular in statistics as versatile techniques to sample from complicated probability distributions. In this work, we propose a method to parameterize and train transition kernels of Markov chains to achieve efficient sampling and good mixing. This training procedure minimizes the total variation distance between the stationary distribution of the chain and the empirical distribution of the data. Our approach leverages involutive Metropolis-Hastings kernels constructed from reversible neural networks that ensure detailed balance by construction. We find that reversibility also implies $C_2$-equivariance of the discriminator function which can be used to restrict its function space.</description>

      <title>Guiding a Diffusion Model with a Bad Version of Itself</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary axes of interest in image-generating diffusion models are image quality, the amount of variation in the results, and how well the results align with a given condition, e.g., a class label or a text prompt. The popular classifier-free guidance approach uses an unconditional model to guide a conditional model, leading to simultaneously better prompt alignment and higher-quality images at the cost of reduced variation. These effects seem inherently entangled, and thus hard to control. We make the surprising observation that it is possible to obtain disentangled control over image quality without compromising the amount of variation by guiding generation using a smaller, less-trained version of the model itself rather than an unconditional model. This leads to significant improvements in ImageNet generation, setting record FIDs of 1.01 for 64x64 and 1.25 for 512x512, using publicly available networks. Furthermore, the method is also applicable to unconditional diffusion models, drastically improving their quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models can solve tasks that were not present in the training set. This capability is believed to be due to in-context learning and skill composition. In this work, we study the emergence of in-context learning and skill composition in a collection of modular arithmetic tasks. Specifically, we consider a finite collection of linear modular functions $z = a \, x + b \, y \;\mathrm{mod}\; p$ labeled by the vector $(a, b) \in \mathbb{Z}_p^2$. We use some of these tasks for pre-training and the rest for out-of-distribution testing. We empirically show that a GPT-style transformer exhibits a transition from in-distribution to out-of-distribution generalization as the number of pre-training tasks increases. We find that the smallest model capable of out-of-distribution generalization requires two transformer blocks, while for deeper models, the out-of-distribution generalization phase is \emph{transient}, necessitating early stopping. Finally, we perform an interpretability study of the pre-trained models, revealing the highly structured representations in both phases; and discuss the learnt algorithm.</description>

Abstract: The identifiability of latent variable models has received increasing attention due to its relevance in interpretability and out-of-distribution generalisation. In this work, we study the identifiability of Switching Dynamical Systems, taking an initial step toward extending identifiability analysis to sequential latent variable models. We first prove the identifiability of Markov Switching Models, which commonly serve as the prior distribution for the continuous latent variables in Switching Dynamical Systems. We present identification conditions for first-order Markov dependency structures, whose transition distribution is parametrised via non-linear Gaussians. We then establish the identifiability of the latent variables and non-linear mappings in Switching Dynamical Systems up to affine transformations, by leveraging identifiability analysis techniques from identifiable deep latent variable models. We finally develop estimation algorithms for identifiable Switching Dynamical Systems. Throughout empirical studies, we demonstrate the practicality of identifiable Switching Dynamical Systems for segmenting high-dimensional time series such as videos, and showcase the use of identifiable Markov Switching Models for regime-dependent causal discovery in climate data.</description>

      <title>More PAC-Bayes bounds: From bounded losses, to losses with general tail behaviors, to anytime validity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12214v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present new high-probability PAC-Bayes bounds for different types of losses. Firstly, for losses with a bounded range, we recover a strengthened version of Catoni's bound that holds uniformly for all parameter values. This leads to new fast-rate and mixed-rate bounds that are interpretable and tighter than previous bounds in the literature. In particular, the fast-rate bound is equivalent to the Seeger--Langford bound. Secondly, for losses with more general tail behaviors, we introduce two new parameter-free bounds: a PAC-Bayes Chernoff analogue when the loss' cumulative generating function is bounded, and a bound when the loss' second moment is bounded. These two bounds are obtained using a new technique based on a discretization of the space of possible events for the ``in probability'' parameter optimization problem. This technique is both simpler and more general than previous approaches optimizing over a grid on the parameters' space. Finally, using a simple technique that is applicable to any existing bound, we extend all previous results to anytime-valid bounds.</description>

      <title>VITS : Variational Inference Thomson Sampling for contextual bandits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and analyze a variant of the Thompson sampling (TS) algorithm for contextual bandits. At each round, traditional TS requires samples from the current posterior distribution, which is usually intractable. To circumvent this issue, approximate inference techniques can be used and provide samples with distribution close to the posteriors. However, current approximate techniques yield to either poor estimation (Laplace approximation) or can be computationally expensive (MCMC methods, Ensemble sampling...). In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, Varational Inference Thompson sampling VITS, based on Gaussian Variational Inference. This scheme provides powerful posterior approximations which are easy to sample from, and is computationally efficient, making it an ideal choice for TS. In addition, we show that VITS achieves a sub-linear regret bound of the same order in the dimension and number of round as traditional TS for linear contextual bandit. Finally, we demonstrate experimentally the effectiveness of VITS on both synthetic and real world datasets.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of best-arm identification with fixed budget in stochastic multi-armed bandits with Bernoulli rewards. For the problem with two arms, also known as the A/B testing problem, we prove that there is no algorithm that (i) performs as well as the algorithm sampling each arm equally (referred to as the {\it uniform sampling} algorithm) in all instances, and that (ii) strictly outperforms uniform sampling on at least one instance. In short, there is no algorithm better than the uniform sampling algorithm. To establish this result, we first introduce the natural class of {\it consistent} and {\it stable} algorithms, and show that any algorithm that performs as well as the uniform sampling algorithm in all instances belongs to this class. The proof then proceeds by deriving a lower bound on the error rate satisfied by any consistent and stable algorithm, and by showing that the uniform sampling algorithm matches this lower bound. Our results provide a solution to the two open problems presented in \citep{qin2022open}. For the general problem with more than two arms, we provide a first set of results. We characterize the asymptotic error rate of the celebrated Successive Rejects (SR) algorithm \citep{audibert2010best} and show that, surprisingly, the uniform sampling algorithm outperforms the SR algorithm in some instances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05436v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data distillation and coresets have emerged as popular approaches to generate a smaller representative set of samples for downstream learning tasks to handle large-scale datasets. At the same time, machine learning is being increasingly applied to decision-making processes at a societal level, making it imperative for modelers to address inherent biases towards subgroups present in the data. While current approaches focus on creating fair synthetic representative samples by optimizing local properties relative to the original samples, their impact on downstream learning processes has yet to be explored. In this work, we present fair Wasserstein coresets (FWC), a novel coreset approach which generates fair synthetic representative samples along with sample-level weights to be used in downstream learning tasks. FWC uses an efficient majority minimization algorithm to minimize the Wasserstein distance between the original dataset and the weighted synthetic samples while enforcing demographic parity. We show that an unconstrained version of FWC is equivalent to Lloyd's algorithm for k-medians and k-means clustering. Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real datasets show that FWC: (i) achieves a competitive fairness-utility tradeoff in downstream models compared to existing approaches, (ii) improves downstream fairness when added to the existing training data and (iii) can be used to reduce biases in predictions from large language models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the task of learning individual-specific intensities of counting processes from a set of static variables and irregularly sampled time series. We introduce a novel modelization approach in which the intensity is the solution to a controlled differential equation. We first design a neural estimator by building on neural controlled differential equations. In a second time, we show that our model can be linearized in the signature space under sufficient regularity conditions, yielding a signature-based estimator which we call CoxSig. We provide theoretical learning guarantees for both estimators, before showcasing the performance of our models on a vast array of simulated and real-world datasets from finance, predictive maintenance and food supply chain management.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of feature learning in two-layer networks after one gradient-step</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we investigate the problem of how two-layer neural networks learn features from data, and improve over the kernel regime, after being trained with a single gradient descent step. Leveraging the insight from (Ba et al., 2022), we model the trained network by a spiked Random Features (sRF) model. Further building on recent progress on Gaussian universality (Dandi et al., 2023), we provide an exact asymptotic description of the generalization error of the sRF in the high-dimensional limit where the number of samples, the width, and the input dimension grow at a proportional rate. The resulting characterization for sRFs also captures closely the learning curves of the original network model. This enables us to understand how adapting to the data is crucial for the network to efficiently learn non-linear functions in the direction of the gradient -- where at initialization it can only express linear functions in this regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07131v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the task of constructing confidence intervals with differential privacy. We propose two private variants of the non-parametric bootstrap, which privately compute the median of the results of multiple "little" bootstraps run on partitions of the data and give asymptotic bounds on the coverage error of the resulting confidence intervals. For a fixed differential privacy parameter $\epsilon$, our methods enjoy the same error rates as that of the non-private bootstrap to within logarithmic factors in the sample size $n$. We empirically validate the performance of our methods for mean estimation, median estimation, and logistic regression with both real and synthetic data. Our methods achieve similar coverage accuracy to existing methods (and non-private baselines) while providing notably shorter ($\gtrsim 10$ times) confidence intervals than previous approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new procedure named PASOA, for Bayesian experimental design, that performs sequential design optimization by simultaneously providing accurate estimates of successive posterior distributions for parameter inference. The sequential design process is carried out via a contrastive estimation principle, using stochastic optimization and Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers to maximise the Expected Information Gain (EIG). As larger information gains are obtained for larger distances between successive posterior distributions, this EIG objective may worsen classical SMC performance. To handle this issue, tempering is proposed to have both a large information gain and an accurate SMC sampling, that we show is crucial for performance. This novel combination of stochastic optimization and tempered SMC allows to jointly handle design optimization and parameter inference. We provide a proof that the obtained optimal design estimators benefit from some consistency property. Numerical experiments confirm the potential of the approach, which outperforms other recent existing procedures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distribution shifts are ubiquitous in real-world machine learning applications, posing a challenge to the generalization of models trained on one data distribution to another. We focus on scenarios where data distributions vary across multiple segments of the entire population and only make local assumptions about the differences between training and test (deployment) distributions within each segment. We propose a two-stage multiply robust estimation method to improve model performance on each individual segment for tabular data analysis. The method involves fitting a linear combination of the based models, learned using clusters of training data from multiple segments, followed by a refinement step for each segment. Our method is designed to be implemented with commonly used off-the-shelf machine learning models. We establish theoretical guarantees on the generalization bound of the method on the test risk. With extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method substantially improves over existing alternatives in prediction accuracy and robustness on both regression and classification tasks. We also assess its effectiveness on a user city prediction dataset from Meta.</description>

      <title>Iterated INLA for State and Parameter Estimation in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) methods use priors arising from differential equations to robustly interpolate and extrapolate data. Popular techniques such as ensemble methods that handle high-dimensional, nonlinear PDE priors focus mostly on state estimation, however can have difficulty learning the parameters accurately. On the other hand, machine learning based approaches can naturally learn the state and parameters, but their applicability can be limited, or produce uncertainties that are hard to interpret. Inspired by the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) method in spatial statistics, we propose an alternative approach to DA based on iteratively linearising the dynamical model. This produces a Gaussian Markov random field at each iteration, enabling one to use INLA to infer the state and parameters. Our approach can be used for arbitrary nonlinear systems, while retaining interpretability, and is furthermore demonstrated to outperform existing methods on the DA task. By providing a more nuanced approach to handling nonlinear PDE priors, our methodology offers improved accuracy and robustness in predictions, especially where data sparsity is prevalent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of efficiently computing the derivative of the fixed-point of a parametric nondifferentiable contraction map. This problem has wide applications in machine learning, including hyperparameter optimization, meta-learning and data poisoning attacks. We analyze two popular approaches: iterative differentiation (ITD) and approximate implicit differentiation (AID). A key challenge behind the nonsmooth setting is that the chain rule does not hold anymore. We build upon the work by Bolte et al. (2022), who prove linear convergence of nonsmooth ITD under a piecewise Lipschitz smooth assumption. In the deterministic case, we provide a linear rate for AID and an improved linear rate for ITD which closely match the ones for the smooth setting. We further introduce NSID, a new stochastic method to compute the implicit derivative when the contraction map is defined as the composition of an outer map and an inner map which is accessible only through a stochastic unbiased estimator. We establish rates for the convergence of NSID, encompassing the best available rates in the smooth setting. We also present illustrative experiments confirming our analysis.</description>

      <title>Sliding down the stairs: how correlated latent variables accelerate learning with neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks extract features from data using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In particular, higher-order input cumulants (HOCs) are crucial for their performance. However, extracting information from the $p$th cumulant of $d$-dimensional inputs is computationally hard: the number of samples required to recover a single direction from an order-$p$ tensor (tensor PCA) using online SGD grows as $d^{p-1}$, which is prohibitive for high-dimensional inputs. This result raises the question of how neural networks extract relevant directions from the HOCs of their inputs efficiently. Here, we show that correlations between latent variables along the directions encoded in different input cumulants speed up learning from higher-order correlations. We show this effect analytically by deriving nearly sharp thresholds for the number of samples required by a single neuron to weakly-recover these directions using online SGD from a random start in high dimensions. Our analytical results are confirmed in simulations of two-layer neural networks and unveil a new mechanism for hierarchical learning in neural networks.</description>

      <title>Triadic-OCD: Asynchronous Online Change Detection with Provable Robustness, Optimality, and Convergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The primary goal of online change detection (OCD) is to promptly identify changes in the data stream. OCD problem find a wide variety of applications in diverse areas, e.g., security detection in smart grids and intrusion detection in communication networks. Prior research usually assumes precise knowledge of the system parameters. Nevertheless, this presumption often proves unattainable in practical scenarios due to factors such as estimation errors, system updates, etc. This paper aims to take the first attempt to develop a triadic-OCD framework with certifiable robustness, provable optimality, and guaranteed convergence. In addition, the proposed triadic-OCD algorithm can be realized in a fully asynchronous distributed manner, easing the necessity of transmitting the data to a single server. This asynchronous mechanism could also mitigate the straggler issue that faced by traditional synchronous algorithm. Moreover, the non-asymptotic convergence property of Triadic-OCD is theoretically analyzed, and its iteration complexity to achieve an $\epsilon$-optimal point is derived. Extensive experiments have been conducted to elucidate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Nearly Minimax Optimal Regret for Multinomial Logistic Bandit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the contextual multinomial logit (MNL) bandit problem in which a learning agent sequentially selects an assortment based on contextual information, and user feedback follows an MNL choice model. There has been a significant discrepancy between lower and upper regret bounds, particularly regarding the feature dimension $d$ and the maximum assortment size $K$. Additionally, the variation in reward structures between these bounds complicates the quest for optimality. Under uniform rewards, where all items have the same expected reward, we establish a regret lower bound of $\Omega(d\sqrt{\smash[b]{T/K}})$ and propose a constant-time algorithm, OFU-MNL+, that achieves a matching upper bound of $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{\smash[b]{T/K}})$. Under non-uniform rewards, we prove a lower bound of $\Omega(d\sqrt{T})$ and an upper bound of $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{T})$, also achievable by OFU-MNL+. Our empirical studies support these theoretical findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in the contextual MNL bandit literature to prove minimax optimality -- for either uniform or non-uniform reward setting -- and to propose a computationally efficient algorithm that achieves this optimality up to logarithmic factors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a theoretical and computational investigation of the Gamma-Maximin method with soft revision, which was recently proposed as a robust criterion for pseudo-label selection (PLS) in semi-supervised learning. Opposed to traditional methods for PLS we use credal sets of priors ("generalized Bayes") to represent the epistemic modeling uncertainty. These latter are then updated by the Gamma-Maximin method with soft revision. We eventually select pseudo-labeled data that are most likely in light of the least favorable distribution from the so updated credal set. We formalize the task of finding optimal pseudo-labeled data w.r.t. the Gamma-Maximin method with soft revision as an optimization problem. A concrete implementation for the class of logistic models then allows us to compare the predictive power of the method with competing approaches. It is observed that the Gamma-Maximin method with soft revision can achieve very promising results, especially when the proportion of labeled data is low.</description>

      <title>A New Analysis of Differential Privacy's Generalization Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03577</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.03577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a new proof of the "transfer theorem" underlying adaptive data analysis: that any mechanism for answering adaptively chosen statistical queries that is differentially private and sample-accurate is also accurate out-of-sample. Our new proof is elementary and gives structural insights that we expect will be useful elsewhere. We show: 1) that differential privacy ensures that the expectation of any query on the posterior distribution on datasets induced by the transcript of the interaction is close to its true value on the data distribution, and 2) sample accuracy on its own ensures that any query answer produced by the mechanism is close to its posterior expectation with high probability. This second claim follows from a thought experiment in which we imagine that the dataset is resampled from the posterior distribution after the mechanism has committed to its answers. The transfer theorem then follows by summing these two bounds, and in particular, avoids the "monitor argument" used to derive high probability bounds in prior work. An upshot of our new proof technique is that the concrete bounds we obtain are substantially better than the best previously known bounds, even though the improvements are in the constants, rather than the asymptotics (which are known to be tight). As we show, our new bounds outperform the naive "sample-splitting" baseline at dramatically smaller dataset sizes compared to the previous state of the art, bringing techniques from this literature closer to practicality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.14439v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although deep learning models have taken on commercial and political relevance, key aspects of their training and operation remain poorly understood. This has sparked interest in science of deep learning projects, many of which require large amounts of time, money, and electricity. But how much of this research really needs to occur at scale? In this paper, we introduce MNIST-1D: a minimalist, procedurally generated, low-memory, and low-compute alternative to classic deep learning benchmarks. Although the dimensionality of MNIST-1D is only 40 and its default training set size only 4000, MNIST-1D can be used to study inductive biases of different deep architectures, find lottery tickets, observe deep double descent, metalearn an activation function, and demonstrate guillotine regularization in self-supervised learning. All these experiments can be conducted on a GPU or often even on a CPU within minutes, allowing for fast prototyping, educational use cases, and cutting-edge research on a low budget.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.04419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Privacy-preserving data analysis has become more prevalent in recent years. In this study, we propose a distributed group differentially private Majority Vote mechanism, for the sign selection problem in a distributed setup. To achieve this, we apply the iterative peeling to the stability function and use the exponential mechanism to recover the signs. For enhanced applicability, we study the private sign selection for mean estimation and linear regression problems, in distributed systems. Our method recovers the support and signs with the optimal signal-to-noise ratio as in the non-private scenario, which is better than contemporary works of private variable selections. Moreover, the sign selection consistency is justified by theoretical guarantees. Simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a method called graph fusion embedding, designed for multi-graph embedding with shared vertex sets. Under the framework of supervised learning, our method exhibits a remarkable and highly desirable synergistic effect: for sufficiently large vertex size, the accuracy of vertex classification consistently benefits from the incorporation of additional graphs. We establish the mathematical foundation for the method, including the asymptotic convergence of the embedding, a sufficient condition for asymptotic optimal classification, and the proof of the synergistic effect for vertex classification. Our comprehensive simulations and real data experiments provide compelling evidence supporting the effectiveness of our proposed method, showcasing the pronounced synergistic effect for multiple graphs from disparate sources.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous graph trend filtering via a l2,0 cardinality penalty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05223v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study estimation of piecewise smooth signals over a graph. We propose a $\ell_{2,0}$-norm penalized Graph Trend Filtering (GTF) model to estimate piecewise smooth graph signals that exhibit inhomogeneous levels of smoothness across the nodes. We prove that the proposed GTF model is simultaneously a k-means clustering on the signal over the nodes and a minimum graph cut on the edges of the graph, where the clustering and the cut share the same assignment matrix. We propose two methods to solve the proposed GTF model: a spectral decomposition method and a method based on simulated annealing. In the experiment on synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that the proposed GTF model has a better performances compared with existing approaches on the tasks of denoising, support recovery and semi-supervised classification. We also show that the proposed GTF model can be solved more efficiently than existing models for the dataset with a large edge set.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Oversmoothing in Attention-Based Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16102v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Oversmoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) refers to the phenomenon where increasing network depth leads to homogeneous node representations. While previous work has established that Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) exponentially lose expressive power, it remains controversial whether the graph attention mechanism can mitigate oversmoothing. In this work, we provide a definitive answer to this question through a rigorous mathematical analysis, by viewing attention-based GNNs as nonlinear time-varying dynamical systems and incorporating tools and techniques from the theory of products of inhomogeneous matrices and the joint spectral radius. We establish that, contrary to popular belief, the graph attention mechanism cannot prevent oversmoothing and loses expressive power exponentially. The proposed framework extends the existing results on oversmoothing for symmetric GCNs to a significantly broader class of GNN models, including random walk GCNs, Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and (graph) transformers. In particular, our analysis accounts for asymmetric, state-dependent and time-varying aggregation operators and a wide range of common nonlinear activation functions, such as ReLU, LeakyReLU, GELU and SiLU.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feedback Alignment (FA) methods are biologically inspired local learning rules for training neural networks with reduced communication between layers. While FA has potential applications in distributed and privacy-aware ML, limitations in multi-class classification and lack of theoretical understanding of the alignment mechanism have constrained its impact. This study introduces a unified framework elucidating the operational principles behind alignment in FA. Our key contributions include: (1) a novel conservation law linking changes in synaptic weights to implicit regularization that maintains alignment with the gradient, with support from experiments, (2) sufficient conditions for convergence based on the concept of alignment dominance, and (3) empirical analysis showing better alignment can enhance FA performance on complex multi-class tasks. Overall, these theoretical and practical advancements improve interpretability of bio-plausible learning rules and provide groundwork for developing enhanced FA algorithms.</description>

      <title>Correcting Underrepresentation and Intersectional Bias for Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11112v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning from data corrupted by underrepresentation bias, where positive examples are filtered from the data at different, unknown rates for a fixed number of sensitive groups. We show that with a small amount of unbiased data, we can efficiently estimate the group-wise drop-out rates, even in settings where intersectional group membership makes learning each intersectional rate computationally infeasible. Using these estimates, we construct a reweighting scheme that allows us to approximate the loss of any hypothesis on the true distribution, even if we only observe the empirical error on a biased sample. From this, we present an algorithm encapsulating this learning and reweighting process along with a thorough empirical investigation. Finally, we define a bespoke notion of PAC learnability for the underrepresentation and intersectional bias setting and show that our algorithm permits efficient learning for model classes of finite VC dimension.</description>

      <title>MALIBO: Meta-learning for Likelihood-free Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular method to optimize costly black-box functions. While traditional BO optimizes each new target task from scratch, meta-learning has emerged as a way to leverage knowledge from related tasks to optimize new tasks faster. However, existing meta-learning BO methods rely on surrogate models that suffer from scalability issues and are sensitive to observations with different scales and noise types across tasks. Moreover, they often overlook the uncertainty associated with task similarity. This leads to unreliable task adaptation when only limited observations are obtained or when the new tasks differ significantly from the related tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a novel meta-learning BO approach that bypasses the surrogate model and directly learns the utility of queries across tasks. Our method explicitly models task uncertainty and includes an auxiliary model to enable robust adaptation to new tasks. Extensive experiments show that our method demonstrates strong anytime performance and outperforms state-of-the-art meta-learning BO methods in various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Towards Causal Foundation Model: on Duality between Causal Inference and Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00809v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models have brought changes to the landscape of machine learning, demonstrating sparks of human-level intelligence across a diverse array of tasks. However, a gap persists in complex tasks such as causal inference, primarily due to challenges associated with intricate reasoning steps and high numerical precision requirements. In this work, we take a first step towards building causally-aware foundation models for treatment effect estimations. We propose a novel, theoretically justified method called Causal Inference with Attention (CInA), which utilizes multiple unlabeled datasets to perform self-supervised causal learning, and subsequently enables zero-shot causal inference on unseen tasks with new data. This is based on our theoretical results that demonstrate the primal-dual connection between optimal covariate balancing and self-attention, facilitating zero-shot causal inference through the final layer of a trained transformer-type architecture. We demonstrate empirically that CInA effectively generalizes to out-of-distribution datasets and various real-world datasets, matching or even surpassing traditional per-dataset methodologies. These results provide compelling evidence that our method has the potential to serve as a stepping stone for the development of causal foundation models.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Attacks on Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study reward poisoning attacks on Combinatorial Multi-armed Bandits (CMAB). We first provide a sufficient and necessary condition for the attackability of CMAB, a notion to capture the vulnerability and robustness of CMAB. The attackability condition depends on the intrinsic properties of the corresponding CMAB instance such as the reward distributions of super arms and outcome distributions of base arms. Additionally, we devise an attack algorithm for attackable CMAB instances. Contrary to prior understanding of multi-armed bandits, our work reveals a surprising fact that the attackability of a specific CMAB instance also depends on whether the bandit instance is known or unknown to the adversary. This finding indicates that adversarial attacks on CMAB are difficult in practice and a general attack strategy for any CMAB instance does not exist since the environment is mostly unknown to the adversary. We validate our theoretical findings via extensive experiments on real-world CMAB applications including probabilistic maximum covering problem, online minimum spanning tree, cascading bandits for online ranking, and online shortest path.</description>

      <title>Towards Practical Non-Adversarial Distribution Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distribution matching can be used to learn invariant representations with applications in fairness and robustness. Most prior works resort to adversarial matching methods but the resulting minimax problems are unstable and challenging to optimize. Non-adversarial likelihood-based approaches either require model invertibility, impose constraints on the latent prior, or lack a generic framework for distribution matching. To overcome these limitations, we propose a non-adversarial VAE-based matching method that can be applied to any model pipeline. We develop a set of alignment upper bounds for distribution matching (including a noisy bound) that have VAE-like objectives but with a different perspective. We carefully compare our method to prior VAE-based matching approaches both theoretically and empirically. Finally, we demonstrate that our novel matching losses can replace adversarial losses in standard invariant representation learning pipelines without modifying the original architectures -- thereby significantly broadening the applicability of non-adversarial matching methods.</description>

      <title>Posterior Sampling-Based Bayesian Optimization with Tighter Bayesian Regret Bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03760v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among various acquisition functions (AFs) in Bayesian optimization (BO), Gaussian process upper confidence bound (GP-UCB) and Thompson sampling (TS) are well-known options with established theoretical properties regarding Bayesian cumulative regret (BCR). Recently, it has been shown that a randomized variant of GP-UCB achieves a tighter BCR bound compared with GP-UCB, which we call the tighter BCR bound for brevity. Inspired by this study, this paper first shows that TS achieves the tighter BCR bound. On the other hand, GP-UCB and TS often practically suffer from manual hyperparameter tuning and over-exploration issues, respectively. Therefore, we analyze yet another AF called a probability of improvement from the maximum of a sample path (PIMS). We show that PIMS achieves the tighter BCR bound and avoids the hyperparameter tuning, unlike GP-UCB. Furthermore, we demonstrate a wide range of experiments, focusing on the effectiveness of PIMS that mitigates the practical issues of GP-UCB and TS.</description>

      <title>Quantum Inception Score</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12163v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the great success of classical generative models in machine learning, enthusiastic exploration of their quantum version has recently started. To depart on this journey, it is important to develop a relevant metric to evaluate the quality of quantum generative models; in the classical case, one such example is the (classical) inception score (cIS). In this paper, as a natural extension of cIS, we propose the quantum inception score (qIS) for quantum generators. Importantly, qIS relates the quality to the Holevo information of the quantum channel that classifies a given dataset. In this context, we show several properties of qIS. First, qIS is greater than or equal to the corresponding cIS, which is defined through projection measurements on the system output. Second, the difference between qIS and cIS arises from the presence of quantum coherence, as characterized by the resource theory of asymmetry. Third, when a set of entangled generators is prepared, there exists a classifying process leading to the further enhancement of qIS. Fourth, we harness the quantum fluctuation theorem to characterize the physical limitation of qIS. Finally, we apply qIS to assess the quality of the one-dimensional spin chain model as a quantum generative model, with the quantum convolutional neural network as a quantum classifier, for the phase classification problem in the quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Understanding Heterophily for Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphs with heterophily have been regarded as challenging scenarios for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where nodes are connected with dissimilar neighbors through various patterns. In this paper, we present theoretical understandings of the impacts of different heterophily patterns for GNNs by incorporating the graph convolution (GC) operations into fully connected networks via the proposed Heterophilous Stochastic Block Models (HSBM), a general random graph model that can accommodate diverse heterophily patterns. Firstly, we show that by applying a GC operation, the separability gains are determined by two factors, i.e., the Euclidean distance of the neighborhood distributions and $\sqrt{\mathbb{E}\left[\operatorname{deg}\right]}$, where $\mathbb{E}\left[\operatorname{deg}\right]$ is the averaged node degree. It reveals that the impact of heterophily on classification needs to be evaluated alongside the averaged node degree. Secondly, we show that the topological noise has a detrimental impact on separability, which is equivalent to degrading $\mathbb{E}\left[\operatorname{deg}\right]$. Finally, when applying multiple GC operations, we show that the separability gains are determined by the normalized distance of the $l$-powered neighborhood distributions. It indicates that the nodes still possess separability as $l$ goes to infinity in a wide range of regimes. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data verify the effectiveness of our theory.</description>

      <title>Partial-Label Learning with a Reject Option</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00592v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In real-world applications, one often encounters ambiguously labeled data, where different annotators assign conflicting class labels. Partial-label learning allows training classifiers in this weakly supervised setting, where state-of-the-art methods already show good predictive performance. However, even the best algorithms give incorrect predictions, which can have severe consequences when they impact actions or decisions. We propose a novel risk-consistent partial-label learning algorithm with a reject option, that is, the algorithm can reject unsure predictions. Extensive experiments on artificial and real-world datasets show that our method provides the best trade-off between the number and accuracy of non-rejected predictions when compared to our competitors, which use confidence thresholds for rejecting unsure predictions instead. When evaluated without the reject option, our nearest neighbor-based approach also achieves competitive prediction performance.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Model behind Self-Supervised Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In self-supervised learning (SSL), representations are learned via an auxiliary task without annotated labels. A common task is to classify augmentations or different modalities of the data, which share semantic content (e.g. an object in an image) but differ in style (e.g. the object's location). Many approaches to self-supervised learning have been proposed, e.g. SimCLR, CLIP, and VicREG, which have recently gained much attention for their representations achieving downstream performance comparable to supervised learning. However, a theoretical understanding of self-supervised methods eludes. Addressing this, we present a generative latent variable model for self-supervised learning and show that several families of discriminative SSL, including contrastive methods, induce a comparable distribution over representations, providing a unifying theoretical framework for these methods. The proposed model also justifies connections drawn to mutual information and the use of a "projection head". Learning representations by fitting the model generatively (termed SimVAE) improves performance over discriminative and other VAE-based methods on simple image benchmarks and significantly narrows the gap between generative and discriminative representation learning in more complex settings. Importantly, as our analysis predicts, SimVAE outperforms self-supervised learning where style information is required, taking an important step toward understanding self-supervised methods and achieving task-agnostic representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores challenges in training Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), emphasizing the role of the loss landscape in the training process. We examine difficulties in minimizing the PINN loss function, particularly due to ill-conditioning caused by differential operators in the residual term. We compare gradient-based optimizers Adam, L-BFGS, and their combination Adam+L-BFGS, showing the superiority of Adam+L-BFGS, and introduce a novel second-order optimizer, NysNewton-CG (NNCG), which significantly improves PINN performance. Theoretically, our work elucidates the connection between ill-conditioned differential operators and ill-conditioning in the PINN loss and shows the benefits of combining first- and second-order optimization methods. Our work presents valuable insights and more powerful optimization strategies for training PINNs, which could improve the utility of PINNs for solving difficult partial differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02322v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Best subset selection is considered the `gold standard' for many sparse learning problems. A variety of optimization techniques have been proposed to attack this non-smooth non-convex problem. In this paper, we investigate the dual forms of a family of $\ell_0$-regularized problems. An efficient primal-dual algorithm is developed based on the primal and dual problem structures. By leveraging the dual range estimation along with the incremental strategy, our algorithm potentially reduces redundant computation and improves the solutions of best subset selection. Theoretical analysis and experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the efficiency and statistical properties of the proposed solutions.</description>

      <title>Timer: Generative Pre-trained Transformers Are Large Time Series Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has contributed remarkably to the advancement of time series analysis. Still, deep models can encounter performance bottlenecks in real-world data-scarce scenarios, which can be concealed due to the performance saturation with small models on current benchmarks. Meanwhile, large models have demonstrated great powers in these scenarios through large-scale pre-training. Continuous progress has been achieved with the emergence of large language models, exhibiting unprecedented abilities such as few-shot generalization, scalability, and task generality, which are however absent in small deep models. To change the status quo of training scenario-specific small models from scratch, this paper aims at the early development of large time series models (LTSM). During pre-training, we curate large-scale datasets with up to 1 billion time points, unify heterogeneous time series into single-series sequence (S3) format, and develop the GPT-style architecture toward LTSMs. To meet diverse application needs, we convert forecasting, imputation, and anomaly detection of time series into a unified generative task. The outcome of this study is a Time Series Transformer (Timer), which is generative pre-trained by next token prediction and adapted to various downstream tasks with promising capabilities as an LTSM.

      <title>Transductive Sample Complexities Are Compact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a compactness result holding broadly across supervised learning with a general class of loss functions: Any hypothesis class $H$ is learnable with transductive sample complexity $m$ precisely when all of its finite projections are learnable with sample complexity $m$. We prove that this exact form of compactness holds for realizable and agnostic learning with respect to any proper metric loss function (e.g., any norm on $\mathbb{R}^d$) and any continuous loss on a compact space (e.g., cross-entropy, squared loss). For realizable learning with improper metric losses, we show that exact compactness of sample complexity can fail, and provide matching upper and lower bounds of a factor of 2 on the extent to which such sample complexities can differ. We conjecture that larger gaps are possible for the agnostic case. Furthermore, invoking the equivalence between sample complexities in the PAC and transductive models (up to lower order factors, in the realizable case) permits us to directly port our results to the PAC model, revealing an almost-exact form of compactness holding broadly in PAC learning.</description>

      <title>The Role of Learning Algorithms in Collective Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06582v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective action in machine learning is the study of the control that a coordinated group can have over machine learning algorithms. While previous research has concentrated on assessing the impact of collectives against Bayes (sub-)optimal classifiers, this perspective is limited in that it does not account for the choice of learning algorithm. Since classifiers seldom behave like Bayes classifiers and are influenced by the choice of learning algorithms along with their inherent biases, in this work we initiate the study of how the choice of the learning algorithm plays a role in the success of a collective in practical settings. Specifically, we focus on distributionally robust optimization (DRO), popular for improving a worst group error, and on the ubiquitous stochastic gradient descent (SGD), due to its inductive bias for "simpler" functions. Our empirical results, supported by a theoretical foundation, show that the effective size and success of the collective are highly dependent on properties of the learning algorithm. This highlights the necessity of taking the learning algorithm into account when studying the impact of collective action in machine learning.</description>

      <title>A Unified Linear Programming Framework for Offline Reward Learning from Human Demonstrations and Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are pivotal methodologies in reward learning, which involve inferring and shaping the underlying reward function of sequential decision-making problems based on observed human demonstrations and feedback. Most prior work in reward learning has relied on prior knowledge or assumptions about decision or preference models, potentially leading to robustness issues. In response, this paper introduces a novel linear programming (LP) framework tailored for offline reward learning. Utilizing pre-collected trajectories without online exploration, this framework estimates a feasible reward set from the primal-dual optimality conditions of a suitably designed LP, and offers an optimality guarantee with provable sample efficiency. Our LP framework also enables aligning the reward functions with human feedback, such as pairwise trajectory comparison data, while maintaining computational tractability and sample efficiency. We demonstrate that our framework potentially achieves better performance compared to the conventional maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach through analytical examples and numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Private Edge Density Estimation for Random Graphs: Optimal, Efficient and Robust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give the first polynomial-time, differentially node-private, and robust algorithm for estimating the edge density of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs and their generalization, inhomogeneous random graphs. We further prove information-theoretical lower bounds, showing that the error rate of our algorithm is optimal up to logarithmic factors. Previous algorithms incur either exponential running time or suboptimal error rates.
  Two key ingredients of our algorithm are (1) a new sum-of-squares algorithm for robust edge density estimation, and (2) the reduction from privacy to robustness based on sum-of-squares exponential mechanisms due to Hopkins et al. (STOC 2023).</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Cycloid Trajectory of EM Iterations in Mixed Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the trajectory of iterations and the convergence rates of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR). The fundamental goal of MLR is to learn the regression models from unlabeled observations. The EM algorithm finds extensive applications in solving the mixture of linear regressions. Recent results have established the super-linear convergence of EM for 2MLR in the noiseless and high SNR settings under some assumptions and its global convergence rate with random initialization has been affirmed. However, the exponent of convergence has not been theoretically estimated and the geometric properties of the trajectory of EM iterations are not well-understood. In this paper, first, using Bessel functions we provide explicit closed-form expressions for the EM updates under all SNR regimes. Then, in the noiseless setting, we completely characterize the behavior of EM iterations by deriving a recurrence relation at the population level and notably show that all the iterations lie on a certain cycloid. Based on this new trajectory-based analysis, we exhibit the theoretical estimate for the exponent of super-linear convergence and further improve the statistical error bound at the finite-sample level. Our analysis provides a new framework for studying the behavior of EM for Mixed Linear Regression.</description>

      <title>Learning topological states from randomized measurements using variational tensor network tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning faithful representations of quantum states is crucial to fully characterizing the variety of many-body states created on quantum processors. While various tomographic methods such as classical shadow and MPS tomography have shown promise in characterizing a wide class of quantum states, they face unique limitations in detecting topologically ordered two-dimensional states. To address this problem, we implement and study a heuristic tomographic method that combines variational optimization on tensor networks with randomized measurement techniques. Using this approach, we demonstrate its ability to learn the ground state of the surface code Hamiltonian as well as an experimentally realizable quantum spin liquid state. In particular, we perform numerical experiments using MPS ans\"atze and systematically investigate the sample complexity required to achieve high fidelities for systems of sizes up to $48$ qubits. In addition, we provide theoretical insights into the scaling of our learning algorithm by analyzing the statistical properties of maximum likelihood estimation. Notably, our method is sample-efficient and experimentally friendly, only requiring snapshots of the quantum state measured randomly in the $X$ or $Z$ bases. Using this subset of measurements, our approach can effectively learn any real pure states represented by tensor networks, and we rigorously prove that random-$XZ$ measurements are tomographically complete for such states.</description>

      <title>Stein Random Feature Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In large-scale regression problems, random Fourier features (RFFs) have significantly enhanced the computational scalability and flexibility of Gaussian processes (GPs) by defining kernels through their spectral density, from which a finite set of Monte Carlo samples can be used to form an approximate low-rank GP. However, the efficacy of RFFs in kernel approximation and Bayesian kernel learning depends on the ability to tractably sample the kernel spectral measure and the quality of the generated samples. We introduce Stein random features (SRF), leveraging Stein variational gradient descent, which can be used to both generate high-quality RFF samples of known spectral densities as well as flexibly and efficiently approximate traditionally non-analytical spectral measure posteriors. SRFs require only the evaluation of log-probability gradients to perform both kernel approximation and Bayesian kernel learning that results in superior performance over traditional approaches. We empirically validate the effectiveness of SRFs by comparing them to baselines on kernel approximation and well-known GP regression problems.</description>
