      <title>A new convection scheme for GCMs of temperate sub-Neptunes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric characterisation of temperate sub-Neptunes is the new frontier of exoplanetary science with recent JWST observations of possible Hycean world K2-18b. Accurate modelling of atmospheric processes is essential to interpreting high-precision spectroscopic data given the wide range of possible conditions in the sub-Neptune regime, including on potentially habitable planets. Notably, convection is an important process which can operate in different modes across sub-Neptune conditions. Convection can act very differently in atmospheres with a high condensible mass fraction (non-dilute atmospheres) or with a lighter background gas, e.g. water convection in a H$_2$-rich atmosphere, and can be much weaker or even shut down entirely in the latter case. We present a new mass-flux scheme which can capture these variations and simulate convection over a wide range of parameter space for use in 3D general circulation models (GCMs). We validate our scheme for two representative cases, a terrestrial-like atmosphere and a mini-Neptune atmosphere. In the terrestrial case, considering TRAPPIST-1e with an Earth-like atmosphere, the model performs near-identically to Earth-tuned models in an Earth-like convection case. In the mini-Neptune case, considering the bulk properties of K2-18b and assuming a deep H$_2$-rich atmosphere, we demonstrate the capability of the scheme to reproduce non-condensing convection. We find convection occurring at pressures greater than 0.3 bar and the dynamical structure shows high-latitude prograde jets. Our convection scheme will aid in the 3D climate modelling of a wide range of exoplanet atmospheres, and enable further exploration of temperate sub-Neptune atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Vertical structure of an exoplanet's atmospheric jet stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-hot Jupiters, an extreme class of planets not found in our solar system, provide a unique window into atmospheric processes. The extreme temperature contrasts between their day- and night-sides pose a fundamental climate puzzle: how is energy distributed? To address this, we must observe the 3D structure of these atmospheres, particularly their vertical circulation patterns, which can serve as a testbed for advanced Global Circulation Models (GCM) [e.g. 1]. Here, we show a dramatic shift in atmospheric circulation in an ultra-hot Jupiter: a unilateral flow from the hot star-facing side to the cooler space-facing side of the planet sits below an equatorial super-rotational jet stream. By resolving the vertical structure of atmospheric dynamics, we move beyond integrated global snapshots of the atmosphere, enabling more accurate identification of flow patterns and allowing for a more nuanced comparison to models. Global circulation models based on first principles struggle to replicate the observed circulation pattern [3], underscoring a critical gap between theoretical understanding of atmospheric flows and observational evidence. This work serves as a testbed to develop more comprehensive models applicable beyond our Solar System as we prepare for the next generation of giant telescopes.</description>

      <title>Titanium chemistry of WASP-121 b with ESPRESSO in 4-UT mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transit spectroscopy usually relies on the integration of one or several transits to achieve the S/N necessary to resolve spectral features. Consequently, high-S/N observations of exoplanet atmospheres are essential for disentangling the complex chemistry and dynamics beyond global trends. In this study, we combined two partial 4-UT transits of the ultrahot Jupiter WASP-121 b, observed with the ESPRESSO at the VLT in order to revisit its titanium chemistry. Through cross-correlation analysis, we achieved detections of H I, Li I, Na I, K I, Mg I, Ca I, Ti I, V I, Cr I, Mn I, Fe I, Fe II, Co I, Ni I, Ba II, Sr I, and Sr II. Additionally, narrow-band spectroscopy allowed us to resolve strong single lines, resulting in significant detections of H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, H$\gamma$, Li I, Na I, K I, Mg I, Ca II, Sr I, Sr II, and Mn I. Our most notable finding is the high-significance detection of Ti I ($\sim$ 5$\sigma$ per spectrum, and $\sim$ 19$\sigma$ stacked in the planetary rest frame). Comparison with atmospheric models reveals that Ti I is indeed depleted compared to V I. We also resolve the planetary velocity traces of both Ti I and V I, with Ti I exhibiting a significant blueshift toward the end of the transit. This suggests that Ti I primarily originates from low-latitude regions within the super-rotating jet observed in WASP-121 b. Our observations suggest limited mixing between the equatorial jet and the mid-latitudes, in contrast with model predictions from GCMs. We also report the non-detection of TiO, which we attribute to inaccuracies in the line list that could hinder its detection, even if present. Thus, the final determination of the presence of TiO must await space-based observations. We conclude that the 4-UT mode of ESPRESSO is an excellent testbed for achieving high S/N on relatively faint targets, paving the way for future observations with the ELT.</description>

      <title>Electron-induced chemistry and sputtering of volatile species from amorphous and crystalline water ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron irradiation of water-rich ices plays a significant role in initiating the chemical and physical processes on the surface of airless icy bodies in radiation environments such as Europa and Enceladus, as well as on the Moon, comets, and asteroids interacting with the solar wind. The sputtering process by electrons and ions leads to chemical modification and outgassing of their icy surfaces and the subsequent formation of a tenuous atmosphere. Though electron-sputtering yields are known to be lower compared to ion-sputtering yields, one needs to also account for their differential fluxes. In our experiments, the electron-induced sputtering yields of all the gaseous species H2, O, OH, H2O, and O2 are investigated for electron energies lower than 2 keV in terms of partial pressure vs. time of irradiation. The effective averaged change in partial pressure of the desorbed species is converted to the number of sputtered atoms or molecules per second per cm2 from the ice, and then to the sputtering yields (number of species sputtered per electron). Our data agrees well with the previously reported data for the sputtering of O2 and H2O yield for the amorphous ice. We also find that crystalline ice shows significantly lower sputtering yields when compared to amorphous ice, in agreement with the observation of similar trends in the literature. Our work indicates that sputtering yields per keV of O, OH, O2, and H2O drop with increasing electron energy from 0.5 keV to 2 keV.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Constraints on the Vertical Structure of Jupiter's Polar Cyclones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jupiter's poles feature striking polygons of cyclones that drift westward over time-a motion governed by beta-drift. This study investigates how beta-drift and the resulting westward motion depend on the depth of these cyclones. Counterintuitively, shallower cyclones drift more slowly, a consequence of stronger vortex stretching. By employing a 2D quasi-geostrophic model of Jupiter's polar regions, we constrain the cyclones' deformation radius, a key parameter that serves as a proxy for their vertical extent, required to replicate the observed westward drift. We then explore possible vertical structures and the static stability of the poles by solving the eigenvalue problem that links the 2D model to a 3D framework, matching the constrained deformation radius. These findings provide a foundation for interpreting upcoming Juno microwave measurements of Jupiter's north pole, offering insights into the static stability and vertical structure of the polar cyclones. Thus, by leveraging long-term motion as a novel constraint on vertical dynamics, this work sets the stage for advancing our understanding of the formation and evolution of Jupiter's enigmatic polar cyclones.</description>

      <title>Preparing for the 2061 return of Halley's comet -- A rendezvous mission with an innovative imaging system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The return of Comet 1P/Halley will promote a wide interest for ground and space observations of a celestial body of outstanding scientific and cultural interest. In addition to remote observations, space will open the possibility of in situ science similarly to the passage of 1986. In this paper, we first discuss the scientific motivations for a rendezvous mission, capable to overcome the limitations of the flyby missions that took place at that time. In the second part, we describe an example of a rendezvous trajectory that can be carried out with existing power and propulsion technologies. The transfer is made possible by the gravitational assistance of a giant planet. The resulting mission will be capable to reach the comet beyond the distance of Saturn, when the sublimation of super-volatile species will be ongoing, and well before the onset of the sublimation of water (4 AU). After rendezvous, the spacecraft will accompany the comet for several years before, around and after perihelion (July 2061). Our concept mission does not foresee the implementation of solar panels. In this way, operations can occur even inside the dense dust coma at short distance from the nucleus. In the third part of the paper, an innovative imaging system is proposed, with a very large field of view (100{\deg}) capable to record on the same frame details on the surface and the surrounding space, in order to follow for several degrees the trajectories of chunks and clouds ejected by pits or fractures, crucial to the understanding of the cometary activity. A concerted effort is needed in the current decade to plan and approve a rendezvous mission to 1P. Indeed, the scenario here described requires launching before 2040, less than 15 years from now. Later launches imply a severe loss of scientific knowledge, because the spacecraft will not be able to reach the comet before the onset of water sublimation.</description>

      <title>OGLE-2014-BLG-1760: A Jupiter-Sun analogue residing in the Galactic Bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the analysis of OGLE-2014-BLG-1760, a planetary system in the galactic bulge. We combine Keck Adaptive Optics follow-up observations in $K$-band with re-reduced light curve data to confirm the source and lens star identifications and stellar types. The re-reduced MOA dataset had an important impact on the light curve model. We find the Einstein ring crossing time of the event to be $\sim$ 2.5 days shorter than previous fits, which increases the planetary mass-ratio and decreases the source angular size by a factor of 0.25. Our OSIRIS images obtained 6 years after the peak of the event show a source-lens separation of 54.20 $\pm$ 0.23 mas, which leads to a relative proper motion of $\mu_{\rm rel}$ = 9.14 $\pm$ 0.05 mas/yr, larger than the previous light curve-only models. Our analysis shows that the event consists of a Jupiter-mass planet of $M_{\rm p}$ = 0.931 $\pm$ 0.117 $M_{\rm Jup}$ orbiting a K-dwarf star of $M_*$ = 0.803 $\pm$ 0.097 $M_{\odot}$ with a $K$-magnitude of $K_{\rm L}$ = 18.30 $\pm$ 0.05, located in the galactic bulge or bar. We also attempt to constrain the source properties using the source angular size $\theta_*$ and $K$-magnitude. Our results favor the scenario of the source being a younger star in the galactic disk, behind the galactic center, but future multicolor observations are needed to constrain the source and thus the lens properties.</description>

      <title>Ionosphere of Ganymede: Galileo observations versus test particle simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we model the plasma environment of Ganymede by means of a collisionless test particle simulation. By coupling the outputs from a DSMC simulation of Ganymede's exosphere (i.e. number density profiles of neutral species such as $\mathrm{H}$, $\mathrm{H_2}$, $\mathrm{O}$, $\mathrm{HO}$, $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{O_2}$ for which we provide parametrisation) with those of a MagnetoHydroDynamic simulation of the interaction between Ganymede and the Jovian plasma (i.e. electric and magnetic fields), we perform a comparison between simulated ion plasma densities and ion energy spectra with those observed in-situ during 6 close flybys of Ganymede by the Galileo spacecraft. We find that not only our test particle simulation sometimes can well reproduce the in-situ ion number density measurement, but also the dominant ion species during these flybys are $\mathrm{H_2^+}$, $\mathrm{O_2^+}$, and occasionally $\mathrm{H_2O^+}$. Although the observed ion energy spectra cannot be reproduced exactly, the simulated ion energy spectra exhibit similar trends to those observed near the closest approach and near the magnetopause crossings but at lower energies. We show that the neutral exosphere plays an important role in supplying plasma to Ganymede's magnetised environment and that additional mechanisms may be at play to energise/accelerate newborn ions from the neutral exosphere.</description>

      <title>The past, present and future of observations of externally irradiated disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge of interest in the community studying the effect of ultraviolet radiation environment, predominantly set by OB stars, on protoplanetary disc evolution and planet formation. This is important because a significant fraction of planetary systems, potentially including our own, formed in close proximity to OB stars. This is a rapidly developing field, with a broad range of observations across many regions recently obtained or recently scheduled. In this paper, stimulated by a series of workshops on the topic, we take stock of the current and upcoming observations. We discuss how the community can build on this recent success with future observations to make progress in answering the big questions of the field, with the broad goal of disentangling how external photoevaporation contributes to shaping the observed (exo)planet population. Both existing and future instruments offer numerous opportunities to make progress towards this goal.</description>

      <title>Large-scale clustering of inertial particles in a rotating, stratified and inhomogeneous turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of various kinds of large-scale clustering of inertial particles in a rotating density stratified or inhomogeneous turbulent fluid flows. The large-scale particle clustering occurs in scales which are much larger than the integral scale of turbulence, and it is described in terms of the effective pumping velocity in a turbulent flux of particles. We show that for a fast rotating strongly anisotropic turbulence, the large-scale clustering occurs in the plane perpendicular to rotation axis in the direction of the fluid density stratification. We apply the theory of the large-scale particle clustering for explanation of the formation of planetesimals (progenitors of planets) in accretion protoplanetary discs. We determine the radial profiles of the radial and azimuthal components of the effective pumping velocity of particles which have two maxima corresponding to different regimes of the particle--fluid interactions: at the small radius it is the Stokes regime, while at the larger radius it is the Epstein regime. With the decrease the particle radius, the distance between the maxima increases. This implies that smaller-size particles are concentrated nearby the central body of the accretion disk, while larger-size particles are accumulated far from the central body. The dynamic time of the particle clustering is about $\tau_{\rm dyn} \sim 10^5$--$10^6$ years, while the turbulent diffusion time is about $10^7$ years, that is much larger than the characteristic formation time of large-scale particle clusters ($\sim \tau_{\rm dyn}$).</description>

      <title>A comprehensive survey of the GEO-belt using simultaneous four-colour observations with STING</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colour light curves of resident space objects (RSOs) encapsulate distinctive features that can offer insights into an object's structure and design, making them an invaluable tool for classification and characterisation. We present the results of the first large systematic colour survey of the GEO belt in which we obtain full-night multi-colour light curves for 112 active geostationary objects between April and May 2023. Colour light curve maps were created to compare and contrast the colours between different satellites and bus configurations. We find that satellites with BSS-702 and STAR-2 buses can be effectively distinguished from the colour measurements on these maps, but comparing the average colour of individual satellites within given solar equatorial phase angle ranges shows that it is difficult to distinguish between bus configurations based on colour alone. We also find tentative evidence to suggest that there is a relationship between colour and time spent on orbit for the Eurostar-3000 class satellites, which is unseen behaviour within other bus configuration classes. The satellites in our sample exhibit `redder' colours than the Sun, which is in agreement with previous findings. We found common light curve features such as symmetrical colour changes as well as unique regions of short timescale glinting which are `bluer' than other regimes within the colour light curves. If these features are indeed seasonal, this would be a powerful characterisation tool. We are able to detect and resolve features in the light curve of the LDPE-3A satellite related to manoeuvres being performed. Finally, we measured the solar panel offsets of 54 satellites in our sample and found variation in the type of colour response. The majority of which did not exhibit any colour change across the solar panel glints compared to them shifting towards 'redder' or 'bluer' colours.</description>

Abstract: Meta-instability is an irreversible precursor of earthquakes. To identify the meta-instability precursor of the Yangbi $M_S$ 6.4 earthquake ($99.87^{\circ}\mathrm{E}$, $25.67^{\circ}\mathrm{N}$)that occurred on May 21, 2021, we selected seismic data from the pre-earthquake period between 1 and 21 May. We then calculated the apparent wave velocity ratio and the apparent Poisson\text{'}s ratio within the region of $98.5^{\circ} \mathrm{E}-101^{\circ}\mathrm{E}$, $24.6^{\circ}\mathrm{N}-27.1^{\circ}\mathrm{N}$ and interpolated these values. Our findings revealed that the trends of the fitted straight lines at the maximum and minimum points of the gradient divergences of the apparent wave velocity ratio and apparent Poisson\text{'}s ratio fields are consistent with the source mechanism solution for Sections 1 and 2, respectively. Similarly, the trend of the fitted straight lines at the minimum and maximum points of their values is also consistent with the source mechanism solution for Sections 1 and 2. Positive gradient divergence values indicate energy released, whereas negative values suggest energy absorption. The observed stress state matches the experimentally demonstrated meta-instable state. We propose that this method can be a reference for identifying the meta-instability of strike-slip strong earthquakes with a significant number of foreshocks. For seismically active regions, increasing the number of stations with rich data acquisition will facilitate more convenient stress field analysis.</description>

      <title>Ringworlds and Dyson spheres can be stable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12806</link>

Abstract: In his 1856 Adams Prize essay, James Clark Maxwell demonstrated that Saturn's rings cannot be comprised of a uniform rigid body. This is a consequence of the two-body gravitational interaction between a ring and planet resulting in instability. Similarly, it is also known that a so-called Dyson sphere encompassing a single star would be unstable due to Newton's shell theorem. A surprising finding is reported here that both a ring and a sphere (shell) can be stable in the restricted three-body problem. First, if two primary masses are considered in orbit about their common centre of mass, a large, uniform, infinitesimal ring enclosing the smaller of the masses can in principle be stable under certain conditions. Similarly, a Dyson sphere can, be stable, if the sphere encloses the smaller of the two primary masses, again under certain conditions. These findings extend Maxwell's results on the dynamics of rings and have an interesting bearing on so-called Ringworlds and Dyson spheres from fiction. Moreover, the existence of passively stable orbits for such large-scale structures may have implications for so-called techno-signatures in search for extra-terrestrial intelligence studies.</description>

      <title>A long spin period for a sub-Neptune-mass exoplanet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: HIP 41378 f is a sub-Neptune exoplanet with an anomalously low density. Its long orbital period and deep transit make it an ideal candidate for detecting oblateness photometrically. We present a new cross-platform, GPU-enabled code greenlantern, suitable for computing transit light curves of oblate planets at arbitrary orientations. We then use Markov Chain Monte Carlo to fit K2 data of HIP 41378 f, specifically examining its transit for possible oblateness and obliquity. We find that the flattening of HIP 41378 f is $f \leq 0.889$ at the 95% confidence level, consistent with a rotation period of $P_\text{rot} \geq 15.3$ hr. In the future, high-precision data from JWST has the potential to tighten such a constraint and can differentiate between spherical and flattened planets.</description>

      <title>ExoMiner++ on TESS with Transfer Learning from Kepler: Transit Classification and Vetting Catalog for 2-min Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09790v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present ExoMiner++, an enhanced deep learning model that builds on the success of ExoMiner to improve transit signal classification in 2-minute TESS data. ExoMiner++ incorporates additional diagnostic inputs, including periodogram, flux trend, difference image, unfolded flux, and spacecraft attitude control data, all of which are crucial for effectively distinguishing transit signals from more challenging sources of false positives. To further enhance performance, we leverage transfer learning from high-quality labeled data from the Kepler space telescope, mitigating the impact of TESS's noisier and more ambiguous labels. ExoMiner++ achieves high accuracy across various classification and ranking metrics, significantly narrowing the search space for follow-up investigations to confirm new planets. To serve the exoplanet community, we introduce new TESS catalogs containing ExoMiner++ classifications and confidence scores for each transit signal. Among the 147,568 unlabeled TCEs, ExoMiner++ identifies 7,330 as planet candidates, with the remainder classified as false positives. These 7,330 planet candidates correspond to 1,868 existing TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs), 69 Community TESS Objects of Interest (CTOIs), and 50 newly introduced CTOIs. 1,797 out of the 2,506 TOIs previously labeled as planet candidates in ExoFOP are classified as planet candidates by ExoMiner++. This reduction in plausible candidates combined with the excellent ranking quality of ExoMiner++ allows the follow-up efforts to be focused on the most likely candidates, increasing the overall planet yield.</description>
