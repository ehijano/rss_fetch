      <title>The radium ion's metastable $6d\,\,^2\!D_{5/2}$ and $6d\,\, ^2\!D_{3/2}$ state lifetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report lifetime measurements of the metastable $6d\, ^2\!D_{5/2}$ and $6d\, ^2\!D_{3/2}$ states of the radium ion. The measured lifetimes, $\tau_{5} = $ 303.8(1.5) ms and $\tau_{3} = $ 642(9) ms, are important for optical frequency standards and for benchmarking high-precision relativistic atomic theory. Independent of the reported measurements, the $D$ state lifetimes were calculated using the coupled-cluster single double triple method, in which the coupled-cluster equations for both core and valence triple excitations were solved iteratively. The method was designed for precise prediction of atomic properties, especially for heavy elements, where relativistic and correlation corrections become large, making their treatment more challenging. This work presents the first benchmark comparisons of the method for transition properties. Our prediction agrees with experimental values within the uncertainties. The ability to accurately predict the atomic properties of heavy elements is important for many applications, from tests of fundamental symmetries to the development of optical clocks.</description>

      <title>Efficient preparation of entangled states in cavity QED with Grover's algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose to employ the amplification mechanism of Grover's search algorithm to efficiently prepare entangled states of an ensemble of qubits. The conditional change of sign employed in the algorithm can be implemented by the phase shift of photons scattered on an optical cavity hosting an atomic ensemble. We show that collective Dicke states, GHZ states, and Schr\"odinger cat superpositions of $N$ atoms may be prepared deterministically by few ($\sim N^{1/4}$) photon scattering events without individual addressing of the atoms.</description>

      <title>Deterministic carving of quantum states with Grover's algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that iteration of a few ( $\sim N^{1/4}$) unitary steps of Grover's algorithm suffices to perfectly prepare a Dicke state of $N$ atoms in a cavity. We also show that a few subsequent Grover steps can be employed to generate GHZ and Cat states. The Grover iteration is physically realized by global qubit rotations and by the phase shift of single photons reflected on the cavity. Our protocols are deterministic and require no individual addressing of the atoms. A detailed error analysis accounting for spatial mode matching of the photon to the cavity, spontaneous emission, mirror scattering, and the finite bandwidth of the photon mode is used to predict the fidelity of the prepared states as a function of system parameters and atom-cavity cooperativity. The fidelity can be increased by heralding on detection of the reflected photon.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Ion Dynamics from Muon Diffusion in Muon Spin Relaxation II -- Extension to Paramagnetic Muons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the previously published model that distinguishes between the diffusive motion of diamagnetic muons and the dynamics of ions around the muon in matter, and propose a generalized model for {\sl paramagnetic muons} (Mu$^0$s, bound states of a muon and an unpaired electron) observed in non-metallic host materials. The new model distinguishes among the independent motion of unpaired electron associated with Mu$^0$, the self-diffusive motion of Mu$^0$ as single atomic entity, and that of the ions surrounding Mu$^0$, where the muon spin relaxation is induced by dynamical fluctuations of the hyperfine (HF) field exerted from the unpaired electron (e.g., due to spin/charge exchange reaction) and/or that of the nuclear hyperfine (NHF) interactions between the unpaired electron and the surrounding ions. We have applied this model to the muonated radicals (Mu$^0$s in a polaron state) in conducting polymers, and examined the validity of the interpretations claimed in the earlier literature that the spin relaxation is induced by quasi-one dimensional motion of the unpaired electron. The result suggests that experimental support for such a claim is still inadequate and needs to be reexamined, including the possibility of other origins for the fluctuations. It is expected that our model will prove a useful guide for $\mu$SR studies of various local dynamics involving paramagnetic muon states.</description>

      <title>Strong parity-violation effects induced by large-amplitude motions: A quantum-dynamics study of substituted chiral methanols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02302v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An enhanced mechanism is proposed for the large-amplitude-motion-induced parity-violating frequency by integrating the exact quantum dynamics method with the relativistic electronic structure theory. The torsional wavefunctions and PV frequency shifts are obtained by the exact quantum dynamics method. The potential energy curve and PV energy along the torsional coordinates are calculated using the extended atomic mean-field two-component Hamiltonian. The predicted PV frequency shift for the torsional transition of CFClBrOH is approximately 100 times larger than that of the conventional C-F stretching mode of CHFClBr. The maximum PV frequency shift (3.2 Hz) is obtained in the CHBrIOH molecule.</description>

      <title>Magnetic quadrupole dichroism in isotropic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For isotropic media, the magnetic field applied across the light propagation direction affects their optical properties only in the second order, and its effect proves to be much weaker than in the longitudinal field. In this work, we show that, under resonant excitation well beyond the linear regime, the situation changes drastically: A small magnetic linear anisotropy considerably increases, and an even stronger new quadrupole dichroism emerges. The latter manifests itself as the 90$^\circ$-periodic azimuthal dependence of the transmission and anisotropic rotation of the probe polarization plane. These effects are described microscopically in a toy model, and their symmetry analysis is presented. Both are observed experimentally on the D2 resonance of cesium vapor and agree with the theoretical predictions. The large magnitude of the quadrupole dichroism makes it promising for magnetometric applications and for studying the effects of anisotropic bleaching.</description>
