      <title>Linear Superposition of Quadratic Functions in a Fifth Order KdV-Type Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a fifth order KdV-type equation admits several real as well as complex parity-time reversal or PT-invariant solutions with linear superposition of quadratic functions involving Jacobi elliptic functions of the form ${\rm dn}^2(x,m)$, ${\rm cn}(x,m){\rm dn}(x,m)$, ${\rm sn}(x,m) {\rm cn}(x,m)$ and ${\rm sn}(x,m){\rm dn}(x,m)$. These results must be contrasted with only partial superposition of such functions in Korteweg-de Vries (KdV), $\phi^3$ and a few other nonlinear equations.</description>

      <title>Algebraic approach to the inverse spectral problem for rational matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of reconstruction of an $n\times n$ matrix with coefficients depending rationally on $x\in \mathbb P^1$ from the data of: (a) its characteristic polynomial and (b) a line bundle of degree $g+n-1$, with $g$ the geometric genus of the spectral curve, represented by a choice of $g+n+1$ points forming a (non-positive) divisor of the given degree.
  We thus provide a reconstruction formula that does not involve transcendental functions; this includes formulas for the spectral projectors and for the change of line bundle, thus integrating the isospectral flows.
  The formula is a single residue formula which depends rationally on the coordinates of the points involved, the coefficients of the spectral curve, and the position of the finite poles of $L$. We also discuss the canonical bi-differential associated with the Lax matrix and its relationship with other bi-differentials that appear in Topological Recursion and integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic equations with fifth-order symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the classification of hyperbolic equations. We study a class of equations of the form $$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x\partial y}=F\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x},\frac{\partial u}{\partial y},u\right),$$ where $u(x,y)$ is the unknown function and $x,y$ are independent variables. The classification is based on the requirement for the existence of higher fifth-order symmetries. As a result, a list of four equations with the required conditions was obtained.</description>

      <title>Conservation laws of nonlinear PDEs arising in elasticity and acoustics in Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conservation laws are computed for various nonlinear partial differential equations that arise in elasticity and acoustics. Using a scaling homogeneity approach, conservation laws are established for two models describing shear wave propagation in a circular cylinder and a cylindrical annulus. Next, using the multiplier method, conservation laws are derived for a parameterized system of constitutive equations in cylindrical coordinates involving a general expression for the Cauchy stress. Conservation laws for the Khokhlov-Zabolotskaya-Kuznetsov equation and Westervelt-type equations in various coordinate systems are also presented.</description>

      <title>Flow topology classification of limit cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent topological tools offer a powerful way to classify how phases of nonlinear bosonic resonators are organized. Yet, they remain incomplete. In particular, self-sustained oscillations in the form of limit cycles act as robust organizing centers in phase space that are not captured by existing fixed-point-based approaches. In this work, we extend the flow topology framework for nonlinear resonators to include limit cycles as fundamental topological elements. Using a graph-based construction, we show how periodic attractors impact the global connectivity of phase-space flows. We illustrate the approach with a minimal nonlinear Van der Pol resonator model, where limit cycles coexist with stationary points. Our results provide a unified topological description of stationary and time-periodic phases in nonlinear bosonic systems, with direct relevance to photonic, superconducting, and optomechanical platforms, and raise new questions on synchronization and the extension of flow topology to the quantum regime.</description>

      <title>On $\beta=6$ Tracy-Widom distribution and the second Calogero-Painlev\'e system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.06733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Calogero-Painlev\'e systems were introduced in 2001 by K. Takasaki as a natural generalization of the classical Painlev\'e equations to the case of the several Painlev\'e ``particles'' coupled via the Calogero type interactions. In 2014, I. Rumanov discovered the remarkable fact that a particular case of the second Calogero-Painlev\'e II equation describes the Tracy-Widom distribution function for the general beta-ensembles with even values of the parameter beta. Most recently, in 2017 work of M. Bertola, M. Cafasso, and V. Rubtsov, it was proven that all Calogero-Painlev\'e systems are Lax integrable, and hence their solutions admit a Riemann-Hilbert representation. This important observation has opened the door to rigorous, based on the Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method, asymptotic analysis of the Calogero-Painlev\'e equations. This in turn yields the possibility of rigorous evaluation of the asymptotic behavior of the Tracy-Widom distributions for the values of beta beyond the classical $\beta =1, 2, 4.$ In this work we shall start an asymptotic analysis of the Calogero-Painlev\'e system with a special focus on the Calogero-Painlev\'e system corresponding to $\beta = 6$ Tracy-Widom distribution function. The principle technical challenge is the implementation of the nonlinear steepest descent approach beyond the $2\times 2$ matrix dimension of the corresponding Riemann-Hilbert problem; in our case, it is $6\times 6$.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous potentials, Lagrange's identity and Poisson geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lagrange identity expresses the second derivative of the moment of inertia of a system of material points through kinetic energy and homogeneous potential energy, from which follows the Jacobi well-known result on the instability of a system of gravitating bodies. In this work, it is proven that if a Hamiltonian system satisfies the Lagrange identity, then it possesses additional tensor invariants that are not expressed through the basic invariants existing for all Hamiltonian systems. A new class of Hamiltonian systems with inhomogeneous potentials is considered, which also possess similar additional tensor invariants.</description>

      <title>On integrable structure of the null string in (anti-)de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Presently integrability turned the key property in the study of duality between superconformal gauge theories and strings in anti-de Sitter superspaces. Complexity of the study of integrable structure in string theory is caused by complicated dependence of background fields of the Type II supergravity multiplets, with which strings interact, on the superspace coordinates. This explains an interest to study of limiting cases, in which superstring equations simplify. In the present work considered is the limiting case of zero tension corresponding to null string. It is obtained the representation in the form of the Lax equation of null-string equations in (anti-)de Sitter space realized as coset manifold. Proposed is twistor interpretation of the Lagrangian of (null) string in anti-de Sitter space expressed in terms of group variables.</description>
