      <title>Status and Future Prospects of the Standardization Framework Industry 4.0: A European Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of Industry 4.0 technologies requires robust and comprehensive standardization to ensure interoperability, safety and efficiency in the Industry of the Future. This paper examines the fundamental role and functionality of standardization, with a particular focus on its importance in Europe's regulatory framework. Based on this, selected topics in context of standardization activities in context intelligent manufacturing and digital twins are highlighted and, by that, an overview of the Industry 4.0 standards framework is provided. This paper serves both as an informative guide to the existing standards in Industry 4.0 with respect to Artificial Intelligence and Digital Twins, and as a call to action for increased cooperation between standardization bodies and the research community. By fostering such collaboration, we aim to facilitate the continued development and implementation of standards that will drive innovation and progress in the manufacturing sector.</description>

      <title>H3PIMAP: A Heterogeneity-Aware Multi-Objective DNN Mapping Framework on Electronic-Photonic Processing-in-Memory Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The future of artificial intelligence (AI) acceleration demands a paradigm shift beyond the limitations of purely electronic or photonic architectures. Photonic analog computing delivers unmatched speed and parallelism but struggles with data movement, robustness, and precision. Electronic processing-in-memory (PIM) enables energy-efficient computing by co-locating storage and computation but suffers from endurance and reconfiguration constraints, limiting it to static weight mapping. Neither approach alone achieves the balance needed for adaptive, efficient AI. To break this impasse, we study a hybrid electronic-photonic-PIM computing architecture and introduce H3PIMAP, a heterogeneity-aware mapping framework that seamlessly orchestrates workloads across electronic and optical tiers. By optimizing workload partitioning through a two-stage multi-objective exploration method, H3PIMAP harnesses light speed for high-throughput operations and PIM efficiency for memory-bound tasks. System-level evaluations on language and vision models show H3PIMAP achieves a 2.74x energy efficiency improvement and a 3.47x latency reduction compared to homogeneous architectures and naive mapping strategies. This proposed framework lays the foundation for hybrid AI accelerators, bridging the gap between electronic and photonic computation for next-generation efficiency and scalability.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Normality Learning and Divergence Vector-guided Model Merging for Zero-shot Congenital Heart Disease Detection in Fetal Ultrasound Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is one of the leading causes of fetal mortality, yet the scarcity of labeled CHD data and strict privacy regulations surrounding fetal ultrasound (US) imaging present significant challenges for the development of deep learning-based models for CHD detection. Centralised collection of large real-world datasets for rare conditions, such as CHD, from large populations requires significant co-ordination and resource. In addition, data governance rules increasingly prevent data sharing between sites. To address these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, a novel privacy-preserving, zero-shot CHD detection framework that formulates CHD detection as a normality modeling problem integrated with model merging. In our framework dubbed Sparse Tube Ultrasound Distillation (STUD), each hospital site first trains a sparse video tube-based self-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) model on normal fetal heart US clips with self-distillation loss. This enables site-specific models to independently learn the distribution of healthy cases. To aggregate knowledge across the decentralized models while maintaining privacy, we propose a Divergence Vector-Guided Model Merging approach, DivMerge, that combines site-specific models into a single VAD model without data exchange. Our approach preserves domain-agnostic rich spatio-temporal representations, ensuring generalization to unseen CHD cases. We evaluated our approach on real-world fetal US data collected from 5 hospital sites. Our merged model outperformed site-specific models by 23.77% and 30.13% in accuracy and F1-score respectively on external test sets.</description>

      <title>How Does CP Length Affect the Sensing Range for OFDM-ISAC?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), which has been the dominating waveform for contemporary wireless communications, is also regarded as a competitive candidate for future integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Existing works on OFDM-ISAC usually assume that the maximum sensing range should be limited by the cyclic prefix (CP) length since inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI) should be avoided. However, in this paper, we provide rigorous analysis to reveal that the random data embedded in OFDM-ISAC signal can actually act as a free ``mask" for ISI, which makes ISI/ICI random and hence greatly attenuated after radar signal processing. The derived signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in the range profile demonstrates that the maximum sensing range of OFDM-ISAC can greatly exceed the ISI-free distance that is limited by the CP length, which is validated by simulation results. To further mitigate power degradation for long-range targets, a novel sliding window sensing method is proposed, which iteratively detects and cancels short-range targets before shifting the detection window. The shifted detection window can effectively compensate the power degradation due to insufficient CP length for long-range targets. Such results provide valuable guidance for the CP length design in OFDM-ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Optimization and Benchmarking of Monolithically Stackable Gain Cell Memory for Last-Level Cache</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Last Level Cache (LLC) is the processor's critical bridge between on-chip and off-chip memory levels - optimized for high density, high bandwidth, and low operation energy. To date, high-density (HD) SRAM has been the conventional device of choice; however, with the slowing of transistor scaling, as reflected in the industry's almost identical HD SRAM cell size from 5 nm to 3 nm, alternative solutions such as 3D stacking with advanced packaging like hybrid bonding are pursued (as demonstrated in AMD's V-cache). Escalating data demands necessitate ultra-large on-chip caches to decrease costly off-chip memory movement, pushing the exploration of device technology toward monolithic 3D (M3D) integration where transistors can be stacked in the back-end-of-line (BEOL) at the interconnect level. M3D integration requires fabrication techniques compatible with a low thermal budget (&lt;400 degC). Among promising BEOL device candidates are amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) transistors, particularly desirable for their ultra-low leakage (&lt;fA/um), enabling persistent data retention (&gt;seconds) when used in a gain-cell configuration. This paper examines device, circuit, and system-level tradeoffs when optimizing BEOL-compatible AOS-based 2-transistor gain cell (2T-GC) for LLC. A cache early-exploration tool, NS-Cache, is developed to model caches in advanced 7 and 3 nm nodes and is integrated with the Gem5 simulator to systematically benchmark the impact of the newfound density/performance when compared to HD-SRAM, MRAM, and 1T1C eDRAM alternatives for LLC.</description>

      <title>Parameter-Efficient Electromagnetic Surrogate Solver for Broadband Field Prediction using Discrete Wavelength Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, electromagnetic surrogate solvers, trained on solutions of Maxwell's equations under specific simulation conditions, enabled real-time inference of computationally expensive simulations. However, conventional surrogate solvers often consider only a narrow range of simulation parameters and fail when encountering even slight variations in simulation conditions. To address this limitation, we propose a broadband surrogate solver capable of providing solutions across a continuous range of wavelengths, even when trained on discrete wavelength data. Our approach leverages a Wave-Informed element-wise Multiplicative Encoding and a Fourier Group Convolutional Shuffling operator to mitigate overfitting while capturing the fundamental characteristics of Maxwell's equations. Compared to the state-of-the-art surrogate solver, our model achieves a 74% reduction in parameters, an 80.5% improvement in prediction accuracy for untrained wavelengths, demonstrating superior generalization and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Potential of AI Researchers in Scientific Discovery: What Is Missing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The potential of AI researchers in scientific discovery remains largely to be unleashed. Over the past decade, the presence of AI for Science (AI4Science) in the 145 Nature Index journals has increased ninefold, yet nearly 90% of AI4Science research remains predominantly led by experimental scientists. Drawing on the Diffusion of Innovation theory, we project that AI4Science's share of total publications will rise from 3.57% in 2024 to approximately 25% by 2050. Unlocking the potential of AI researchers is essential for driving this shift and fostering deeper integration of AI expertise into the research ecosystem. To this end, we propose structured and actionable workflows, alongside key strategies to position AI researchers at the forefront of scientific discovery. Furthermore, we outline three pivotal pathways: equipping experimental scientists with user-friendly AI tools to amplify the impact of AI researchers, bridging cognitive and methodological gaps to enable more direct participation in scientific discovery, and proactively cultivating a thriving AI-driven scientific ecosystem. By addressing these challenges, this work aims to empower AI researchers as a driving force in shaping the future of scientific discovery.</description>
