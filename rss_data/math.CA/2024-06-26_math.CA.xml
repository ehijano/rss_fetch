      <title>Balayage of Radon measures of infinite energy on locally compact spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For suitable kernels on a locally compact space $X$, we develop a theory of inner balayage of quite general Radon measures $\omega$ (not necessarily of finite energy) to arbitrary $A\subset X$. In the case where $A$ is Borel, this theory provides, as a by-product, a theory of outer balayage. We prove the existence and the uniqueness of inner (outer) swept measures, analyze their properties, and provide a number of alternative characterizations. In spite of being in agreement with Cartan's theory of Newtonian balayage, the results obtained require essentially new methods and approaches, since in the case in question, useful specific features of Newtonian potentials may fail to hold. The theory thereby established generalizes substantially the existing ones, pertaining either to $\omega$ of finite energy, or to some particular $A$ (e.g. quasiclosed). This work covers many interesting kernels in classical and modern potential theory, which looks promising for possible applications.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Versus Analytic Density of Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that under very mild conditions on a measure $\mu$ on the real line, the span of $\{x^n\}_{n=j}^{\infty}$ is dense in $L^2(\mu)$ for any $j\in\mathbb{N}$. We also present a slightly weaker result with an interesting proof that uses Sobolev orthogonality.</description>

      <title>On Shilnikov's scenario with a homoclinic orbit in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper provides a detailed proof that complicated motion exists in Shilnikov's scenario of a smooth vectorfield $V$ on $mathbb{R}^3$ with $V(0)=0$ so that the equation $x'=V(x)$ has a homoclinic solution $h$ with $\lim_{|t|\to\infty}h(t)=0$, and $DV(0)$ has eigenvalues $u&gt;0$ and $\sigma\pm\mu$, $\sigma&lt;0&lt;\mu$, with $0&lt;\sigma+u$.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds on the measure of the support of positive and negative parts of trigonometric polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a finite set of natural numbers $D$ consider a complex polynomial of the form $f(z) = \sum_{d \in D} c_d z^d$. Let $\rho_+(f)$ and $\rho_-(f)$ be the fractions of the unit circle that $f$ sends to the right($\operatorname{Re} f(z) &gt; 0$) and left($\operatorname{Re} f(z) &lt; 0$) half-planes, respectively. Note that $\operatorname{Re} f(z)$ is a real trigonometric polynomial, whose allowed set of frequencies is $D$. Turns out that $\min(\rho_+(f), \rho_-(f))$ is always bounded below by a numerical characteristic $\alpha(D)$ of our set $D$ that arises from a seemingly unrelated combinatorial problem. Furthermore, this result could be generalized to power series, almost periodic functions, functions of several variables and multivalued algebraic functions.</description>

      <title>$\Phi^4_3$ measures on compact Riemannian $3$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10185v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the $\Phi^4_3$ measure on an arbitrary 3-dimensional compact Riemannian manifold without boundary as an invariant probability measure of a singular stochastic partial differential equation. Proving the nontriviality and the covariance under Riemannian isometries of that measure gives for the first time a non-perturbative, non-topological interacting Euclidean quantum field theory on curved spaces in dimension 3. This answers a longstanding open problem of constructive quantum field theory on curved 3 dimensional backgrounds. To control analytically several Feynman diagrams appearing in the construction of a number of random fields, we introduce a novel approach of renormalization using microlocal and harmonic analysis. This allows to obtain a renormalized equation which involves some universal constants independent of the manifold. We also define a new vectorial Cole-Hopf transform which allows to deal with the vectorial $\Phi^4_3$ model where $\Phi$ is now a bundle valued random field. In a companion paper, we develop in a self-contained way all the tools from paradifferential and microlocal analysis that we use to build in our manifold setting a number of analytic and probabilistic objects.</description>

      <title>Faber-Krahn inequalities, the Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman formula, and Carleson's $\varepsilon^2$ conjecture in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06187v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main aim of this article is to prove quantitative spectral inequalities for the Laplacian with Dirichlet boundary conditions. More specifically, we prove sharp quantitative stability for the Faber-Krahn inequality in terms of Newtonian capacities and Hausdorff contents of positive codimension, thus providing an answer to a question posed by De Philippis and Brasco.
  One of our results asserts that for any bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^n$, $n\geq3$, with Lebesgue measure equal to that of the unit ball $B_0$ and whose first eigenvalue is $\lambda_\Omega$, denoting by $\lambda_{B_0}$ the first eigenvalue for the unit ball, for any $a\in (0,1)$ it holds $$\lambda_\Omega - \lambda_{B_0} \geq C(a) \,\inf_B \bigg(\sup_{t\in (0,1)} \frac1{H^{n-1}(\partial ((1-t) B))} \int_{\partial ((1-t) B)} \frac{\operatorname{Cap}_{n-2}(B(x,atr_B)\setminus \Omega)}{(t\,r_B)^{n-3}}\,dH^{n-1}(x)\bigg)^2,$$ where the infimum is taken over all balls $B$ with the same Lebesgue measure as $\Omega$ and $\operatorname{Cap}_{n-2}$ is the Newtonian capacity of homogeneity $n-2$. In fact, this holds for bounded subdomains of the sphere and the hyperbolic space, as well.
  In a second result, we also apply the new Faber-Krahn type inequalities to quantify the Hayman-Friedland inequality about the characteristics of disjoint domains in the unit sphere. Thirdly, we propose a natural extension of Carleson's $\varepsilon^2$-conjecture to higher dimensions in terms of a square function involving the characteristics of certain spherical domains, and we prove the necessity of the finiteness of such square function in the tangent points via the Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman monotonicity formula. Finally, we answer in the negative a question posed by Allen, Kriventsov and Neumayer in connection to rectifiability and the positivity set of the ACF monotonicity formula.</description>
