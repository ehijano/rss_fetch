      <title>The Minimum Mass of Planets, Dwarf Planets, and Planetary-scale Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The International Astronomical Union definitions for Planet and Dwarf Planet both require that a body has sufficient mass to overcome rigid body forces and self gravitate into a nearly round shape. However, quantitative standards for determining when a body is sufficiently round have been lacking. Previously published triaxial ellipsoid solutions for asteroids, satellites, and Dwarf Planets in the radius range 135 to 800 km are examined to identify a minimum mass above which the entire population, regardless of composition, is round. From this data, the minimum mass to meet the roundness criterion is 5.0 x 10E20 kg. The triaxial shape data suggests three radius ranges: (1) bodies with a radius less than 160 km are non-spheroidal, (2) bodies with a radius in the range 160 to 450 km are transitional in shape or nearly round, (3) bodies with a radius greater than 450 km are spheroidal. Bodies orbiting the Sun with a mass greater than 5.0 x 10E20 kg are Planets or Dwarf Planets. Arguments are presented for including the 16 spheroidal moons of the Solar System as a third dynamical class that can be identified as Satellite Planets. Definitions are proposed that expand upon the taxonomy started in 2006 with the International Astronomomical Union Planet and Dwarf Planet classes.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Binary Reference Stars on JWST NIRCam Coronagraphy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct imaging campaigns executed with James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will enable the study of the faintest observable exoplanets yet. To assist observers in the JWST proposal process, we present an in-depth exploration of the effects of moderate contrast binary (visual and physical) systems on JWST NIRCam coronagraphic Reference Differential Imaging (RDI) methods. All work in this paper is based on simulation data generated using the Python package PanCAKE, in addition to a variety of custom scripts which we have made publicly available on GitHub. Presenting both contrast curves and more involved 'heatmaps' of sensitivity loss, we present quantifiable measurements for how a binary companion will impact contrast both totally and locally, as a function of magnitude, separation, and position angle. Observers can use results in this work to estimate the impact of a known binary, and in some cases will find that PSF subtraction can still be reliably performed. We have found several scenarios where JWST NIRCam coronagraphic RDI PSF subtraction can be viably performed using a binary reference and make several suggestions. The brightest binary companions analyzed, with a relative brightness of 1e-3, resulted in the worst local sensitivity loss of 3.02 units of magnitude. The faintest binary companions looked at, 1e-6 relative brightness, have almost no effect on local sensitivity. Changing position angle impacts sensitivity loss by 0.5 to 0.3 depending on companion flux. Binary companion separation considerations should be on a case-by-case science goal basis. This work also discusses the trade space for these suggestions in detail.</description>

      <title>Rapid inference and comparison of gravitational-wave population models with neural variational posteriors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog has been analyzed with an abundance of different population models due to theoretical uncertainty in the formation of gravitational-wave sources. To expedite model exploration, we introduce an efficient and accurate variational Bayesian approach that learns the population posterior with a normalizing flow and serves as a drop-in replacement for existing samplers. With hardware acceleration, inference takes just seconds for the current set of black-hole mergers and readily scales to larger catalogs. The trained posteriors provide an arbitrary number of independent samples with exact probability densities, unlike established stochastic sampling algorithms that otherwise match with Jensen-Shannon divergences below 0.1 nats in our 14-dimensional parameter space, while requiring up to three orders of magnitude fewer likelihood evaluations and as few as $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$. Provided the posterior support is covered, discrepancies can be addressed with smoothed importance sampling, which quantifies a goodness-of-fit metric for the variational approximation while also estimating the evidence for Bayesian model selection. Neural variational inference thus enables interactive development, analysis, and comparison of population models, making it a useful tool for astrophysical interpretation of current and future gravitational-wave observations.</description>

      <title>Sequential Filtering Techniques for Simultaneous Tracking and Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of resident space objects is rising at an alarming rate. Mega-constellations and breakup events are proliferating in most orbital regimes, and safe navigation is becoming increasingly problematic. It is important to be able to track RSOs accurately and at an affordable computational cost. Orbital dynamics are highly nonlinear, and current operational methods assume Gaussian representations of the objects' states and employ linearizations which cease to hold true in observation-free propagation. Monte Carlo-based filters can provide a means to approximate the a posteriori probability distribution of the states more accurately by providing support in the portion of the state space which overlaps the most with the processed observations. Moreover, dynamical models are not able to capture the full extent of realistic forces experienced in the near-Earth space environment, and hence fully deterministic propagation methods may fail to achieve the desired accuracy. By modeling orbital dynamics as a stochastic system and solving it using stochastic numerical integrators, we are able to simultaneously estimate the scale of the process noise incurred by the assumed uncertainty in the system, and robustly track the state of the spacecraft. In order to find an adequate balance between accuracy and computational cost, we propose three algorithms which are capable of tracking a space object and estimating the magnitude of the system's uncertainty. The proposed filters are successfully applied to a LEO scenario, demonstrating the ability to accurately track a spacecraft state and estimate the scale of the uncertainty online, in various simulation setups.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Detection of Fast Moving Celestial Objects Using a Mixture of Experts and Physical-Inspired Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast moving celestial objects are characterized by velocities across the celestial sphere that significantly differ from the motions of background stars. In observational images, these objects exhibit distinct shapes, contrasting with the typical appearances of stars. Depending on the observational method employed, these celestial entities may be designated as near-Earth objects or asteroids. Historically, fast moving celestial objects have been observed using ground-based telescopes, where the relative stability of stars and Earth facilitated effective image differencing techniques alongside traditional fast moving celestial object detection and classification algorithms. However, the growing prevalence of space-based telescopes, along with their diverse observational modes, produces images with different properties, rendering conventional methods less effective. This paper presents a novel algorithm for detecting fast moving celestial objects within star fields. Our approach enhances state-of-the-art fast moving celestial object detection neural networks by transforming them into physical-inspired neural networks. These neural networks leverage the point spread function of the telescope and the specific observational mode as prior information; they can directly identify moving fast moving celestial objects within star fields without requiring additional training, thereby addressing the limitations of traditional techniques. Additionally, all neural networks are integrated using the mixture of experts technique, forming a comprehensive fast moving celestial object detection algorithm. We have evaluated our algorithm using simulated observational data that mimics various observations carried out by space based telescope scenarios and real observation images. Results demonstrate that our method effectively detects fast moving celestial objects across different observational modes.</description>

      <title>Earth-like planet predictor: A machine learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searching for planets analogous to Earth in terms of mass and equilibrium temperature is currently the first step in the quest for habitable conditions outside our Solar System and, ultimately, the search for life in the universe. Future missions such as PLATO or LIFE will begin to detect and characterise these small, cold planets, dedicating significant observation time to them. The aim of this work is to predict which stars are most likely to host an Earth-like planet (ELP) to avoid blind searches, minimises detection times, and thus maximises the number of detections. Using a previous study on correlations between the presence of an ELP and the properties of its system, we trained a Random Forest to recognise and classify systems as 'hosting an ELP' or 'not hosting an ELP'. The Random Forest was trained and tested on populations of synthetic planetary systems derived from the Bern model, and then applied to real observed systems. The tests conducted on the machine learning (ML) model yield precision scores of up to 0.99, indicating that 99% of the systems identified by the model as having ELPs possess at least one. Among the few real observed systems that have been tested, 44 have been selected as having a high probability of hosting an ELP, and a quick study of the stability of these systems confirms that the presence of an Earth-like planet within them would leave them stable. The excellent results obtained from the tests conducted on the ML model demonstrate its ability to recognise the typical architectures of systems with or without ELPs within populations derived from the Bern model. If we assume that the Bern model adequately describes the architecture of real systems, then such a tool can prove indispensable in the search for Earth-like planets. A similar approach could be applied to other planetary system formation models to validate those predictions.</description>

      <title>Low-Thrust Many-Revolution Transfer between Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit and Low Lunar Orbit Using Hybrid Differential Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-thrust, many-revolution transfers between near-rectilinear halo orbits and low lunar orbits are challenging due to the many-revolutions and is further complicated by three-body perturbation. To address these challenges, we extend hybrid differential dynamic programming by enhancing with a continuation of dynamical system. The optimization begins with the Sundman-transformed two-body problem and gradually transitions to the Sundman-transformed circular restricted three-body problem expressed in the moon-centered inertial frame. Numerical examples demonstrate the robust convergence of our method, where optimal transfers from low lunar orbit to near-rectilinear halo orbit are obtained with a poor initial guess of low lunar orbit.</description>

      <title>Orbit design for mitigating interstellar scattering effects in Earth-space VLBI observations of Sgr A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (abridged) The black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is a prime target for next-generation Earth-space very-long-baseline interferometry missions such as the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX), which aims to probe baselines of the order of 20 G$\lambda$. At these baselines, Sgr A* observations will be affected by the diffractive scattering effects from the interstellar medium (ISM). Therefore, we study how different parameter choices for turbulence in the ISM affect BHEX's observational capabilities to probe strong lensing features of Sgr A*. By using a simple geometric model of concentric Gaussian rings for Sgr A*'s photon ring signal and observing at 320 GHz, we find that the BHEX-ALMA baseline has the required sensitivity to observe Sgr A* for a broad range of values of the power-law index of density fluctuations in the ISM and the inner scale of turbulence. For other baselines with moderate sensitivities, a strong need for observations at shorter scales of $\approx$ 13.5 G$\lambda$ is identified. For this purpose, an orbit migration scheme is proposed. It is modeled using both chemical propulsion (CP)-based Hohmann transfers and electric propulsion (EP)-based orbit raising with the result that a CP-based transfer can be performed in a matter of hours, but with a significantly higher fuel requirement as compared to EP, which however requires a transfer time of around 6 weeks. The consequences of these orbits for probing Sgr A*'s spacetime is studied by quantifying the spatial resolution, temporal resolution and the angular sampling of the photon ring signal in the Fourier coverage of each of these orbits. We show that higher orbits isolate spacetime features while sacrificing both, signal lost to scattering and temporal resolution, but gain greater access to the morphology of the photon ring.</description>

      <title>Measuring Type Ia Supernova Angular-Diameter Distances with Intensity Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07725v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the potential of intensity interferometry, based on the Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect, for measuring supernova sizes and distances. Through optimized telescope positioning, observing strategy, and advancements in single-photon detection technology, this method can provide precise angular size measurements of Type Ia supernovae as bright as 12~mag, corresponding to a local volume out to $z\sim0.004$, with an anticipated rate of $\sim 1$ events per year. The combination of angular size data with known physical dimensions enables accurate distance determination. Multiple telescope pairs at different relative positions allow tomographic mapping of the ejecta structure while reducing distance uncertainties. As Type Ia supernovae serve as standardizable candles for measuring the Universe's expansion history, combining intensity interferometry distances with the supernova Hubble diagram facilitates measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Charge-coupled Device Readout Enabled by the Floating-Gate Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple-Amplifier Sensing (MAS) charge-coupled devices (CCDs) have recently been shown to be promising silicon detectors that meet noise sensitivity requirements for next generation Stage-5 spectroscopic surveys and potentially, future space-based imaging of extremely faint objects on missions such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory. Building upon the capability of the Skipper CCD to achieve deeply sub-electron noise floors, MAS CCDs utilize multiple floating-gate amplifiers along the serial register to increase the readout speed by a factor of the number of output nodes compared to a Skipper CCD. We introduce and experimentally demonstrate on a 16-channel prototype device new readout techniques that exploit the MAS CCD's floating-gate amplifiers to optimize the correlated double sampling (CDS) by resetting once per line instead of once per pixel. With this new mode, we find an optimal filter to subtract the noise from the signal during read out. We also take advantage of the MAS CCD's structure to tune the read time by independently changing integration times for the signal and reference level. Together with optimal weighted averaging of the 16 outputs, these approaches enable us to reach a sub-electron noise of 0.9 e$^-$ rms pix$^{-1}$ at 19 $\mu$s pix$^{-1}$ for a single charge measurement per pixel - simultaneously giving a 30% faster readout time and 10% lower read noise compared to performance previously evaluated without these techniques.</description>

      <title>Nearly a Decade of Groundbreaking Speckle Interferometry at the International Gemini Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since its inception, speckle interferometry has revolutionized high-resolution astronomical imaging, overcoming atmospheric challenges to achieve the diffraction limits of telescopes. Almost a decade ago, in 2018, a pair of speckle cameras -- 'Alopeke and Zorro -- were installed at the twin 8.1-meter Gemini North and South telescopes, two of the largest apertures in the world, in Hawai'i and Chile. Equipped with dual blue and red channels, 'Alopeke and Zorro deliver high-resolution imaging across optical bandpasses from 350 to 1000 nm, which has led to crucial discoveries in both stellar multiplicity and exoplanetary science. Furthermore, the broad and nonrestrictive access to these instruments, given by each Gemini Observatory partner and via the US NOIRLab open skies policy, has allowed our community to expand the applications of the instruments, supporting a wide range of scientific investigations from Solar System bodies, to morphological studies of stellar remnants, to evolved stars, to transient phenomena. This paper reviews the instrument technology and observational capabilities, and highlights key scientific contributions and discoveries of 'Alopeke and Zorro, emphasizing the enduring importance of speckle interferometry in advancing modern observational astronomy and expanding the frontiers of astronomical research.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Modeling of Planet and Substellar Atmosphere: High-Resolution Emission, Transmission, and Reflection Spectroscopy with ExoJAX2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling based on differentiable programming holds great promise for astronomy, as it can employ techniques such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, gradient-based optimization, and other machine learning techniques. This new programming paradigm has motivated us to develop the first auto-differentiable spectrum model of exoplanets and brown dwarfs, ExoJAX (Kawahara et al. 2022). ExoJAX is designed to directly calculate cross-sections as functions of temperature and pressure, rather than interpolating tabulated data, to minimize errors in high-dispersion spectra modeling. However, its application was primarily proof-of-concept and limited to narrowband high-dispersion emission spectroscopy. In this paper, we have enhanced the differentiable opacity calculation using a new fast and memory-efficient algorithm, and have developed differentiable radiative transfer schemes, including emission, transmission, and reflection spectroscopy. These enhancements significantly expand the range of applications, as demonstrated through actual atmospheric retrievals: high-dispersion emission spectra of the brown dwarf GL229 B, medium-dispersion transmission spectra of the hot Saturn WASP-39 b from JWST, and high-dispersion reflection spectra of Jupiter. We obtained a C/O ratio for GL229 B consistent with its host star, constrained WASP-39 b's radial velocity from molecular fine structures at original resolution ($R \sim 3,000$), and estimated Jupiter's metallicity consistent with previous studies.</description>

Upon custom wavelength calibration we achieve a Doppler RV precision of $&lt;$ 60 {\mbox{${\rm m\,s}^{-1}$}}. This is an improvement in RV stability of roughly 240 {\mbox{${\rm m\,s}^{-1}$}} with respect to the instrument standard. We report an average sodium flux residual of $\Delta \mathcal{F}_{NaD}/ \mathcal{F}_{\star} (\lambda) \sim$ 3.2 $\pm$ 0.4 $\%$ (8.0 $\sigma$) comparable to previous studies. Interestingly, an average Doppler shift of -6.2 $\pm$ 0.5 {\mbox{${\rm km\,s}^{-1}$}} (12.4 $\sigma$) is identified offset from the exoplanet rest frame. The velocity residuals \textit{in time} trace a blueshift (v$_{\Gamma, ingress} \sim$ -10.3 $\pm$ 1.9 {\mbox{${\rm km\,s}^{-1}$}}) to redshift (v$_{\Gamma, egress} \sim$ +4.1 $\pm$ 1.5 {\mbox{${\rm km\,s}^{-1}$}}) suggesting the origin of the observed sodium is unlikely from the atmosphere of the planet. The average Na light curves indicate a depth of $\Delta \mathcal{F}_{NaD} /\mathcal{F}_{\star} (t) \sim$ 0.47 $\pm$ 0.04 \% (11.7 $\sigma$) enduring $\lesssim$ 90 minutes with a half-max duration of $\sim$ 40.1 minutes. Frequent high-resolution spectroscopic observations will be able to characterize the periodicity of the observed Doppler shifts. Considering the origin of the transient sodium gas is of unknown geometry, a co-orbiting natural satellite may be a likely source.</description>
