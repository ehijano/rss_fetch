      <title>Chaos controlled and disorder driven phase transitions by breaking permutation symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introducing disorder in a system typically breaks symmetries and can introduce dramatic changes in its properties such as localization. At the same time, the clean system can have distinct many-body features depending on how chaotic it is. In this work the effect of permutation symmetry breaking by disorder is studied in a system which has a controllable and deterministic regular to chaotic transition. Results indicate a continuous phase transition from an area-law to a volume-law entangled phase irrespective of whether there is chaos or not, as the strength of the disorder is increased. The critical disorder strength obtained by finite size scaling, indicate a strong dependence on whether the clean system is regular or chaotic to begin with. In the process, we also obtain the critical exponents associated with this phase transition. Additionally, we find that a relatively small disorder is seen to be sufficient to delocalize a chaotic system.</description>

      <title>Predicting unobserved climate time series data at distant areas via spatial correlation using reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collecting time series data spatially distributed in many locations is often important for analyzing climate change and its impacts on ecosystems. However, comprehensive spatial data collection is not always feasible, requiring us to predict climate variables at some locations. This study focuses on a prediction of climatic elements, specifically near-surface temperature and pressure, at a target location apart from a data observation point. Our approach uses two prediction methods: reservoir computing (RC), known as a machine learning framework with low computational requirements, and vector autoregression models (VAR), recognized as a statistical method for analyzing time series data. Our results show that the accuracy of the predictions degrades with the distance between the observation and target locations. We quantitatively estimate the distance in which effective predictions are possible. We also find that in the context of climate data, a geographical distance is associated with data correlation, and a strong data correlation significantly improves the prediction accuracy with RC. In particular, RC outperforms VAR in predicting highly correlated data within the predictive range. These findings suggest that machine learning-based methods can be used more effectively to predict climatic elements in remote locations by assessing the distance to them from the data observation point in advance. Our study on low-cost and accurate prediction of climate variables has significant value for climate change strategies.</description>

      <title>Numerical spectral analysis of standing waves in quantum hydrodynamics with viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spectrum of the linearization around standing wave profiles for two quantum hydrodynamics systems with linear and nonlinear viscosity. The essential spectrum for such profiles is stable; we investigate the point spectrum using an Evans function technique. For both systems we show numerically that there exists a real unstable eigenvalue, thus providing numerical evidence for spectral instability.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and non-integrability of the double spring pendulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamics and integrability of the double spring pendulum, which has great importance in studying nonlinear dynamics, chaos, and bifurcations. Being a Hamiltonian system with three degrees of freedom, its analysis presents a significant challenge. To gain insight into the system's dynamics, we employ various numerical methods, including Lyapunov exponents spectra, phase-parametric diagrams, and Poincar\'e cross-sections. The novelty of our work lies in the integration of these three numerical methods into one powerful tool. We provide a comprehensive understanding of the system's dynamics by identifying parameter values or initial conditions that lead to hyper-chaotic, chaotic, quasi-periodic, and periodic motion, which is a novel contribution in the context of Hamiltonian systems. In the absence of gravitational potential, the system exhibits $S^1$ symmetry, and the presence of an additional first integral was identified using Lyapunov exponents diagrams. We demonstrate the effective utilisation of Lyapunov exponents as a potential indicator of first integrals and integrable dynamics. The numerical analysis is complemented by an analytical proof regarding the non-integrability of the system. This proof relies on the analysis of properties of the differential Galois group of variational equations along specific solutions of the system. To facilitate this analysis, we utilised a newly developed extension of the Kovacic algorithm specifically designed for fourth-order differential equations. Overall, our study sheds light on the intricate dynamics and integrability of the double spring pendulum, offering new insights and methodologies for further research in this field.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dynamics in Krylov Space: Methods and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of quantum systems unfolds within a subspace of the state space or operator space, known as the Krylov space. This review presents the use of Krylov subspace methods to provide a compact and computationally efficient description of quantum evolution, with emphasis on nonequilibrium phenomena of many-body systems with a large Hilbert space. It provides a comprehensive update of recent developments, focused on the quantum evolution of operators in the Heisenberg picture as well as pure and mixed states. It further explores the notion of Krylov complexity and associated metrics as tools for quantifying operator growth, their bounds by generalized quantum speed limits, the universal operator growth hypothesis, and its relation to quantum chaos, scrambling, and generalized coherent states. A comparison of several generalizations of the Krylov construction for open quantum systems is presented. A closing discussion addresses the application of Krylov subspace methods in quantum field theory, holography, integrability, quantum control, and quantum computing, as well as current open problems.</description>
