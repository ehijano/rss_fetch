      <title>Transfer Learning Enabled Transformer based Generative Adversarial Networks (TT-GAN) for Terahertz Channel Modeling and Generating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communications, ranging from 100 GHz to 10 THz, are envisioned as a promising technology for 6G and beyond wireless systems. As foundation of designing THz communications, channel modeling and characterization are crucial to scrutinize the potential of the new spectrum. However, current channel modeling and standardization heavily rely on measurements, which are both time-consuming and costly to obtain in the THz band. Here, we propose a Transfer learning enabled Transformer based Generative Adversarial Network (TT-GAN) for THz channel modeling. Specifically, as a fundamental building block, a GAN is exploited to generate channel parameters, which can substitute measurements. To greatly improve the accuracy, the first T, i.e., a transformer structure with a self-attention mechanism is incorporated in GAN. Still incurring errors compared with ground-truth measurement, the second T, i.e., a transfer learning is designed to solve the mismatch between the formulated network and measurement. The proposed TT-GAN can achieve high accuracy in channel modeling, while requiring only rather limited amount of measurement, which is a promising complementary of channel standardization that fundamentally differs from the current techniques that heavily rely on measurement.</description>

      <title>Wavelet-based Autoencoder and EfficientNet for Schizophrenia Detection from EEG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schizophrenia (SZ) is a complex mental disorder that necessitates accurate and timely diagnosis for effective treatment. Traditional methods for SZ classification often struggle to capture transient EEG features and face high computational complexity. This study proposes a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) to address these challenges by reducing dimensionality and computational complexity. Additionally, we introduce a novel approach utilizing spectral scalograms (SS) combined with EfficientNet (ENB) architectures. The SS, obtained through continuous wavelet transform, reveals temporal and spectral information of EEG signals, aiding in the identification of transient features. ENB models, through transfer learning (TL), extract discriminative features and improve SZ classification accuracy. Experimental evaluation on a comprehensive dataset demonstrates the efficacy of our approach, achieving a five-fold mean cross-validation accuracy of 98.5\% using CAE with a soft voting classifier and 99\% employing SS with the ENB7 model. These results suggest the potential of our methods to enhance SZ diagnosis, surpassing traditional deep learning (DL) and TL techniques. By leveraging CAE and ENBs, this research offers a robust framework for objective SZ classification, promoting early intervention and improved patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Harnessing DRL for URLLC in Open RAN: A Trade-off Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) alongside the emergence of Open RAN (ORAN) architectures presents unprecedented challenges and opportunities in Radio Resource Management (RRM) for next-generation communication systems. This paper presents a comprehensive trade-off analysis of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approaches designed to enhance URLLC performance within ORAN's flexible and dynamic framework. By investigating various DRL strategies for optimising RRM parameters, we explore the intricate balance between reliability, latency, and the newfound adaptability afforded by ORAN principles. Through extensive simulation results, our study compares the efficacy of different DRL models in achieving URLLC objectives in an ORAN context, highlighting the potential of DRL to navigate the complexities introduced by ORAN. The proposed study provides valuable insights into the practical implementation of DRL-based RRM solutions in ORAN-enabled wireless networks. It sheds light on the benefits and challenges of integrating DRL and ORAN for URLLC enhancements. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discourse on advancements in URLLC and ORAN, offering a roadmap for future research to pursue efficient, reliable, and flexible communication systems.</description>

      <title>Distributed Memory Approximate Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms are iterative methods for signal recovery in noisy linear systems. In some scenarios, AMP algorithms need to operate within a distributed network. To address this challenge, the distributed extensions of AMP (D-AMP, FD-AMP) and orthogonal/vector AMP (D-OAMP/D-VAMP) were proposed, but they still inherit the limitations of centralized algorithms. In this letter, we propose distributed memory AMP (D-MAMP) to overcome the IID matrix limitation of D-AMP/FD-AMP, as well as the high complexity and heavy communication cost of D-OAMP/D-VAMP. We introduce a matrix-by-vector variant of MAMP tailored for distributed computing. Leveraging this variant, D-MAMP enables each node to execute computations utilizing locally available observation vectors and transform matrices. Meanwhile, global summations of locally updated results are conducted through message interaction among nodes. For acyclic graphs, D-MAMP converges to the same mean square error performance as the centralized MAMP.</description>

      <title>Speed-enhanced Subdomain Adaptation Regression for Long-term Stable Neural Decoding in Brain-computer Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer a means to convert neural signals into control signals, providing a potential restoration of movement for people with paralysis. Despite their promise, BCIs face a significant challenge in maintaining decoding accuracy over time due to neural nonstationarities. However, the decoding accuracy of BCI drops severely across days due to the neural data drift. While current recalibration techniques address this issue to a degree, they often fail to leverage the limited labeled data, to consider the signal correlation between two days, or to perform conditional alignment in regression tasks. This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance recalibration performance. We begin with preliminary experiments that reveal the temporal patterns of neural signal changes and identify three critical elements for effective recalibration: global alignment, conditional speed alignment, and feature-label consistency. Building on these insights, we propose the Speed-enhanced Subdomain Adaptation Regression (SSAR) framework, integrating semi-supervised learning with domain adaptation techniques in regression neural decoding. SSAR employs Speed-enhanced Subdomain Alignment (SeSA) for global and speed conditional alignment of similarly labeled data, with Contrastive Consistency Constraint (CCC) to enhance the alignment of SeSA by reinforcing feature-label consistency through contrastive learning. Our comprehensive set of experiments, both qualitative and quantitative, substantiate the superior recalibration performance and robustness of SSAR.</description>

      <title>Advancing Multi-Modal Sensing Through Expandable Modality Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensing technology is widely used for comprehending the physical world, with numerous modalities explored in past decades. While there has been considerable work on multi-modality learning, they all require data of all modalities be paired. How to leverage multi-modality data with partially pairings remains an open problem. To tackle this challenge, we introduce the Babel framework, encompassing the neural network architecture, data preparation and processing, as well as the training strategies. Babel serves as a scalable pre-trained multi-modal sensing neural network, currently aligning six sensing modalities, namely Wi-Fi, mmWave, IMU, LiDAR, video, and depth. To overcome the scarcity of complete paired data, the key idea of Babel involves transforming the N-modality alignment into a series of two-modality alignments by devising the expandable network architecture. This concept is also realized via a series of novel techniques, including the pre-trained modality tower that capitalizes on available single-modal networks, and the adaptive training strategy balancing the contribution of the newly incorporated modality with the previously established modality alignment.
  Evaluation demonstrates Babel's outstanding performance on eight human activity recognition datasets, compared to various baselines e.g., the top multi-modal sensing framework, single-modal sensing networks, and multi-modal large language models. Babel not only effectively fuses multiple available modalities (up to 22% accuracy increase), but also enhance the performance of individual modality (12% averaged accuracy improvement). Case studies also highlight exciting application scenarios empowered by Babel, including cross-modality retrieval (i.e., sensing imaging), and bridging LLM for sensing comprehension.</description>

      <title>Explain EEG-based End-to-end Deep Learning Models in the Frequency Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent rise of EEG-based end-to-end deep learning models presents a significant challenge in elucidating how these models process raw EEG signals and generate predictions in the frequency domain. This challenge limits the transparency and credibility of EEG-based end-to-end models, hindering their application in security-sensitive areas. To address this issue, we propose a mask perturbation method to explain the behavior of end-to-end models in the frequency domain. Considering the characteristics of EEG data, we introduce a target alignment loss to mitigate the out-of-distribution problem associated with perturbation operations. Additionally, we develop a perturbation generator to define perturbation generation in the frequency domain. Our explanation method is validated through experiments on multiple representative end-to-end deep learning models in the EEG decoding field, using an established EEG benchmark dataset. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method, and highlight its potential to advance research in EEG-based end-to-end models.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficient Aerial RIS: Phase Shift Optimization and Trajectory Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) technology has gained significant attention due to its ability to enhance the performance of wireless communication systems. The main advantage of RIS is that it can be strategically placed in the environment to control wireless signals, enabling improvements in coverage, capacity, and energy efficiency. In this paper, we investigate a scenario in which a drone, equipped with a RIS, travels from an initial point to a target destination. In this scenario, the aerial RIS (ARIS) is deployed to establish a direct link between the base station and obstructed users. Our objective is to maximize the energy efficiency of the ARIS while taking into account its dynamic model including its velocity and acceleration along with the phase shift of the RIS. To this end, we formulate the energy efficiency problem under the constraints of the dynamic model of the drone. The studied problem is challenging to solve. To address this, we proceed as follows. First, we introduce an efficient solution that involves decoupling the phase shift optimization and the trajectory design. Specifically, the closed-form expression of the phase-shift is obtained using a convex approximation, which is subsequently integrated into the trajectory design problem. We then employ tools inspired by economic model predictive control (EMPC) to solve the resulting trajectory optimization.
  Our simulation results show a significant improvement in energy efficiency against the scenario where the dynamic model of the UAV is ignored.</description>

      <title>Access Point Selection for Bistatic Backscatter Communication in Cell-Free MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backscatter communication (BC) has emerged as a key technology to satisfy the increasing need for low-cost and green Internet-of-Things (IoT) connectivity, especially in large-scale deployments. Unlike the monostatic BC (MoBC), the bistatic BC (BiBC) has the possibility to decrease the round-trip path loss by having the carrier emitter (CE) and the reader in different locations. Therefore, this work investigates the BiBC in the context of cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks by exploring the optimal selection of CE and reader among all access points, leveraging prior knowledge about the area where the backscatter device (BD) is located. First, a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) detector to decode the BD information bits is derived. Then, the exact probability of error for this detector is obtained. In addition, an algorithm to select the best CE-reader pair for serving the specified area is proposed. Finally, simulation results show that the error performance of the BC is improved by the proposed algorithm compared to the benchmark scenario.</description>

      <title>Multipath Identification and Mitigation with FDA-MIMO Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In smart city development, the automatic detection of structures and vehicles within urban or suburban areas via array radar (airborne or vehicle platforms) becomes crucial. However, the inescapable multipath effect adversely affects the radar's capability to detect and track targets. Frequency Diversity Array (FDA)-MIMO radar offers innovative solutions in mitigating multipath due to its frequency flexibility and waveform diversity traits amongst array elements. Hence, utilizing FDA-MIMO radar, this research proposes a multipath discrimination and suppression strategy to augment target detection and suppress false alarms. The primary advancement is the transformation of conventional multipath suppression into a multipath recognition issue, thereby enabling multipath components from single-frame echo data to be separated without prior knowledge. By offsetting the distance steering vectors of different objects to be detected, the accurate spectral information corresponding to the current distance unit can be extracted during spatial spectrum estimation. The direct and multipath components are differentiated depending on whether the transmitting and receiving angles match. Additionally, to mitigate high-order multipath, the echo intensity of multipath components is reduced via joint optimization of array transmit weighting and frequency increment. The numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can identify multipath at different distances in both single-target and multi-target scenarios, which is superior to the general MIMO radar.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a Full Duplex (FD) eXtremely Large (XL) Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) node equipped with reconfigurable metasurface antennas at its transmission and reception sides is considered, which is optimized for simultaneous multi-user communications and sensing in the near-field regime at THz frequencies. We first present a novel Position Error Bound (PEB) analysis for the spatial parameters of multiple targets in the vicinity of the FD node, via the received backscattered data signals, and devise an optimization framework for its metasurface-based precoder and combiner. Then, we formulate and solve an optimization problem aiming at the downlink sum-rate maximization, while simultaneously ensuring a minimum PEB requirement for targets' localization. Our simulation results for a sub-THz system setup validate the joint near-field communications and sensing capability of the proposed FD XL MIMO scheme with metasurfaces antennas, showcasing the interplay of its various design parameters.</description>

      <title>Thermal Radiation (TR) mode: A Deployment Perspective for 5G NR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 5G New Radio NR technology is under standardization process by 3GPP to provide outline for a new radio interface for the next generation of cellular networks. The aim of the 5G networks include not only to provide enhanced capacity coverage but also support advanced services such as enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication URLLC massive Machine Type Communication mMTC. Key features of NR include Ultra lean carrier design to minimize the power consumption by limiting the always-on signal transmissions and to reduce interference in the neighboring cells . Another feature is the use of massive number of antennas for transmission as well as reception of signals. This rise in the number of antennas to provide a greater coverage brings about various challenges and impact in the system. With the increase in investigations in the mmWave frequencies, there is a need to investigate the health hazards they have on human body and the environment at large. This paper intends to provide an insight into the harmful impacts of Radio Frequency RF fields. The radiation metric to study the RF impact for far field is power density and for near field is Specific Absorption Rate SAR. These are the two main EM radiation metrics to find out the exposure due to uplink and downlink phenomenon in mobile communications. Mobile communication systems are addressed particularly to discuss the Electromagnetic EM Radiation impact as smart phones are used in close proximity to the body. A proposal in the form of Thermal Radiation TR mode is given to reduce the radiations emitted from a mobile phone. The performance of the proposed mode is validated from the results by achieving reduced power density, complexity and exposure ratio.</description>

      <title>Green and Safe 6G Wireless Networks: A Hybrid Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the wireless internet access being increasingly popular with services such as HD video streaming and so on, the demand for high data consuming applications is also rising. This increment in demand is coupled with a proportional rise in the power consumption. It is required that the internet traffic is offloaded to technologies that serve the users and contribute in energy consumption. There is a need to decrease the carbon footprint in the atmosphere and also make the network safe and reliable. In this article we propose a hybrid system of RF (Radio Frequency) and VLC (Visible Light Communication) for indoor communication that can provide communication along with illumination with least power consumption. The hybrid network is viable as it utilizes power with respect to the user demand and maintains the required Quality of ServiceQoS and Quality of Experience QoE for a particular application in use. This scheme aims for Green Communication and reduction in Electromagnetic EM Radiation. A comparative analysis for RF communication, Hybrid RF+ VLC and pure VLC is made and simulations are carried out using Python, Scilab and MathWorks tool. The proposal achieves high energy efficiency of about 37% low Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) lower incident and absorbed power density complexity and temperature elevation in human body tissues exposed to the radiation. It also enhances the battery lifetime of the mobile device in use by increasing the lifetime approximately by 7 hours as validated from the obtained results. Thus the overall network reliability and safety factor is enhanced with the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Graph Linear Canonical Transform Based on CM-CC-CM Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The graph linear canonical transform (GLCT) is presented as an extension of the graph Fourier transform (GFT) and the graph fractional Fourier transform (GFrFT), offering more flexibility as an effective tool for graph signal processing. In this paper, we introduce a GLCT based on chirp multiplication-chirp convolution-chirp multiplication decomposition (CM-CC-CM-GLCT), which irrelevant to sampling periods and without oversampling operation. Various properties and special cases of the CM-CC-CM-GLCT are derived and discussed. In terms of computational complexity, additivity, and reversibility, we compare the CM-CC-CM-GLCT and the GLCT based on the central discrete dilated Hermite function (CDDHFs-GLCT). Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the computational complexity of the CM-CC-CM-GLCT is significantly reduced. Simulation results indicate that the CM-CC-CM-GLCT achieves similar additivity to the CDDHFs-GLCT. Notably, the CM-CC-CM-GLCT exhibits better reversibility.</description>

      <title>Two-Timescale Design for Movable Antenna Array-Enabled Multiuser Uplink Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) technology can flexibly reconfigure wireless channels by adjusting antenna positions in a local region, thus owing great potential for enhancing communication performance. This letter investigates MA technology enabled multiuser uplink communications over general Rician fading channels, which consist of a base station (BS) equipped with the MA array and multiple single-antenna users. Since it is practically challenging to collect all instantaneous channel state information (CSI) by traversing all possible antenna positions at the BS, we instead propose a two-timescale scheme for maximizing the ergodic sum rate. Specifically, antenna positions at the BS are first optimized using only the statistical CSI. Subsequently, the receiving beamforming at the BS (for which we consider the three typical zero-forcing (ZF), minimum mean-square error (MMSE) and MMSE with successive interference cancellation (MMSE-SIC) receivers) is designed based on the instantaneous CSI with optimized antenna positions, thus significantly reducing practical implementation complexities. The formulated problems are highly non-convex and we develop projected gradient ascent (PGA) algorithms to effectively handle them. Simulation results illustrate that compared to conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) array, the MA array can achieve significant performance gains by reaping an additional spatial degree of freedom.</description>

      <title>MDS-ED: Multimodal Decision Support in the Emergency Department -- a Benchmark Dataset for Diagnoses and Deterioration Prediction in Emergency Medicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Benchmarking medical decision support algorithms often struggles due to limited access to datasets, narrow prediction tasks, and restricted input modalities. These limitations affect their clinical relevance and performance in high-stakes areas like emergency care, complicating replication, validation, and improvement of benchmarks.
  Methods: We introduce a dataset based on MIMIC-IV, benchmarking protocol, and initial results for evaluating multimodal decision support in the emergency department (ED). We use diverse data modalities from the first 1.5 hours of patient arrival, including demographics, biometrics, vital signs, lab values, and electrocardiogram waveforms. We analyze 1443 clinical labels across two contexts: predicting diagnoses with ICD-10 codes and forecasting patient deterioration.
  Results: Our multimodal diagnostic model achieves an AUROC score over 0.8 in a statistically significant manner for 357 out of 1428 conditions, including cardiac issues like myocardial infarction and non-cardiac conditions such as renal disease and diabetes. The deterioration model scores above 0.8 in a statistically significant manner for 13 out of 15 targets, including critical events like cardiac arrest and mechanical ventilation, ICU admission as well as short- and long-term mortality. Incorporating raw waveform data significantly improves model performance, which represents one of the first robust demonstrations of this effect.
  Conclusions: This study highlights the uniqueness of our dataset, which encompasses a wide range of clinical tasks and utilizes a comprehensive set of features collected early during the emergency after arriving at the ED. The strong performance, as evidenced by high AUROC scores across diagnostic and deterioration targets, underscores the potential of our approach to revolutionize decision-making in acute and emergency medicine.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Industrial Cohorted Federated Learning for Heterogeneous Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is the most widely adopted collaborative learning approach for training decentralized Machine Learning (ML) models by exchanging learning between clients without sharing the data and compromising privacy. However, since great data similarity or homogeneity is taken for granted in all FL tasks, FL is still not specifically designed for the industrial setting. Rarely this is the case in industrial data because there are differences in machine type, firmware version, operational conditions, environmental factors, and hence, data distribution. Albeit its popularity, it has been observed that FL performance degrades if the clients have heterogeneous data distributions. Therefore, we propose a Lightweight Industrial Cohorted FL (LICFL) algorithm that uses model parameters for cohorting without any additional on-edge (clientlevel) computations and communications than standard FL and mitigates the shortcomings from data heterogeneity in industrial applications. Our approach enhances client-level model performance by allowing them to collaborate with similar clients and train more specialized or personalized models. Also, we propose an adaptive aggregation algorithm that extends the LICFL to Adaptive LICFL (ALICFL) for further improving the global model performance and speeding up the convergence. Through numerical experiments on real-time data, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms and compare the performance with existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Detection of manatee vocalisations using the Audio Spectrogram Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Antillean manatee (\emph{Trichechus manatus}) is an endangered herbivorous aquatic mammal whose role as an ecological balancer and umbrella species underscores the importance of its conservation. An innovative approach to monitor manatee populations is passive acoustic monitoring (PAM), where vocalisations are extracted from submarine audio. We propose a novel end-to-end approach to detect manatee vocalisations building on the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST). In a transfer learning spirit, we fine-tune AST to detect manatee calls by redesigning its filterbanks and adapting a real-world dataset containing partial positive labels. Our experimental evaluation reveals the two key features of the proposed model: i) it performs on par with the state of the art without requiring hand-tuned denoising or detection stages, and ii) it can successfully identify missed vocalisations in the training dataset, thus reducing the workload of expert bioacoustic labellers. This work is a preliminary relevant step to develop novel, user-friendly tools for the conservation of the different species of manatees.</description>

      <title>Sparse Incremental Aggregation in Multi-Hop Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates federated learning (FL) in a multi-hop communication setup, such as in constellations with inter-satellite links. In this setup, part of the FL clients are responsible for forwarding other client's results to the parameter server. Instead of using conventional routing, the communication efficiency can be improved significantly by using in-network model aggregation at each intermediate hop, known as incremental aggregation (IA). Prior works [1] have indicated diminishing gains for IA under gradient sparsification. Here we study this issue and propose several novel correlated sparsification methods for IA. Numerical results show that, for some of these algorithms, the full potential of IA is still available under sparsification without impairing convergence. We demonstrate a 15x improvement in communication efficiency over conventional routing and a 11x improvement over state-of-the-art (SoA) sparse IA.</description>

Abstract: Distributed multiple-input multiple-output (D-MIMO) is a promising technology for simultaneous communication and positioning. However, phase synchronization between multiple access points in D-MIMO is challenging and methods that function without the need for phase synchronization are highly desired. Therefore, we present a method for D-MIMO that performs direct positioning of a moving device based on the delay-Doppler characteristics of the channel state information (CSI). Our method relies on particle-filter-based Bayesian inference with a state-space model. We use recent measurements from a sub-6 GHz D-MIMO OFDM system in an industrial environment to demonstrate near-centimeter accuracy under partial line-of-sight (LoS) conditions and decimeter accuracy under fully obstructed LoS.</description>

Abstract: Prior to the era of artificial intelligence and big data, wireless communications primarily followed a conventional research route involving problem analysis, model building and calibration, algorithm design and tuning, and holistic and empirical verification. However, this methodology often encountered limitations when dealing with large-scale and complex problems and managing dynamic and massive data, resulting in inefficiencies and limited performance of traditional communication systems and methods. As such, wireless communications have embraced the revolutionary impact of artificial intelligence and machine learning, giving birth to more adaptive, efficient, and intelligent systems and algorithms. This technological shift opens a road to intelligent information transmission and processing. This overview article discusses the typical roles of machine learning in intelligent wireless communications, as well as its features, challenges, and practical considerations.</description>

      <title>The Analytic Stockwell Transform and its Zeros</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent original line of research in time--frequency analysis has shifted the interest in energy maxima toward zeros. Initially motivated by the intriguing uniform spread of the zeros of the spectrogram of white noise, it has led to fruitful theoretical developments combining probability theory, complex analysis and signal processing. In this vein, the present work proposes a characterization of the zeros of the Stockwell Transform of white noise, which consists in an hybrid time--frequency multiresolution representation. First of all, an analytic version of the Stockwell Transform is designed. Then, analyticity is leveraged to establish a connection with the hyperbolic Gaussian Analytic Function, whose zero set is invariant under the isometries of the Poincar\'e disk. Finally, the theoretical spatial statistics of the zeros of the hyperbolic Gaussian Analytic Function and the empirical statistics of the zeros the Analytic Stockwell Transform of white noise are compared through intensive Monte Carlo simulations, supporting the established connection. A publicly available documented Python toolbox accompanies this work.</description>

      <title>A Physical-Layer Orchestration Framework for Open System Models of Autonomous RISs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To obviate the control of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and related overhead, recent works envisioned the concept of autonomous RISs: Intelligent devices capable of autonomously deciding their reflection states. This paradigm is enabled by hybrid RIS (HRIS), a hardware solution that integrates sensing and channel estimation (CHEST) capabilities, enabling autonomous operation. Autonomous RISs operate independently alongside other network entities, promoting open communication system models for RISs. However, this autonomy introduces a significant challenge: How to schedule the operation of the autonomous RIS over time and frequency to minimize its impact on the network? This paper introduces a physical layer (PHY) orchestration framework within a massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) network to address this challenge. Our framework highlights an engineering trade-off termed the "autonomous RIS trade-off," which examines the performance implications of autonomy. Through mathematical analysis and numerical results, we describe the HRIS feasibility region, illustrating the conditions under which autonomous RISs are viable when properly deployed.</description>

      <title>Implementing and Evaluating Security in O-RAN: Interfaces, Intelligence, and Platforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11125v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Open Radio Access Network (RAN) is a networking paradigm that builds on top of cloud-based, multi-vendor, open and intelligent architectures to shape the next generation of cellular networks for 5G and beyond. While this new paradigm comes with many advantages in terms of observatibility and reconfigurability of the network, it inevitably expands the threat surface of cellular systems and can potentially expose its components to several cyber attacks, thus making securing O-RAN networks a necessity. In this paper, we explore the security aspects of O-RAN systems by focusing on the specifications and architectures proposed by the O-RAN Alliance. We address the problem of securing O-RAN systems with a holistic perspective, including considerations on the open interfaces used to interconnect the different O-RAN components, on the overall platform, and on the intelligence used to monitor and control the network. For each focus area we identify threats, discuss relevant solutions to address these issues, and demonstrate experimentally how such solutions can effectively defend O-RAN systems against selected cyber attacks. This article is the first work in approaching the security aspect of O-RAN holistically and with experimental evidence obtained on a state-of-the-art programmable O-RAN platform, thus providing unique guideline for researchers in the field.</description>

      <title>Robust Beamforming for RIS-aided Communications: Gradient-based Manifold Meta Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10626v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has become a promising technology to realize the programmable wireless environment via steering the incident signal in fully customizable ways. However, a major challenge in RIS-aided communication systems is the simultaneous design of the precoding matrix at the base station (BS) and the phase shifting matrix of the RIS elements. This is mainly attributed to the highly non-convex optimization space of variables at both the BS and the RIS, and the diversity of communication environments. Generally, traditional optimization methods for this problem suffer from the high complexity, while existing deep learning based methods are lack of robustness in various scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce a gradient-based manifold meta learning method (GMML), which works without pre-training and has strong robustness for RIS-aided communications. Specifically, the proposed method fuses meta learning and manifold learning to improve the overall spectral efficiency, and reduce the overhead of the high-dimensional signal process. Unlike traditional deep learning based methods which directly take channel state information as input, GMML feeds the gradients of the precoding matrix and phase shifting matrix into neural networks. Coherently, we design a differential regulator to constrain the phase shifting matrix of the RIS. Numerical results show that the proposed GMML can improve the spectral efficiency by up to 7.31\%, and speed up the convergence by 23 times faster compared to traditional approaches. Moreover, they also demonstrate remarkable robustness and adaptability in dynamic settings.</description>

      <title>Physics-Enhanced Graph Neural Networks For Soft Sensing in Industrial Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is reshaping manufacturing, industrial processes, and infrastructure management. By fostering new levels of automation, efficiency, and predictive maintenance, IIoT is transforming traditional industries into intelligent, seamlessly interconnected ecosystems. However, achieving highly reliable IIoT can be hindered by factors such as the cost of installing large numbers of sensors, limitations in retrofitting existing systems with sensors, or harsh environmental conditions that may make sensor installation impractical. Soft (virtual) sensing leverages mathematical models to estimate variables from physical sensor data, offering a solution to these challenges. Data-driven and physics-based modeling are the two main methodologies widely used for soft sensing. The choice between these strategies depends on the complexity of the underlying system, with the data-driven approach often being preferred when the physics-based inference models are intricate and present challenges for state estimation. However, conventional deep learning models are typically hindered by their inability to explicitly represent the complex interactions among various sensors. To address this limitation, we adopt Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), renowned for their ability to effectively capture the complex relationships between sensor measurements. In this research, we propose physics-enhanced GNNs, which integrate principles of physics into graph-based methodologies. This is achieved by augmenting additional nodes in the input graph derived from the underlying characteristics of the physical processes. Our evaluation of the proposed methodology on the case study of district heating networks reveals significant improvements over purely data-driven GNNs, even in the presence of noise and parameter inaccuracies.</description>

      <title>PAPR Reduction with Pre-chirp Selection for Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14064v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is a promising new multicarrier technique for high-mobility communications based on discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT). By properly tuning the pre-chirp parameter and the post-chirp parameter in the DAFT, the effective channel in the DAFT domain can completely circumvent path overlap, thereby constituting a full representation of delay-Doppler profile. However, AFDM has a crucial problem of high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), stemming from randomness of modulated symbols. In this letter, a novel algorithm named grouped pre-chirp selection (GPS) is proposed to reduce PAPR by strategically varying the pre-chirp parameter across subcarrier groups. Initially, it is established that key AFDM properties are maintained when implementing GPS. Next, we proceed to detail the operational procedures of the GPS algorithm, elucidating its principle for PAPR reduction and emphasizing its computational efficiency advantages. Finally, simulation results employing the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) validate the effectiveness of the proposed GPS in reducing PAPR.</description>
