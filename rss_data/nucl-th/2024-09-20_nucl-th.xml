      <title>Systematic study of cross section for proton-induced reactions on Neodymium up to 65 MeV using TALYS-1.96 code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systematic study of theoretical estimation of nuclear cross section of charged particle induced reactions on rare earth nuclei has been carried out. The production cross section of the $^{150,149,148,146,144,143,141}$Pm and $^{149,147}$Nd nuclei were calculated theoretically via proton induced reaction on neodymium using TALYS (version 1.96) code in the default mode, with different combination of nuclear models as well as using adjusted nuclear model parameters from reaction threshold to the proton energy upto 65 MeV. The theoretically computed results were compared with the experimental results taken from EXFOR database and literature, reported by various research groups. Moreover, the effect of the various Level Density Models (LDMs), Preequilibrium Models (PEs), Optical Model Potentials (OMPs), gamma Strength Functions ($\gamma$SFs) in the cross section calculation were taken into consideration. The present theoretical analysis will help to understand the theory of nuclear reaction models and improve the evaluated nuclear data libraries.</description>

      <title>Effective nucleus-nucleus potentials for heavy-ion fusion reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the Skyrme energy density functional and the reaction $Q$-value, we propose an effective nucleus-nucleus potential for describing the capture barrier in heavy-ion fusion processes. The 443 extracted barrier heights are well reproduced with a root-mean-square (rms) error of 1.53 MeV and the rms deviations with respect to 144 TDHF capture barrier heights is only 1.05 MeV. Together with the Siwek-Wilczy\'{n}ski formula in which the three parameters are determined by the proposed effective potentials, the measured capture cross sections at energies around the barriers can be reasonably well reproduced for a series of fusion reactions induced by not only nearly spherical nuclei but also the nuclei with large deformations such as $^{154}$Sm and $^{238}$U. The shallow capture pockets and small values of the average barrier radii play a role in the reduction of the capture cross sections for $^{52,54}$Cr and $^{64}$Ni induced reactions which are related to the synthesis of new super-heavy nuclei.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking rotational correction energies in odd-mass nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear energy density functional theory (DFT) provides a microscopic approach to describing nuclear masses. By incorporating pairing correlations and deformation within DFT, nuclear masses can be predicted with sub-MeV accuracy. A crucial factor in achieving this precision is the dynamical correlation energy associated with restoring rotational symmetry, known as rotational correction energy (RCE). This correction is typically estimated using the cranking approximation in perturbation theory. In this work, we benchmark the results of these calculations against exact angular-momentum projection (AMP) for both even-even and odd-mass nuclei from light to heavy mass region, utilizing a covariant DFT framework. We find that the RCE, computed using the full moment of inertia (MoI) in the cranking approximation, closely matches the results from exact AMP for both even-even and odd-mass nuclei, with the exception of near-spherical even-even nuclei. For certain configurations in odd-mass nuclei, however, the RCEs can become abnormally small, a phenomenon linked to the divergence of the MoI. To address this, a regulator is introduced for the MoI of an odd-mass nucleus, the validity of which is examined through exact AMP calculations.</description>

      <title>Mixed phases of compact star matter in a unified mean-field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on an extended NJL model that treats baryons as clusters of quarks, we investigate the properties and microscopic structures of mixed phases for various types of first-order phase transitions in a unified manner, where the model parameters are fixed by reproducing nuclear matter properties and the binding energies of finite nuclei. In particular, based on the Thomas-Fermi approximation, we investigate the mixed phases arise from the liquid-gas phase transition of nuclear matter, chiral phase transition, and deconfinement phase transition in dense stellar matter adopting spherical and cylindrical approximations for the Wigner-Seitz cells. It is found that the geometrical structures do not emerge for chiral phases transition, while the droplet, rod, slab, tube, and bubble phases emerge sequentially as density increases for the liquid-gas and deconfinement phase transitions. Additional attractive interactions between strange quark matter and hyperons are observed as the deconfinement phase transition is entangled with chiral phase transition of $s$ quarks. The results obtained here should be useful to understand the properties and structures of dense stellar matter throughout compact stars and in particular the matter state in the core regions. Meanwhile, more extensive investigations in a three-dimensional geometry with large box sizes are necessary for our future study.</description>

      <title>Allowed and forbidden beta-decay log ft values of neutron-rich Pb and Bi isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The beta-decay log ft values for 210 215Pb 210 215Bi and 210 215Bi 210 215Po transitions in the north east region of 208Pb nuclei are estimated using the proton neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation model. The pn-QRPA equations were solved using the schematic model approach. The Woods Saxon (WS) potential was inserted as a mean field basis and nuclei were treated as spherical. Allowed Gamow Teller (GT) and first forbidden (FF) transitions were investigated in the particle hole (ph) channel. The calculated log ft values of the allowed GT and FF transitions using the pn-QRPA(WS) were found closer to the experimental values. Later we performed calculation of beta-decay rates in stellar environment. Here we solved the RPA equations in deformed Nilsson basis, both in the particle particle (pp) and particle hole (ph) channels. Allowed beta decay and unique first-forbidden (U1F) rates were calculated in stellar matter. For certain cases, the calculated U1F contribution was much more than the allowed beta decay rates under prevailing stellar conditions in line with previous findings. Increasing temperature of the stellar core affected the allowed GT rates more than the U1F rates.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and pairing in two-nucleon systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the entanglement and correlation in two-nucleon systems using isospin formalism. With the help of Slater decomposition, we derive analytical expressions for various entanglement measures. Specifically, we analyze the one- and two-mode entropies, mutual informations, and a basis-independent characteristic known as the one-body entanglement entropy. To understand the impact of pairing, we consider interactions involving isovector and isoscalar L=0 pairing terms. Our findings reveal that in certain cases, these pairing interactions lead to ground states that maximize the one-body entanglement entropy, provided that the total angular momentum and total isospin have zero projections. We provide numerical examples for the sd shell and explore the mutual informations in LS-coupled and jj-coupled single-particle bases. We find that the shell structure and angular momentum coupling significantly impact the measures of entanglement. Additionally, we establish the general implications of conserving angular momentum and isospin on the one-mode entropies, regardless of the particle number.</description>

      <title>Detecting Hyperons in neutron stars -- a machine learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a neural network classification model for detecting the presence of hyperonic degrees of freedom in neutron stars. The models take radii and/or tidal deformabilities as input and give the probability for the presence of hyperons in the neutron star composition. Different numbers of observations and different levels of uncertainty in the neutron star properties are tested. The models have been trained on a dataset of well-calibrated microscopic equations of state of neutron star matter based on a relativistic mean-field formalism. Real data and data generated from a different description of hyperonic matter are used to test the performance of the models.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Phenomenology of Identified Particle Spectra in Heavy-Ion Collisions at LHC Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A nonequilibrium state does not relax to thermodynamic equilibrium but to a state which takes into account long-living fluctuations as quasi-conserved quantities. This state is described by the relevant statistical operator within the Zubarev method to derive the nonequilibrium statistical operator. We apply this approach to the spectra of particles produced in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions at the LHC experiments at CERN. We show that controversal explanations of the low-momentum part of the spectrum given by an extended hydrodynamic-like Blast-Wave approach [with mesonic chemical potentials] and the reaction-kinetic description of the hadron resonance gas can be considered as special approximation of a more general nonequilibrium approach which takes mesonic chemical potentials into account to describe quasi-conserved particle numbers, but takes also continuum correlations, in particular resonances, into account using the Beth-Uhlenbeck [or Dashen-Ma-Bernstein] virial expansion. We present results for the spectra of pions, kaons, and protons and explain why different approaches can explain the data obtained from the ALICE experiments.</description>

      <title>$\nu$-point energy correletors with FastEEC: small-$x$ physics from LHC jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, energy correlators have emerged as a powerful tool for studying jet substructure, with promising applications such as probing the hadronization transition, analyzing the quark-gluon plasma, and improving the precision of top quark mass measurements. The projected $N$-point correlator measures correlations between $N$ final-state particles by tracking the largest separation between them, showing a scaling behavior related to DGLAP splitting functions. These correlators can be analytically continued in $N$, commonly referred to as $\nu$-correlators, allowing access to non-integer moments of the splitting functions. Of particular interest is the $\nu \to 0$ limit, where the small momentum fraction behavior of the splitting functions requires resummation. Originally, the computational complexity of evaluating $\nu$-correlators for $M$ particles scaled as $2^{2M}$, making it impractical for real-world analyses. However, by using recursion, we reduce this to $M 2^M$, and through the FastEEC method of dynamically resolving subjets, $M$ is replaced by the number of subjets. This breakthrough enables, for the first time, the computation of $\nu$-correlators for LHC data. In practice, limiting the number of subjets to 16 is sufficient to achieve percent-level precision, which we validate using known integer-$\nu$ results and convergence tests for non-integer $\nu$. We have implemented this in an update to FastEEC and conducted an initial study of power-law scaling in the perturbative regime as a function of $\nu$, using CMS Open Data on jets. The results agree with DGLAP evolution, except at small $\nu$, where the anomalous dimension saturates to a value that matches the BFKL anomalous dimension. This work is meant as a first step towards detailed experimental measurements and precision theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Towards an unbiased jet energy loss measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modifications imprinted on jets due to their interaction with Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) are assessed by comparing samples of jets produced in nucleus-nucleus collisions and proton-proton collisions. The standard procedure ignores the effect of bin migration by comparing specific observables for jet populations at the same reconstructed jet transverse momentum ($p_T$). Since jet $p_T$ is itself modified by interaction with QGP, all such comparisons confound QGP induced modifications with changes that are simply a consequence of comparing jets that started out differently. The quantile matching procedure introduced by Brewer et al. directly estimates average fractional jet energy loss ($Q_{AA}$) and can thus mitigate this $p_T$ migration effect. In this work, we validate the procedure in more realistic scenarios that include medium response. We study the evolution of $Q_{AA}$ with jet radius, its sensitivity to minimum particle $p_T$ and medium response as implemented in two different models for jet evolution in heavy-ion collisions. Further, we use this procedure to establish that the difference between inclusive jet and $\gamma+$jet nuclear modification factors ($R_{AA}$) is dominated by differences in the spectral shape, leaving the colour charge of the jet initiating parton with a lesser role to play. Additionally, we compare $Q_{AA}$ to an experimentally proposed proxy for fractional jet energy loss, $S_{loss}$, showing that both quantities are similar, although the former provides a more clear physical interpretation. Finally, we show the size of the $p_T$ migration correction for four different substructure observables and how to reliably use the quantile procedure experimentally to improve existing measurements.</description>

      <title>Magnetized neutral 2SC color superconductivity and possible origin of the inner magnetic field of magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper the neutral 2SC phase of color superconductivity is investigated in the presence of a magnetic field and for diquark coupling constants and baryonic densities that are expected to characterize neutron stars. Specifically, the behavior of the charged gluons Meissner masses is investigated in the parameter region of interest taking into account in addition the contribution of a rotated magnetic field. It is found that up to moderately-high diquark coupling constants the mentioned Meissner masses become tachyonic independently of the applied magnetic field amplitude, hence signalizing the chromomagnetic instability of this phase. To remove the instability, it is proposed the restructuring of the system ground state, which now will be formed by vortices of the rotated charged gluons. These vortices boost the applied magnetic field having the most significant increase for relatively low applied magnetic fields. Finally, considering that with the stellar rotational frequency observed for magnetars a field of order $10^8$ G can be generated by dynamo effect. Then, we show that by the boosting effect just described the field can be amplified to $10^{17}$ G that is in the range of inner core fields expected for magnetars. Thus, we conclude that the described mechanism could be the one responsible for the large fields characterizing magnetars if the core of this compact objects are formed by neutral 2SC matter.</description>

      <title>Medium modifications of heavy-flavor jet angularities in high-energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first theoretical study of heavy-flavor jet angularities ($\lambda_{\kappa}^{\alpha}$) in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=$ 5.02 TeV. The initial production of heavy-flavor jets is carried out using the POWHEG+PYTHIA8 prescription, while the jet evolution in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is described by the SHELL transport model. In p+p collisions, we observe narrower angularity distributions for the D$^0$-tagged jets compared to inclusive jets, consistent with the preliminary ALICE results. We then demonstrate that jet quenching in the QGP may slightly widen the angularity distributions of both inclusive and D$^0$-tagged jets in Pb+Pb collisions relative to p+p at $10&lt; p_{\rm T,jet} &lt; 20$ GeV/c. Additionally, by comparing the averaged angularities $\langle \lambda^{\kappa}_{\alpha} \rangle$ of inclusive, D$^0$-tagged and B$^0$-tagged jets with varying $\alpha$ and $\kappa$, we show that the larger the quark mass is, the lower the jet's $\langle \lambda^{\kappa}_{\alpha} \rangle$ values are. As a result of the slenderer initial distribution, we predict that as compared to inclusive jets, the heavy-flavor jets, especially the B$^0$-tagged one, will suffer more distinct modifications of $\langle \lambda^{\kappa}_{\alpha} \rangle$ in Pb+Pb relative to p+p at $10 &lt; p_{\rm T,jet} &lt; 20$ GeV/c. For a larger jet radius, a more significant broadening of jet angularities could be obtained because of the enhanced contributions of the wide-angle particles. It is also noted that the angularity distributions of inclusive and D$^0$-tagged jets become narrower in Pb+Pb collisions relative to p+p at $p_{\rm T,jet} &gt; 20$ GeV/c due to the strong influence of the selection bias.</description>

      <title>Flavor Hierarchy of Jet Energy Correlators inside the Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heavy flavor jets provide ideal tools to probe the mass effect on jet substructure in both vacuum and quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Energy-energy correlator (EEC) is an excellent jet substructure observable owning to its strong sensitivity to jet physics at different scales. We perform a complete realistic simulation on medium modification of heavy and light flavor jet EEC in heavy-ion collisions. A clear flavor hierarchy is observed for jet EEC in both vacuum and QGP due to the mass effect. The medium modification of inclusive jet EEC at different angular scales exhibits very rich structure: suppression at intermediate angles, and enhancement at small and large angles, which can be well explained by the interplay of mass effect, energy loss, medium-induced radiation and medium response. These unique features of jet EEC are shown to probe the physics of jet-medium interaction at different scales, and can be readily validated by upcoming experiments.</description>

Abstract: By considering baryons as clusters of three quarks, we extend the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model to describe baryonic matter, quark matter, and their transitions in a unified manner, where the Dirac sea and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking are considered. In particular, a density-dependent structural function $\alpha_S$ is introduced to modulate the four(six)-point interaction strengths to reproduce the baryon masses in vacuum and medium. Vector interactions are considered with the exchange of $\omega$ and $\rho$ mesons, where the density-dependent coupling constants are fixed by reproducing nuclear matter properties as well as the $\Lambda$-hyperon potential depth in nuclear medium. As density increases, quarks will emerge as quasi-free particles and coexist with baryons. This phase is interpreted as quarkyonic matter, where quarks are restricted to the lowest energy states in the presence of baryons, i.e., quarks are still confined. Similar to the treatment of $\alpha$ clustering in nuclear medium, a Pauli blocking term is added to baryon masses so that baryons eventually become unbound in the presence of a quark Fermi Sea. Then at large enough densities baryons vanish and a Mott transition takes place, we consider such a transition as deconfinement phase transition. Depending on the strengths of Pauli blocking term and quark-vector meson couplings, both first-order and continues phase transitions are observed for quarkyonic, chiral, and deconfinement phase transitions. The corresponding compact star structures are then investigated and confronted with various astrophysical constraints.</description>

      <title>Constraining neutron star matter from the slope of the mass-radius curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the implications of information about local derivatives from the mass-radius diagram in neutron star matter. It is expected that the next generation of gravitational wave and electromagnetic detectors will allow the determination of the neutron star radius and mass with a small uncertainty. Observations of neutron stars clustered around a given neutron star mass allow the estimation of local derivatives in the $M(R)$ diagram, which can be used to constrain neutron star properties. From a model-independent description of the neutron star equation of state, it is shown that a $M(R)$ curve with a negative slope at 1.4$M_\odot$ predicts a $2M_\odot$ neutron star radius below 12 km. Furthermore, a maximum mass below 2.3$M_\odot$ is obtained if the $M(R)$ slope is negative in the whole range of masses above $1M_\odot$, and a maximum mass above 2.4$M_\odot$ requires the $M(R)$ slope to be positive in some range of masses. Constraints on the mass-radius curve of neutron stars will place strong constraints on microscopic models.</description>

      <title>Hard Thermal Loop -- theory and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this review, we present the key aspects of modern thermal perturbation theory based on the hard thermal loop (HTL) approximation, including its theoretical foundations and applications within quantum electrodynamics (QED) and quantum chromodynamics (QCD) plasmas. To maintain conciseness, we focus on scenarios in thermal equilibrium, examining a variety of physical quantities and settings. Specifically, we explore both bulk thermodynamic properties and real-time observables in high-temperature domains relevant to heavy-ion physics.</description>

      <title>Studying the $\Xi(2030)$ as a predominantly $\bar{K}^{*}\Sigma$ molecular state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since its discovery in 1977, the spin-parity of $\Xi(2030)$ has not been fully determined experimentally. The latest Particle Data Group (PDG) listing suggests it may be a baryon with $J=5/2$. Therefore, studying the mass spectrum and decay properties of $\Xi(2030)$ has become a current hot topic to definitively establish its spin-parity. As the three-quark model fails to explain $\Xi(2030)$, we previously proposed it may be a molecule primarily composed of $\bar{K}^{}\Sigma$ with $J^P=5/2^{+}$, based on its mass spectrum study. To verify its molecular state interpretation, this work proposes studying the strong decays of $\Xi(2030)$ assuming it is a $P$-wave $J^P=5/2^{+}$ meson-baryon molecule predominantly composed of $\bar{K}^{}\Sigma$. We calculated all experimentally measured two-body and three-body final state decay widths of $\Xi(2030)$, including $\Xi(2030) \to \bar{K}\Lambda, \bar{K}\Sigma, \pi\Xi, \pi\Xi^{*}$, and $\Xi(2030) \to \pi\pi\Xi, \pi\bar{K}\Sigma, \pi\bar{K}\Lambda$. The results indicate that both the total decay width and partial decay widths agree well with experimental values within the error margins. This supports that $\Xi(2030)$ is a molecule with spin-parity $J^P = 5/2^{+}$, predominantly composed of $\bar{K}^{*}\Sigma$. Compared to the experimental central values, our results are slightly smaller, which suggests that $\Xi(2030)$ may contain additional components besides meson-baryon molecular components, such as three quark structures.</description>

      <title>Unified study of nucleon and $\Delta$ baryon spectra and their strong decays with chiral dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we systematically study both the mass spectra and strong decays of the nucleon and $\Delta$ resonances up to the $N=2$ shell within a unified quark model framework with chiral dynamics. In this framework we achieve a good description of the strong decay properties of the well-established nucleon and $\Delta$ resonances. Meanwhile, the mass reversal between $N(1440)1/2^{+}$ as the first radial excitation state and the $1P$-wave nucleon resonances can be explained. We show that the three-body spin-orbit potential arising from the one-gluon exchange can cause a large configuration mixing between $N(1520)3/2^-$ and $N(1700)3/2^-$, and is also responsible for the large splitting between $\Delta(1600)1/2^-$ and $\Delta(1700)3/2^-$. Some of these baryon resonances turn to weakly couple to the $N\pi$, $N\eta$, $K\Lambda$, and $K\Sigma$ channels, which may answer the question why they have not been established in these channels via the $\pi N$ and $\gamma N$ scatterings. It shows that these ``missing resonances" may have large potentials to be established in the $N\pi\pi$ final state due to their large decay rates into either the $\Delta(1232)$ or $1P$-wave nucleon resonances via the pionic decays. Further experimental search for their signals in charmonium decays at BESIII is thus strongly recommended.</description>
