      <title>An Effective Information Theoretic Framework for Channel Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel pruning is a promising method for accelerating and compressing convolutional neural networks. However, current pruning algorithms still remain unsolved problems that how to assign layer-wise pruning ratios properly and discard the least important channels with a convincing criterion. In this paper, we present a novel channel pruning approach via information theory and interpretability of neural networks. Specifically, we regard information entropy as the expected amount of information for convolutional layers. In addition, if we suppose a matrix as a system of linear equations, a higher-rank matrix represents there exist more solutions to it, which indicates more uncertainty. From the point of view of information theory, the rank can also describe the amount of information. In a neural network, considering the rank and entropy as two information indicators of convolutional layers, we propose a fusion function to reach a compromise of them, where the fusion results are defined as ``information concentration''. When pre-defining layer-wise pruning ratios, we employ the information concentration as a reference instead of heuristic and engineering tuning to provide a more interpretable solution. Moreover, we leverage Shapley values, which are a potent tool in the interpretability of neural networks, to evaluate the channel contributions and discard the least important channels for model compression while maintaining its performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and promising performance of our method. For example, our method improves the accuracy by 0.21% when reducing 45.5% FLOPs and removing 40.3% parameters for ResNet-56 on CIFAR-10. Moreover, our method obtains loss in Top-1/Top-5 accuracies of 0.43%/0.11% by reducing 41.6% FLOPs and removing 35.0% parameters for ResNet-50 on ImageNet.</description>

      <title>Optimal UCA Design for OAM Based Wireless Backhaul Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM), which is considered as a novel way to achieve high capacity, has been attracted much attention recently. OAM signals emitted by uniform circular array (UCA) are widely regarded to go through the Bessel-form channels. However, the channel gains corresponding to the Bessel-form channels are with low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) on OAM-modes and it is difficult to achieve high capacity using all OAM modes. To achieve maximum capacity offered by OAM multiplexing for wireless backhaul communications, in this paper we propose the optimal UCA design, which selects the optimal OAM-modes and radius of receive UCA. We formulate the capacity maximization problem and divide it into two subproblems for obtaining the corresponding optimal UCA design for OAM multiplexing based wireless backhaul communications. In particular, the optimal radius of the receive UCA is firstly derived. Then, we propose an mode selection scheme to choose appropriate OAM-modes for data transmission to maximize the capacity. Extensive simulations obtained validate that the capacity of OAM multiplexing can be significantly increased with our developed scheme.</description>

      <title>Jammer Mitigation in Absorptive RIS-Assisted Uplink NOMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising technology for next-generation wireless communication systems due to its enhanced spectral efficiency. In this paper, we consider an uplink NOMA system operating together with a high-dimensional absorptive reconfigurable intelligent surface (A-RIS). We aim to minimize the total power transmitted by the users in order to meet signal-to-interference-plus-noise constraints at the base station in the presence of a jammer. We propose an iterative algorithm to solve the high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem using linear programming to find the transmit powers and a fractional programming algorithm based on the Dinkelbach algorithm with a sequential convex relaxation procedure to optimize the reflection coefficients. We show that our algorithm converges on large optimization problems, with a jammer comprising as many as $64$ antennas, and an A-RIS with $128$ elements. Our numerical results show that, compared with a standard RIS that reflects all impinging energy, the A-RIS can dramatically reduce the users' required transmit power and successfully mitigate interference from the jammer. The absorption capability of the A-RIS is in particular useful in cases when the number of jammer antennas is of the same order as the number of A-RIS elements.</description>

      <title>RIS-Aided Backscattering Tag-to-Tag Networks: Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backscattering tag-to-tag networks (BTTNs) represent a passive radio frequency identification (RFID) system that enables direct communication between tags within an external radio frequency (RF) field. However, low spectral efficiency and short-range communication capabilities, along with the ultra-low power nature of the tags, create significant challenges for reliable and practical applications of BTTNs. To address these challenges, this paper introduces integrating an indoor reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) into BTTN and studying RIS's impact on the system's performance. To that end, we first derive compact analytical expressions of the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver tag by exploiting the moment matching technique. Then, based on the derived PDF and CDF, we further derive analytical expressions of outage probability (OP), bit error rate (BER), and average capacity (AC) rate. Eventually, the Monte Carlo simulation is used to validate the accuracy of the analytical results, revealing that utilizing RIS can greatly improve the performance of BTTNs in terms of AC, BER, OP, and coverage region relative to traditional BTTNs setups that do not incorporate RIS.</description>

      <title>Secure Integrated Sensing and Communication Under Correlated Rayleigh Fading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a secure integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scenario, in which a signal is transmitted through a state-dependent wiretap channel with one legitimate receiver with which the transmitter communicates and one honest-but-curious target that the transmitter wants to sense. The secure ISAC channel is modeled as two state-dependent fast-fading channels with correlated Rayleigh fading coefficients and independent additive Gaussian noise components. Delayed channel outputs are fed back to the transmitter to improve the communication performance and to estimate the channel state sequence. We establish and illustrate an achievable secrecy-distortion region for degraded secure ISAC channels under correlated Rayleigh fading. We also evaluate the inner bound for a large set of parameters to derive practical design insights for secure ISAC methods. The presented results include in particular parameter ranges for which the secrecy capacity of a classical wiretap channel setup is surpassed and for which the channel capacity is approached.</description>

      <title>Secure Transmission in Cell-Free Massive MIMO under Active Eavesdropping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study secure communications in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems with multi-antenna access points (APs) and protective partial zero-forcing (PPZF) precoding. In particular, we consider an active eavesdropping attack, where an eavesdropper contaminates the uplink channel estimation phase by sending an identical pilot sequence with a legitimate user of interest. We formulate an optimization problem for maximizing the received signal-to-noise ratio (SINR) at the legitimate user, subject to a maximum allowable SINR at the eavesdropper and maximum transmit power at each AP, while guaranteeing specific SINR requirements on other legitimate users. The optimization problem is solved using a path-following algorithm. We also propose a large-scale-based greedy AP selection scheme to improve the secrecy spectral efficiency (SSE). Finally, we propose a simple method for identifying the presence of an eavesdropper within the system. Our findings show that PPZF can substantially outperform the conventional maximum-ratio transmission (MRT) scheme by providing around 2-fold improvement in the SSE compared to the MRT scheme. More importantly, for PPZF precoding scheme, our proposed AP selection can achieve a remarkable SSE gain of up to 220%, while our power optimization approach can provide an additional gain of up to 55% compared with a CF-mMIMO system with equal power allocation.</description>

      <title>A New Method for the Identification of a Wiener-Hammerstein Model in a Communication Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new algorithm to identify a Wiener-Hammerstein system. This model represents a communication channel where two linear filters are separated by a non-linear function modelling an amplifier. The algorithm enables to recover each parameter of the model, namely the two linear filters and the non-linear function. This is to be opposed with estimation algorithms which identify the equivalent Volterra system. The algorithm is composed of three main steps and uses three distinct pilot sequences. The estimation of the parameters is done in the time domain via several instances of the least-square algorithm. However, arguments based on the spectral representation of the signals and filters are used to design the pilot sequences. We also provide an analysis of the proposed algorithm. We estimate, via the theory and simulations, the minimum required size of the pilot sequences to achieve a target mean squared error between the output of the true channel and the output of the estimated model. We obtain that the new method requires reduced-size pilot sequences: The sum of the length of the pilot sequences is approximately the one needed to estimate the convolutional product of the two linear filters with a back-off. A comparison with the Volterra approach is also provided.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Learning for Task-Oriented Semantic Communications Over MIMO Channels: An Information-Theoretic Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of end-to-end (E2E) design of learning and communication in a task-oriented semantic communication system. In particular, we consider a multi-device cooperative edge inference system over a wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiple access channel, where multiple devices transmit extracted features to a server to perform a classification task. We formulate the E2E design of feature encoding, MIMO precoding, and classification as a conditional mutual information maximization problem. However, it is notoriously difficult to design and train an E2E network that can be adaptive to both the task dataset and different channel realizations. Regarding network training, we propose a decoupled pretraining framework that separately trains the feature encoder and the MIMO precoder, with a maximum a posteriori (MAP) classifier employed at the server to generate the inference result. The feature encoder is pretrained exclusively using the task dataset, while the MIMO precoder is pretrained solely based on the channel and noise distributions. Nevertheless, we manage to align the pretraining objectives of each individual component with the E2E learning objective, so as to approach the performance bound of E2E learning. By leveraging the decoupled pretraining results for initialization, the E2E learning can be conducted with minimal training overhead. Regarding network architecture design, we develop two deep unfolded precoding networks that effectively incorporate the domain knowledge of the solution to the decoupled precoding problem. Simulation results on both the CIFAR-10 and ModelNet10 datasets verify that the proposed method achieves significantly higher classification accuracy compared to various baselines.</description>

      <title>Replica Analysis for Ensemble Techniques in Variable Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variable selection is a problem of statistics that aims to find the subset of the $N$-dimensional possible explanatory variables that are truly related to the generation process of the response variable. In high-dimensional setups, where the input dimension $N$ is comparable to the data size $M$, it is difficult to use classic methods based on $p$-values. Therefore, methods based on the ensemble learning are often used. In this review article, we introduce how the performance of these ensemble-based methods can be systematically analyzed using the replica method from statistical mechanics when $N$ and $M$ diverge at the same rate as $N,M\to\infty, M/N\to\alpha\in(0,\infty)$. As a concrete application, we analyze the power of stability selection (SS) and the derandomized knockoff (dKO) with the $\ell_1$-regularized statistics in the high-dimensional linear model. The result indicates that dKO provably outperforms the vanilla knockoff and the standard SS, while increasing the bootstrap resampling rate in SS might further improve the detection power.</description>

      <title>Further Investigation on Differential Properties of the Generalized Ness-Helleseth Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $n$ be an odd positive integer, $p$ be a prime with $p\equiv3\pmod4$, $d_{1} = {{p^{n}-1}\over {2}} -1 $ and $d_{2} =p^{n}-2$. The function defined by $f_u(x)=ux^{d_{1}}+x^{d_{2}}$ is called the generalized Ness-Helleseth function over $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$, where $u\in\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$. It was initially studied by Ness and Helleseth in the ternary case. In this paper, for $p^n \equiv 3 \pmod 4$ and $p^n \ge7$, we provide the necessary and sufficient condition for $f_u(x)$ to be an APN function. In addition, for each $u$ satisfying $\chi(u+1) = \chi(u-1)$, the differential spectrum of $f_u(x)$ is investigated, and it is expressed in terms of some quadratic character sums of cubic polynomials, where $\chi(\cdot)$ denotes the quadratic character of $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$.</description>

      <title>Information-Based Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Absolute Tracking in Cislunar Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The resurgence of lunar operations requires advancements in cislunar navigation and Space Situational Awareness (SSA). Challenges associated to these tasks have created an interest in autonomous planning, navigation, and tracking technologies that operate with little ground-based intervention. This research introduces a trajectory planning tool for a low-thrust mobile observer, aimed at maximizing navigation and tracking performance with satellite-to-satellite relative measurements. We formulate an expression for the information gathered over an observation period based on the mutual information between augmented observer/target states and the associated measurement set collected. We then develop an optimal trajectory design problem for a mobile observer, balancing information gain and control effort, and solve this problem with a Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) approach. The developed methods are demonstrated in scenarios involving spacecraft in the cislunar regime, demonstrating the potential for improved autonomous navigation and tracking.</description>

      <title>On Effective Convergence in Fekete's Lemma and Related Combinatorial Problems in Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.09896v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fekete's lemma is a well known result from combinatorial mathematics that shows the existence of a limit value related to super- and subadditive sequences of real numbers. In this paper, we analyze Fekete's lemma in view of the arithmetical hierarchy of real numbers by Zheng and Weihrauch and fit the results into an information-theoretic context. We introduce special sets associated to super- and subadditive sequences and prove their effective equivalence to \(\Sigma_1\) and \(\Pi_1\). Using methods from the theory established by Zheng and Weihrauch, we then show that the limit value emerging from Fekete's lemma is, in general, not a computable number. Given a sequence that additionally satisfies non-negativity, we characterize under which conditions the associated limit value can be computed effectively and investigate the corresponding modulus of convergence. Subsidiarily, we prove a theorem concerning the structural differences between computable sequences of computable numbers and computable sequences of rational numbers. We close the paper by a discussion on how our findings affect common problems from information theory.</description>

Abstract: We give an operational definition of information-theoretic resources within a given multipartite classical or quantum correlation. We present our causal model that serves as the source coding side of this correlation and introduce a novel concept of resource rate. We argue that, beyond classical secrecy, additional resources exist that are useful for the security of distributed computing problems, which can be captured by the resource rate. Furthermore, we establish a relationship between resource rate and an extension of Shannon's logarithmic information measure, namely, total correlation.</description>

Abstract: Reliability of sequential hypothesis testing can be greatly improved when decision maker is given the freedom to adaptively take an action that determines the distribution of the current collected sample. Such advantage of sampling adaptivity has been realized since Chernoff's seminal paper in 1959 [1]. While a large body of works have explored and investigated the gain of adaptivity, in the general multiple-hypothesis setting, the fundamental limits of individual error probabilities have not been fully understood. In particular, in the asymptotic regime as the expected stopping time tends to infinity, the error exponents are only characterized in specific cases, such as that of the total error probability. In this paper, we consider a general setup of active sequential multiple-hypothesis testing where at each time slot, a temporally varying subset of data sources (out of a known set) emerges from which the decision maker can select to collect samples, subject to a family of expected selection budget constraints. The selection of sources, understood as the "action" at each time slot, is constrained in a predefined action space. At the end of each time slot, the decision maker either decides to make the inference on the $M$ hypotheses, or continues to observe the data sources for the next time slot. The optimal tradeoffs among $M(M-1)$ types of error exponents are characterized. A companion asymptotically optimal test that strikes the balance between exploration and exploitation is proposed to achieve any target error exponents within the region. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in the literature to identify such tradeoffs among error exponents, and it uncovers the tension among different action taking policies even in the basic setting of Chernoff [1].</description>

      <title>Beam-align: distributed user association for mmWave networks with multi-connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.13166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the spectrum below 6 GHz bands is insufficient to meet the high bandwidth requirements of 5G use cases, 5G networks expand their operation to mmWave bands. However, operation at these bands has to cope with a high penetration loss and susceptibility to blocking objects. Beamforming and multi-connectivity (MC) can together mitigate these challenges. But, to design such an optimal user association scheme leveraging these two features is non-trivial and computationally expensive. Previous studies either considered a fixed MC degree for all users or overlooked beamforming. Driven by the question what is the optimal degree of MC for each user in a mmWave network, we formulate a user association scheme that maximizes throughput considering beam formation and MC. Our numerical analysis shows that there is no one-size-fits-all degree of optimal MC; it depends on the number of users, their rate requirements, locations, and the maximum number of active beams at a BS.Based on the optimal association, we design BEAM-ALIGN: an efficient heuristic with polynomial-time complexity O(|U|log|U|), where |U| is the number of users. Moreover, BEAM-ALIGN only uses local BS information - i.e. the received signal quality at the user. Differing from prior works, BEAM-ALIGN considers beamforming, multiconnectivity and line-of-sight probability. Via simulations, we show that BEAM-ALIGN performs close to optimal in terms of per-user capacity and satisfaction while it outperforms frequently-used signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio based association schemes. We then show that BEAM-ALIGN has a robust performance under various challenging scenarios: the presence of blockers, rain, and clustered users.</description>
