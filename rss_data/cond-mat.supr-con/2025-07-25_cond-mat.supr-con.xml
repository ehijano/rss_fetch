      <title>Persistent paramagnons in high-temperature infinite-layer nickelate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in hole-doped SmNiO$_2$, exhibiting the record-high transition temperature $T_c$ among infinite-layer (IL) nickelates, has opened a new avenue for exploring design principles of superconductivity. Experimentally determining the electronic structure and magnetic interactions in this new system is crucial to elucidating the mechanism behind the enhanced superconductivity. Here, we report a Ni $L$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) study of superconducting Sm-based IL nickelate thin films Sm$_{1-x-y-z}$Eu$_x$Ca$_y$Sr$_z$NiO$_2$ (SECS). Dispersive paramagnonic excitations are observed in both optimally and overdoped SECS samples, supporting a spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing scenario. However, despite the two-fold enhancement of $T_c$ in the Sm-based nickelates compared to their Pr-based counterparts, the effective exchange coupling strength is reduced by approximately $20\%$. This behavior contrasts with hole-doped cuprates, where magnetic interactions correlate positively with $T_c$, highlighting essential differences in their superconducting mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of plasmon modes in layered Lindhard metals and strange metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The enigmatic strange metal remains one of the central unsolved problems of 21st century science. Understanding this phase of matter requires knowledge of the momentum- and energy-resolved dynamic charge susceptibility, $\chi(q,\omega)$, especially at finite momentum. Inelastic electron scattering (EELS), performed in either transmission (T-EELS) or reflection (R-EELS) geometries, is a powerful probe of $\chi(q,\omega)$. For the prototypical strange metal Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$, T-EELS, R-EELS, and infrared (IR) spectroscopy agree at $q \sim 0$, all revealing a highly damped plasmon near 1 eV. At larger $q$, however, EELS results show unresolved discrepancies. Since IR data are highly reproducible, it is advantageous to use IR data to calculate what the expected EELS response should be at modest $q$. Building on prior R-EELS work [J. Chen \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. B. \textbf{109}, 045108 (2024)], we extend this approach to T-EELS for finite stacks of metallic layers, comparing a "textbook" Lindhard metal to a strange metal. In the Lindhard case, the low-$q$ response is dominated by long-lived, standing wave plasmon modes arising from interlayer Coulomb coupling, with in-plane dispersions that resemble the well-known Fetter modes of layered metals. This behavior depends only on the geometry and the long-ranged nature of the Coulomb interaction, and is largely insensitive to layer details. At larger $q$, the response reflects the microscopic properties of individual layers. For the strange metal, calculations based on IR data predict a highly damped plasmon with weak dispersion and no distinct surface mode. While our results match IR and R-EELS at low $q$, they do not reproduce any published EELS spectra at large $q$, highlighting unresolved discrepancies that demand further experimental investigation.</description>

      <title>Variational Monte Carlo Optimization of Topological Chiral Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the variational Monte Carlo calculation for recently proposed chiral superconducting states driven by strong Coulomb interactions. We compare the resulting energetics of these electronic phases for the electron dispersion relation $E_k = c_2 k^2+c_4 k^4$. Motivated by the recent discovery of chiral superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene systems, we apply our analysis to relevant parameter regimes. We demonstrate that topological chiral superconducting phases (including a spin-unpolarized state) can be energetically favored over the spin-valley polarized Fermi liquid above the density of Wigner crystal phase. Our results show that the preference for chiral superconductivity is strongest when $c_2$ lies between zero and a negative value, corresponding to a system on the verge of forming a hole pocket around $k=0$. This finding suggests that superconductivity can arise from pure repulsive Coulomb interactions in systems with an almost flat band bottom, without relying on the pairing instability of a Fermi surface. This mechanism opens a new pathway to superconductivity beyond the conventional BCS mechanism.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity from dual-surface carriers in rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intrinsic rhombohedral graphene hosts an unusual low-energy electronic wavefunction, predominantly localized at its outer crystal faces with negligible presence in the bulk. Increasing the number of graphene layers amplifies the density of states near charge neutrality, greatly enhancing the susceptibility to symmetry-breaking phases. Here, we report superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene arising from an unusual charge-delocalized semimetallic normal state, characterized by coexisting valence- and conduction-band Fermi pockets split to opposite crystal surfaces. In octalayer graphene, the superconductivity appears in five apparently distinct pockets for each sign of an external electric displacement field ($D$). In a moir\'e superlattice sample where heptalayer graphene is aligned on one side to hexagonal boron nitride, two pockets of superconductivity emerge from a single sharp resistive feature. At higher $D$ the same resistive feature additionally induces an $h/e^{2}$-quantized anomalous Hall state at dopings near one electron per moir\'e unit cell. Our findings reveal a novel superconducting regime in multilayer graphene and create opportunities for coupling to nearby topological states.</description>

      <title>Phase transition in quasi-flat band superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate superconductivity in a two-dimensional material described by a two-band heavy-fermion model, where hybridization between a dispersive band and a flat band introduces a quasi-flat dispersion to the otherwise localized flat-band electrons. The enhanced density of states in the quasi-flat band raises the crossover temperature for an inhomogeneous preformed Cooper pair state. The superconducting phase stiffness and the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) temperature are governed by the Fermi surface contribution induced by hybridization. We compute the crossover and BKT temperatures, revealing a dome-like dependence on doping. When the pairing amplitude exceeds the energy width of the quasi-flat band, superconductivity is suppressed, and the inhomogeneous pairing regime expands linearly with increasing interaction strength. However, in the opposite case, the BKT temperature reaches a maximum value that is only numerically less than the energy width of the quasi-flat band. We also discuss our results in the context of superconductivity in graphene-based systems.</description>

      <title>Four-terminal Josephson junctions: diode effects, anomalous currents and transverse currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19376v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a multi-terminal Josephson junction consisting of a central spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) region with an in-plane Zeeman field connected to four superconducting terminals. This setup allows for the simultaneous measurement of both longitudinal and transverse Josephson currents in response to a phase bias and provides a platform to probe the planar Hall effect in superconducting transport. We find that the system exhibits anomalous Josephson effect (AJE) and Josephson diode effect (JDE) when the symmetry between opposite momentum modes is broken in SOC region. Specifically, breaking the symmetry between $k_x$ and $-k_x$ results in JDE and AJE in the longitudinal Josephson current, while breaking the symmetry between $k_y$ and $-k_y$ leads to a finite transverse Josephson current that also exhibits JDE and AJE. Transverse Josephson diode effect coefficient attains values as large as $500\%$ for realistic set of parameters. Furthermore, for specific parameter choices, the current-phase relation in the transverse direction supports unidirectional transport, highlighting its potential for superconducting circuit applications. Our setup offers a new route to engineering nonreciprocal superconducting transport.</description>

      <title>Superfluid quantum criticality and the thermal evolution of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The neutron star starts to cool down shortly after its birth by emitting neutrinos. As it becomes cold enough, the Cooper pairs of neutrons are formed, triggering a superfluid transition. Previous studies on neutron superfluidity are focused on finite-temperature transitions, with little attention paid to the potentially important quantum critical phenomena associated with superfluidity. Here, we provide the first theoretical analysis of superfluid quantum criticality, concentrating on its impact on neutron star cooling. Extensive calculations found that superfluidity occurs within a finite range of neutron star density $\rho$. The density serves as a non-thermal parameter for superfluid quantum phase transition. In a broad quantum critical region, gapless neutrons are strongly coupled to the quantum critical fluctuations of superfluid order parameter. We handle this coupling using both perturbation theory and renormalization group method and find that it leads to non-Fermi liquid behavior, which yields a logarithmic $T\ln(1/T)$ correction to the neutron specific heat $c_{\mathrm{n}}\propto T$ and also dramatically alters the neutrino emissivity. Quantum critical phenomena emerge much earlier than the onset of superfluidity and persist throughout almost the entire lifetime of a neutron star. At low temperatures, these phenomena coexist with superfluidity in the neutron star interior but occupy different layers. We incorporate superfluid quantum criticality into the theoretical description of neutron star cooling and show that it substantially prolongs the thermal relaxation time. By varying the strength of superfluid fluctuations and other quantities, we obtain an excellent fit to the observed cooling data of a number of neutron stars. Our results indicate an intriguing correlation between superfluid quantum criticality and the thermal evolution of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Strain-Tunable Topological Phase Transitions in Line- and Split-Graph Flat-Band Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11783v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, materials with topological flat bands have attracted significant attention due to their association with extraordinary transport properties and strongly correlated electrons. Yet, generic principles linking lattice architecture, strain, and band topology remain scarce. Here, using a unified graph-theoretic framework we generate entire families of two-dimensional lattices and, using analytical tight-binding calculations, demonstrate that a single mechanical knob -- uniform in-plane strain -- drives universal transitions between trivial insulating, Dirac semimetal, and quantum spin-Hall phases across all lattices. The framework yields several flat band lattices that were hitherto absent or largely unexplored in the literature -- for example, the checkerboard split-graph and triangular-Kagome lattices -- whose strain-driven topological phase diagrams we establish here for the first time. The design rules implied by our studies provide a blueprint for engineering topological states in a wide variety of 2D materials, photonic crystals, and circuit lattices, and are anticipated to accelerate the discovery of strain-programmable quantum matter.</description>
