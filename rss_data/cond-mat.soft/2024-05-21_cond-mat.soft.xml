      <title>Physics of a granular pile</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the onset of the subject, granular media have been defying the toolkit of statistical mechanics thus preventing from understanding their thermodynamical and rheological properties and making them one of the key remaining mysteries in science. In the present work, we offer a resolution to this problem in the case of static granular media by considering a collective behavior of 2D identical balls forming a granular pile in the gravity field, which allows us to develop its thermodynamics and rheology from the first principles. Besides the uncertainty due to rough substrate on which the pile is built, we uncover another one due to ambiguities occurring in the positions of some interior balls. Both are responsible for the thermodynamic description of the granular pile, which proves to be anything but ordinary. In particular, we show that a pile is characterized by three temperatures: one is infinite, the other is negative, and the third is of higher-order. Also, considering the fields of ball displacements $\boldsymbol{\xi}$ and the normal force deviations $\delta\boldsymbol{N}$ from the ideal isosceles triangular structure of a regular pile reveals the hyperbolic nature of the $\boldsymbol{\xi}$-field and ability of the $\delta\boldsymbol{N}$-field to change the characteristic type from hyperbolic to elliptic. The latter property not only explains the origin of force chains and provides an adequate description of the rheology of static granular media, but turned out to be instrumental for understanding of granular media thermodynamics. Our model should provide a basis for further grasping of granular media properties, in general.</description>

      <title>Simplified discrete model for axisymmetric dielectric elastomer membranes with robotic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft robots utilizing inflatable dielectric membranes can realize intricate functionalities through the application of non-mechanical fields. However, given the current limitations in simulations, including low computational efficiency and difficulty in dealing with complex external interactions, the design and control of such soft robots often require trial and error. Thus, a novel one-dimensional (1D) discrete differential geometry (DDG)-based numerical model is developed for analyzing the highly nonlinear mechanics in axisymmetric inflatable dielectric membranes. The model captures the intricate dynamics of these membranes under both inflationary pressure and electrical stimulation. Comprehensive validations using hyperelastic benchmarks demonstrate the model's accuracy and reliability. Additionally, the focus on the electro-mechanical coupling elucidates critical insights into the membrane's behavior under varying internal pressures and electrical loads. The research further translates these findings into innovative soft robotic applications, including a spherical soft actuator, a soft circular fluid pump, and a soft toroidal gripper, where the snap-through of electroelastic membrane plays a crucial role. Our analyses reveal that the functional ranges of soft robots are amplified by the snap-through of an electroelastic membrane upon electrical stimuli. This study underscores the potential of DDG-based simulations to advance the understanding of the nonlinear mechanics of electroelastic membranes and guide the design of electroelastic actuators in soft robotics applications.</description>

      <title>Simulation and design of isostatic thick origami structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thick origami structures are considered here as assemblies of polygonal panels hinged to each other along their edges according to a corresponding origami crease pattern. The determination of the internal actions caused by external loads in such structures is not an easy task, owing to their high degree of static indeterminacy, and the likelihood of unwanted self-balanced internal actions induced by manufacturing imperfections. Here we present a method for reducing the degree of static indeterminacy which can be applied to several thick origami structures to make them isostatic. The method utilizes sliding hinges, which permit also the relative translation along the hinge axis, to replace conventional hinges. After giving the analytical description of both types of hinges and describing a rigid folding simulation procedure based on the integration of the exponential map, we present the static analysis of a series of noteworthy examples based on the Miura-ori pattern, the Yoshimura pattern, and the Kresling pattern. The method can be applied for the design and realization of thick origami structures with adequate strength to resist external actions.</description>

      <title>On the derivation of the equilibrium equations in terms of displacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study shows that errors exist in the derivation of equilibrium equations in terms of displacement. It is discovered that when the equilibrium equations in terms of displacement are derived, the variation of the differential order of displacement may cause the variation of the stress state in an elastomer. For plane stress problems, the Lame-Navier equations are not equivalent to the equilibrium equations described with stress. By submitting the displacement field of the well-known issue of a rectangular beam purely bent into the Lame-Navier equations, the conclusion is confirmed. It is also revealed that the velocity of longitudinal wave in an elastomer is affected by its thickness.</description>

      <title>A molecular perspective on the emergence of long-range polar order from an isotropic fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ferroelectric nematic phase (N$_{\text{F}}$) has quickly become the most studied system in liquid crystal research. In this work, we investigate the origin of such polar structure by studying a compound for which the N$_{\text{F}}$ phase directly follows the isotropic liquid phase on cooling, making it a particularly interesting system. Our experimental results evidence the presence of polar correlations already in the high-temperature phase, in which ferroelectric order can be induced under a sufficiently strong electric field. In the N$_{\text{F}}$ phase, molecular dynamics and polar correlations are investigated through detailed dynamic dielectric measurements, while second harmonic generation experiments evidence a large value of the main coefficient of the second order dielectric susceptibility tensor. Lastly, experimentally determined parameters are employed for calculations based on a recently proposed theoretical model for the stability of the N$_{\text{F}}$ phase. The obtained results suggest that the parallel alignment of dipoles is driven by a subtle interplay between electrostatic and excluded volume interactions.</description>

      <title>Mixing in superhydrophobic biomimetic rose petal passive microchannel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laminar flow prevails in microfluidic channels, and mixing is limited by the slow diffusive process at the interface between the mixing liquids. Whitesides and co-workers demonstrated a chaotic mixer by patterning the floor of the microchannel with obliquely oriented microridges. This creates an anisotropic resistance to flow, inducing exponential increase in stretching and folding of fluid elements leading to a dramatic increase in mixing. Rose petals that have micro papillae decorated with nanofolds, present a unique biomimetic, superhydrophobic, super adhesive surface. In the present work, a positive and negative replica of the rose petal surface was created using a simple, inexpensive soft lithographic technique and these replicas formed the floor of the microchannel. The floor of the channel naturally presents alternating slip and no slip boundary conditions for the fluid flow that in turn provides anisotropic drag reduction. We find that mixing index obtained for positive replica floor channel is distinctly higher than that of a negative replica floor channel. The variation in mixing index with Peclet number for the replicated channels are explained by characterizing their wetting behavior using contact angle and confocal microscopy. The enhancement in mixing due to the patterning of the floor is quantified by calculating the percentage change in mixing in the replicated channels from the corresponding simple Y channel values. The maximum percentage change is obtained for the positive replica floor channel (77.2 %) and compares well with chaotic mixer having obliquely oriented ridges on the floor (74.7 %).</description>

      <title>Examination of flow birefringence induced by the shear components along the optical axis using a parallel-plate-type rheometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the concept of rheo-optics is applied that explores the flow birefringence caused by stress components along the optical axis of the camera since it is often overlooked in the traditional theories of photoelastic flow measurement. A novel aspect of this research is that it involved conducting polarization measurements on simple shear flows, specifically from a perspective in which a shear-velocity gradient exists along the camera's optical axis. A parallel-plate-type rheometer and a polarization camera are employed for these systematic measurements. The experimental findings for dilute aqueous cellulose nanocrystal suspensions demonstrates that the flow birefringence can be expressed as a power law based on the power of the second invariant of the deformation-rate tensor. This suggests that flow birefringence can be universally characterized by the coordinate-independent invariants and a pre-factor determined by the direction of polarization measurement. By adjusting the nonlinear term in the stress-optic law, its applicability could be expanded to include three-dimensional fluid stress fields in which the stress is distributed along the camera's optical axis.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen peroxide forms spontaneously in water (bulk, film, or microdroplet) via reduction of dissolved oxygen at solid-water interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zare and co-workers have recently claimed that hydrogen peroxide is spontaneously generated on the air-water interface of sprayed microdroplets, i.e., that H2O2 forms without an external energy source or co-reactant or catalyst. Specifically, they find that the H2O2(aq) concentration in sprayed microdroplets increases by a factor of 3.5 (or 2.5) as the spray chamber's relative humidity (RH) is changed from 15% to 50% (or from 15% to 95%). Building on these results, they imply causation for the seasonality of viral infections arising from the RH-dependent H2O2 generation in environmental microdroplets. Here, we present an alternative explanation for their observations.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of thermal active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active matter concerns many-body systems comprised of living or self-driven agents that collectively exhibit macroscopic phenomena distinct from conventional passive matter. Using Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theory, we develop a novel hydrodynamic framework for thermal active matter that accounts for local temperature variations and the ensuing stochastic effects. This framework provides a deeper understanding of energy balance, second law of thermodynamics, and thermostated steady states in active matter, while also addressing the systematic violations of fluctuation-dissipation theorem and detailed balance. We use our framework of active hydrodynamics to develop effective field theory actions for active superfluids and active nematics that offer a first-principle derivation of various active transport coefficients and feature activity-induced phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Adhesion of a nematic elastomer cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid crystal elastomers are cross-linked elastomer networks with liquid crystal mesogens incorporated into the main or side chain. Polydomain liquid crystalline (nematic) elastomers exhibit unusual mechanical properties like soft elasticity, where the material deforms at nearly constant stress, due to the reorientation of mesogens. In this paper, we use numerical simulation to study the implication of the remarkable elastic softness on a classical problem of adhesion. This study reveals that the soft elasticity of nematic elastomers dramatically affects the interfacial stress distribution at the interface of a nematic elastomer cylinder adhered to a rigid substrate. The stress near the edge of the nematic cylinder under tensile load deviates from the singular behavior predicted for linear elastic materials, and the maximum normal stress reduces dramatically. Moreover, the location of maximum interfacial stress shifts from the edge to the center of the nematic cylinder when the applied tensile force goes beyond a critical value. We discuss the implications for adhesion. The results are consistent with the available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Phase behaviour and self-assembly of semiflexible polymers in poor-solvent solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Langevin dynamics complemented by Wang-Landau Monte Carlo simulations, we study the phase behavior of single and multiple semiflexible polymer chains in solution under poor-solvent conditions. In the case of a single chain, we obtain the full phase diagram in the temperature-bending rigidity (stiffness) plane and we provide connections with a classical mean field result on a lattice as well as with past results on the same model. At low bending rigidity and upon cooling, we find a second order coil-globule transition, followed by a subsequent first order globule-crystal transition at lower temperatures. The obtained crystals have the shape of a twisted rod whose length increases with the increase of the stiffness of the chain. Above a critical value of the stiffness, we also find a direct first order globule-crystal transition, with the crystal having the form of a twisted toroid. Close to the triple point, we find a region with isoenergetic structures with frequent switching from rods to toroids, with the toroid eventually becoming the only observed stable phase at higher stiffness. The model is then extended to many thermally equilibrated chains in a box and the analogous phase diagram is deduced where the chains are observed to first fold into a globule bundle at low stiffness upon cooling, and then rearrange into a nematic bundle via a nucleation process involving an isotropic-nematic transition. As in the single chain counterpart, above a critical stiffness the chains are observed to undergo a direct transition from a gas of isotropically distributed chains to a nematic bundle as the temperature decreases in agreement with recent suggestions from mean field theory. The consequences of these findings for self-assembly of biopolymers in solutions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Role of Plasticizers in Film Formation and Deformation-Induced Bonding of Glassy Polymers of Bidisperse Blends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bonding between polymers below the glass transition temperature through molecular-scale dilatation (or densification)-based interdiffusion of macromolecules has recently been introduced. In this mechanism, plastic deformation enables polymer chains to interdiffuse and form entanglements at the interface, facilitating rapid bonding below the glass transition temperature ($T_g$). Here, we are addressing the role of low molecular weight plasticizer in bonding polymer interfaces of bidisperse blends through deformation-induced bonding (DIB) at temperatures well below the surface and bulk glass transition temperatures, $T_g^s$ and $T_g^b$, respectively, by using molecular simulations. These simulations reveal that addition of plasticizer ($\phi\le$20\%) drastically enhances the number of chain-ends at the interfacial region compared to a pure glass sample ($\phi=0\%$) during deformation below $T_g^s$, which improves the possibility of opposite side entanglement formation. The changes in stress-strain response of debonded samples correlate with the normalized entanglement density. Likewise, the maximum interfacial fracture energy $G_{I,max}$ of debonded samples is correlated with the plasticizer concentration ($\phi$), below $T_g^s$. Furthermore, the optimization of material and process conditions for DIB has yielded a notable advancement: achieving a higher bonding strength, approximately one-third of the bulk, all while remaining below $T_g$.</description>

      <title>A digger for 2D densely-packed coarse granular media using vibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We create a manually-operated mechanical digger able to move within 2D densely packed granular media, in a manner intrinsically different from the existing biomimic diggers. The characteristics of our design include that the average grain size is about one tenth as large as the digger, the area packing density $\phi$ is about $90\%$ of the jamming density $\phi_{c}$, and the value of the dimensionless inertial number $I$ is in the quasi-static regime. Unlike conventional autonomous diggers that move by fluidizing the surrounding granular media with a much finer grain size, our digger swiftly bypasses this mobility mechanism as coarse grains with interparticle friction are hard to be fluidized. To achieve this, the digger has a circular shape and singly captures granular particles near the front entrance of the recess formed by the center unit running across its body using the equipped vibrating claw and then ejects the captured particles backwards. We validate this moving strategy in both experiments and numerical simulations, and demonstrate that the moving efficiency can be enhanced by the judgement of the human operator but the effectiveness is not significantly influenced by the shape of granular particles. In addition, localized vibration from the claw is needed to degrade friction between interlocked irregular-shaped particles.</description>

      <title>Competitive ligand binding kinetics to linear polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different types of ligands compete in binding to polymers with different consequences for the physical and chemical properties of the resulting complex. Here, we derive a general kinetic model for the competitive binding kinetics of different types of ligands to a linear polymer, using the McGhee and von Hippel detailed binding site counting procedure. The derived model allows the description of the competitive binding process in terms of the size of the ligand, binding and release rates, and cooperativity parameters. We illustrate the implications of the general theory showing the equations for the competitive binding of two ligands. The size of the ligand, given by the number of monomers occluded, is shown to have a great impact in competitive binding. Ligands requiring a large available gap for binding are strongly inhibited by smaller ligands. Ligand size then has a leading role compared to binding affinity or cooperativity. For ligands that can bind in different modes (i.e., different number of monomers), this implies that they are more effective in covering or passivating the polymer in lower modes, if the different modes have similar binding energies.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram and Coarsening dynamics in dry apolar Active Nematics with Reciprocal local alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Lebwohl-Lasher interaction for reciprocal local alignment, we present a comprehensive phase diagram for a dry, apolar, active nematic system using its stochastic dynamics. The nematic-isotropic transition in this system is first-order and fluctuation-dominated. Our phase diagram identifies three distinct regions based on activity and orientational noise relative to alignment strength: a homogeneous isotropic phase, a nematic phase with giant density fluctuations, and a coexistence region. Using mean-field analysis and hydrodynamic theory, we demonstrate that reciprocal interactions lead to a density fluctuation-induced first-order transition and derive a phase boundary consistent with numerical results. Quenching from the isotropic to nematic phase reveals coarsening dynamics with distinctive scaling behaviors for density and nematic fields, exhibiting exponents between 2 and 3, typical of non-conserved and conserved dynamics.</description>

Abstract: The study of growth-induced surface wrinkling in constrained bilayers comprising a thin film attached to a thick substrate is a canonical model for understanding pattern formation in many biological systems. While the bilayer model has received much prior attention, the nonlinear behaviour for arrangements with similar film and substrate properties, or substrate growth that outpaces film growth, remains poorly understood. This paper therefore focuses on these cases in which the substrate's elasticity dominates surface wrinkling. We study the critical states, and the initial and advanced post-critical behaviour of growing bilayers with film-to-substrate modulus ratios in the region of $2.5$--$50$, and cases where the substrate grows faster than the film. Based on nonlinear elasticity, we formulate analytical models for linear buckling analyses and asymptotic projections around the critical point, and use finite element (FE) models coupled to continuation and branch-switching algorithms to uncover the deep post-critical regime. It is shown that a rapidly growing substrate may change the critical mode from film-governed sinusoidal wrinkling to substrate-governed Biot wrinkling depending on the stiffness ratio and growth ratio. We present a phase change diagram of the post-critical modal landscape split into sinusoidal wrinkling, period doubling, period quadrupling, and creasing regimes in terms of the stiffness ratio and growth ratio. While the post-critical regime of film- and substrate-dominated bilayers (either in terms of dominant elasticity or growth rate) is governed by sinusoidal wrinkling and Biot creasing, respectively, the intermediate regions allow for period doubling and quadrupling bifurcations. Finally, we demonstrate the existence of multi-stability in the advanced post-buckling regimes for growing bilayers where growth in the substrate surpasses that of the film.</description>

      <title>Solvent Selectivity controls Micro- versus Macro-phase Separation in Multiblock Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monte Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble were used to obtain critical parameters and conditions leading to microphase separation for block copolymers with solvophilic and solvophobic segments. Solvent selectivity was systematically varied to distinguish between systems that undergo macrophase separation to ones that microphase separate in the dilute phase, prior to macrophase separating. Finite-size scaling was used to obtain the critical parameters. Interestingly, corrections to scaling increase significantly for systems that form finite aggregates. The threshold value of solvent selectivity for aggregation was determined for symmetric diblock chains of varying length. The results indicate that long diblock copolymers form micelles in the dilute phase prior to macrophase separation, even in marginally selective solvents. The dependence of critical temperature on solvent selectivity was obtained for triblock, multiblock, and alternating chains. For highly selective solvents, strong structuring of both dilute and dense phases makes it harder to reach equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Chemical control of self-assembly by the electrosolvation force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-assembly of matter in solution generally relies on attractive interactions that overcome entropy and drive the formation of higher-order molecular and particulate structures. Such interactions play key roles in a variety of contexts, e.g., crystallisation, biomolecular folding and condensation, pathological protein aggregation, pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals. The electrosolvation force entails a new conceptual paradigm in the known palette of interactions that drive the spontaneous accretion and organisation of matter. However, an understanding of the underlying physical chemistry, and therefore the ability to exert control over and tune the interaction, remains incomplete. Here we demonstrate that this force arises from the structure of the interfacial electrolyte. Neutral molecules such as a different solvent, osmolytes or surfactants, can - even at very low concentrations in the medium - disrupt or reinforce pre-existing interfacial solvent structure, thereby furnishing unanticipated chemical tuning of the ability of matter to self-assemble. The observations further present unexpected mechanistic elements that may explain the impact of co-solvents and osmolytes on protein structure, stability and pathological protein condensation. Our findings shed new light on microscopic mechanisms that drive the emergence of order and structure from molecular to macroscopic scales in the solution phase.</description>

      <title>Elastic solids under frictionless rigid contact and configurational force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A homogeneous elastic solid, bounded by a flat surface in its unstressed configuration, undergoes a finite strain when in frictionless contact against a rigid and rectilinear constraint, ending with a rounded or sharp corner, in a two-dimensional formulation. With a strong analogy to fracture mechanics, it is shown that (i.) a path-independent $J$--integral can be defined for frictionless contact problems, (ii.) which is equal to the energy release rate $G$ associated with an infinitesimal growth in the size of the frictionless constraint, and thus gives the value of the configurational force component along the sliding direction. Furthermore, it is found that (iii.) such a configurational sliding force is the Newtonian force component exerted by the elastic solid on the constraint at the frictionless contact. Assuming the kinematics of an Euler-Bernoulli rod for an elastic body of rectangular shape, the results (i.)--(iii.) lead to a new interpretation from a nonlinear solid mechanics perspective of the configurational forces recently disclosed for one-dimensional structures of variable length. Finally, approximate but closed-form solutions (validated with finite element simulations) are exploited to provide further insight into the effect of configurational forces. In particular, two applications are presented which show that a transverse compression can lead to Eulerian buckling or to longitudinal dynamic motion, both realizing novel examples of soft actuation mechanisms. As an application to biology, our results may provide a mechanical explanation for the observed phenomenon of negative durotaxis, where cells migrate from stiffer to softer environments.</description>

      <title>Building a Simplistic Automatic Extruder: Instrument Development Opportunities for the Laboratory</title>

Abstract: A well-rounded introduction to work in a STEM laboratory is vital to scientific education. Besides the ability to use available instrumentation for sample characterization, students should also be imparted knowledge in the steps of instrument development and construction. These concepts can be taught using the example of lipid vesicle preparation via extrusion. Vesicle extrusion is a common technique that involves syringes pushing solutions through membrane filters and is used in fundamental studies on vesicles. Such research is important to better understand of biological phenomena and drug development. Well prepared samples are key to successful research. While the manual approach is very useful to acquire experience, automatic extrusion is more convenient, and automation often results in better reproducibility. These advantages can be combined in a simplistic automatic extruder, that does not require advanced technical skills to be assembled. It can therefore be used by various groups, ranging undergraduate to graduate students using equipment typically available. Using this approach, students can acquire different skillsets including coding, testing, and advanced use of building materials based on their properties. Finally, the quality of the automatic extruder is verified.</description>

      <title>Memory corrections to Markovian Langevin dynamics</title>

Abstract: Analysis of non-Markovian systems and memory induced phenomena poses an everlasting challenge for physics. As a paradigmatic example we consider a classical Brownian particle of mass $M$ subjected to an external force and exposed to correlated thermal fluctuations. We show that the recently developed approach to this system, in which its non-Markovian dynamics given by the Generalized Langevin Equation is approximated by its memoryless counterpart but with the effective particle mass $M^* &lt; M$, can be derived within the Markovian embedding technique. Using this method we calculate the first and the second order memory correction to Markovian dynamics of the Brownian particle for the memory kernel represented as the Prony series. The second one lowers the effective mass of the system further and improves precision of the approximation. Our work opens the door for the derivation of higher order memory corrections to Markovian Langevin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of laser induced self-organized void array formation in Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigated the formation of multi-voids in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) using a multi-pulse irradiation method and explored the impact of laser energy, number of pulses per micron (writing speed), and laser spot size (NA) on the process. The experimental results revealed that multi-void formation occurred due to multi-pulse irradiation in the bulk of PDMS. Additionally, increasing laser energy led to an increase in the number of voids, while the number of voids did not change with an increase in the number of pulses per micron for a fixed laser parameter. However, the size of the voids increased with the number of pulses per micron, and tighter focusing conditions (higher NA) resulted in smaller voids with a shorter distance between them. Furthermore, Finite-Difference-Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations reproduced the generation of void arrays in PDMS using a similar multi-laser pulse approach. By modeling the voids as concentric spheres with densified shells and simulating the laser interaction with the voids, we showed that void array generation in PDMS is a linear mechanism. This study provides valuable insight into the mechanism behind the formation of void arrays in PDMS. The simulation results agrees well with the experimental results to further validate the model and gain a better understanding of the physical processes involved in the generation of void arrays in PDMS.</description>
