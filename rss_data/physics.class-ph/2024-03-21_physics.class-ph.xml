      <title>Flexures for Kibble balances: Minimizing the effects of anelastic relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern weighing cells would not be possible without flexure technology. Flexures are created by thinning metal in a specific shape so that it bends as desired when an external torque is applied. In contrast to other pivots, such as knife edges and different types of bearings, flexures provide rotary motion without stick-slip friction. Flexures, however, suffer from anelastic effects, most importantly a time-dependent torque that slowly decays after a large excursion. This effect is known as anelastic relaxation. In traditional servo-controlled mass comparators, the range of motion is minimal, and, hence, anelastic relaxation is negligible. Employing the same technology in Kibble balances challenges that assumption because the necessary velocity mode requires a relatively large excursion of the balance.
  Here, we present measurements of the anelastic relaxation that would occur after excursions held for tens of minutes of time in a balance beam in closed-loop operation. Procedures to mitigate the effect of spurious torque from anelastic effects are discussed. We found a static shift of the flexure's internal equilibrium after a change in the stress and strain state. These static shifts, although measurable, are small, and are uncritical in the Kibble balance application at present.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Balance Laws of Nonlinear Hyperelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the balance laws of hyperelasticity (Green elasticity), i.e., conservation of mass and balance of linear and angular momenta, can be derived using the first law of thermodynamics by postulating its invariance under rigid body motions of the Euclidean ambient space -- the Green-Naghdi-Rivlin theorem. In the case of a non-Euclidean ambient space, covariance of the energy balance -- its invariance under arbitrary diffeomorphisms of the ambient space -- gives all the balance laws and the Doyle-Ericksen formula -- the Marsden-Hughes theorem. In this note, we show that the constitutive equations as well as the balance laws of hyperelasticity can be derived using the first and second laws of thermodynamics without assuming any invariance.</description>

      <title>Electricity at the macroscale and its microscopic origins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I define the fields that describe electrical macrostructure, and their rates of change, in terms of the microscopic charge density, electric field, electric potential, and their rates of change. To deduce these definitions, I lay some foundations of a general theory of structure homogenization, meaning a theory of how any observable macroscopic field is related to spatial averages of its microscopic counterpart.
  I apply homogenization theory to the fields that appear in the vacuum theory of electromagnetism and deduce that the relationships between macroscopic fields are identical in form to the relationships between their microscopic counterparts. Without invoking quantum mechanics, I derive the expressions for polarization current established by the Modern Theory of Polarization. I prove that the bulk-average electric potential, or mean inner potential, vanishes in a macroscopically-uniform charge-neutral material, and I show that when a crystal lattice lacks inversion symmetry, it does not imply the existence of macroscopic $\vec{E}$ or $\vec{P}$ fields in the crystal's bulk.
  I point out that symmetry is scale-dependent. Therefore, if anisotropy of the microstructure does not manifest as anisotropy of the macrostructure, it cannot be the origin of a macroscopic vector field. The macroscopic charge density is isotropic in the bulks of most materials, because it vanishes at every point. Therefore, regardless of the microstructure, a macroscopic electric field cannot emanate from the bulk. I find that all relationships between observable macroscopic fields can be expressed mathematically without introducing the polarization ($\vec{P}$) and electric displacement ($\vec{D}$) fields, neither of which is observable.

      <title>There is no 'velocity kick' memory in electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06325v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The memory effect in electrodynamics, as discovered in 1981 by Staruszkiewicz, and also analysed later, consists of adiabatic shift of the position of a test particle. The proposed 'velocity kick' memory effect, supposedly discovered recently, is in contradiction to these findings. We show that the 'velocity kick' memory is an artefact resulting from an unjustified interchange of limits. This example is a warning against drawing uncritical conclusions for spacetime fields, from their asymptotic behavior.</description>
