      <title>Silicon is the next frontier in plant synthetic biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon has striking similarity with carbon and is found in plant cells. However, there is no specific role that has been assigned to silicon in the life cycle of plants. The amount of silicon in plant cells is species specific and can reach levels comparable to macronutrients. Silicon is the central element for artificial intelligence, nanotechnology and digital revolution thus can act as an informational molecule like nucleic acids while the diverse bonding potential of silicon with different chemical species is analogous to carbon and thus can serve as a structural candidate such as proteins. The discovery of large amounts of silicon on Mars and the moon along with the recent developments of enzyme that can incorporate silicon into organic molecules has propelled the theory of creating silicon-based life. More recently, bacterial cytochrome has been modified through directed evolution such that it could cleave silicon-carbon bonds in organo-silicon compounds thus consolidating on the idea of utilizing silicon in biomolecules. In this article the potential of silicon-based life forms has been hypothesized along with the reasoning that autotrophic virus-like particles can be a lucrative candidate to investigate such potential. Such investigations in the field of synthetic biology and astrobiology will have corollary benefit on Earth in the areas of medicine, sustainable agriculture and environmental sustainability. Bibliometric analysis indicates an increasing interest in synthetic biology. Germany leads in research related to plant synthetic biology, while Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) at UK has highest financial commitments and Chinese Academy of Sciences generates the highest number of publications in the field.</description>

      <title>Representation Learning, Large-Scale 3D Molecular Pretraining, Molecular Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular pretrained representations (MPR) has emerged as a powerful approach for addressing the challenge of limited supervised data in applications such as drug discovery and material design. While early MPR methods relied on 1D sequences and 2D graphs, recent advancements have incorporated 3D conformational information to capture rich atomic interactions. However, these prior models treat molecules merely as discrete atom sets, overlooking the space surrounding them. We argue from a physical perspective that only modeling these discrete points is insufficient. We first present a simple yet insightful observation: naively adding randomly sampled virtual points beyond atoms can surprisingly enhance MPR performance. In light of this, we propose a principled framework that incorporates the entire 3D space spanned by molecules. We implement the framework via a novel Transformer-based architecture, dubbed SpaceFormer, with three key components: (1) grid-based space discretization; (2) grid sampling/merging; and (3) efficient 3D positional encoding. Extensive experiments show that SpaceFormer significantly outperforms previous 3D MPR models across various downstream tasks with limited data, validating the benefit of leveraging the additional 3D space beyond atoms in MPR models.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of saturated and unsaturated substituted N-heterocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mathematical and computational approaches in chemistry and biochemistry fill a gap in respect to the analysis of the physicochemical features of compounds and their functionality and provide an overview of known as well as yet unknown, but hypothetically possible structures. Nitrogen-containing heterocycles such as aziridine, azetidine and pyrrolidine bear a high potential in pharmacology, biotechnology and synthetic biology. Here, we present a mathematical enumeration procedure for all possible azaheterocycles with at least one substituent depending on the number of atoms in the ring, in the sense of saturated and unsaturated congeners. One subgroup belonging to that substance class is constituted by ring-shaped amino acids with a secondary amino group, such as proline. A recursion formula is derived, which results in a modified Lucas number series. Moreover, an explicit formula for determining the number of such substances based on the Golden Ratio is given and a second one, based on binomial coefficients, is newly derived. This enumeration is a helpful tool for construction or complementation of virtual compound databases and for computer-assisted chemical synthesis route planning.</description>

      <title>Structure Language Models for Protein Conformation Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proteins adopt multiple structural conformations to perform their diverse biological functions, and understanding these conformations is crucial for advancing drug discovery. Traditional physics-based simulation methods often struggle with sampling equilibrium conformations and are computationally expensive. Recently, deep generative models have shown promise in generating protein conformations as a more efficient alternative. However, these methods predominantly rely on the diffusion process within a 3D geometric space, which typically centers around the vicinity of metastable states and is often inefficient in terms of runtime. In this paper, we introduce Structure Language Modeling (SLM) as a novel framework for efficient protein conformation generation. Specifically, the protein structures are first encoded into a compact latent space using a discrete variational auto-encoder, followed by conditional language modeling that effectively captures sequence-specific conformation distributions. This enables a more efficient and interpretable exploration of diverse ensemble modes compared to existing methods. Based on this general framework, we instantiate SLM with various popular LM architectures as well as proposing the ESMDiff, a novel BERT-like structure language model fine-tuned from ESM3 with masked diffusion. We verify our approach in various scenarios, including the equilibrium dynamics of BPTI, conformational change pairs, and intrinsically disordered proteins. SLM provides a highly efficient solution, offering a 20-100x speedup than existing methods in generating diverse conformations, shedding light on promising avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>ProtTeX: Structure-In-Context Reasoning and Editing of Proteins with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08179v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models have made remarkable progress in the field of molecular science, particularly in understanding and generating functional small molecules. This success is largely attributed to the effectiveness of molecular tokenization strategies. In protein science, the amino acid sequence serves as the sole tokenizer for LLMs. However, many fundamental challenges in protein science are inherently structure-dependent. The absence of structure-aware tokens significantly limits the capabilities of LLMs for comprehensive biomolecular comprehension and multimodal generation. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework, ProtTeX, which tokenizes the protein sequences, structures, and textual information into a unified discrete space. This innovative approach enables joint training of the LLM exclusively through the Next-Token Prediction paradigm, facilitating multimodal protein reasoning and generation. ProtTeX enables general LLMs to perceive and process protein structures through sequential text input, leverage structural information as intermediate reasoning components, and generate or manipulate structures via sequential text output. Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements in protein function prediction, outperforming the state-of-the-art domain expert model with a twofold increase in accuracy. Our framework enables high-quality conformational generation and customizable protein design. For the first time, we demonstrate that by adopting the standard training and inference pipelines from the LLM domain, ProtTeX empowers decoder-only LLMs to effectively address diverse spectrum of protein-related tasks.</description>
