      <title>Modeling and Forecasting Realized Volatility with Multivariate Fractional Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multivariate fractional Brownian motion (mfBm) with component-wise Hurst exponents is used to model and forecast realized volatility. We investigate the interplay between correlation coefficients and Hurst exponents and propose a novel estimation method for all model parameters, establishing consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimators. Additionally, we develop a time-reversibility test, which is typically not rejected by real volatility data. When the data-generating process is a time-reversible mfBm, we derive optimal forecasting formulae and analyze their properties. A key insight is that an mfBm with different Hurst exponents and non-zero correlations can reduce forecasting errors compared to a one-dimensional model. Consistent with optimal forecasting theory, out-of-sample forecasts using the time-reversible mfBm show improvements over univariate fBm, particularly when the estimated Hurst exponents differ significantly. Empirical results demonstrate that mfBm-based forecasts outperform the (vector) HAR model.</description>

      <title>Learning the Spoofability of Limit Order Books With Interpretable Probabilistic Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates real-time detection of spoofing activity in limit order books, focusing on cryptocurrency centralized exchanges. We first introduce novel order flow variables based on multi-scale Hawkes processes that account both for the size and placement distance from current best prices of new limit orders. Using a Level-3 data set, we train a neural network model to predict the conditional probability distribution of mid price movements based on these features. Our empirical analysis highlights the critical role of the posting distance of limit orders in the price formation process, showing that spoofing detection models that do not take the posting distance into account are inadequate to describe the data. Next, we propose a spoofing detection framework based on the probabilistic market manipulation gain of a spoofing agent and use the previously trained neural network to compute the expected gain. Running this algorithm on all submitted limit orders in the period 2024-12-04 to 2024-12-07, we find that 31% of large orders could spoof the market. Because of its simple neuronal architecture, our model can be run in real time. This work contributes to enhancing market integrity by providing a robust tool for monitoring and mitigating spoofing in both cryptocurrency exchanges and traditional financial markets.</description>
