      <title>CarAT: Carbon Atom Tracing across Industrial Chemical Value Chains via Chemistry Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical industry is increasingly prioritising sustainability, with a focus on reducing carbon footprints to achieve net zero. By 2026, the Together for Sustainability (TfS) consortium will require reporting of biogenic carbon content (BCC) in chemical products, posing a challenge as BCC depends on feedstocks, value chain configuration, and process-specific variables. While carbon-14 isotope analysis can measure BCC, it is impractical for continuous industrial monitoring. This work presents CarAT (Carbon Atom Tracker), an automated methodology for calculating BCC across industrial value chains, enabling dynamic and accurate sustainability reporting. The approach leverages existing Enterprise Resource Planning data in three stages: (1) preparing value chain data, (2) performing atom mapping in chemical reactions using chemistry language models, and (3) applying a linear program to calculate BCC given known inlet compositions. The methodology is validated on a 27-node industrial toluene diisocyanate value chain. Three scenarios are analysed: a base case with fossil feedstocks, a case incorporating a renewable feedstock, and a butanediol value chain with a recycle stream. Results are visualised with Sankey diagrams showing the flow of carbon attributes across the value chain. The key contribution is a scalable, automated method for real-time BCC calculation under changing industrial conditions. CarAT supports compliance with upcoming reporting mandates and advances carbon neutrality goals by enabling systematic fossil-to-biogenic substitution. Through transparent, auditable tracking of carbon sources in production networks, it empowers data-driven decisions to accelerate the transition to sustainable manufacturing.</description>

      <title>TOBACO: Topology Optimization via Band-limited Coordinate Networks for Compositionally Graded Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compositionally Graded Alloys (CGAs) offer unprecedented design flexibility by enabling spatial variations in composition; tailoring material properties to local loading conditions. This flexibility leads to components that are stronger, lighter, and more cost-effective than traditional monolithic counterparts. The fabrication of CGAs have become increasingly feasible owing to recent advancements in additive manufacturing (AM), particularly in multi-material printing and improved precision in material deposition. However, AM of CGAs requires imposition of manufacturing constraints; in particular limits on the maximum spatial gradation of composition.
  This paper introduces a topology optimization (TO) based framework for designing optimized CGA components with controlled compositional gradation. In particular, we represent the constrained composition distribution using a band-limited coordinate neural network. By regulating the network's bandwidth, we ensure implicit compliance with gradation limits, eliminating the need for explicit constraints. The proposed approach also benefits from the inherent advantages of TO using coordinate networks, including mesh independence, high-resolution design extraction, and end-to-end differentiability. The effectiveness of our framework is demonstrated through various elastic and thermo-elastic TO examples.</description>

      <title>Chem3DLLM: 3D Multimodal Large Language Models for Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the real world, a molecule is a 3D geometric structure. Compared to 1D SMILES sequences and 2D molecular graphs, 3D molecules represent the most informative molecular modality. Despite the rapid progress of autoregressive-based language models, they cannot handle the generation of 3D molecular conformation due to several challenges: 1) 3D molecular structures are incompatible with LLMs' discrete token space, 2) integrating heterogeneous inputs like proteins, ligands, and text remains difficult within a unified model, and 3) LLMs lack essential scientific priors, hindering the enforcement of physical and chemical constraints during generation. To tackle these issues, we present Chem3DLLM, a unified protein-conditioned multimodal large language model. Our approach designs a novel reversible text encoding for 3D molecular structures using run-length compression, achieving 3x size reduction while preserving complete structural information. This enables seamless integration of molecular geometry with protein pocket features in a single LLM architecture. We employ reinforcement learning with stability-based rewards to optimize chemical validity and incorporate a lightweight protein embedding projector for end-to-end training. Experimental results on structure-based drug design demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with a Vina score of -7.21, validating our unified multimodal approach for practical drug discovery applications.</description>

      <title>Reverse Physician-AI Relationship: Full-process Clinical Diagnosis Driven by a Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Full-process clinical diagnosis in the real world encompasses the entire diagnostic workflow that begins with only an ambiguous chief complaint. While artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), is transforming clinical diagnosis, its role remains largely as an assistant to physicians. This AI-assisted working pattern makes AI can only answer specific medical questions at certain parts within the diagnostic process, but lack the ability to drive the entire diagnostic process starting from an ambiguous complaint, which still relies heavily on human physicians. This gap limits AI's ability to fully reduce physicians' workload and enhance diagnostic efficiency. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that reverses the relationship between physicians and AI: repositioning AI as the primary director, with physicians serving as its assistants. So we present DxDirector-7B, an LLM endowed with advanced deep thinking capabilities, enabling it to drive the full-process diagnosis with minimal physician involvement. Furthermore, DxDirector-7B establishes a robust accountability framework for misdiagnoses, delineating responsibility between AI and human physicians. In evaluations across rare, complex, and real-world cases under full-process diagnosis setting, DxDirector-7B not only achieves significant superior diagnostic accuracy but also substantially reduces physician workload than state-of-the-art medical LLMs as well as general-purpose LLMs. Fine-grained analyses across multiple clinical departments and tasks validate its efficacy, with expert evaluations indicating its potential to serve as a viable substitute for medical specialists. These findings mark a new era where AI, traditionally a physicians' assistant, now drives the entire diagnostic process to drastically reduce physicians' workload, indicating an efficient and accurate diagnostic solution.</description>

      <title>Virtual Sensing for Solder Layer Degradation and Temperature Monitoring in IGBT Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitoring the degradation state of Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) modules is essential for ensuring the reliability and longevity of power electronic systems, especially in safety-critical and high-performance applications. However, direct measurement of key degradation indicators - such as junction temperature, solder fatigue or delamination - remains challenging due to the physical inaccessibility of internal components and the harsh environment. In this context, machine learning-based virtual sensing offers a promising alternative by bridging the gap from feasible sensor placement to the relevant but inaccessible locations. This paper explores the feasibility of estimating the degradation state of solder layers, and the corresponding full temperature maps based on a limited number of physical sensors. Based on synthetic data of a specific degradation mode, we obtain a high accuracy in the estimation of the degraded solder area (1.17% mean absolute error), and are able to reproduce the surface temperature of the IGBT with a maximum relative error of 4.56% (corresponding to an average relative error of 0.37%).</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Deep Contrast Source Inversion: A Unified Framework for Inverse Scattering Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse scattering problems are critical in electromagnetic imaging and medical diagnostics but are challenged by their nonlinearity and diverse measurement scenarios. This paper proposes a physics-informed deep contrast source inversion framework (DeepCSI) for fast and accurate medium reconstruction across various measurement conditions. Inspired by contrast source inversion (CSI) and neural operator methods, a residual multilayer perceptron (ResMLP) is employed to model current distributions in the region of interest under different transmitter excitations, effectively linearizing the nonlinear inverse scattering problem and significantly reducing the computational cost of traditional full-waveform inversion. By modeling medium parameters as learnable tensors and utilizing a hybrid loss function that integrates state equation loss, data equation loss, and total variation regularization, DeepCSI establishes a fully differentiable framework for joint optimization of network parameters and medium properties. Compared with conventional methods, DeepCSI offers advantages in terms of simplicity and universal modeling capabilities for diverse measurement scenarios, including phase-less and multi-frequency observation. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that DeepCSI achieves high-precision, robust reconstruction under full-data, phaseless data, and multifrequency conditions, outperforming traditional CSI methods and providing an efficient and universal solution for complex inverse scattering problems.</description>

      <title>Impacts of DEM Type and Resolution on Deep Learning-Based Flood Inundation Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13360v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing availability of hydrological and physiographic spatiotemporal data has boosted machine learning's role in rapid flood mapping. Yet, data scarcity, especially high-resolution DEMs, challenges regions with limited access. This paper examines how DEM type and resolution affect flood prediction accuracy, utilizing a cutting-edge deep learning (DL) method called 1D convolutional neural network (CNN). It utilizes synthetic hydrographs as training input and water depth data obtained from LISFLOOD-FP, a 2D hydrodynamic model, as target data. This study investigates digital surface models (DSMs) and digital terrain models (DTMs) derived from a 1 m LIDAR-based DTM, with resolutions from 15 to 30 m. The methodology is applied and assessed in an established benchmark, the city of Carlisle, UK. The models' performance is then evaluated and compared against an observed flood event using RMSE, Bias, and Fit indices. Leveraging the insights gained from this region, the paper discusses the applicability of the methodology to address the challenges encountered in a data-scarce flood-prone region, exemplified by Pakistan. Results indicated that utilizing a 30 m DTM outperformed a 30 m DSM in terms of flood depth prediction accuracy by about 21% during the flood peak stage, highlighting the superior performance of DTM at lower resolutions. Increasing the resolution of DTM to 15 m resulted in a minimum 50% increase in RMSE and a 20% increase in fit index across all flood stages. The findings emphasize that while a coarser resolution DEM may impact the accuracy of machine learning models, it remains a viable option for rapid flood prediction. However, even a slight improvement in data resolution in data-scarce regions would provide significant added value, ultimately enhancing flood risk management.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Neural ODEs for Gene Regulatory Network Discovery under Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02409v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern high-throughput biological datasets with thousands of perturbations provide the opportunity for large-scale discovery of causal graphs that represent the regulatory interactions between genes. Differentiable causal graphical models have been proposed to infer a gene regulatory network (GRN) from large scale interventional datasets, capturing the causal gene regulatory relationships from genetic perturbations. However, existing models are limited in their expressivity and scalability while failing to address the dynamic nature of biological processes such as cellular differentiation. We propose PerturbODE, a novel framework that incorporates biologically informative neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) to model cell state trajectories under perturbations and derive the causal GRN from the neural ODE's parameters. We demonstrate PerturbODE's efficacy in trajectory prediction and GRN inference across simulated and real over-expression datasets.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Enhanced Time-Series Forecasting via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a significant role in finance, energy, meteorology, and IoT applications. Recent studies have leveraged the generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adapt to time series forecasting, achieving promising performance. However, existing studies focus on token-level modal alignment, instead of bridging the intrinsic modality gap between linguistic knowledge structures and time series data patterns, greatly limiting the semantic representation. To address this issue, we propose a novel Semantic-Enhanced LLM (SE-LLM) that explores the inherent periodicity and anomalous characteristics of time series to embed into the semantic space to enhance the token embedding. This process enhances the interpretability of tokens for LLMs, thereby activating the potential of LLMs for temporal sequence analysis. Moreover, existing Transformer-based LLMs excel at capturing long-range dependencies but are weak at modeling short-term anomalies in time-series data. Hence, we propose a plugin module embedded within self-attention that models long-term and short-term dependencies to effectively adapt LLMs to time-series analysis. Our approach freezes the LLM and reduces the sequence dimensionality of tokens, greatly reducing computational consumption. Experiments demonstrate the superiority performance of our SE-LLM against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</description>
