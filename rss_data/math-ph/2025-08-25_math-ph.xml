      <title>Clustering of quantum correlations at low temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying conditions for the clustering of correlations in thermal states is a central problem in quantum many-body physics. In the low temperature regime, the problem is subtle, because it is intimately connected to phase transitions. Here we investigate quantum lattice Hamiltonians that are sums of on-site terms and relatively bounded perturbations. We present a direct proof that the thermal state satisfies exponential decay of correlations at low temperature, with a correlation length that stays uniformly bounded as $T\to0$. The proof develops a quantum many-body adaptation of a probabilistic swapping trick of the first author and Cao (Ann. Probab. 53, 2025) for lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Gaussian filters in quantum lattice systems: Applications to spectral flow, local perturbations, clustering, and the quantum Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the locality and spectral properties of the smearing \[ \tau_f(A) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty dt \, f(t) \, \tau_t(A) \] when applied to the dynamics $\tau_t$ of quantum spin systems. While recent applications of this map have used superpolynomially but not exponentially decaying functions $f$ to ensure exact spectral properties, we use here Gaussian filters. This improves the locality at the expense of errors on the spectral side. We propose a number of concrete applications, from quasi-adiabatic continuation to correlation decay, and exponential stability away from impurities. Finally, we discuss an application to the quantum Hall effect.</description>

Abstract: We produce an explicit formula for the wave function of the spherically symmetric fields emitted to the FLRW universe with the scale factor generated by the de Sitter universe. As an application of these explicitly written solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation, we test the decay in time of the field generated by a pionic atom.</description>

      <title>Breaking global symmetries with locality-preserving operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the general framework of quantum resource theories, one typically only distinguishes between operations that can or cannot generate the resource of interest. In many-body settings, one can further characterize quantum operations based on underlying geometrical constraints, and a natural question is to understand the power of resource-generating operations that preserve locality. In this work, we address this question within the resource theory of asymmetry, which has recently found applications in the study of many-body symmetry-breaking and symmetry-restoration phenomena. We consider symmetries corresponding to both abelian and non-abelian compact groups with a homogeneous action on the space of $N$ qubits, focusing on the prototypical examples of $U(1)$ and $SU(2)$. We study the so-called $G$-asymmetry $\Delta S^{G}_N$, and present two main results. First, we derive a general bound on the asymmetry that can be generated by locality-preserving operations acting on product states. We prove that, in any spatial dimension, $\Delta S^{G}_N\leq (1/2)\Delta S^{G, \rm max}_N[1+o(1)]$, where $\Delta S^{G, \rm max}_N$ is the maximum value of the $G$-asymmetry in the full many-body Hilbert space. Second, we show that locality-preserving operations can generate maximal asymmetry, $\Delta S^{G}_N\sim\Delta S^{G, \rm max}_N$, when applied to symmetric states featuring long-range entanglement. Our results provide a unified perspective on recent studies of asymmetry in many-body physics, highlighting a non-trivial interplay between asymmetry, locality, and entanglement.</description>

      <title>Quantum Higher Order Fourier Analysis and the Clifford Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a mathematical framework that we call quantum, higher-order Fourier analysis. This generalizes the classical theory of higher-order Fourier analysis, which led to many advances in number theory and combinatorics. We define a family of quantum measures on a Hilbert space, that reduce in the case of diagonal matrices to the classical uniformity norms. We show that our quantum measures and our related theory of quantum higher-order Fourier analysis characterize the Clifford hierarchy, an important notion of complexity in quantum information. In particular, we give a necessary and sufficient analytic condition that a unitary is an element of the k-th level of the Clifford hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Angular phase-space integrals with four denominators through Mellin--Barnes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute four-denominator angular phase-space integrals using the Mellin--Barnes (MB) technique in dimensional regularisation. Independent of the scattering process, an angular integral can be categorised based on the nature of the momenta appearing in the denominators. We address all scenarios involving fully massless and massive momenta. We present a partial fraction decomposition that relates angular integrals with multiple massive momenta to those with a single massive momentum. By solving six- and seven-fold MB integrals, we express the final results up to the finite order in the dimensional regulator in terms of Goncharov polylogarithms.</description>

      <title>Universality and Invariance in Hegselmann-Krause Opinion Dynamics: Proof of Three Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three conjectures from [R. Hegselmann, The Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulations 26(4), 11 (2023)] about the Hegselmann-Krause opinion dynamics and the structure of $\epsilon$-switches are proved. The first conjecture states that the number of $\epsilon$-switches for any given initial opinion distribution is always finite, guaranteeing that the algorithm for enumerating them terminates. The second conjecture concerns the relationship between the dynamics of two consecutive $\epsilon$-switches, showing that the opinion evolution is identical up to the switch time. The third conjecture establishes the invariance of the dynamics under positive-affine transformations of the initial distribution, with a corresponding rescaling of all $\epsilon$-switch values. Together, these results provide a formal foundation for the empirical observations reported in the literature and offer a step towards a systematic classification of BC-processes based on their initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Probing Local Branching Dynamics with Stern-Gerlach Interferometers and Dual Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new experimental program to empirically distinguish the Branched Hilbert Subspace Interpretation (BHSI) from the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI) and Many-Worlds Interpretations (MWI) by examining the dynamics of local quantum branching. Our approach uses Stern-Gerlach interferometers (SGIs) equipped with a novel dual sensing technique, combining non-destructive transparent sensors (TSs) and projective opaque detectors (ODs), to test foundational principles in a closed system. The first stage employs a single SGI with dual sensors to search for anomalous "delayed-choice" events that challenge the instantaneous collapse of CI and the global branching of MWI. The second stage involves a full-loop SGI with two TSs and one OD to investigate recoherence phenomena, which would violate both CI and MWI if observed. Finally, the third stage introduces a second full-loop SGI with a test ion to generate an electromagnetic phase shift, enabling discrimination between retrocausal and unitary recoherence mechanisms. Successfully observing these rare anomalies, while without breaking any conservation laws, would offer strong evidence for the local branching framework of BHSI, showing a fuzzy quantum-classical boundary within dual sensing. The proposed experiments are feasible with current trapped-ion and quantum sensing technologies, offering a promising path forward in the ongoing debate over quantum interpretations.</description>

      <title>Correlations of the percolation energy field and its logarithmic partner</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For site percolation on the triangular lattice, we define two lattice fields that form a logarithmic pair in the sense of conformal field theory. We show that, at the critical point, their two- and three-point correlation functions have well-defined scaling limits, whose structure agrees with that predicted for logarithmic field theories. One of the two fields can be identified with the percolation analog of the Ising energy field, while the other is related to the percolation four-arm event.</description>

      <title>Power-law correction in the probability density function of the critical Ising magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the critical point, the probability density function of the Ising magnetization is believed to decay like $\exp{(-x^{\delta+1})}$, where $\delta$ is the Ising critical exponent that controls the decay to zero of the magnetization in a vanishing external field. In this paper, we discuss the presence of a power-law correction $x^{\frac{\delta-1}{2}}$, which has been debated in the physics literature. We argue that whether such a correction is present or not is related to the asymptotic behavior of a function that measures the extent to which the average magnetization of a finite system with an external field is influenced by the boundary conditions. Our discussion is informed by a mixture of heuristic calculations and rigorous results. Along the way, we review some recent results on the critical Ising model and prove properties of the average magnetization in two dimensions which are of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with the dependence of the lowest eigenvalue of the magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian on the geometry of rectangles, subject to homogeneous fields. We conjecture that the square is a global minimiser both under the area or perimeter constraints. Contrary to the well-known magnetic-free analogue, the present spectral problem does not admit explicit solutions. By establishing lower and upper bound to the eigenvalue, we establish the conjecture for weak magnetic fields. Moreover, we relate the validity of the conjecture to the simplicity of the eigenvalue and symmetries of minimisers of a non-convex minimisation problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we review the construction and large $N$ study of the continuous two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory with gauge group $\mathrm{U}(N)$ through probability, combinatorics and representation theory. In a first part, we define the continuous Yang-Mills measure using Markovian holonomy fields, following a construction by L{\'e}vy, then we show in a second part how to derive Migdal's character expansion of the partition function for any compact structure group from this setting. We continue with two developments obtained in the last few years by Dahlqvist, Lemoine, L{\'e}vy and Ma{\"i}da with similar approaches with respect to the partition function: its large $N$ asymptotics on all compact surfaces for the structure group $\mathrm{U}(N)$, and its $\frac{1}{N}$ expansion on a torus with an interpretation in terms of random surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we make a proposal for the solution to a long-standing problem - the asymptotic expansions of the modular $S$-transform of a generalised Gibbs ensemble (GGE) in a theory with $\mathcal{W}_3$ symmetry where the GGE includes the first non-trivial charge. Equivalently, we give a proposal for the modular $S$-transform of traces of arbitrary powers of the zero mode $W_0$. We provide evidence in the form of exact results using Zhu's recursion, results obtained using conjectured results for Verma modules, and exact results for the particular value $c=-2$. We expect these have generalisations to other symmetry algebras/hierarchies such as the Virasoro algebra/KdV charges, and to GGEs with arbitrary finite sets of charges.</description>

      <title>Sharp bounds on the failure of the hot spots conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hot spots ratio of a domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ measures the degree of failure of Rauch's hot spots conjecture on that domain. We identify the largest possible value of this ratio over all connected Lipschitz domains $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, for any dimension $d$. As $d\to \infty$, we show that this maximal ratio converges to $\sqrt{e}$, which asymptotically matches the previous best known upper bound by Mariano, Panzo and Wang. For $d\ge 2$, we show that sets extremizing the hot spots ratio do not exist, and extremizing sequences must converge to a ball at a quantitative rate. We then give a sharp bound on the measure of the set for which the first Neumann eigenfunction exceeds its maximal boundary value. From this we deduce that the hot spots conjecture is asymptotically true "in measure'' as $d\to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Elastoplasticity with softening as a state-dependent sweeping process: non-uniqueness of solutions and emergence of shear bands in lattices of springs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasticity with softening and fracture mechanics lead to ill-posed mathematical problems due to the loss of monotonicity. Multiple co-existing solutions are possible when softening elements are coupled together, and solutions cannot be continued beyond the point of complete degradation of the set of admissible stresses. We present a state-dependent sweeping process which solves the evolution of elasto-plastic Lattice Spring Models with arbitrary placement of softening, hardening and perfectly plastic springs. Using numerical simulations of regular grid lattices with softening we demonstrate the emergence of non-symmetric shear bands with strain localization. At the same time, in toy examples it is easy to analytically derive multiple co-existing solutions. These solutions correspond to fixed points in the implicit catch-up algorithm and we observe a discontinuous bifurcation with the exchange of stability of those fixed points.</description>

      <title>On the asymptotic behavior of the spectral gap for discrete Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we elaborate on the convergence of the spectral gap of a class of discrete Schr\"odinger operators defined on a path graph in the limit of infinite volume. We confirm and extend recent results on the convergence of the spectral gap to a larger class of potentials using entirely different methods. Most importantly, we also resolve a conjecture previously proposed in this context. This then yields new insights into the rate at which the spectral gap tends to zero as the volume increases.</description>

      <title>Large-scale concentration and relaxation for mean-field Langevin particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Langevin dynamics of diffusive particles with regular pairwise interactions under mean-field scaling. By approximating empirical distributions with conditional distributions, we establish coercive and contractive properties for the modulated free energy functional. These properties yield near-optimal large-scale concentration and relaxation rates for the particle system throughout the subcritical regime. Furthermore, we derive generation of chaos estimates with the optimal order of particle approximation. As a simpler instance, we demonstrate long-time convergence of the independent projection of Langevin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Large N limit of spectral duality in classical integrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the large $N$ limit of spectral duality between rational Gaudin models introduced by Adams, Harnad and Hurtubise. The limit of ${\rm gl}_N$ model is performed by means of the noncommutative torus algebra represented by the fields on a torus with the Moyal-Weyl star product. We apply the approach developed by Hoppe, Olshanetsky and Theisen to the Gaudin type models and describe the corresponding integrable field theory (2d hydrodynamics) on a torus. The dual model is a large $N$ limit of the ${\rm gl}_M$ Gaudin model with $N$ marked points written in the form of Gaudin model with irregular singularities.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach to find Exact Solutions of Nonlinear ODE Systems: Applications to Coupled Non-Integrable and Integrable mKdV Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel approach is introduced for deriving exact solutions to nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations. This method consists of four parts. In the initial part, the examined nonlinear differential equation system is transformed into a linear differential equation system using an infinite series sum transformation and Adomian polynomials. In the second part, we presented a modified method of variation of parameters utilizing a revised Cramer's rule for addressing a linear system of block matrices. In the following part, we merged the outcomes of the prior two parts and introduced a new recursive method for acquiring a series solution of the system established in the first section. In the final part, we introduce the fundamental ideas of the multiplicative inverse of power series and methods for summing infinite series. The method utilizes the property that the multiplicative inverse of the power series either terminates after a finite number of terms or simplifies to a geometric series, which can be easily summed to yield closed-form solutions for the series in question. The effectiveness of this method is shown by successfully deriving exact localized solutions for both integrable and non-integrable coupled modified Korteweg-de Vries equations. Using the multiplicative inverse technique, it is shown that a rational generating function can be created for the series solution derived from the proposed method for the specified system of nonlinear differential equations, regardless of whether it is integrable or non-integrable.</description>

      <title>Microscopic field theories of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct effective field theories of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect from matrix Chern-Simons theory for $N$ electrons, corresponding to matrix dimension $N$. We first consider a quantum Hall droplet within finite $N$ matrix Chern-Simons theory. Taking into account the differential geometry of the matrix Chern-Simons droplet for a partially-filled fuzzy two-sphere, we first generalize the quantization procedure by replacing the Poisson bracket, a classical Lie derivative, with a quantum counterpart, the Lie derivative for a deformed fuzzy sphere. This yields the topological invariant introduced in earlier works on the quantum skyrmion Hall effect and previously unidentified fusion rules. This is consistent with treatment of a spin $S$ of multiplicity $2S+1$ as a quantum Hall droplet within matrix Chern-Simons theory for $N=2S+1$ spinless electrons and a generalization of a Jain composite particle for a Laughlin state. We then construct $D$-dimensional arrays of coupled small $N$ matrix Chern-Simons droplets as effective field theories of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. In higher-symmetry constructions, this yields what appears to be a D+1 dimensional $U(N)$ Yang-Mills theory, but actually contains $\delta$ extra fuzzy dimensions from the finite $N$ MCS theory as well as deformations from $U(N)$ due to partial filling of the fuzzy spheres. In this construction, the Chern-Simons level is $k+1$ for each small $N$ droplet, while the entire array can be interpreted as an unbounded matrix Chern-Simons theory at level $k$. Such constructions at $k=2$ are consistent with earlier results for the multiplicative Chern insulator. We also formulate the quantum skyrmion Hall effect in terms of a Lagrangian for an array of potentially distinct, small $N$ droplets within anisotropic fuzzification. We discuss the relevance of these results to spin lattice models and lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Optimal Hamiltonian for a quantum state with finite entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the following task: how for a given quantum state $\rho$ to find a grounded Hamiltonian $H$ such that $\mathrm{Tr}H\rho\leq E_0&lt;+\infty$ in such a way that the von Neumann entropy of the Gibbs state $\gamma_H(E)$ corresponding to a given energy $E&gt;0$ be as small as possible.
  We show that for any mixed state $\rho$ with finite entropy and any $E&gt;0$ there is a unique solution $H(\rho,E_0,E)$ of the above problem which we call optimal Hamiltonian for this state. Explicit expressions for $H(\rho,E_0,E)$ and $S(\gamma_H(E))$ with $H=H(\rho,E_0,E)$ are obtained. Several examples are considered.
  A brief overview of possible applications is given (with the intention to give a detailed description in a separate article).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19396v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the homogeneous mean-field Bose gas at temperatures proportional to the critical temperature of its Bose-Einstein condensation phase transition. We prove a trace norm approximation for the grand canonical Gibbs state in terms of a reference state, which is given by a convex combination of products of coherent states and Gibbs states associated with certain temperature-dependent Bogoliubov Hamiltonians. The convex combination is expressed as an integral over a Gibbs distribution of a one-mode $\Phi^4$-theory describing the condensate. This result justifies an analogue of Lee and Yang's extension of Bogoliubov theory to positive temperatures, and it allows us to derive various limiting distributions for the number of particles in the condensate, as well as precise formulas for the one- and two-particle density matrices of the Gibbs state. Key ingredients of our proof, which are of independent interest, include two novel abstract correlation inequalities. The proof of one of them is based on an application of an infinite-dimensional version of Stahl's theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with deformed Wigner random matrices. These matrices are closely connected with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): weight matrices of trained DNNs could be represented in the form $R + S$, where $R$ is random and $S$ is highly correlated. The spectrum of such matrices plays a key role in rigorous underpinning of the novel pruning technique based on Random Matrix Theory. Mathematics has been done only for finite-rank matrix $S$. However, in practice rank may grow. In this paper we develop asymptotic analysis for the case of growing rank.</description>

      <title>Rigid models for 2-gerbes I: Chern-Simons geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05521v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the problem of constructing explicit geometric string structures, we give a rigid model for bundle 2-gerbes, and define connective structures thereon. This model is designed to make explicit calculations easier in applications to physics. To compare to the existing definition, we give a functorial construction of a bundle 2-gerbe as in the literature from our rigid model, including with connections. As an example we prove that the Chern--Simons bundle 2-gerbe from the literature, with its connective structure, can be rigidified -- it arises, up to isomorphism in the strongest possible sense, from a rigid bundle 2-gerbe with connective structure via this construction. Further, our rigid version of 2-gerbe trivialisation (with connections) gives rise to trivialisations (with connections) of bundle 2-gerbes in the usual sense, and as such can be used to describe geometric string structures.</description>

      <title>Non-degenerate Marginal-Likelihood Calibration with Application to Quantum Characterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12552v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a marginal likelihood strategy within the Kennedy-O'Hagan (KOH) Bayesian framework, where a Gaussian process (GP) models the discrepancy between a physical system and its simulator. Our approach introduces a novel marginalized likelihood by integrating out the degenerate eigenspace of the covariance matrix, rather than approximating the original likelihood. Unlike approximation methods that compromise accuracy for computational efficiency, our method defines an exact likelihood -- distinct from the original but preserving all relevant information. This formulation achieves computational efficiency and stability, even for large datasets where the covariance matrix nears degeneracy. Applied to the characterization of a superconducting quantum device at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the approach enhances the predictive accuracy of the Lindblad master equations for modeling Ramsey measurement data by effectively quantifying uncertainties consistent with the quantum data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twisted period integrals are ubiquitous in theoretical physics and mathematics, where they inhabit a finite-dimensional vector space governed by an inner product known as the intersection number. In this work, we uncover the associated tensor structures of intersection numbers and integrate them with the fibration method to develop a novel evaluation scheme. Companion matrices allow us to cast the computation of the intersection numbers in terms of a matrix operator calculus within the ambient tensor space. For illustrative purposes, our algorithm has been successfully applied to the numerical decomposition of a sample of two-loop integrals, coming from planar five-point massless functions, representing a significant advancement for the direct projection of Feynman integrals to master integrals via intersection numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate Gibbs measures for diffusive particles interacting through a two-body mean field energy. By identifying a gradient structure for the conditional law, we derive sharp bounds on the size of chaos, providing a quantitative characterization of particle independence. To handle interaction forces that are unbounded at infinity, we study the concentration of measure phenomenon for Gibbs measures via a defective Talagrand inequality, which may hold independent interest. Our approach provides a unified framework for both the flat semi-convex and displacement convex cases. Additionally, we establish sharp chaos bounds for the quartic Curie-Weiss model in the sub-critical regime, demonstrating the generality of this method.</description>

      <title>The essential regularity of singular connections in Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we accomplish three things: (i) We discover the geometric (true) regularity of affine connections, their essential (highest possible) regularity, a geometric property independent of starting atlas. (ii) We give a checkable necessary and sufficient condition for determining whether or not connections are at their essential regularity, based on the relative regularity of the connection and its Riemann curvature. (iii) We introduce a computable procedure for lifting any $L^p$ affine connection in an atlas ($p&gt;n$), to a new atlas in which the connection exhibits its essential regularity. To accomplish this, we prove that the RT-equations, originally designed by the authors to locally lift the regularity of singular connections by just one derivative, surprisingly, also induce an implicit hidden regularization of the Riemann curvature tensor, together with a global regularization of transition maps between regularizing coordinate charts. From this we deduce a multi-step regularization of the connection, and construct a new atlas in which the connection exhibits its essential regularity. The present paper is a culmination of the theory of the RT-equations which provides a definitive theory for determining whether or not singularities in an $L^p$ affine connection ($p&gt;n$) are essential or removable by coordinate transformation, together with an explicit procedure for lifting removable singularities to their essential regularity, both locally and globally. This includes GR shock wave singularities and cusp singularities (continuous metrics with infinite gradients), both obstacles to numerical simulation. We propose the essential regularity of a connection to be the point where an intrinsic level of regularity enters the subject of Geometry.</description>

      <title>Planar quantum low-density parity-check codes with open boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08887v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although high-threshold and low-overhead quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes, such as bivariate bicycle (BB) codes, can reduce the physical-qubit cost by an order of magnitude compared to the Kitaev toric code, their torus layout remains difficult for physical implementation. In this work, we introduce the first systematic procedure to convert BB codes into fully planar, open-boundary qLDPC codes, preserving their performance. We present planar code families with logical dimensions $6 \leq k\leq13$, e.g., $[[78, 6, 6]]$, $[[107, 7, 7]]$, $[[268, 8, 12]]$, $[[405, 9, 15]]$, $[[348, 10, 13]]$, $[[450, 11, 15]]$, $[[386, 12, 12]]$, $[[362, 13, 11]]$, all with geometrically local weight-6 stabilizers. Allowing weight-8 stabilizers produces a $[[282,12,14]]$ code, exhibiting an efficiency metric ($kd^2/n$) an order of magnitude higher than the surface code. The construction combines boundary anyon condensation with the ``lattice grafting'' optimization, yielding high-performance qLDPC codes natively compatible with planar hardware architectures. It also uncovers Sierpinski-type fractal logical operators whose distance scales with the fractal area on finite lattices. These planar qLDPC codes provide an implementable route to resource-efficient, high-threshold fault tolerance and a flexible framework for future code design on realistic two-dimensional hardware.</description>

      <title>SDEs with critical general distributional drifts: sharp solvability and blow-ups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09244v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish weak well-posedness for SDEs having discontinuous diffusion coefficients and general distributional drifts that may introduce blow up effects. Our drifts satisfy minimal assumptions, i.e.\,we assume only that the Cauchy problem for the Kolmogorov backward equation is well-posed in the standard Hilbert triple $W^{1,2} \hookrightarrow L^2 \hookrightarrow W^{-1,2}$. By a result of Mazya and Verbitsky, these assumptions are precisely those drifts that can be represented as the sum of a form-bounded component (encompassing, for example, Morrey or Chang-Wilson-Wolff drifts) and a divergence-free distributional component in the ${\rm BMO}^{-1}$ space of Koch and Tataru.
  We apply our results to finite particle systems with strong attracting interactions immersed in a turbulent flow. This includes particle systems of Keller-Segel type. Crucially, in dimensions $d \geq 3$, we cover almost the entire admissible range of attraction strengths, reaching nearly to the blow-up threshold.
  As a further application of our results for SDEs and of the theory of Bessel processes, we obtain an improved upper bound on the constant in the many-particle Hardy inequality. Consequently, the lower bound previously derived by Hoffmann-Ostenhof, Hoffmann-Ostenhof, Laptev, and Tidblom is shown to be close to optimal.</description>
