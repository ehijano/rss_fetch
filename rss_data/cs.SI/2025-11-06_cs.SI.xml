      <title>Establishing Trust in Crowdsourced Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crowdsourced data supports real-time decision-making but faces challenges like misinformation, errors, and contributor power concentration. This study systematically examines trust management practices across platforms categorised as Volunteered Geographic Information, Wiki Ecosystems, Social Media, Mobile Crowdsensing, and Specialised Review and Environmental Crowdsourcing. Identified strengths include automated moderation and community validation, while limitations involve rapid data influx, niche oversight gaps, opaque trust metrics, and elite dominance. Proposed solutions incorporate advanced AI tools, transparent reputation metrics, decentralised moderation, structured community engagement, and a ``soft power'' strategy, aiming to equitably distribute decision-making authority and enhance overall data reliability.</description>

      <title>Beyond Citations: Measuring Idea-level Knowledge Diffusion from Research to Journalism and Policy-making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the importance of social science knowledge for various stakeholders, measuring its diffusion into different domains remains a challenge. This study uses a novel text-based approach to measure the idea-level diffusion of social science knowledge from the research domain to the journalism and policy-making domains. By doing so, we expand the detection of knowledge diffusion beyond the measurements of direct references. Our study focuses on media effects theories as key research ideas in the field of communication science. Using 72,703 documents (2000-2019) from three domains (i.e., research, journalism, and policy-making) that mention these ideas, we count the mentions of these ideas in each domain, estimate their domain-specific contexts, and track and compare differences across domains and over time. Overall, we find that diffusion patterns and dynamics vary considerably between ideas, with some ideas diffusing between other domains, while others do not. Based on the embedding regression approach, we compare contextualized meanings across domains and find that the distances between research and policy are typically larger than between research and journalism. We also find that ideas largely shift roles across domains - from being the theories themselves in research to sense-making in news to applied, administrative use in policy. Over time, we observe semantic convergence mainly for ideas that are practically oriented. Our results characterize the cross-domain diffusion patterns and dynamics of social science knowledge at the idea level, and we discuss the implications for measuring knowledge diffusion beyond citations.</description>

      <title>A local eigenvector centrality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03608v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eigenvector centrality is an established measure of global connectivity, from which the importance and influence of nodes can be inferred. We introduce a local eigenvector centrality that incorporates both local and global connectivity. This new measure references prominent eigengaps and combines their associated eigenspectrum, via the Euclidean norm, to detect centrality that reflects the influence of prominent community structures. In contact networks, with clearly defined community structures, local eigenvector centrality is shown to identify similar but distinct distributions to eigenvector centrality applied on each community in isolation and PageRank. Discrepancies between the two eigenvector measures highlight nodes and communities that do not conform to their defined local structures, e.g. nodes with more connections outside of their defined community than within it. While reference to PageRank's centrality assessment enables a mitigation strategy for localisation effects inherent in eigenvector-based measures. In networks without clearly defined communities, such as city road networks, local eigenvector centrality is shown to identify both locally prominent and globally connected hubs.</description>

      <title>GMoPE:A Prompt-Expert Mixture Framework for Graph Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance on task-specific benchmarks, yet their ability to generalize across diverse domains and tasks remains limited. Existing approaches often struggle with negative transfer, scalability issues, and high adaptation costs. To address these challenges, we propose GMoPE (Graph Mixture of Prompt-Experts), a novel framework that seamlessly integrates the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with prompt-based learning for graphs. GMoPE leverages expert-specific prompt vectors and structure-aware MoE routing to enable each expert to specialize in distinct subdomains and dynamically contribute to predictions. To promote diversity and prevent expert collapse, we introduce a soft orthogonality constraint across prompt vectors, encouraging expert specialization and facilitating a more balanced expert utilization. Additionally, we adopt a prompt-only fine-tuning strategy that significantly reduces spatiotemporal complexity during transfer. We validate GMoPE through extensive experiments under various pretraining strategies and multiple downstream tasks. Results show that GMoPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves performance comparable to full parameter fine-tuning-while requiring only a fraction of the adaptation overhead. Our work provides a principled and scalable framework for advancing generalizable and efficient graph foundation models.</description>

      <title>Characterising Global Platforms: Centralised, Decentralised, Federated, and Grassroots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03286v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global digital platforms are software systems designed to serve entire populations, with some already serving billions of people. We propose atomic transactions-based multiagent transition systems and protocols as a formal framework to study them; introduce essential agents -- minimal sets of agents the removal of which makes communication impossible; and show that the cardinality of essential agents partitions all global platforms into four classes:
  1. Centralised -- one (the server)
  2. Decentralised -- finite $&gt;1$ (bootstrap nodes)
  3. Federated -- infinite but not universal (all servers)
  4. Grassroots -- universal (all agents)
  Our illustrative formal example is a global social network, for which we provide centralised, decentralised, federated, and grassroots specifications via multiagent atomic transactions, and prove they all satisfy the same basic correctness properties. We discuss informally additional global platforms -- currencies, ``sharing economy'' apps, AI, and more. While this may be the first characterisation of centralised, decentralised, and federated global platforms, grassroots platforms have been formally defined previously, but using different notions. Here, we prove that their original definition implies that all agents are essential, placing grassroots platforms in a distinct class within the broader formal context that includes all global platforms. This work provides the first mathematical framework for classifying any global platform -- existing or imagined -- by providing a multiagent atomic-transactions specification of it and determining the cardinality of the minimal set of essential agents in the ensuing multiagent protocol. It thus provides a unifying mathematical approach for the study of global digital platforms, perhaps the most important class of computer systems today.</description>

      <title>Inter-Agent Trust Models: A Comparative Study of Brief, Claim, Proof, Stake, Reputation and Constraint in Agentic Web Protocol Design-A2A, AP2, ERC-8004, and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the "agentic web" takes shape-billions of AI agents (often LLM-powered) autonomously transacting and collaborating-trust shifts from human oversight to protocol design. In 2025, several inter-agent protocols crystallized this shift, including Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), Agent Payments Protocol (AP2), and Ethereum's ERC-8004 "Trustless Agents," yet their underlying trust assumptions remain under-examined. This paper presents a comparative study of trust models in inter-agent protocol design: Brief (self- or third-party verifiable claims), Claim (self-proclaimed capabilities and identity, e.g. AgentCard), Proof (cryptographic verification, including zero-knowledge proofs and trusted execution environment attestations), Stake (bonded collateral with slashing and insurance), Reputation (crowd feedback and graph-based trust signals), and Constraint (sandboxing and capability bounding). For each, we analyze assumptions, attack surfaces, and design trade-offs, with particular emphasis on LLM-specific fragilities-prompt injection, sycophancy/nudge-susceptibility, hallucination, deception, and misalignment-that render purely reputational or claim-only approaches brittle. Our findings indicate no single mechanism suffices. We argue for trustless-by-default architectures anchored in Proof and Stake to gate high-impact actions, augmented by Brief for identity and discovery and Reputation overlays for flexibility and social signals. We comparatively evaluate A2A, AP2, ERC-8004 and related historical variations in academic research under metrics spanning security, privacy, latency/cost, and social robustness (Sybil/collusion/whitewashing resistance). We conclude with hybrid trust model recommendations that mitigate reputation gaming and misinformed LLM behavior, and we distill actionable design guidelines for safer, interoperable, and scalable agent economies.</description>

      <title>Social feedback amplifies emotional language in online video live chats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05700v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A growing share of human interactions now occurs online, where the expression and perception of emotions are often amplified and distorted. Yet, the interplay between different emotions and the extent to which they are driven by external stimuli or social feedback remains poorly understood. We calibrate a multivariate Hawkes self-exciting point process to model the temporal expression of six basic emotions in YouTube Live chats. This framework captures both temporal and cross-emotional dependencies while allowing us to disentangle the influence of video content (exogenous) from peer interactions (endogenous). We find that emotional expressions are up to four times more strongly driven by peer interaction than by video content. Positivity is more contagious, spreading three times more readily, whereas negativity is more memorable, lingering nearly twice as long. Moreover, we observe asymmetric cross-excitation, with negative emotions frequently triggering positive ones, a pattern consistent with trolling dynamics, but not the reverse. These findings highlight the central role of social interaction in shaping emotional dynamics online and the risks of emotional manipulation as human-chatbot interactions become increasingly realistic.</description>

      <title>Beyond Single-Tokenomics: How Farcaster's Pluralistic Incentives Reshape Social Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the first empirical analysis of how diverse token-based reward mechanisms impact platform dynamics and user behaviors. For this, we gather a unique, large-scale dataset from Farcaster. This blockchain-based, decentralized social network incorporates multiple incentive mechanisms spanning platform-native rewards, third-party token programs, and peer-to-peer tipping. Our dataset captures token transactions and social interactions from 574,829 wallet-linked users, representing 64.25% of the platform's user base. Our socioeconomic analyses reveal how different tokenomics design shape varying participation rates (7.6%--70%) and wealth concentration patterns (Gini 0.72--0.94), whereas inter-community tipping is 1.3--2x more frequent among non-following pairs, thereby mitigating echo chambers. Our causal analyses further uncover several critical trade-offs: (1) while most token rewards boost content creation, they often fail to enhance -- sometimes undermining -- content quality; (2) token rewards increase follower acquisition but show neutral or negative effects on outbound following, suggesting potential asymmetric network growth; (3) repeated algorithmic rewards demonstrate strong cumulative effects that may encourage strategic optimization. Our findings advance understanding of cryptocurrency integration in social platforms and highlight challenges in aligning economic incentives with authentic social value.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Graph Neural Networks in Real world: Imbalance, Noise, Privacy and OOD Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph-structured data exhibits universality and widespread applicability across diverse domains, such as social network analysis, biochemistry, financial fraud detection, and network security. Significant strides have been made in leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to achieve remarkable success in these areas. However, in real-world scenarios, the training environment for models is often far from ideal, leading to substantial performance degradation of GNN models due to various unfavorable factors, including imbalance in data distribution, the presence of noise in erroneous data, privacy protection of sensitive information, and generalization capability for out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To tackle these issues, substantial efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of GNN models in practical real-world scenarios, as well as enhancing their reliability and robustness. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey that systematically reviews existing GNN models, focusing on solutions to the four mentioned real-world challenges including imbalance, noise, privacy, and OOD in practical scenarios that many existing reviews have not considered. Specifically, we first highlight the four key challenges faced by existing GNNs, paving the way for our exploration of real-world GNN models. Subsequently, we provide detailed discussions on these four aspects, dissecting how these solutions contribute to enhancing the reliability and robustness of GNN models. Last but not least, we outline promising directions and offer future perspectives in the field.</description>
