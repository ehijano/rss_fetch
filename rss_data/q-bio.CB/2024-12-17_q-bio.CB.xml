      <title>Hierarchical Control of State Transitions in Dense Associative Memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a generalization of Modern Hopfield networks that emerges naturally in the gene regulatory networks that control cellular identity. Here gene expression patterns correspond to stored memories and the dynamics are governed by the interplay between an inverse-temperature-like parameter $\beta$ and a weight vector $\textbf{w}$. The parameter $\beta$ controls the attractor landscape structure: at large $\beta$, memory patterns are stable attractors, while at lower $\beta$ values, the attractors are associated with progenitor patterns: weighted combinations of two or more memory patterns. We associate progenitor states with self similarity of the model following a coarse graining transformation on memory pattern subsets. We use this transformation to propose a hierarchical model for the control of the identity, stability, and basins of attraction of the progenitor states which facilitates transitions between memory patterns through an annealing-like mechanism. We use this framework to explain the dynamical regulation of blood formation in mammals, demonstrating how robust control of attractor transitions may emerge in complex feedback networks and providing a mathematical basis for well established experimental observations on the hierarchical control of cell identity.</description>

      <title>Inferring nonlinear dynamics of cell migration</title>

Abstract: The motility of eukaryotic cells is strongly influenced by their environment, with confined cells often developing qualitatively different motility patterns from those migrating on simple two-dimensional substrates. Recent experiments, coupled with data-driven methods to extract a cell's equation of motion, showed that cancerous MDA-MB-231 cells persistently hop in a limit cycle when placed on two-state adhesive micropatterns (two large squares connected by a narrow bridge), while they remain stationary on average in rectangular confinements. In contrast, healthy MCF10A cells migrating on the two-state micropattern are bistable, i.e., they settle into either basin on average with only noise-induced hops between the two states. We can capture all these behaviors with a single computational phase field model of a crawling cell, under the assumption that contact with non-adhesive substrate inhibits the cell front. Our model predicts that larger and softer cells are more likely to persistently hop, while smaller and stiffer cells are more likely to be bistable. Other key factors controlling cell migration are the frequency of protrusions and their magnitude of noise. Our results show that relatively simple assumptions about how cells sense their geometry can explain a wide variety of different cell behaviors, and show the power of data-driven approaches to characterize both experiment and simulation.</description>

      <title>Adaptive flexibility of cells through nonequilibrium entropy production</title>

Abstract: Cellular adaptation to environmental changes relies on the dynamic remodeling of subcellular structures. Among these, sarcomere structures are fundamental to the organization and function of the cytoskeletal architecture. In muscle-type cells, sarcomeres exhibit ordered structures of consistent lengths, optimized for stable force generation. By contrast, nonmuscle-type cells display a higher degree of structural variability, with sarcomeres of varying lengths that contribute not only to force generation but also to adaptive remodeling upon environmental cues. While these differences in sarcomere structures have traditionally been attributed to the unique properties of specific proteins expressed in each cell type, the functional implications of such structural variability remain unclear. Here, we present a nonequilibrium physics framework to elucidate the role of sarcomere variability in cytoskeletal adaptation. Specifically, we demonstrate that the effective binding strength of sarcomere components can be evaluated by analyzing structural randomness using Shannon entropy. The increased entropy associated with the inherent randomness of sarcomere structures in nonmuscle-type cells lowers the energy barrier for cytoskeletal remodeling, enabling flexible adaptation to environmental demands. Meanwhile, the ordered sarcomere arrangements in muscle-type cells correspond to higher binding energies and more stable cytoskeletal configurations. Although structural disorder is often regarded as unfavorable in terms of stability, our study suggests that it plays a key role in enabling adaptive responses in cellular systems.</description>
