      <title>New Uniqueness Results For A Mean Field Game Of Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to proving the uniqueness of solutions to a certain class of mean field games of controls. In this class, the equilibrium is determined by an aggregate quantity $Q(t)$, e.g. the market price or production, which then determines optimal trajectories for agents. Our approach consists in analyzing the relationship between $Q(t)$ and corresponding optimal trajectories to find conditions under which there is at most one equilibrium. We show that our conditions do not match those prescribed by the Lasry-Lions monotonicity condition, nor even displacement monotonicity, but they do apply to economic models that have been proposed in the literature.</description>

      <title>From Distributional Robustness to Robust Statistics: A Confidence Sets Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a connection between distributionally robust optimization (DRO) and classical robust statistics. We demonstrate that this connection arises naturally in the context of estimation under data corruption, where the goal is to construct ``minimal'' confidence sets for the unknown data-generating distribution. Specifically, we show that a DRO ambiguity set, based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence and total variation distance, is uniformly minimal, meaning it represents the smallest confidence set that contains the unknown distribution with at a given confidence power. Moreover, we prove that when parametric assumptions are imposed on the unknown distribution, the ambiguity set is never larger than a confidence set based on the optimal estimator proposed by Huber. This insight reveals that the commonly observed conservatism of DRO formulations is not intrinsic to these formulations themselves but rather stems from the non-parametric framework in which these formulations are employed.</description>

      <title>Towards Reliability-Aware Active Distribution System Operations: A Sequential Convex Programming Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demand for electricity and the aging infrastructure of power distribution systems have raised significant concerns about future system reliability. Failures in distribution systems, closely linked to system usage and environmental factors, are the primary contributors to electricity service interruptions. The integration of distributed energy resources (DER) presents an opportunity to enhance system reliability through optimized operations. This paper proposes a novel approach that explicitly incorporates both decision- and context-dependent reliability into the optimization of control setpoints for DERs in active distribution systems. The proposed model captures how operational decisions and ambient temperature impact the likelihood of component failures, enabling a balanced approach to cost efficiency and reliability. By leveraging a logistic function model for component failure rates and employing a sequential convex programming method, the model addresses the challenges of non-convex optimization under decision-dependent uncertainty. Numerical case study on a modified IEEE $33$-bus test system demonstrates the effectiveness of the model in dynamically adjusting power flows and enhancing system robustness under varying environmental conditions and operational loads. The results highlight the potential of DERs to contribute to distribution system reliability by efficiently managing power flows and responding to fluctuating energy demands.</description>

      <title>Independently-Normalized SGD for Generalized-Smooth Nonconvex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that many nonconvex machine learning problems meet a so-called generalized-smooth condition that extends beyond traditional smooth nonconvex optimization. However, the existing algorithms designed for generalized-smooth nonconvex optimization encounter significant limitations in both their design and convergence analysis. In this work, we first study deterministic generalized-smooth nonconvex optimization and analyze the convergence of normalized gradient descent under the generalized Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between gradient normalization and function geometry. Then, for stochastic generalized-smooth nonconvex optimization, we propose an independently-normalized stochastic gradient descent algorithm, which leverages independent sampling, gradient normalization and clipping to achieve an $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ sample complexity under relaxed assumptions. Experiments demonstrate the fast convergence of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Accelerating operator Sinkhorn iteration with overrelaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose accelerated versions of the operator Sinkhorn iteration for operator scaling using successive overrelaxation. We analyze the local convergence rates of these accelerated methods via linearization, which allows us to determine the asymptotically optimal relaxation parameter based on Young's SOR theorem. Using the Hilbert metric on positive definite cones, we also obtain a global convergence result for a geodesic version of overrelaxation in a specific range of relaxation parameters. These techniques generalize corresponding results obtained for matrix scaling by Thibault et al. (Algorithms, 14(5):143, 2021) and Lehmann et al. (Optim. Lett., 16(8):2209--2220, 2022). Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the original operator Sinkhorn iteration in certain applications.</description>

      <title>Aggregation of Bilinear Bipartite Equality Constraints and its Application to Structural Model Updating Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the strength of convex relaxations obtained by convexification of aggregation of constraints for a set $S$ described by two bilinear bipartite equalities. Aggregation is the process of rescaling the original constraints by scalar weights and adding the scaled constraints together. It is natural to study the aggregation technique as it yields a single bilinear bipartite equality whose convex hull is already understood from previous literature. On the theoretical side, we present sufficient conditions when $\text{conv}(S)$ can be described by the intersection of convex hulls of a finite number of aggregations, examples when $\text{conv}(S)$ can only be obtained as the intersection of the convex hull of an infinite number of aggregations, and examples when $\text{conv}(S)$ cannot be achieved exactly from the process of aggregation. Computationally, we explore different methods to derive aggregation weights in order to obtain tight convex relaxations. We show that even if an exact convex hull may not be achieved using aggregations, including the convex hull of an aggregation often significantly tightens the outer approximation of $\text{conv}(S)$. Finally, we apply the aggregation method to obtain convex relaxation for the structural model updating problem and show that this yields better bounds within a branch-and-bound tree as compared to not using aggregations.</description>

      <title>Continuous models combining slacks-based measures of efficiency and super-efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of data envelopment analysis (DEA), Tone (2001) introduced the slacks-based measure (SBM) of efficiency, which is a nonradial model that incorporates all the slacks of the evaluated decision-making units (DMUs) into their efficiency scores, unlike classical radial efficiency models. Next, Tone (2002) developed the SBM super-efficiency model in order to differentiate and rank efficient DMUs, whose SBM efficiency scores are always $1$. However, as pointed out by Chen (2013), some interpretation problems arise when the so-called super-efficiency projections are weakly efficient, leading to an overestimation of the SBM super-efficiency score. Moreover, this overestimation is closely related to discontinuity issues when implementing SBM super-efficiency in conjunction with SBM efficiency. Chen (2013) and Chen et al. (2019) treated these problems, but they did not arrive to a fully satisfactory solution. In this paper, we review these papers and propose a new complementary score, called composite SBM, that actually fixes the discontinuity problems by counteracting the overestimation of the SBM super-efficiency score. Moreover, we extend the composite SBM model to different orientations and variable returns to scale, and propose additive versions. Finally, we give examples and state some open problems.</description>

      <title>On picking operations in e-commerce warehouses: Insights from the complete-information counterpart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Major players in e-commerce process dynamically incoming orders in real-time and already use advanced anticipation techniques, like AI, to predict characteristics of future orders. However, at the warehousing level, there are still no unambiguous recommendations on integrating anticipation with intelligent online optimization algorithms, nor an unbiased benchmark to assess the improvement potential of advanced anticipation over myopic techniques, as optimal online solutions are usually unavailable. In this paper, we compute and analyze Complete-Information Optimal policy Solutions (CIOSs), of an exact perfect anticipation algorithm with full knowledge of future customer orders' arrival times and items, for picking operations in picker-to-parts warehouses. We provide analytical properties and leverage CIOSs to uncover decision patterns that enhance simpler algorithms, improving both makespan (costs) and order turnover (delivery speed). Using a metric similar to the gap to optimality, we quantify the gains from optimization elements and the improvements remaining for advanced anticipation mechanisms. To compute CIOSs, we design the first exact algorithm for the Order Batching, Sequencing, and Routing Problem with Release Times (OBSRP-R), based on dynamic programming. Our analysis advises on the largely overlooked intervention - the dynamic adjustment of started batches, and the strategic relocation of an idle picker towards future picking locations. The former affected over 60% of CIOS orders and triggered consistent improvements across warehousing policies. The latter occurred before 39%-62% CIOS orders and could decrease a myopic policy's gap to optimal turnover by 4.3% on average (up to 14%). Notably, we challenge the debated concept of strategic waiting, revealing why the latter resembles an "all-in" gamble and harms both makespan and order turnover when intervention is allowed.</description>

      <title>Extra-Gradient Method with Flexible Anchoring: Strong Convergence and Fast Residual Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel Extra-Gradient method with anchor term governed by general parameters. Our method is derived from an explicit discretization of a Tikhonov-regularized monotone flow in Hilbert space, which provides a theoretical foundation for analyzing its convergence properties. We establish strong convergence to specific points within the solution set, as well as convergence rates expressed in terms of the regularization parameters. Notably, our approach recovers the fast residual decay rate $O(k^{-1})$ for standard parameter choices. Numerical experiments highlight the competitiveness of the method and demonstrate how its flexible design enhances practical performance.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity analysis for linear changes of the constraint matrix of a linear program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the variation of the optimal value with respect to change in the data is an old problem of mathematical optimisation. This paper focuses on the linear problem $f(\lambda) = \min c^t x$ such that $(A+\lambda D)x \leq b$, where $\lambda$ is an unknown parameter that varies within an interval and $D$ is a matrix modifying the coefficients of the constraint matrix $A$. This problem is used to analyse the impact of multiple affine changes in the constraint matrix on the objective function. The function $f(\lambda)$ can have an erratic behaviour and computing it for a large number of points is computationally heavy while not providing any guarantees in between the computed points. As a new approach to the problem, we derive several bounding methods that provide guarantees on the objective function's behaviour. Those guarantees can be exploited to avoid recomputing the problem for numerous $\lambda$. The bounding methods are based on approaches from robust optimisation or Lagrangian relaxations. For each approach, we derive three methods of increasing complexity and precision, one that provides constant bounds, one that provides $\lambda$-dependant bounds and envelope bounds. We assess each bounding method in terms of precision, availability and timing. We show that for a large number of problems, the bound approach outperforms the naive sampling approach considered with 100 points while still providing a good precision and stronger guarantees on a large dataset of problems. We also introduce an iterative algorithm that uses these bounds to compute an approximation of the original function within a given error threshold and discuss its performances.</description>

      <title>Data-driven topology design with persistent homology for enhancing population diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a selection strategy for enhancing population diversity in data-driven topology design (DDTD), a topology optimization framework based on evolutionary algorithms (EAs) using a deep generative model. While population diversity is essential for global search with EAs, conventional selection operators that preserve diverse solutions based on objective values may still lead to a loss of population diversity in topology optimization problems due to the high dimensionality of design variable space and strong nonlinearity of evaluation functions. Motivated by the idea that topology is what characterizes the inherent diversity among material distributions, we employ a topological data analysis method called persistent homology. As a specific operation, a Wasserstein distance sorting between persistence diagrams is introduced into a selection algorithm to maintain the intrinsic population diversity. We apply the proposed selection operation incorporated into DDTD to a stress-based topology optimization problem as a numerical example. The results confirm that topology can be analyzed using persistent homology and that the proposed selection operation significantly enhances the search performance of DDTD.</description>

      <title>Evacuation Planning on Time-Expanded Networks with Integrated Wildfire Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of evacuation planning for natural disasters, focusing on wildfire evacuations. By creating pre-planned evacuation routes that can be updated based on real-time data, we provide an easily adjustable approach to fire evacuation planning and implementation. Our method uses publicly available data and can be easily tailored for a particular region or circumstance.
  We formulate large-scale evacuations as maximum flow problems on time-expanded networks, in which we integrate fire information given in the form of a shapefile. An initial flow is found based on a predicted fire, and is then updated based on revised fire information received during the evacuation.
  We provide a proof on concept on three locations with historic deadly fires using data available through OpenStreetMaps, a basemap for a geographic information system (GIS), on a NetworkX Python script. The results validate viable running times and quality of information for application in practice.</description>

      <title>Performance bounds for multi-vehicle networks with local integrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of coordinating a collection of $n$th-order integrator systems. The coordination is achieved through the novel serial-consensus design, which can be seen as a method for achieving a stable closed-loop while only using local relative measurements. Earlier work has shown that second-order serial consensus can stabilize a collection of double integrators with scalable performance conditions, independent of the number of agents and topology. In this paper, we generalize these performance results to an arbitrary order $n\geq 1$. The derived performance bound depends on the condition number, measured in the vector-induced maximum matrix norm, of a general diagonalizing matrix. We provide an exact characterization of how a minimal condition number can be achieved. Third-order serial consensus is illustrated through a case study of PI-controlled vehicular formation, where the added integrators are used to mitigate the effect of unmeasured load disturbances. The theoretical results are illustrated through examples.</description>

      <title>Contractivity and linear convergence in bilinear saddle-point problems: An operator-theoretic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the convex-concave bilinear saddle-point problem $\min_x \max_y f(x) + y^\top Ax - g(y)$, where both, only one, or none of the functions $f$ and $g$ are strongly convex, and suitable rank conditions on the matrix $A$ hold. The solution of this problem is at the core of many machine learning tasks. By employing tools from operator theory, we systematically prove the contractivity (in turn, the linear convergence) of several first-order primal-dual algorithms, including the Chambolle-Pock method. Our approach results in concise and elegant proofs, and it yields new convergence guarantees and tighter bounds compared to known results.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Stochastic Gradient Descent and Heavy-tailed Noise: A Unified Framework and High-probability Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study high-probability convergence in online learning, in the presence of heavy-tailed noise. To combat the heavy tails, a general framework of nonlinear SGD methods is considered, subsuming several popular nonlinearities like sign, quantization, component-wise and joint clipping. In our work the nonlinearity is treated in a black-box manner, allowing us to establish unified guarantees for a broad range of nonlinear methods. For symmetric noise and non-convex costs we establish convergence of gradient norm-squared, at a rate $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(t^{-1/4})$, while for the last iterate of strongly convex costs we establish convergence to the population optima, at a rate $\mathcal{O}(t^{-\zeta})$, where $\zeta \in (0,1)$ depends on noise and problem parameters. Further, if the noise is a (biased) mixture of symmetric and non-symmetric components, we show convergence to a neighbourhood of stationarity, whose size depends on the mixture coefficient, nonlinearity and noise. Compared to state-of-the-art, who only consider clipping and require unbiased noise with bounded $p$-th moments, $p \in (1,2]$, we provide guarantees for a broad class of nonlinearities, without any assumptions on noise moments. While the rate exponents in state-of-the-art depend on noise moments and vanish as $p \rightarrow 1$, our exponents are constant and strictly better whenever $p &lt; 6/5$ for non-convex and $p &lt; 8/7$ for strongly convex costs. Experiments validate our theory, demonstrating noise symmetry in real-life settings and showing that clipping is not always the optimal nonlinearity, further underlining the value of a general framework.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sparse PCA via Block-Diagonalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse Principal Component Analysis (Sparse PCA) is a pivotal tool in data analysis and dimensionality reduction. However, Sparse PCA is a challenging problem in both theory and practice: it is known to be NP-hard and current exact methods generally require exponential runtime. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to efficiently approximate Sparse PCA by (i) approximating the general input covariance matrix with a re-sorted block-diagonal matrix, (ii) solving the Sparse PCA sub-problem in each block, and (iii) reconstructing the solution to the original problem. Our framework is simple and powerful: it can leverage any off-the-shelf Sparse PCA algorithm and achieve significant computational speedups, with a minor additive error that is linear in the approximation error of the block-diagonal matrix. Suppose $g(k, d)$ is the runtime of an algorithm (approximately) solving Sparse PCA in dimension $d$ and with sparsity value $k$. Our framework, when integrated with this algorithm, reduces the runtime to $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{d}{d^\star} \cdot g(k, d^\star) + d^2\right)$, where $d^\star \leq d$ is the largest block size of the block-diagonal matrix. For instance, integrating our framework with the Branch-and-Bound algorithm reduces the complexity from $g(k, d) = \mathcal{O}(k^3\cdot d^k)$ to $\mathcal{O}(k^3\cdot d \cdot (d^\star)^{k-1})$, demonstrating exponential speedups if $d^\star$ is small. We perform large-scale evaluations on many real-world datasets: for exact Sparse PCA algorithm, our method achieves an average speedup factor of 93.77, while maintaining an average approximation error of 2.15%; for approximate Sparse PCA algorithm, our method achieves an average speedup factor of 6.77 and an average approximation error of merely 0.37%.</description>

      <title>A Communication and Computation Efficient Fully First-order Method for Decentralized Bilevel Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization, crucial for hyperparameter tuning, meta-learning and reinforcement learning, remains less explored in the decentralized learning paradigm, such as decentralized federated learning (DFL). Typically, decentralized bilevel methods rely on both gradients and Hessian matrices to approximate hypergradients of upper-level models. However, acquiring and sharing the second-order oracle is compute and communication intensive. % and sharing this information incurs heavy communication overhead. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a fully first-order decentralized method for decentralized Bilevel optimization, $\text{C}^2$DFB which is both compute- and communicate-efficient. In $\text{C}^2$DFB, each learning node optimizes a min-min-max problem to approximate hypergradient by exclusively using gradients information. To reduce the traffic load at the inner-loop of solving the lower-level problem, $\text{C}^2$DFB incorporates a lightweight communication protocol for efficiently transmitting compressed residuals of local parameters. % during the inner loops. Rigorous theoretical analysis ensures its convergence % of the algorithm, indicating a first-order oracle calls of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-4})$. Experiments on hyperparameter tuning and hyper-representation tasks validate the superiority of $\text{C}^2$DFB across various typologies and heterogeneous data distributions.</description>

      <title>Robustness to Model Approximation, Learning, and Sample Complexity in Wasserstein Regular MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the robustness property of discrete-time stochastic optimal control for Wasserstein model approximation under various performance criteria. Specifically, we study the performance loss when applying an optimal policy designed for an approximate model to the true dynamics compared with the optimal cost for the true model under the sup-norm-induced metric, and relate this to the Wasserstein-1 distance between the approximate and true transition kernel, under both discounted cost and average cost criteria. A primary motivation of this analysis is on empirical model estimation, where Wasserstein convergence holds under mild conditions but stronger convergence criterion, such as total variation, may not. We will discuss the application of the results to the disturbance estimation problem, where sample complexity bounds on mismatch loss are given. A further application regarding the continuity of invariant probability measures with respect to transition kernels is also discussed.</description>

      <title>A Mirror Descent Perspective of Smoothed Sign Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work by Woodworth et al. (2020) shows that the optimization dynamics of gradient descent for overparameterized problems can be viewed as low-dimensional dual dynamics induced by a mirror map, explaining the implicit regularization phenomenon from the mirror descent perspective. However, the methodology does not apply to algorithms where update directions deviate from true gradients, such as ADAM. We use the mirror descent framework to study the dynamics of smoothed sign descent with a stability constant $\varepsilon$ for regression problems. We propose a mirror map that establishes equivalence to dual dynamics under some assumptions. By studying dual dynamics, we characterize the convergent solution as an approximate KKT point of minimizing a Bregman divergence style function, and show the benefit of tuning the stability constant $\varepsilon$ to reduce the KKT error.</description>

      <title>Elements of disinformation theory: cyber engagement via increasing adversary information consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the case where an adversary is conducting a surveillance campaign against a networked control system (NCS), and take the perspective of a defender/control system operator who has successfully isolated the cyber intruder. To better understand the adversary's intentions and to drive up their operating costs, the defender directs the adversary towards a ``honeypot" that emulates a real control system and without actual connections to a physical plant. We propose a strategy for adversary engagement within the ``honey" control system to increase the adversary's costs of information processing. We assume that, based on an understanding of the adversary's control theoretic goals, cyber threat intelligence (CTI) provides the defender knowledge of the adversary's preferences for information acquisition. We use this knowledge to spoof sensor readings to maximize the amount of information the adversary consumes while making it (information theoretically) difficult for the adversary to detect that they are being spoofed. We discuss the case of imperfect versus perfect threat intelligence and perform a numerical comparison.</description>

      <title>Unified Convergence Analysis for Score-Based Diffusion Models with Deterministic Samplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have emerged as powerful techniques for generating samples from high-dimensional data distributions. These models involve a two-phase process: first, injecting noise to transform the data distribution into a known prior distribution, and second, sampling to recover the original data distribution from noise. Among the various sampling methods, deterministic samplers stand out for their enhanced efficiency. However, analyzing these deterministic samplers presents unique challenges, as they preclude the use of established techniques such as Girsanov's theorem, which are only applicable to stochastic samplers. Furthermore, existing analysis for deterministic samplers usually focuses on specific examples, lacking a generalized approach for general forward processes and various deterministic samplers. Our paper addresses these limitations by introducing a unified convergence analysis framework. To demonstrate the power of our framework, we analyze the variance-preserving (VP) forward process with the exponential integrator (EI) scheme, achieving iteration complexity of $\tilde O(d^2/\epsilon)$. Additionally, we provide a detailed analysis of Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM)-type samplers, which have been underexplored in previous research, achieving polynomial iteration complexity.</description>

Abstract: We construct a new family of chance constrained directional models in stochastic data envelopment analysis, generalizing the deterministic directional models and the chance constrained radial models. We prove that chance constrained directional models define the same concept of stochastic efficiency as the one given by chance constrained radial models and, as a particular case, we obtain a stochastic version of the generalized Farrell measure. Finally, we give some examples of application of chance constrained directional models with stochastic and deterministic directions, showing that inefficiency scores obtained with stochastic directions are less or equal than those obtained considering deterministic directions whose values are the means of the stochastic ones.</description>

      <title>Boosting K-means for Big Data by Fusing Data Streaming with Global Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: K-means clustering is a cornerstone of data mining, but its efficiency deteriorates when confronted with massive datasets. To address this limitation, we propose a novel heuristic algorithm that leverages the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) metaheuristic to optimize K-means clustering for big data. Our approach is based on the sequential optimization of the partial objective function landscapes obtained by restricting the Minimum Sum-of-Squares Clustering (MSSC) formulation to random samples from the original big dataset. Within each landscape, systematically expanding neighborhoods of the currently best (incumbent) solution are explored by reinitializing all degenerate and a varying number of additional centroids. Extensive and rigorous experimentation on a large number of real-world datasets reveals that by transforming the traditional local search into a global one, our algorithm significantly enhances the accuracy and efficiency of K-means clustering in big data environments, becoming the new state of the art in the field.</description>

      <title>Near-optimal Approaches for Binary-Continuous Sum-of-ratios Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a class of non-convex sum-of-ratios programs relevant to decision-making in key areas such as product assortment and pricing, facility location and cost planning, and security games. These optimization problems, characterized by both continuous and binary decision variables, are highly non-convex and challenging to solve. To the best of our knowledge, no existing methods can efficiently solve these problems to near-optimality with arbitrary precision. To address this challenge, we explore a piecewise linear approximation approach that enables the approximation of complex nonlinear components of the objective function as linear functions. We then demonstrate that the approximated problem can be reformulated as a mixed-integer linear program, a second-order cone program, or a bilinear program, all of which can be solved to optimality using off-the-shelf solvers like CPLEX or GUROBI. Additionally, we provide theoretical bounds on the approximation errors associated with the solutions derived from the approximated problem. We illustrate the applicability of our approach to competitive joint facility location and cost optimization, as well as product assortment and pricing problems. Extensive experiments on instances of varying sizes are conducted to assess the efficiency of our method.</description>

      <title>Fixed non-stockout-probability policies for the single-item lost-sales model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the classical discrete time lost-sales model under stationary continuous demand and linear holding and penalty costs and positive constant lead time. To date the optimal policy structure is only known implicitly by solving numerically the Bellman equations. In this paper we derive an optimality equation for the lost-sales model. We propose a fixed non-stockout-probability (FP3) policy, implying that each period the order size ensures that P3, the probability of no-stockout at the end of the period of arrival of this order, equals some target value. The FP3-policy can be computed efficiently and accurately from an exact recursive expression and two-moment fits to the emerging random variables. We use the lost-sales optimality equation to compute the optimal FP3-policy. Comparison against the optimal policy for discrete demand suggests that the fixed P3-policy is close-to-optimal. An extensive numerical experiment shows that the FP3-policy outperforms other policies proposed in literature in 97% of all cases. Under the FP3-policy, the volatility of the replenishment process, measured as coefficient of variation (cv) is much lower than the volatility of the demand process. This cv-reduction holds a promise for substantial cost reduction at upstream stages in the supply chain of the end-item under consideration, compared to the situation with backlogging.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a Smoothing Accelerated Proximal Gradient Method with Extrapolation Term (SAPGM) for nonsmooth multiobjective optimization. By combining the smoothing methods and the accelerated algorithm for multiobjective optimization by Tanabe et al., our method achieve fast convergence rate. Specifically, we establish that the convergence rate of our proposed method can be enhanced to $o(\ln^\sigma k/k)$ by incorporating a extrapolation term $\frac{k-1}{k + \alpha -1}$ with $\alpha &gt; 3$.Moreover, we prove that the iterates sequence is convergent to a Pareto optimal solution of the primal problem. Furthermore, we present an effective strategy for solving the subproblem through its dual representation, validating the efficacy of the proposed method through a series of numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: We consider constraints on the measure of the support for integrable functions on arbitrary measure spaces. It is shown that this non-convex and discontinuous constraint can be equivalently reformulated by the difference of two convex and continuous functions, namely the $L^1$-norm and the so-called largest-$K$-norm. The largest-$K$-norm is studied and its convex subdifferential is derived. A corresponding penalty method is proposed, and its numerical solution by a DC method is investigated. Numerical experiments for two example problems, including a sparse optimal control problem, are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider assortment and inventory planning problems with dynamic stockout-based substitution effects, and without replenishment, in two different settings: (1) Customers can see all available products when they arrive, a typical scenario in physical stores. (2) The seller can choose to offer a subset of available products to each customer, which is more common on online platforms. Both settings are known to be computationally challenging, and the current approximation algorithms for the two settings are quite different. We develop a unified algorithm framework under the MNL choice model for both settings. Our algorithms improve on the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of approximation guarantee and runtime, and the ability to manage uncertainty in the total number of customers and handle more complex constraints. In the process, we establish various novel properties of dynamic assortment planning (for the MNL choice model) that may be useful more broadly.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Control for Diffusion Aggregation system with Coulomb Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mean-field control problem for a multi-dimensional diffusion-aggregation system with Coulomb interaction (the so called parabolic elliptic Keller-Segel system) is considered. The existence of optimal control is proved through the $\Gamma$-convergence of the corresponding control problem of the interacting particle system. There are three building blocks in the whole argument. Firstly, for the optimal control problem on the particle level, instead of using classical method for stochastic system, we study directly the control problem of high-dimensional parabolic equation, i.e. the Liouville equation of it. Secondly, we obtain a strong propagation of chaos result for the interacting particle system by combining the convergence in probability and relative entropy method. Due to this strong mean field limit result, we avoid giving compact support requirement for control functions, which has been often used in the literature. Thirdly, because of strong aggregation effect, additional difficulties arise from control function in obtaining the well-posedness theory of the diffusion-aggregation equation, so that the known method cannot be directly applied. Instead, we use a combination of local existence result and bootstrap argument to obtain the global solution in the sub-critical regime.</description>

      <title>Distributionally and Adversarially Robust Logistic Regression via Intersecting Wasserstein Balls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adversarially robust optimization (ARO) has become the de facto standard for training models to defend against adversarial attacks during testing. However, despite their robustness, these models often suffer from severe overfitting. To mitigate this issue, several successful approaches have been proposed, including replacing the empirical distribution in training with: (i) a worst-case distribution within an ambiguity set, leading to a distributionally robust (DR) counterpart of ARO; or (ii) a mixture of the empirical distribution with one derived from an auxiliary dataset (e.g., synthetic, external, or out-of-domain). Building on the first approach, we explore the Wasserstein DR counterpart of ARO for logistic regression and show it admits a tractable convex optimization reformulation. Adopting the second approach, we enhance the DR framework by intersecting its ambiguity set with one constructed from an auxiliary dataset, which yields significant improvements when the Wasserstein distance between the data-generating and auxiliary distributions can be estimated. We analyze the resulting optimization problem, develop efficient solutions, and show that our method outperforms benchmark approaches on standard datasets.</description>

      <title>Optimization Dynamics of Equivariant and Augmented Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: We investigate the optimization of neural networks on symmetric data, and compare the strategy of constraining the architecture to be equivariant to that of using data augmentation. Our analysis reveals that that the relative geometry of the admissible and the equivariant layers, respectively, plays a key role. Under natural assumptions on the data, network, loss, and group of symmetries, we show that compatibility of the spaces of admissible layers and equivariant layers, in the sense that the corresponding orthogonal projections commute, implies that the sets of equivariant stationary points are identical for the two strategies. If the linear layers of the network also are given a unitary parametrization, the set of equivariant layers is even invariant under the gradient flow for augmented models. Our analysis however also reveals that even in the latter situation, stationary points may be unstable for augmented training although they are stable for the manifestly equivariant models.</description>

      <title>Learning-Augmented Decentralized Online Convex Optimization in Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10158v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies decentralized online convex optimization in a networked multi-agent system and proposes a novel algorithm, Learning-Augmented Decentralized Online optimization (LADO), for individual agents to select actions only based on local online information. LADO leverages a baseline policy to safeguard online actions for worst-case robustness guarantees, while staying close to the machine learning (ML) policy for average performance improvement. In stark contrast with the existing learning-augmented online algorithms that focus on centralized settings, LADO achieves strong robustness guarantees in a decentralized setting. We also prove the average cost bound for LADO, revealing the tradeoff between average performance and worst-case robustness and demonstrating the advantage of training the ML policy by explicitly considering the robustness requirement.</description>

      <title>Predicting Accurate Lagrangian Multipliers for Mixed Integer Linear Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lagrangian relaxation stands among the most efficient approaches for solving a Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILP) with difficult constraints. Given any duals for these constraints, called Lagrangian Multipliers (LMs), it returns a bound on the optimal value of the MILP, and Lagrangian methods seek the LMs giving the best such bound. But these methods generally rely on iterative algorithms resembling gradient descent to maximize the concave piecewise linear dual function: the computational burden grows quickly with the number of relaxed constraints. We introduce a deep learning approach that bypasses the descent, effectively amortizing the local, per instance, optimization. A probabilistic encoder based on a graph convolutional network computes high-dimensional representations of relaxed constraints in MILP instances. A decoder then turns these representations into LMs. We train the encoder and decoder jointly by directly optimizing the bound obtained from the predicted multipliers. Numerical experiments show that our approach closes up to 85~\% of the gap between the continuous relaxation and the best Lagrangian bound, and provides a high quality warm-start for descent based Lagrangian methods.</description>

      <title>AdaFisher: Adaptive Second Order Optimization via Fisher Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: First-order optimization methods are currently the mainstream in training deep neural networks (DNNs). Optimizers like Adam incorporate limited curvature information by employing the diagonal matrix preconditioning of the stochastic gradient during the training. Despite their widespread, second-order optimization algorithms exhibit superior convergence properties compared to their first-order counterparts e.g. Adam and SGD. However, their practicality in training DNNs are still limited due to increased per-iteration computations and suboptimal accuracy compared to the first order methods. We present AdaFisher--an adaptive second-order optimizer that leverages a block-diagonal approximation to the Fisher information matrix for adaptive gradient preconditioning. AdaFisher aims to bridge the gap between enhanced convergence capabilities and computational efficiency in second-order optimization framework for training DNNs. Despite the slow pace of second-order optimizers, we showcase that AdaFisher can be reliably adopted for image classification, language modelling and stand out for its stability and robustness in hyperparameter tuning. We demonstrate that AdaFisher outperforms the SOTA optimizers in terms of both accuracy and convergence speed. Code is available from https://github.com/AtlasAnalyticsLab/AdaFisher.</description>

      <title>Proximal Interacting Particle Langevin Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of algorithms, termed Proximal Interacting Particle Langevin Algorithms (PIPLA), for inference and learning in latent variable models whose joint probability density is non-differentiable. Leveraging proximal Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques and the recently introduced interacting particle Langevin algorithm (IPLA), we propose several variants within the novel proximal IPLA family, tailored to the problem of estimating parameters in a non-differentiable statistical model. We prove nonasymptotic bounds for the parameter estimates produced by multiple algorithms in the strongly log-concave setting and provide comprehensive numerical experiments on various models to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. In particular, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed family of algorithms on a toy hierarchical example where our assumptions can be checked, as well as on the problems of sparse Bayesian logistic regression, sparse Bayesian neural network, and sparse matrix completion. Our theory and experiments together show that PIPLA family can be the de facto choice for parameter estimation problems in latent variable models for non-differentiable models.</description>

      <title>Distributed Optimization with Finite Bit Adaptive Quantization for Efficient Communication and Precision Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In realistic distributed optimization scenarios, individual nodes possess only partial information and communicate over bandwidth constrained channels. For this reason, the development of efficient distributed algorithms is essential. In our paper we addresses the challenge of unconstrained distributed optimization. In our scenario each node's local function exhibits strong convexity with Lipschitz continuous gradients. The exchange of information between nodes occurs through $3$-bit bandwidth-limited channels (i.e., nodes exchange messages represented by a only $3$-bits). Our proposed algorithm respects the network's bandwidth constraints by leveraging zoom-in and zoom-out operations to adjust quantizer parameters dynamically. We show that during our algorithm's operation nodes are able to converge to the exact optimal solution. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm achieves a linear convergence rate to the optimal solution. We conclude the paper with simulations that highlight our algorithm's unique characteristics.</description>
