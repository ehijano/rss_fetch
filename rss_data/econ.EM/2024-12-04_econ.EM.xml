      <title>Endogenous Interference in Randomized Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the identification and inference of treatment effects in randomized controlled trials with social interactions. Two key network features characterize the setting and introduce endogeneity: (1) latent variables may affect both network formation and outcomes, and (2) the intervention may alter network structure, mediating treatment effects. I make three contributions. First, I define parameters within a post-treatment network framework, distinguishing direct effects of treatment from indirect effects mediated through changes in network structure. I provide a causal interpretation of the coefficients in a linear outcome model. For estimation and inference, I focus on a specific form of peer effects, represented by the fraction of treated friends. Second, in the absence of endogeneity, I establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of ordinary least squares estimators. Third, if endogeneity is present, I propose addressing it through shift-share instrumental variables, demonstrating the consistency and asymptotic normality of instrumental variable estimators in relatively sparse networks. For denser networks, I propose a denoised estimator based on eigendecomposition to restore consistency. Finally, I revisit Prina (2015) as an empirical illustration, demonstrating that treatment can influence outcomes both directly and through network structure changes.</description>

      <title>Simple and Effective Portfolio Construction with Crypto Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing a portfolio that combines traditional financial assets with crypto assets. We show that despite the documented attributes of crypto assets, such as high volatility, heavy tails, excess kurtosis, and skewness, a simple extension of traditional risk allocation provides robust solutions for integrating these emerging assets into broader investment strategies. Examination of the risk allocation holdings suggests an even simpler method, analogous to the traditional 60/40 stocks/bonds allocation, involving a fixed allocation to crypto and traditional assets, dynamically diluted with cash to achieve a target risk level.</description>

      <title>A Markowitz Approach to Managing a Dynamic Basket of Moving-Band Statistical Arbitrages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of managing a portfolio of moving-band statistical arbitrages (MBSAs), inspired by the Markowitz optimization framework. We show how to manage a dynamic basket of MBSAs, and illustrate the method on recent historical data, showing that it can perform very well in terms of risk-adjusted return, essentially uncorrelated with the market.</description>

      <title>Selective Reviews of Bandit Problems in AI via a Statistical View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a widely researched area in artificial intelligence that focuses on teaching agents decision-making through interactions with their environment. A key subset includes stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) and continuum-armed bandit (SCAB) problems, which model sequential decision-making under uncertainty. This review outlines the foundational models and assumptions of bandit problems, explores non-asymptotic theoretical tools like concentration inequalities and minimax regret bounds, and compares frequentist and Bayesian algorithms for managing exploration-exploitation trade-offs. We also extend the discussion to $K$-armed contextual bandits and SCAB, examining their methodologies, regret analyses, and discussing the relation between the SCAB problems and the functional data analysis. Finally, we highlight recent advances and ongoing challenges in the field.</description>

      <title>Use of surrogate endpoints in health technology assessment: a review of selected NICE technology appraisals in oncology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objectives: Surrogate endpoints, used to substitute for and predict final clinical outcomes, are increasingly being used to support submissions to health technology assessment agencies. The increase in use of surrogate endpoints has been accompanied by literature describing frameworks and statistical methods to ensure their robust validation. The aim of this review was to assess how surrogate endpoints have recently been used in oncology technology appraisals by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales.
  Methods: This paper identified technology appraisals in oncology published by NICE between February 2022 and May 2023. Data are extracted on methods for the use and validation of surrogate endpoints.
  Results: Of the 47 technology appraisals in oncology available for review, 18 (38 percent) utilised surrogate endpoints, with 37 separate surrogate endpoints being discussed. However, the evidence supporting the validity of the surrogate relationship varied significantly across putative surrogate relationships with 11 providing RCT evidence, 7 providing evidence from observational studies, 12 based on clinical opinion and 7 providing no evidence for the use of surrogate endpoints.
  Conclusions: This review supports the assertion that surrogate endpoints are frequently used in oncology technology appraisals in England and Wales. Despite increasing availability of statistical methods and guidance on appropriate validation of surrogate endpoints, this review highlights that use and validation of surrogate endpoints can vary between technology appraisals which can lead to uncertainty in decision-making.</description>

      <title>Modelling Large Dimensional Datasets with Markov Switching Factor Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09828v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a novel large dimensional approximate factor model with regime changes in the loadings driven by a latent first order Markov process. By exploiting the equivalent linear representation of the model, we first recover the latent factors by means of Principal Component Analysis. We then cast the model in state-space form, and we estimate loadings and transition probabilities through an EM algorithm based on a modified version of the Baum-Lindgren-Hamilton-Kim filter and smoother that makes use of the factors previously estimated. Our approach is appealing as it provides closed form expressions for all estimators. More importantly, it does not require knowledge of the true number of factors. We derive the theoretical properties of the proposed estimation procedure, and we show their good finite sample performance through a comprehensive set of Monte Carlo experiments. The empirical usefulness of our approach is illustrated through three applications to large U.S. datasets of stock returns, macroeconomic variables, and inflation indexes.</description>

      <title>Identifying Treatment and Spillover Effects Using Exposure Contrasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08183v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To report spillover effects, a common practice is to regress outcomes on statistics capturing treatment variation among neighboring units. This paper studies the causal interpretation of nonparametric analogs of these estimands, which we refer to as exposure contrasts. We demonstrate that their signs can be inconsistent with those of the unit-level effects of interest even under unconfounded assignment. We then provide interpretable restrictions under which exposure contrasts are sign preserving and therefore have causal interpretations. We discuss the implications of our results for cluster-randomized trials, network experiments, and observational settings with peer effects in selection into treatment.</description>
