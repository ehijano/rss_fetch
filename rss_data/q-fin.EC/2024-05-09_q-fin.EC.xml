      <title>Shaping the Future of Urban Mobility: Insights into Autonomous Vehicle Acceptance in Shanghai Through TAM and Perceived Risk Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have begun experimental commercialization initiatives in places such as Shanghai, China, and it is a valuable research question whether people's willingness to use AVs has changed from the prior. This study explores Shanghai residents' attitudes towards AVs by applying the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the Perceived Risk (BAR) model, and introducing perceived externalities as a new psychological variable. Through a survey in Shanghai, where AVs are operational, and structural equation modeling, it was found that perceived usefulness and ease of use positively influence willingness to use AVs, with perceived usefulness being the most significant factor. Perceived externalities have a positive impact, while perceived risk negatively affects willingness to use. Interestingly, ease of use increases perceived risk, but this is mitigated by the benefits perceived in usefulness. This research, differing significantly from previous studies, aims to guide government policy and industry strategies to enhance design, marketing, and popularization.</description>

      <title>Financial knowledge and borrower discouragement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study provides first empirical evidence on the impact of entrepreneurs' financial knowledge on borrower discouragement. Using novel survey data on Italian micro-enterprises, we find that less financially knowledgeable entrepreneurs are more likely to be discouraged from applying for new financing, due to higher application costs and expected rejection. Our main results are robust to several sensitivity checks, including accounting for potential endogeneity. Furthermore, we show that the observed self-rationing mechanism is rather inefficient, suggesting that financial knowledge might play a key role in reducing credit market imperfections.</description>
