      <title>Evolution of the Dual AGN in Mrk 266: A Young AGN and a Rotation Dominated Disk in the SW Nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) offer a unique opportunity to probe the relationship between super massive black holes (SMBH) and their host galaxies as well as the role of major mergers in triggering AGN activity. The confirmed dual AGN Mrk 266 has been studied extensively with multi-wavelength imaging. Now, high spatial resolution IFU spectroscopy of Mrk 266 provides an opportunity to probe the kinematics of both the merger event and AGN feedback. We present for the first time high spatial resolution kinematic maps for both nuclei of Mrk 266 obtained with the Keck OSIRIS IFU spectrograph, utilizing adaptive optics to achieve a resolution of 0.31" and 0.20" for the NE and SW nuclei, respectively. Using the M-sigma relation for mergers, we infer a SMBH mass of approximately 7e7 solar masses for the southwestern nucleus. Additionally, we report that the molecular gas kinematics of the southwestern nucleus are dominated by rotation rather than large-scale chaotic motions. The southwest nucleus also contains both a circumnuclear ring of star formation from which an inflow of molecular gas is likely fueling the AGN and a compact, AGN-dominated outflow of highly ionized gas with a timescale of approximately 2 Myr, significantly shorter than the timescale of the merger. The northeastern nucleus, on the other hand, exhibits complex kinematics related to the merger, including molecular gas that appears to have decoupled from the rotation of the stars. Our results suggest that while the AGN activity in Mrk 266 was likely triggered during the merger, AGN feeding is currently the result of processes internal to each host galaxy, thus resulting in a strong asymmetry between the two nuclei.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium dynamical models in the inner region of the Large Magellanic Cloud based on Gaia DR3 kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Gaia DR3 to explore how well equilibrium dynamical models based on the Jeans equations and the Schwarzschild orbit superposition method are able to describe LMC's 5-dimensional phase-space distribution and line-of-sight (LOS) velocity distribution, respectively. In the latter model we incorporate a triaxial bar component and derive LMC's bar pattern speed. We fit Jeans dynamical models to all Gaia DR3 stars with proper motion and LOS velocity measurements found in the VMC VISTA survey of the LMC using a discrete maximum likelihood approach. These models are very efficient at discriminating genuine LMC member stars from Milky Way foreground stars and background galaxies. They constrain the shape, orientation, and enclosed mass of the galaxy under the assumption for axisymmetry. We use the Jeans model results as a stepping stone to more complex 2-component Schwarzschild models, which include an axisymmetric disc and a co-centric triaxial bar, which we fit to the LMC Gaia DR3 LOS velocity field, using a chi^2 minimisation approach. The Jeans models describe well the rotation and velocity dispersion of the LMC disc and we find an inclination angle 25.5 deg, line of nodes orientation 124 deg, and an intrinsic thickness of the disc 0.23 (minor to major axis ratio). However, bound to axisymmetry, these models fail to properly describe the kinematics in the central region of the galaxy, dominated by the bar. We use the derived disc orientation and the Gaia DR3 density image of the LMC to obtain the intrinsic shape of the bar. Using these two components as an input to our Schwarzschild models, we perform orbit integration and weighting in a rotating reference frame fixed to the bar, deriving an independent measurement of the LMC bar pattern speed 11+/-4 km/s/kpc. Both the Jeans and Schwarzschild models predict the same enclosed mass distribution within a radius of 6.2 kpc of ~1.4e10 Msun.</description>

      <title>A history of galaxy migrations over the Stellar Mass - SFR plane from the COSMOS-Web survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar mass-star formation rate (M$_\star$ - SFR) plane is essential for distinguishing galaxy populations, but how galaxies move within this plane over cosmic time remains unclear. This study aims to describe galaxy migrations in the M$_\star$ - SFR plane by reconstructing star formation histories (SFHs) for a sample of galaxies out to redshift $z &lt; 4$. This provides insights into the physical processes driving star formation. We use data from the COSMOS field, selecting 299131 galaxies at $z &lt; 4$ with COSMOS-Web NIRCam data (m$_\mathrm{F444W} &lt; 27$) over 0.54 deg$^2$. Using the SED modeling code CIGALE with non-parametric SFHs, we derive physical properties and migration vectors for these galaxies. These vectors describe the direction and velocity of evolutionary paths across the M$_\star$ - SFR plane. To assess the accuracy of these vectors, we compare them to results from the Horizon-AGN simulation. Galaxies within the main sequence show low migration amplitudes and dispersed movement directions, indicating oscillation within the main sequence. Most progenitors were already on the main sequence a billion years earlier. Starburst galaxies assembled half their mass in the last 350 Myr and originated from the main sequence. Passive galaxies show uniformly declining SFHs and include massive galaxies already in the passive region at $z = 3.5-4$, with increasing density over time. Using reconstructed SFHs up to $z &lt; 4$, we propose a coherent picture of how galaxies migrate over cosmic time in the M$_\star$ - SFR plane, highlighting the connection between major phases in the star-formation history.</description>

      <title>Age-dating early quiescent galaxies: high star-formation efficiency, but consistent with direct, higher-redshift observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam observations of ZF-UDS-7329, a massive, quiescent galaxy at redshift $z=3.2$, which has been put forward to challenge cosmology and galaxy formation physics. Our study extends previous works by focusing on the impact of different star formation history (SFH) priors, stellar libraries, metallicity, and initial mass function assumptions. Our results show that ZF-UDS-7329, with a formed stellar mass of $M_{\star} \approx 10^{11.4}~M_{\odot}$ and a specific star formation rate of $\mathrm{sSFR} \approx 0.03$ Gyr$^{-1}$, formed efficiently in the first billion years of the Universe. In agreement with previous work, we find that the spectrum is consistent with mass-weighted stellar ages of $1.3-1.8$ Gyr, depending on the SFH prior used. A physically motivated rising SFH prior makes the formation history of ZF-UDS-7329 compatible with stellar mass and star-formation rate estimates of high-redshift ($z&gt;6$) galaxies. Using NIRCam imaging, we identify a colour gradient indicative of an old, quiescent bulge and a younger disc component, as expected from a complex formation history. The inferred SFH is consistent a high stellar fraction of $f_{\star}=M_{\star}/(f_b \cdot M_{\rm h}) \approx 100\%$ at $z=7-12$, implying an extremely high integrated star-formation efficiency. However, when considering cosmic variance and possible mergers as expected in over-dense environments - as traced by ZF-UDS-7329 - the stellar fractions could be reduced to $f_{\star} \approx 50\%$, which is more consistent with galaxy formation models and the stellar-to-halo mass relation at lower redshifts. We conclude that ZF-UDS-7329 forms extremely efficient in the early universe, but does not necessitate unseen galaxies at higher redshifts since the inferred SFR of ancestors are consistent with those seen in $z&gt;6$ galaxies.</description>

      <title>Dust sub-mm emission in Green Valley galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Green valley (GV) galaxies are objects defined on a color-magnitude, or color-mass, diagram which are associated with a transition from a star-forming to a quiescent state (quenching), or vice versa (rejuvenation). Aims. We study the sub-mm emission of galaxies in the GV and link it with their physical evolutionary properties. Methods. We exploit a semi-analytic model (SAM) for galaxy evolution which includes a detailed treatment of dust production and evolution in galactic contexts. We model the observational properties of simulated galaxies by post-processing the SAM catalogs with the spectral synthesis and radiative transfer code GRASIL. Results. Our model produces a clear bimodality (and thus a GV) in the color-mass diagram, although some tensions arise when compared to observations. After having introduced a new criterion for identifying the GV in any dataset, we find that most blue and GV galaxies in our model are emitters at $250\,{\mu \rm m}$ (with fluxes $\geq 25\,{\rm mJy}$), in keeping with GAMA results. In the color-$S_{250\, \mu \rm m}$ diagram, GV galaxies exhibit intermediate colors yet maintain significant sub-mm fluxes. This occurs because, while specific star formation rates drop sharply during quenching, the dust content remains relatively high during the GV transition, powering sub-mm emission. Rejuvenating galaxies in the GV, which were previously red, have experienced a star formation burst that shifts their color to green, but their $S_{250\, \mu \rm m}$ fluxes remain low due to still low dust mass. Conclusions. Our galaxy evolution model highlights the delay between star formation and dust evolution, showing that sub-mm emission is not always a safe indicator of star formation activity, with quenching (rejuvenating) GV galaxies featuring relatively large (low) sub-mm emission.</description>

      <title>A MUSE Source-Blind Survey for Emission from the Circumgalactic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent detection of optical emission lines from the circumgalactic medium (CGM) in combined, large samples of low-redshift, normal galaxy spectra hints at the potential to map the cool ($\sim$ 10$^4$ K) CGM in individual, representative galaxies. Using archival data from a forefront instrument (MUSE) on the VLT, we present a source-blind, wide-redshift-range ($z \sim 0-5)$ narrow-band imaging survey for CGM emission. Our detected, resolved emission line sources are cataloged and include a 30 kpc wide H$\alpha$ source likely tracing the CGM of a low-mass galaxy (stellar mass $\sim$ $10^{8.78\pm0.42}$ M$_\odot$) at $z=0.1723$, a 60 kpc wide Ly $\alpha$ structure associated with a galaxy at $z=3.9076$, and a 130 kpc ($\sim r_{\rm vir}$) wide [O II] feature revealing an interaction between a galaxy pair at $z=1.2480$. The H$\alpha$ velocity field for the low-mass galaxy suggests that the CGM is more chaotic or turbulent than the galaxy disk, while that for the interacting galaxies shows large-scale ($\sim 50$ kpc) coherent motions.</description>

      <title>A-SLOTH reveals the nature of the first stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first generation of stars (PopIII) are too dim to be observed directly and probably too short-lived to have survived for local observations. Hence, we rely on simulations and indirect observations to constrain the nature of the first stars. In this study, we calibrate the semi-analytical model A-SLOTH (Ancient Stars and Local Observables by Tracing Halos), designed for simulating star formation in the early Universe, using a likelihood function based on nine independent observables. These observables span Milky Way-specific and cosmologically representative variables, ensuring a comprehensive calibration process. This calibration methodology ensures that A-SLOTH provides a robust representation of the early Universe's star formation processes, aligning simulated values with observed benchmarks across a diverse set of parameters. The outcome of this calibration process is best-fit values and their uncertainties for 11 important parameters that describe star formation in the early Universe, such as the shape of the initial mass function (IMF) of PopIII stars or escape fractions of ionizing photons. Our best-fitting model has a PopIII IMF with a steeper slope, d$N$/d$M \propto M^{-1.77}$, than the log-flat models often proposed in the literature, and also relatively high minimum and maximum masses, $M_{\rm min} = 13.6$Msun and $M_{\rm max} = 197$Msun. However, we emphasize that the IMF-generating parameters are poorly constrained and, e.g., the IMF slope could vary from log-flat to Salpeter. We also provide data products, such as delay time distribution, bubble size distributions for ionizing and metal-enriched bubbles at high redshift, and correlation plots between all 11 input parameters. Our study contributes to understanding the formation of early stars through A-SLOTH and provides valuable insights into the intricate processes involved in the early Universe's star formation.</description>

      <title>Stellar halos tracing the assembly of Ultra-Faint Dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [Abridged]Ultra-faint dwarfs (UFDs) are expected to be the relics of the earliest galaxies forming in the Universe. Observations show the presence of a stellar halo around them, which can give precious insights into the evolution of UFDs. This work investigates how merger properties impact the formation of stellar halos around UFDs, focusing on Tucana II, the most promising UFD assembled through mergers. We develop N-body simulations of isolated mergers between two UFDs with $1M_\odot$ stellar resolution. We build a suite of simulations by varying: i) the merger mass ratio, $M_1/M_2$, the specific ii) kinetic energy, $k$, and iii) angular momentum, $l$, iv) the dark-to-stellar mass ratio, $M_{DM}/M_*$, of the progenitors and iv) their stellar size, $R_{1/2}$. We use a neural network to explore the parameter space, emulating the properties of the "post-merger" UFD by quantifying the half-mass radius ($R_*$) and the fraction of stars at radii $&gt;5R_*$ ($f_5$). Our principal component analysis clearly shows that $f_5$ ($R_*$) is primarily determined by $M_1/M_2$ ($R_{1/2}$), with $R_{1/2}$ ($M_1/M_2$) playing a secondary role. Both $f_5$ and $R_*$ show almost no dependence on $k$, $l$, and $M_{DM}/M_*$ in the explored range. Using our emulator, we find that to form the stellar halo observed in Tucana II, i.e. $f_5=10\pm5\%$ and $R_*=120\pm30$pc, we need $M_1/M_2=8_{-3}^{+4}$ and $R_{1/2}=97^{+25}_{-18}$pc. Such findings are corroborated by the consistency ($\chi^2=0.5-2$) between the stellar density profile observed and those of simulations having $M_1/M_2$ and $R_{1/2}$ close to the emulator's predictions. Ongoing and planned spectroscopic surveys will greatly increase the statistics of observed stars and thus stellar halos in UFDs. By interpreting such observations with our model, we will provide new insights into the assembly history of UFDs and thus on the early galaxy formation process.</description>

      <title>Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon and CO(2-1) Emission at 50-150 pc Scales in 66 Nearby Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array CO(2-1) mapping and JWST near- and mid-infrared imaging, we characterize the relationship between CO(2-1) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission at ~100 pc resolution in 66 nearby star-forming galaxies, expanding the sample size from previous ~100 pc resolution studies by more than an order of magnitude. Focusing on regions of galaxies where most of the gas is likely to be molecular, we find strong correlations between CO(2-1) and 3.3 micron, 7.7 micron, and 11.3 micron PAH emission, estimated from JWST's F335M, F770W, and F1130W filters. We derive power law relations between CO(2-1) and PAH emission, which have indices in the range 0.8-1.2, implying relatively weak variations in the observed CO-to-PAH ratios across the regions that we study. We find that CO-to-PAH ratios and scaling relationships near HII regions are similar to those in diffuse sight lines. The main difference between the two types of regions is that sight lines near HII regions show higher intensities in all tracers. Galaxy centers, on the other hand, show higher overall intensities and enhanced CO-to-PAH ratios compared to galaxy disks. Individual galaxies show 0.19 dex scatter in the normalization of CO at fixed I_PAH and this normalization anti-correlates with specific star formation rate (SFR/M*) and correlates with stellar mass. We provide a prescription that accounts for these galaxy-to-galaxy variations and represents our best current empirical predictor to estimate CO(2-1) intensity from PAH emission, which allows one to take advantage of JWST's excellent sensitivity and resolution to trace cold gas.</description>

      <title>Whole-disk sampling of molecular clouds in M83</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalog of clouds identified from the $^{12}$CO (1--0) data of M83, which was observed using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) with a spatial resolution of $\sim$46 pc and a mass sensitivity of $\sim$10$^4$ $M_{\odot}$ (3 $\sigma$). The almost full-disk coverage and high sensitivity of the data allowed us to sample 5724 molecular clouds with a median mass of $\sim1.9$ $\times$ $10^5$ $M_{\odot}$, which is comparable to the most frequently sampled mass of Giant Molecular Clouds by surveys in the Milky Way. About 60 percent of the total CO luminosity in M83's disk arises from clouds more massive than 10$^6$ $M_{\odot}$. Such massive clouds comprise 16 percent of the total clouds in number and tend to concentrate toward the arm, bar, and center, while smaller clouds are more prevalent in inter-arm regions. Most $&gt;10^6$ $M_{\odot}$ clouds have peak brightness temperatures $T_{\mathrm{peak}}$ above 2 K with the current resolution. Comparing the observed cloud properties with the scaling relations determined by Solomon et al. 1987 (S87), $T_{\mathrm{peak}}$$&gt;2$ K clouds follow the relations, but $T_{\mathrm{peak}}$$&lt;2$ K clouds, which are dominant in number, deviate significantly. Without considering the effect of beam dilution, the deviations would suggest modestly high virial parameters and low surface mass densities for the entire cloud samples, which are similar to values found for the Milky Way clouds by Rice et al. (2016) and Miville-Desch{\^e}nes et al. (2017). However, once beam dilution is taken into account, the observed $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ and $\Sigma$ for a majority of the clouds (mostly $T_{\mathrm{peak}}$ $&lt;2$ K) can be potentially explained with intrinsic $\Sigma$ of $\sim$100 $M_{\mathrm{\odot}}\ \mathrm{pc}^{-2}$ and $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ of $\sim$1, which are similar to the clouds of S87.</description>

      <title>Relatively young thick discs in low-mass star-forming late-type galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to trace the evolution of eight edge-on star-forming disc galaxies through the analysis of stellar population properties of their thin and thick discs. These galaxies have relatively low stellar masses (4 $\times$ 10$^9$ to 6 $\times$ 10$^{10}$ $M_{\odot}$). We use Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) observations and full-spectrum fitting to produce spatially resolved maps of ages, metallicities and [Mg/Fe]-abundances and extract the star formation histories of stellar discs. Our maps show thick discs that are on average older, more metal-poor and more [Mg/Fe]-enhanced than thin discs. However, age differences between thin and thick discs are small (around 2 Gyr) and the thick discs are younger than previously observed in more massive and more quiescent galaxies. Both thin and thick discs show mostly sub-solar metallicities, and the vertical metallicity gradient is milder than previously observed in similar studies. [Mg/Fe] differences between thick and thin discs are not sharp. The star formation histories of thick discs extend down to recent times, although most of the mass in young stars was formed in thin discs. Our findings show thick discs that are different from old quiescent thick discs previously observed in galaxies of different morphologies and/or different masses. We propose that thick discs in these galaxies did not form quickly at high redshift, but slowly in an extended time. Also, the thin discs formed slowly, however, a larger mass fraction was created at very recent times.</description>

      <title>A new approach to constraining properties of AGN host galaxies by combining image and SED decomposition: testing upon the $M_{\rm BH}-M_\star$ relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The outshining light from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) poses significant challenges in studying the properties of AGN host galaxies. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach which combines image decomposition and spectral energy distribution (SED) decomposition to constrain properties of AGN host galaxies. Image decomposition allows us to disentangle optical flux into AGN and stellar components, thereby providing additional constraints on the SED models to derive more refined stellar mass. To test the viability of this approach, we obtained a sample of 24 X-ray selected type-I AGNs with redshifts ranging from 0.73 to 2.47. We estimated the stellar masses for our sample and found that our results are generally consistent with earlier estimates based on different methods. Through examining the posterior distribution of stellar masses, we find that our method could derive better constrained results compared to previous SED decomposition methods. With the derived stellar masses, we further studied the $M_{\rm BH}-M_\star$ relation of our sample, finding a higher intrinsic scatter in the correlation for our entire sample compared to the local quiescent correlation, which could be caused by a few black hole monsters in our sample. We propose that based on our method, future works could extend to larger samples of high-redshift AGN host galaxies, thereby enhancing our understanding of their properties.</description>

      <title>Self-Similar Buildup and Inside-Out Growth: Tracing the Evolution of Intermediate to High-Mass Star-Forming Galaxies Since $z=2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to discern scenarios of structural evolution of intermediate to high-mass star-forming galaxies (SFGs) since cosmic noon by comparing their stellar mass profiles with present-day stellar masses of $\log(M_{\ast,0}/M_{\odot})=10.3-11$. We addressed discrepancies in the size evolution rates of SFGs, which may be caused by variations in sample selection and methods for size measurements. To check these factors, we traced the evolution of individual galaxies by identifying their progenitors using stellar mass growth histories (SMGHs), integrating along the star-forming main sequence and from the IllustrisTNG simulations. Comparison between the structural parameters estimated from the mass- and light-based profiles shows that mass-weighted size evolves at a slower pace compared to light-based ones, highlighting the need to consider the mass-to-light ratio ($M/L$) gradients. Additionally, we observed mass-dependent growth in stellar mass profiles: massive galaxies ($\log(M_{\ast,0}/M_{\odot})\gtrsim10.8$) formed central regions at $z\gtrsim1.5$ and grew faster in outer regions, suggesting inside-out growth, while intermediate and less massive SFGs followed a relatively self-similar mass buildup since $z\sim2$. Moreover, slopes of observed size evolution conflict with the predictions of TNG50 for samples selected using the same SMGHs across our redshift range. To explore the origin of this deviation, we examined changes in angular momentum (AM) retention fraction using the half-mass size evolution and employing a simple disk formation model. Assuming similar dark matter halo parameters, our calculations indicate that the AM inferred from observations halved in the last 10 Gyr while it remained relatively constant in TNG50. This higher AM in simulations may be due to the accretion of high-AM gases into disks.</description>

      <title>Supermassive primordial black holes for the GHZ9 and UHZ1 observed by the JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high redshift ($z&gt;10$) galaxies GHZ9 and UHZ1 observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are very massive and have exceptionally high black hole-to-star mass ratios with the central black hole masses $M\gtrsim 10^7\rm~M_\odot$. In this paper, we explore the possibility that they are seeded by the supermassive primordial black holes (SMPBHs), which came into being in the very early universe, with initial masses $\sim 10^7\rm~M_\odot$. We present the self-similar accretion solutions for SMPBHs, and find that the mass growth of SMPBHs during pregalactic era may be negligible. These SMPBHs, when the redshift $z\lesssim 20$, can accelerate seeding high-redshift galaxies and their baryonic content, and consequently explain the central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of high-redshift massive galaxies through sub-Eddington accretion. According to our results, SMPBHs actually could lead to the existence of more massive SMBHs at higher redshifts compared to other SMBH seed scenarios, specially SMBHs with masses $M\gtrsim 10^7~\rm M_\odot$ at $z&gt;20$ might only origin from SMPBHs, thus the corresponding observation can serve as a potential probe to PBHs.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way bar potential constrained by the kinematics of SiO maser stars in BAaDE Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method that utilizes the longitude-velocity (l-v) envelope to constrain the Milky Way (MW) bar potential. Previous work (Habing 2016) used the l-v diagram to explain the distribution of the observed high-velocity stars. We successfully reproduce their results, but find that their method is limited to only one single type of periodic orbits. In contrast, we propose that the l-v envelope provides much more comprehensive constraints. We compare the properties of test particles in the Portai et al. (2017) MW potential model (P17) with the observed SiO maser stars from the Bulge Asymmetries and Dynamical Evolution (BAaDE) survey. We find that the l-v envelope generated by the bar potential demonstrates reasonable agreement with the observational data, albeit with slight discrepancies near the Galactic center. The inconsistencies suggest that the P17 potential yields a lower central rotation curve, a slightly larger quadrupole strength, or a possibly underestimated pattern speed. We also adopt an updated version of the P17 potential with a modified central mass component (CMC) proposed by Hunter et al. (2024) (H24). The fitting of the l-v envelope suggests that the H24 potential does not completely address the existing challenges and may hint at a possible underestimation of the central bar mass. Our study demonstrates that the l-v envelope can be used as a valuable tool for constraining the Galactic potential and provides insights into the Milky Way bar potential.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Origin of the Vertical Metallicity Gradient of the Milky Way Bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A vertical metallicity gradient in the Milky Way bulge is well-established. Yet, its origin has not been fully understood under the Galactic secular evolution scenario. We construct single-disk and triple-disk $N$-body models with an initial radial metallicity gradient for each disk. These models generate a vertical metallicity gradient through a ``two-step heating" mechanism: first the outer, metal-poor particles move inward via the bar instability and subsequently undergo more significant vertical heating during the buckling instability, so they end up at greater vertical height. The ``two-step heating" mechanism nearly linearly transforms the radial metallicity gradients in precursor disks into vertical metallicity gradients. Comparing the models with a triple-disk model tagged with radially independent Gaussian metallicity, we find that, despite certain limitations, the ``two-step heating" mechanism is still important in shaping the Galactic vertical metallicity gradient. If the bar and buckling instabilities contributed to the formation of boxy/peanut-shaped bulges, then the ``two-step heating" mechanism is inevitable in the secular evolution of a boxy/peanut-shaped bulge.</description>

      <title>On the dwarf galaxies rotation curves diversity problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show how baryonic physics can solve the problem of the striking diversity in dwarf galaxies rotation curves shapes. To this aim, we compare the distribution of galaxies of the SPARC sample, in the plane $V_{\rm 2 kpc}$-$V_{\rm Rlast }$ (being $V_{\rm 2kpc}$ the galaxy rotation velocity at $2$ kpc, and $V_{\rm Rlast}$ that outermost one) with that of galaxies that we simulated taking account of baryonic effects. The scatter in the rotation curves in the $V_{\rm 2 kpc}$-$V_{\rm Rlast }$ plane, and the trend of the SPARC sample's, and our simulated galaxies', distribution is in good agreement. The solution of the "diversity" problem lies in the ability of baryonic process to produce non self-similar haloes, contrary to DM-only simulations. We show also that baryonic effects can reproduce the rotation curves of galaxies like IC2574 characterized by a slow rising with radius. A solution to the diversity problem can be obtained taking appropriately into account the baryon physics effects.</description>

      <title>Has the Palomar 14 globular cluster been captured by the Milky Way?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine a new scenario to model the outer halo globular cluster (GC) Pal 14 over its lifetime by performing a comprehensive set of direct N-body calculations. We assume Pal 14 was born in a now detached/disrupted dwarf galaxy with a strong tidal field. Pal 14 evolved there until the slope of the stellar mass function (MF) became close to the measured value which is observed to be significantly shallower than in most GCs. After about 2-3 Gyr, Pal 14 was then captured by the Milky Way (MW). Although the physical size of such a cluster is indistinguishable from a cluster that has lived its entire life in the MW, other parameters like its mass and the MF-slope, strongly depend on the time the cluster is taken from the dwarf galaxy. After being captured by the MW on a new orbit, the cluster expands and eventually reaches the appropriate mass and size of Pal 14 after 11.5 Gyr while reproducing the observed MF. These simulations thus suggest that Pal 14 may have formed in a dwarf galaxy with a post-gas-expulsion initial half-mass radius and mass of $r_h=7$ pc and $8&lt;M/10^4&lt;10 $ M$_{\odot}$, respectively, with a high degree of primordial mass segregation.</description>

      <title>Parameters of Star Formation Regions in Galaxies NGC 3963 and NGC 7292</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Results of a study of physical parameters of stellar population in star formation regions in galaxies with signs of peculiarity NGC 3963 and NGC 7292 are presented. The study was carried out based on the analysis of photometric (UBVRI bands), H-alpha and spectroscopic data obtained by the authors, using evolutionary models of stellar population. Among 157 star formation regions identified in galaxies, the young stellar population mass estimates were obtained for 16 of them and the age estimates were obtained for 15. The age of star formation regions clearly correlates with the presence of emission in the H-alpha line: HII regions in the galaxies are younger than 6-8 Myr, and the regions without gas emission are older. The studied objects are included in the version 3 of our catalogue of photometric, physical and chemical parameters of star formation regions, which includes 1667 objects in 21 galaxies. Key aspects of the technique used to estimate the physical parameters and different relations between observational and physical parameters of the young stellar population in star formation regions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Halo Mergers Enhance the Growth of Massive Black Hole Seeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High redshift observations of 10$^9$ M$_\odot$ supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at $z \sim7$ and `Little Red Dots' that may host overmassive black holes at $z&gt;4$ suggests the existence of so-called heavy seeds (&gt;1000 M$_\odot$) in the early Universe. Recent work has suggested that the rapid assembly of halos may be the key to forming heavy seeds early enough in the Universe to match such observations without the need for extreme radiation fields or dark matter streaming velocities. We perform simulations of BH seed formation in 4 distinct idealised halo collapse scenarios; an isolated 10$^6$ M$_\odot$ minihalo, an isolated 10$^7$ M$_\odot$ atomic halo, the direct collision of two 10$^7$ M$_\odot$ halos and a fly-by collision of two 10$^7$ M$_\odot$ halos. We have shown that halo collisions create a central environment of enhanced density, inside which BH seeds can accrete at enhanced rates. For direct collisions, the gas density peaks are disrupted by the interaction, as the collisionless DM peaks pass through each other while the colliding gas is left in the center, removing the sink particle from its accretion source. When the central density peaks instead experience a fly-by interaction, the sink particle remains embedded in the dense gas and maintains enhanced accretion rates throughout the simulated period when compared to the isolated halo cases. Here the final mass of the sink particle achieved a factor of 2 greater in mass than in the isolated atomic halo case, and a factor of 3 greater than the minihalo case, reaching 10$^4$ M$_\odot$ via its 0.03 pc accretion radius. As the maximum halo mass before collapse is determined by the atomic cooling limit of a few times 10$^7$ M$_{\odot}$, the ability of halo-halo mergers to further boost accretion rates onto the central object may play a crucial role in growing SMBH seeds.</description>

      <title>DUNE: Dust depletion UNified method across cosmic time and Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method to characterize dust depletion, namely, the depletion of metals into dust grains. We used observed correlations among relative abundances combining a total of 17 metals in diverse galactic environments, including the Milky Way (MW), Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), and damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs) towards quasars and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We only considered the relative abundances of metals that qualify as tracers of dust and we used all available dust tracers. We find linear correlations among all studied dust tracers in a multidimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to an individual dust tracer. The fit to the linear correlations among the dust tracers describes the tendencies of different elements when depleting into dust grains. We determined the overall strength of dust depletion, $\Delta$, along individual lines of sight, based on the correlations among different dust tracers. We avoided any preference for specific dust tracers or any other assumptions by including all available dust tracers in this multidimensional space. We also determined the dust depletion of Kr, C, O, Cl, P, Zn, Ge, Mg, Cu, Si, Fe, Ni, and Ti. Finally, we offer simple guidelines for the application of the method to the study of the observed patterns of abundances and relative abundances. This has allowed for a straightforward determination of the overall strength of depletion and the dust depletion of individual elements. We also obtained an estimate for the gas-phase metallicity and identified any additional deviations due to the nucleosynthesis of specific stellar populations. Thus, we have established a unified methodology for characterizing dust depletion across cosmic time and diverse galactic environments, offering a valuable new approach to the study of dust depletion in studies of the chemical evolution of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Fields Under Feedback: A Case Study of the Massive Star-Forming Hub G34.26+0.15</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 850$\mu$m polarized observations of the molecular cloud G34.26+0.15 taken using the POL-2 polarimeter mounted on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). G34.26+0.15 is a hub-filament system with ongoing high-mass star-formation, containing multiple HII regions. We extend the Histogram of Relative Orientations technique with an alternative application that considers the alignment of the magnetic field to the filaments and a HII region boundary, denoted as the filament alignment factor ($\xi_{F}$) and the ellipse alignment factor ($\xi_{E}$) respectively. Using these metrics, we find that, although in general the magnetic field aligns parallel to the filamentary structure within the system in the north-west, the magnetic field structure of G34.26+0.15 has been radically reshaped by the expansion of an evolved HII region in the south-east, which itself may have triggered further high-mass star formation in the cloud. Thus, we suggest high-mass star formation is both occurring through mass accretion as per the hub-filament model from one side, and through compression of gas under stellar feedback from the other. We also use HARP observations of C$^{18}$O from the CHIMPS survey to estimate the magnetic field strength across the cloud, finding strengths of $\sim$0.5-1.4 mG.</description>

Abstract: We present new ALMA continuum and spectral observations of the MUSE Ultra Deep Field (MUDF), a $2\times 2$ arcmin$^2$ region with ultradeep multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopy hosting two bright $z\approx 3.22$ quasars used to study intervening gas structures in absorption. Through a blind search for dusty galaxies, we identified a total of seven high-confidence sources, six of which with secure spectroscopic redshifts. We estimate galaxy dust and stellar masses ($M_{\rm dust}\simeq 10^{7.8-8.6}\,M_{\odot}$, $M_{\star}\simeq 10^{10.2-10.7}\,M_{\odot}$), as well as star formation rates (${\rm SFR}\simeq 10^{1.2-2.0}\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}} $) which show that most of these galaxies are massive and dust-obscured similar to coeval (sub-)millimeter galaxies. All six spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies are within $500~\rm km~s^{-1}$ of metal absorption lines observed in the quasar sightlines, corresponding to $100\%$ association rate. We also find that four of these galaxies belong to groups in which they are among the most massive members. Within the multiple group galaxies associated to the same absorption system, the ALMA sources are not always the closest in projection, but they are often aligned with the gaseous structures in velocity space. This suggests that these massive galaxies occupy the center of the potential well of the gas structures traced in absorption. However, albeit the low number density of sources identified with ALMA, our study may indicate that absorbers seem to infrequently originate in the inner circumgalactic medium of these galaxies. Instead, they appear to be better tracers of the gas distributed in the large-scale structure that host them.</description>

      <title>SDSS IV MaNGA: The impact of the acquisition of gas with opposite angular momentum on the evolution of galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A gaseous counter-rotating galaxy is a galaxy containing a gas component with opposite angular momentum to the main stellar disk. The counter-rotating gas provides direct evidence for the accretion of external material, a key aspect in hierarchical galaxy evolution. We identified 303 gaseous counterrotators out of 9992 galaxies in MaNGA. The majority of the counterrotators are early-types. This implies their formation is highly correlated with early-type galaxies although it is still difficult to know if one leads to the other. To disentangle which of the galaxy characteristics within a morphological class were changed by the accretion of counter-rotating gas, we carefully selected a comparison sample with similar fundamental galactic properties, but co-rotation in gas. This comparison shows that gaseous counter-rotation correlates with weak rotation in the stellar component, high central concentration of star forming regions, if present, and a higher fraction of central low ionization emission regions (cLIER) galaxies. The light distributions of the stellar components, dust and HI content (both low), and overall suppressed star formation rates are similar for both samples and seem typical for the morphological class. We claim that elliptical and about half of the lenticular counterrotators, those with weak rotation in the stellar component in the outskirts and central regions, likely have a major merger origin for the gas acquisition, and the other half of lenticulars, with stronger stellar rotation, may have a minor merger or pure gas accretion origin.</description>

      <title>UNCOVER: 404 Error -- Models Not Found for the Triply Imaged Little Red Dot A2744-QSO1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has revealed an abundance of compact, red objects at $z\approx5-8$ dubbed "little red dots" (LRDs), whose SEDs display a faint blue UV continuum followed by a steep rise in the optical. Despite extensive study of their characteristic V-shaped SEDs, the nature of LRDs remains unknown. We present a new analysis of the NIRSpec/PRISM spectrum of A2744-QSO1, a triply imaged LRD at $z=7.04$ from the UNCOVER survey. The spectrum shows a strong Balmer break and broad Balmer emission lines, both of which are difficult to explain with models invoking exclusively AGN or stellar contributions. Our fiducial model decomposes the spectrum into a post-starburst galaxy dominating the UV-optical continuum and a reddened AGN being sub-dominant at all wavelength and contributing at $\sim20\%$ level. However, our most credible model infers a stellar mass of $M_\star\approx 4\times10^9\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ within a radius of $r_\mathrm{e}&lt;30\,$pc, driving its central density to the highest among observations to date. This high central density could be explained if A2744-QSO-1 is the early-forming core of a modern-day massive elliptical galaxy that later puffed up via the inside-out growth channel. The models also necessitate an unusually steep dust law to preserve the strong break strength, though this steepness may be explained by a deficit of large dust grains. It is also probable that these challenges reflect our ignorance of A2744-QSO1's true nature. Future variability and reverberation mapping studies could help disentangle the galaxy and AGN contribution to the continuum, and deeper redder observations could also unveil the dust properties in LRDs.</description>

      <title>The Metallicity Mapping of the Ionized Diffuse Gas at the Milky Way Disk-halo Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metals in the diffuse, ionized gas at the boundary between the Milky Way's interstellar medium (ISM) and circumgalactic medium (CGM), known as the disk-halo interface (DHI), are valuable tracers of the feedback processes that drive the Galactic fountain. However, metallicity measurements in this region are challenging due to obscuration by the Milky Way ISM and uncertain ionization corrections that affect the total hydrogen column density. In this work, we constrain the ionization corrections to neutral hydrogen column densities using precisely measured electron column densities from the dispersion measure of pulsars that lie in the same globular clusters as UV-bright targets with high-resolution absorption spectroscopy. We address the blending of absorption lines with the ISM by jointly fitting Voigt profiles to all absorption components. We present our metallicity estimates for the DHI of the Milky Way based on detailed photoionization modeling to the absorption from ionized metal lines and ionization-corrected total hydrogen columns. Generally, the gas clouds show a large scatter in metallicity, ranging between $0.04-3.2\ Z_{\odot}$, implying that the DHI consists of a mixture of gaseous structures having multiple origins. We estimate the inflow and outflow timescales of the DHI ionized clouds to be $6 - 35$ Myr. We report the detection of an infalling cloud with super-solar metallicity that suggests a Galactic fountain mechanism, whereas at least one low-metallicity outflowing cloud ($Z &lt; 0.1\ Z_{\odot}$) poses a challenge for Galactic fountain and feedback models.</description>

      <title>Determining star formation rates in AGN hosts from strong optical emission lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) on star formation within their host galaxies remains a topic of intense debate. One of the primary challenges in quantifying the star formation rate (SFR) within AGN hosts arises from the prevalent assumption in most methodologies, which attribute gas excitation to young stars alone. However, this assumption does not consider the contribution of the AGN to the ionization of the gas in their environment. To address this issue, we evaluate the use of strong optical emission lines to obtain the SFR surface density ($\Sigma{{\rm SFR_{AGN}}}$) in regions predominantly ionized by an AGN, using a sample of 293 AGN hosts from the MaNGA survey, with SFR measurements available through stellar population fitting. We propose calibrations involving the H$\alpha$ and [O\,{\sc iii}]$\lambda$5007 emission lines, which can be used to determine $\Sigma{{\rm SFR_{AGN}}}$, resulting in values consistent with those estimated through stellar population fitting.</description>

      <title>Galaxy evolution in the post-merger regime I -- Most merger-induced in-situ stellar mass growth happens post-coalescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers can enhance star formation rates throughout the merger sequence, with this effect peaking around the time of coalescence. However, owing to a lack of information about their time of coalescence, post-mergers could only previously be studied as a single, time-averaged population. We use timescale predictions of post-coalescence galaxies in the UNIONS survey, based on the Multi-Model Merger Identifier deep learning framework (\textsc{Mummi}) that predicts the time elapsed since the last merging event. For the first time, we capture a complete timeline of star formation enhancements due to galaxy mergers by combining these post-merger predictions with data from pre-coalescence galaxy pairs in SDSS. Using a sample of $564$ galaxies with $M_* \geq 10^{10} M_\odot$ at $0.005 &lt; z &lt; 0.3$ we demonstrate that: 1) galaxy mergers enhance star formation by, on average, up to a factor of two; 2) this enhancement peaks within 500 Myr of coalescence; 3) enhancements continue for up to 1~Gyr after coalescence; and 4) merger-induced star formation significantly contributes to galaxy mass assembly, with galaxies increasing their final stellar masses by, $10\%$ to $20\%$ per merging event, producing on average $\log(M_*/M_\odot) = {9.56_{-0.19}^{+0.13}}$ more mass than non-interacting star-forming galaxies solely due to the excess star formation.</description>

      <title>Galaxy evolution in the post-merger regime. II -- Post-merger quenching peaks within 500 Myr of coalescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abridged) Mechanisms for quenching star formation in galaxies remain hotly debated, with galaxy mergers an oft-proposed pathway. In Ellison et al. (2022) we tested this scenario by quantifying the fraction of recently and rapidly quenched post-starbursts (PSBs) in a sample of post-merger galaxies identified in the Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS). With our recent development of the Multi-Model Merger Identifier (MUMMI) neural network ensemble (Ferreira et al. 2024a,b), we are now additionally able to predict the time since coalescence (T_PM) for the UNIONS post-merger galaxies up to T_PM = 1.8 Gyr, allowing us to further dissect the merger sequence and measure more precisely when quenching occurs. Based on a sample of 5927 z&lt;0.3 post-mergers identified in UNIONS, we find that the post-coalescence population evolves from one dominated by star-forming (and starbursting) galaxies at 0 &lt; T_PM &lt; 0.16 Gyr, through to a population that is dominated by quenched galaxies by T_PM ~ 1.5 Gyr. We find a PSB excess throughout the post-merger regime, but with a clear peak at 0.16 &lt; T_PM &lt; 0.48 Gyr. In this post-merger time range PSBs are more common than in control galaxies by factors of 30-100, an excess that drops sharply at longer times since merger. We also quantify the fraction of PSBs that are mergers and find that the majority (75%) of classically selected E+A are identified as mergers, with a lower merger fraction (60%) amongst PCA selected PSBs.Our results demonstrate that 1) galaxy-galaxy interactions can lead to rapid post-merger quenching within 0.5 Gyr of coalescence, 2) the majority of (but not all) PSBs at low z are linked to mergers and 3) quenching pathways are diverse, with different PSB selection techniques likely identifying galaxies quenched by different physical processes with an additional dependence on stellar mass.</description>

      <title>On the membership of variable stars in galactic globular clusters: The Oosterhoff gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have performed a critical evaluation of the membership status of all variable stars in globular clusters recorded in the Catalogue of Variable Stars in Globular Clusters (CVSGC) curated by Christine Clement. To this end, we employed the systematic and bulky membership analysis performed by E. Vasiliev and H. Baumgardt based on the proper motions and parallaxes given in Gaia-EDR3. We found numerous variables in the CVSGC which are in fact field stars, which is particularly the case for globular clusters located in the Galactic bulge. Using the newly acquired list of reliable cluster members we examine the Oosterhoff dichotomy present among the Milky Way (MW) globular clusters using their RR Lyrae stars content. We confirm the presence of the Oosterhoff gap, separating both Oosterhoff groups. The Oosterhoff gap is mostly populated by globular clusters associated with MW dwarf galaxies and globular clusters with a low number of fundamental mode RR Lyrae variables. Several of the clusters in the Oosterhoff gap were previously linked to past merger events (e.g. Kraken/Heracles).</description>

      <title>Exploration of Halo Substructures in IoM Space with \textit{Gaia} DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using kinematic data from the Gaia Data Release 3 catalog, along with metallicity estimates robustly derived from Gaia XP spectra, we have explored the Galactic stellar halo in search of both known and potentially new substructures. By applying the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm in IoM space (i.e. $E,L_{z}$ and $L_{\perp}$$ = \sqrt{L_{x}^2+L_{y}^2}$), we identified 5 previously known substructures: Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), Helmi Streams, I'itoi + Sequoia and Hot Thick Disc. We additionally found NGC 3201 and NGC 5139 in this work, and NGC 3201 shares similar distributions in phase space and metallicties to Arjuna, which possibly implies that they have the same origin. Three newly discovered substructures are Prograde Substructure 1 (PG1), Prograde Substructure 2 (PG2) and the Low Energy Group. PG1, with a higher $V_{\phi}$ than typical GSE member stars, is considered as either a low eccentricity and metal-rich part of GSE or part of the metal-poor disc. PG2, sharing kinematic similarities with Aleph, is thought to be its relatively highly eccentric component or the mixture of Aleph and disc. The Low Energy Group, whose metal-poor component of metallicity distribution function has a mean value [M/H] $\sim$ $-$1.29 (compared to that of Heracles [M/H] $\sim$ $-$1.26), may have associations with Heracles.</description>

      <title>A comparative high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of in situ and accreted globular clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) are extremely intriguing systems that help in reconstructing the assembly of the Milky Way via the characterization of their chemo-chrono-dynamical properties. In this study, we use high-resolution spectroscopic archival data from UVES at VLT and UVES-FLAMES at VLT to compare the chemistry of GCs dynamically tagged as either Galactic (NGC 6218, NGC 6522 and NGC 6626) or accreted from distinct merging events (NGC 362 and NGC 1261 from Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, Ruprecht 106 from the Helmi Streams) in the metallicity regime where abundance patterns of field stars with different origin effectively separate ($-1.3 \le$ [Fe/H] $\le -1.0$ dex). We find remarkable similarities in the abundances of the two Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus GCs across all chemical elements. They both display depletion in the $\alpha$-elements (Mg, Si and Ca) and statistically significant differences in Zn and Eu compared to in situ GCs. Additionally, we confirm that Ruprecht 106 exhibits a completely different chemical makeup compared to the other target clusters, being underabundant in all chemical elements. This demonstrates that when high precision is achieved, the abundances of certain chemical elements not only can efficiently separate in situ from accreted GCs, but can also distinguish among GCs born in different progenitor galaxies. In the end, we investigate the possible origin of the chemical peculiarity of Ruprecht 106. Given that its abundances do not match the chemical patterns of field stars associated to its most likely parent galaxy (i.e., the Helmi Streams), especially being depleted in the $\alpha$-elements, we interpret Ruprecht 106 as originating in a less massive galaxy compared to the progenitor of the Helmi Streams.</description>

      <title>Implications for galaxy property estimation revealed by CO luminosity-FWHM relations in local star-forming galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores a relationship between the CO luminosity-full width at half-maximum linewidth linear relation (i.e. the CO LFR) and mean galaxy property of the local star-forming galaxy sample in the xCOLDGASS data base, via a mathematical statement. The whole data base galaxies were separated into two subsamples based on their stellar masses and redshifts, being a help to examine the dependence issue of the CO LFR. Selecting the galaxy data with a stringent requirement was also implemented in order to assure the validly of the CO LFR. An algorithm of the linear regression was conducted with the data of the subsample. An assessment about the linear correlation manifested a valid CO LFR occurs in the selected galaxy of the subsample, and the intercept of the CO LFR may be related with the mean galaxy properties such as the molecular gas fraction and galaxy size. For the finding on the intercept of the CO LFR, we aligned that intercept with those galaxy properties via the involvement of a $\psi$ parameter. On evaluating the $\psi$ value with our local star-forming galaxy sample, we numerically determined a relationship between the statistical result and the galaxy property in a different stellar mass range. It also shows a possible method on estimating galaxy property.</description>

      <title>Photometric Analysis for Predicting Star Formation Rates in Large Galaxies Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star formation rates (SFRs) are a crucial observational tracer of galaxy formation and evolution. Spectroscopy, which is expensive, is traditionally used to estimate SFRs. This study tests the possibility of inferring SFRs of large samples of galaxies from only photometric data, using state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The dataset adopted in this work is the one collected by Delli Veneri et al. (2019): it includes photometric data of more than 27 million galaxies coming from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS-DR7). The algorithms we implemented and tested for comparing the performances include Linear Regression, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and classical deep learning models.
  Our results mention that the Linear Regression model predicted an impressive accuracy of 98.97 percent as measured by the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), demonstrating that machine-learning approaches can be effective when it comes to photometric SFR estimation. Besides, the paper also reported the results for other intelligent algorithms, which predicted the SFRs, providing a detailed comparison of the performance of different machine learning algorithms in the photometric SFR estimation. This study not only shows the estimated SFR from photometric data is promising but also opens a door toward the application of machine learning and deep learning in astrophysics.</description>

Abstract: Cosmological simulations indicate that nearly half of the baryons in the nearby Universe are in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) phase, with about half of which residing in cosmic filaments. Recent observational studies using stacked survey data and deep exposures of galaxy cluster outskirts have detected soft X-ray excess associated with optically identified filaments. However, the physical characteristics of WHIM in filaments remain largely undetermined due to the lack of direct spectral diagnostics. In this work, we aim to select appropriate targets for WHIM characterization through pointing observations with the future Hot Universe Baryon Surveyor (HUBS) mission, which is designed with eV level energy resolution in the 0.1-2.0 keV band and a 1 square degree field-of-view. We built a sample of 1577 inter-cluster filaments based on the first eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) supercluster catalog and estimated their soft X-ray emission, and used their modeled geometrical properties and oxygen line intensities to select four most appropriate candidate targets for HUBS observations. By simulating and analyzing their mock observations, we demonstrated that with 200 ks HUBS exposure for each candidate, the gas properties of individual filaments can be accurately determined, with the temperature constrained to +-0.01 keV, metallicity constrained to &lt; +-0.03 solar, and density constrained to &lt; +-10%. Elemental abundance of O, Ne, Mg, and Fe can be measured separately, providing unprecedented insights into the chemical history of the filament gas. We also showed that direct mapping of the WHIM distribution is promising with narrow-band imaging of the O viii line. Our work forecasts that next-generation X-ray missions such as HUBS will provide substantial improvement in our understanding of the physical status and evolution history of the diffuse WHIM gas in cosmic large-scale structure.</description>

Abstract: The central theme of this thesis work is to explore the possibilities of spiral arm formations from instabilities formed inside the central region of disc galaxies. These instabilities originate from the central baryonic feedback and have many prospects regarding the evolution of disc galaxies. They can trigger the gravitational collapse inside the dense molecular clouds that lead to the formation of stars under suitable astrophysical circumstances. In the present work, the role of parameters like the molecular cloud's magnetic field, rotation, etc., has been investigated behind this explosion-triggered star formation process with the help of Jeans instability analysis. From this study, our essential observation is that the formation of star clusters is favoured by a strong magnetic field ($\sim 10 \; \mu$G), and the effect is enhanced at a more considerable distance from the centre. Again, this instability also contributes to the formation of stellar bars. This dense rotating component may drive out the chaotic stellar orbits from the disc through its two ends like a propeller. This process has been modelled in the thesis work from the viewpoint of chaotic scattering in open Hamiltonian systems. This analysis concludes that this bar-driven chaotic motion (or simply escaping motion) may lead to the forming of spiral arms or inner disc rings, depending on the bar strength. Our study also found that, compared to NFW dark haloes, the oblate dark haloes offer a more cohesive evolutionary framework for generating bar-driven escape structures in giant spiral and dwarf galaxies. Moreover, the formation of spiral arms via bar-driven escaping motion is only encouraged in galaxies with NFW dark haloes if they have highly energetic centres, like active galaxies.</description>

      <title>Microlensing analysis of 14.5-year light curves in SDSS J1004+4112: Quasar accretion disk size and intracluster stellar mass fraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The gravitational lens system SDSS J1004+4112 was the first known example of a quasar lensed by a galaxy cluster. The interest in this system has been renewed following the publication of r-band light curves spanning 14.5 years and the determination of the time delays between the four brightest quasar images.
  Aims. We constrained the quasar accretion disk size and the fraction of the lens mass in stars using the signature of microlensing in the quasar image light curves.
  Methods. We built the six possible histograms of microlensing magnitude differences between the four quasar images and compared them with simulated model histograms, using a $\chi^2$ test to infer the model parameters.
  Results. We infer a quasar disk half-light radius of $R_{1/2}=(0.70\pm0.04)\, R_E=(6.4\pm0.4) \sqrt{M/0.3M_{\odot}}$ light-days at 2407\r{A} in the rest frame and stellar mass fractions at the quasar image positions of $\alpha_A&gt;0.059$, $\alpha_B=0.056^{+0.021}_{-0.027}$, $\alpha_C=0.030^{+0.031}_{-0.021}$, and $\alpha_D=0.072^{+0.034}_{-0.016}$.
  Conclusions. The inferred disk size is broadly compatible with most previous estimates, and the stellar mass fractions are within the expected ranges for galaxy clusters. In the region where image C lies, the stellar mass fraction is compatible with a stellar contribution from the brightest cluster galaxy, galaxy cluster members, and intracluster light, but the values at images B, D, and especially A are slightly larger, possibly suggesting the presence of extra stellar components.</description>

      <title>Blowing star formation away in AGN Hosts (BAH) -- II. Investigating the origin of the H2 emission excess in nearby galaxies with JWST MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) medium-resolution spectrometer (MRS) observations of UGC 8782, CGCG 012-070 and NGC 3884 to investigate the origin of the H$_2$ emission. These three nearby AGN hosts are known to present H$_2$ emission excess relative to star-forming galaxies, as traced by the H$_2$ S(3)/PAH$_{\rm 11.3\mu m}$ line ratio. For every spaxel, we also measure the velocity width ($W_{\rm 80}$) of H$_2$ S(3). We find that the distribution of H$_2$ in the space of these parameters - H$_2$/PAH and its velocity width - is bimodal: one cluster of points shows approximately constant values of $W_{\rm 80}$, while the other cluster exhibits a strong correlation between $W_{\rm 80}$ and H$_2$/PAH. We estimated the temperature of the H$_2$ gas assuming a power-law distribution and find flatter distributions in regions where a correlation between $W_{\rm 80}$ and H$_2$ S(3)/PAH$_{\rm 11.3\mu m}$ is observed. Additionally, we observed a correlation between the [Fe II]$_{\rm 5.34 \mu m}$ (a known shock tracer) and the H$_2$ emission. This indicates that the excess H$_2$ emission excess is associated to shock heating of the gas, generated by outflows or by the interaction of the radio jet with the ambient gas.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray-Driven Galactic Winds with Resolved ISM and Ion-Neutral Damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedback processes in galaxies dictate their structure and evolution. Baryons can be cycled through stars, which inject energy into the interstellar medium (ISM) in supernova explosions, fueling multiphase galactic winds. Cosmic rays (CRs) accelerated at supernova remnants are an important component of feedback. CRs can effectively contribute to wind driving; however, their impact heavily depends on the assumed CR transport model. We run high-resolution "tallbox" simulations of a patch of a galactic disk using the moving mesh magnetohydrodynamics code AREPO, including varied CR implementations and the CRISP non-equilibrium thermochemistry model. We characterize the impact of CR feedback on star formation and multiphase outflows. While CR-driven winds are able to supply energy to a global-scale wind, a purely thermal wind loses most of its energy by the time it reaches 3 kpc above the disk midplane. We further find that the adopted CR transport model significantly affects the steady-state of the wind. In the model with CR advection, streaming, diffusion, and nonlinear Landau damping, CRs provide very strong feedback. Additionally accounting for ion-neutral damping (IND) decouples CRs from the cold ISM, which reduces the impact of CRs on the star formation rate. Nevertheless, CRs in this most realistic model are able to accelerate warm gas and levitate cool gas in the wind but have little effect on cold gas and hot gas. This model displays moderate mass loading and significant CR energy loading, demonstrating that IND does not prevent CRs from providing effective feedback.</description>

      <title>Moving-mesh non-ideal magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the collapse of cloud cores to protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields have been shown both observationally and through theoretical work to be an important factor in the formation of protostars and their accretion disks. Accurate modelling of the evolution of the magnetic field in low-ionization molecular cloud cores requires the inclusion of non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) processes, specifically Ohmic and ambipolar diffusion and the Hall effect. These have a profound influence on the efficiency of magnetic removal of angular momentum from protostellar disks and simulations that include them can avoid the `magnetic-braking catastrophe' in which disks are not able to form. However, the impact of the Hall effect, in particular, is complex and remains poorly studied. In this work, we perform a large suite of simulations of the collapse of cloud cores to protostars with several non-ideal MHD chemistry models and initial core geometries using the moving-mesh code {\small AREPO}. We find that the efficiency of angular momentum removal is significantly reduced with respect to ideal MHD, in line with previous results. The Hall effect has a varied influence on the evolution of the disk which depends on the initial orientation of the magnetic field. This extends to the outflows seen in a subset of the models, where this effect can act to enhance or suppress them and open up new outflow channels. We conclude, in agreement with a subset of the previous literature, that the Hall effect is the dominant non-ideal MHD process in some collapse scenarios and thus should be included in simulations of protostellar disk formation.</description>

      <title>Exploring Magnetic Fields in Molecular Clouds through Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately measuring magnetic field strength in the interstellar medium, including giant molecular clouds (GMCs), remains a significant challenge. We present a machine learning approach using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to estimate magnetic field strength from synthetic observables such as column density, dust continuum polarization vector orientation angles, and line-of-sight (LOS) nonthermal velocity dispersion. We trained three versions of the DDPM model: the 1-channel DDPM (using only column density), the 2-channel DDPM (incorporating both column density and polarization angles), and the 3-channel DDPM (which combines column density, polarization angles, and LOS nonthermal velocity dispersion). We assessed the models on both synthetic test samples and new simulation data that were outside the training set's distribution. The 3-channel DDPM consistently outperformed both the other DDPM variants and the power-law fitting approach based on column density alone, demonstrating its robustness in handling previously unseen data. Additionally, we compared the performance of the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) methods, both classical and modified, to the DDPM predictions. The classical DCF method overestimated the magnetic field strength by approximately an order of magnitude. Although the modified DCF method showed improvement over the classical version, it still fell short of the precision achieved by the 3-channel DDPM.</description>

      <title>Deep HI Mapping of M 106 Group with FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used FAST to conduct deep HI imaging of the entire M 106 group region, and have discovered a few new HI filaments and clouds. Three HI clouds/filaments are found in a region connecting DDO 120 and NGC 4288, indicating an interaction between these two galaxies. The HI features in this region suggest that DDO 120 is probably the origin of the HI stream extending from the northern end of NGC 4288 to M 106. This structure is similar to the SMC-LMC stream, but much longer, about 190 kpc. Furthermore, based on the distance measurements, we have determined the satellite galaxy members of M 106. With an absolute magnitude cutoff of M_B=-10, we obtained a sample of 11 member satellite galaxies for M 106. Using the observed HI mass with FAST, we studied the properties of satellite galaxies in M 106 and found that satellite galaxies with lower stellar masses exhibit more significant deviations from the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) in their specific star formation rates. Furthermore, the relationship between the HI mass of satellite galaxies and optical diameter generally follows the field galaxies relation. We discuss the possible mechanisms leading to the quenching in the M 106 group based on the new data from FAST</description>

      <title>Quantifying the impact of AGN feedback on the large-scale matter distribution using two- and three-point statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) plays a critical role in shaping the matter distribution on scales comparable to and larger than individual galaxies. Upcoming surveys such as $\textit{Euclid}$ and LSST aim to precisely quantify the matter distribution on cosmological scales, making a detailed understanding of AGN feedback effects essential. Hydrodynamical simulations provide an informative framework for studying these effects, in particular by allowing us to vary the parameters that determine the strength of these feedback processes and, consequently, to predict their corresponding impact on the large-scale matter distribution. We use the EAGLE simulations to explore how changes in subgrid viscosity and AGN heating temperature affect the matter distribution, quantified via 2- and 3-point correlation functions, as well as higher order cumulants of the matter distribution. We find that varying viscosity has a small impact ($\approx 10\%$) on scales larger than $1 h^{-1}$ Mpc, while changes to the AGN heating temperature lead to substantial differences, with up to $70\%$ variation in gas clustering on small scales ($\lesssim 1 h^{-1}$ Mpc). By examining the suppression of the power spectrum as a function of time, we identify the redshift range $z = 1.5 - 1$ as a key epoch where AGN feedback begins to dominate in these simulations. The 3-point function provides complementary insight to the more familiar 2-point statistics, and shows more pronounced variations between models on the scale of individual haloes. On the other hand, we find that effects on even larger scales are largely comparable.</description>

      <title>The Effects of AGN Feedback on the Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest Flux Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of AGN feedback on the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest 1D flux power spectrum (P1D). Using the Simba cosmological-hydrodynamic simulations, we examine the impact that adding different AGN feedback modes has on the predicted P1D. We find that, for Simba, the impact of AGN feedback is most dramatic at lower redshifts ($z&lt;1$) and that AGN jet feedback plays the most significant role in altering the P1D. The effects of AGN feedback can be seen across a large range of wavenumbers ($1.5\times10^{-3}&lt;k&lt;10^{-1}$ s/km) changing the ionization state of hydrogen in the IGM through heating. AGN feedback can also alter the thermal evolution of the IGM and thermally broaden individual Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers. For the Simba model, these effects become observable at $z \lesssim 1.0$. At higher redshifts ($z&gt;2.0$), AGN feedback has a $2\%$ effect on the P1D for $k&lt;5\times10^{-2}$ s/km and an $8\%$ effect for $k&gt;5\times10^{-2}$ s/km. We show that the small scale effect is reduced when normalizing the simulation to the observed mean flux. On large scales, the effect of AGN feedback appears via a change in the IGM temperature and is thus unlikely to bias cosmological parameters. The strong AGN jets in the Simba simulation can reproduce the $z&gt;2$ Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. We stress that analyses comparing different AGN feedback models to future higher precision data will be necessary to determine the full extent of this effect.</description>

      <title>Galaxy rotation curve in hyperconical universes: a natural relativistic MOND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) and similar proposals can (at least partially) explain the excess rotation of galaxies or the equivalent mass-discrepancy acceleration, without (or by reducing) the requirement of dark matter halos. This paper develops a modified gravity model to obtain a local limit to general relativity (GR) compatible with a cosmological metric different from the standard Friedmann--Lema\^{\i}tre--Robertson--Walker metric. Specifically, the paper uses a distorted stereographic projection of hyperconical universes, which are 4D hypersurfaces embedded into 5D Minkowski spacetime. This embedding is a key in the MOND effects found in galactic scales. To adequately describe the mass-discrepancy acceleration relation, the centrifugal force would present a small time-like contribution at large-scale dynamics due to the curvature of the Universe. Therefore, the Lagrangian density is very similar to GR but with subtracting the background curvature (or vacuum energy density) of the perturbed hyperconical metric. Results showed that the proposed model adjusts well to 123 galaxy rotation curves obtained from the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves database, using only a free parameter.</description>

      <title>Comparison between the emission torus and the measured toroidal magnetic field for the Crab and Vela nebula</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarization measurements provide insight into the magnetic field, a critical aspect of the dynamics and emission properties around the compact object. In this paper, we present the polarized magnetic field of the Crab outer torus and the Vela arc utilizing Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer observation data. The polarization angle (PA) measured for the Crab outer torus exhibits two monotonic evolutions along the azimuth angle, which are consistent with the normal line of the elliptical ring. There is a slight increase in PA along the azimuth angle for both the inner arc and the outer arc of the Vela nebula. The polarized magnetic vector along the outer torus of the Crab nebula shows the polarized magnetic field aligns with Crab outer torus structure. The PA variation along the Crab outer torus suggests a bulk flow speed of 0.8c. Meanwhile, the Vela nebula polarized magnetic field does not exactly align with the Vela arc structure. We noted that the Crab nebula possesses a polarized toroidal magnetic field, where as the Vela nebula exhibits an incomplete toroidal magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Optical to X-ray Spectra of OJ 287: Insights into X-ray spectral changes and particle spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: OJ 287 is one of the most dynamic BL Lacertae objects that has exhibited behaviour representative of the entire blazar class and is also one of the best sources with simultaneous multi-wavelength coordinated data. Motivated by strong X-ray variability exhibited by the source, we systematically investigated the simultaneous optical to X-ray emission of the source with a focus on the spectral state of the lowest recorded X-ray flux state to understand the X-ray spectral changes. The optical-UV emission being synchrotron, the associated spectral variation is a direct reflection of the high-energy end of the underlying particle spectrum and its power-law continuation to X-rays can drastically affect the X-ray spectrum without much change in optical flux. Thus the combined optical to X-ray provides a potential tool to investigate and explore particle spectrum as well as highest particle energies. We report the finding of a power-law optical-UV spectrum with a photon spectral index of 2.71 $\pm$ 0.03 continuing to X-ray energies and accounting for this contribution at X-ray results in a photon spectral index of 1.15-1.3. We discuss the possible implications of this on X-ray spectral variations and the particle spectrum.</description>

      <title>A Natural Laboratory for Astrochemistry, a Variable Protostar B335</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emission lines from complex organic molecules in B335 were observed in four epochs, spanning a luminosity burst of about 10 years duration. The emission lines increased dramatically in intensity as the luminosity increased, but they have decreased only slightly as the luminosity has decreased. This behavior agrees with expectations of rapid sublimation as the dust temperature increases, but slower freeze-out after the dust temperature drops. Further monitoring of this source, along with detailed chemical models, will exploit this natural laboratory for astrochemistry.</description>

      <title>Calibration of the JAGB method for the Magellanic Clouds and Milky Way from Gaia DR3, considering the role of oxygen-rich AGB stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The JAGB method is a new way of measuring distances with use of AGB stars that are situated in a selected region in a J versus J-Ks CMD, using the fact that the absolute J magnitude is (nearly) constant. It is implicitly assumed in the method that the selected stars are carbon-rich AGB stars. However, as the sample selected to determine M_J is purely colour based there can also be contamination by oxygen-rich AGB stars. As the ratio of C to O-rich stars is known to depend on metallicity and initial mass, the star formation history and age-metallicity relation in a galaxy should influence the value of M_J.
  The aim of this paper is to look at mixed samples of O- and C-rich stars for the LMC, the SMC and Milky Way (MW), using the Gaia catalogue of long period variables as basis. We report the mean and median magnitudes and the results of fitting Gaussian and Lorentzian profiles to the luminosity function (LF) using different colour and magnitudes cuts.
  For the SMC and LMC we confirm the previous results in the literature. The LFs of the SMC and LMC JAGB stars are clearly different, yet the mean magnitude inside a selection box can be argued to agree at the 0.02~mag level.
  The analysis of the MW sample is less straightforward. The contamination by O-rich stars is substantial for a classical lower limit of (J-Ks)0= 1.3, and becomes less than 10% only for (J-Ks)0= 1.5.
  The sample of AGB stars is much smaller than for the MCs for two reasons. Nearby AGB stars tend to be absent as they saturate in the 2MASS catalogue, and the parallax errors of AGB stars tend to be larger compared to non-AGB stars. The mean and median magnitudes are fainter than for the MC samples by about 0.4~mag which is not predicted by theory. We do not confirm the claim in the literature that the absolute calibration of the JAGB method is independent of metallicity up to solar metallicity.</description>

      <title>Neutron Stars and Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars change their structure with accumulation of dark matter. We study how their mass is influenced from the environment. Close to the sun, the dark matter accretion from the neutron star does not have any effect on it. Moving towards the galactic center, the density increase in dark matter results in increased accretion. At distances of some fraction of a parsec, the neutron star acquire enough dark matter to have its structure changed. We show that the neutron star mass decreases going towards the galactic centre, and that dark matter accumulation beyond a critical value collapses the neutron star into a black hole. Calculations cover cases varying the dark matter particle mass, self-interaction strength, and ratio between the pressure of dark matter and ordinary matter. This allow us to constrain the interaction cross section, $\sigma_{\rm dm}$, between nucleons and dark matter particles, as well as the dark matter self-interaction cross section.</description>

      <title>Ages of Stars and Planets in the Kepler Field Younger Than Four Billion Years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent analyses of FGK stars in open clusters have helped clarify the precision with which a star's rotation rate and lithium content can be used as empirical indicators for its age. Here we apply this knowledge to stars observed by Kepler. Rotation periods are drawn from previous work; lithium is measured from new and archival Keck/HIRES spectra. We report rotation-based ages for 23,813 stars (harboring 795 known planets) for which our method is applicable. We find that our rotational ages recover the ages of stars in open clusters spanning 0.04-2.5 Gyr; they also agree with over 90% of the independent lithium ages. The resulting yield includes 63 planets younger than 1 Gyr at 2$\sigma$, and 109 with median ages below 1 Gyr. This is about half the number expected under the classic assumption of a uniform star formation history. The age distribution that we observe, rather than being uniform, shows that the youngest stars in the Kepler field are 3-5 times rarer than stars 3 Gyr old. This trend holds for both known planet hosts and for the parent stellar sample. We attribute this "demographic cliff" to a combination of kinematic heating and a declining star formation rate in the Galaxy's thin disk, and highlight its impact on the age distribution of known transiting exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Limits on planetary-mass primordial black holes from the OGLE high-cadence survey of the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of the Galactic bulge revealed an excess of short-timescale gravitational microlensing events that are generally attributed to a large population of free-floating or wide-orbit exoplanets. However, in recent years, some authors suggested that planetary-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) comprising a substantial fraction (1-10%) of the dark matter in the Milky Way may be responsible for these events. If that was the case, a large number of short-timescale microlensing events should also be seen toward the Magellanic Clouds. Here we report the results of a high-cadence survey of the Magellanic Clouds carried out from October 2022 through May 2024 as part of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE). We observed almost 35 million source stars located in the central regions of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds and found only one long-timescale microlensing event candidate. No short-timescale events were detected despite high sensitivity to such events. That allows us to infer the strongest available limits on the frequency of planetary-mass PBHs in dark matter. We find that PBHs and other compact objects with masses from $1.4 \times 10^{-8}\,M_{\odot}$ (half of the Moon mass) to $0.013\,M_{\odot}$ (planet/brown dwarf boundary) may comprise at most 1% of dark matter. That rules out the PBH origin hypothesis for the short-timescale events detected toward the Galactic bulge and indicates they are caused by the population of free-floating or wide-orbit planets.</description>

      <title>Force-feeding Supermassive Black Holes with Dissipative Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes with masses $\gtrsim 10^9\,M_\odot$ have been discovered by JWST at high redshifts ($z\sim 7$). It is difficult to explain such objects as the result of accretive growth of stellar-mass seeds, as the rate at which baryons can be fed to the black hole is limited by the radiation pressure of the infalling matter. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism to create the early progenitors: the collapse of small dark matter halos through a dissipative cooling mechanism in the dark sector. These small black holes can then be efficiently fed with additional dissipative dark matter due to the comparatively weak interactions between the dark radiation and dark matter, which results in a very short Eddington time and high accretion rates.</description>

      <title>Two waves of massive stars running away from the young cluster R136</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive stars are predominantly born in stellar associations or clusters. Their radiation fields, stellar winds, and supernovae strongly impact their local environment. In the first few million years of a cluster's life, massive stars are dynamically ejected running away from the cluster at high speed. However, the production rate of dynamically ejected runaways is poorly constrained. Here we report on a sample of 55 massive runaway stars ejected from the young cluster R136 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Astrometric analysis with Gaia reveals two channels of dynamically ejected runaways. The first channel ejects massive stars in all directions and is consistent with dynamical interactions during and after the birth of R136. The second channel launches stars in a preferred direction and may be related to a cluster interaction. We find that 23-33% of the most luminous stars initially born in R136 are runaways. Model predictions have significantly underestimated the dynamical escape fraction of massive stars. Consequently, their role in shaping and heating the interstellar and galactic medium, along with their role in driving galactic outflows, is far more important than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Kinematic Insights Into Luminous Blue Variables and B[e] Supergiants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work suggests that many luminous blue variables (LBVs) and B[e] supergiants (sgB[e]) are isolated, implying that they may be products of massive binaries, kicked by partner supernovae (SNe). However, the evidence is somewhat complex and controversial. To test this scenario, we measure the proper-motion velocities for these objects in the LMC and SMC, using Gaia Data Release 3. Our LMC results show that the kinematics, luminosities, and IR properties point to LBVs and sgB[e] stars being distinct classes. We find that Class 1 LBVs, which have dusty nebulae, and sgB[e] stars both show velocity distributions comparable to that of SMC field OBe stars, which are known to have experienced SN kicks. The sgB[e] stars are faster, plausibly due to their lower average masses. However, Class 2 LBVs, which are luminous objects without dusty nebulae, show no signs of acceleration, therefore suggesting that they are single stars, pre-SN binaries, or perhaps binary mergers. The candidate LBV Class 3 stars, which are dominated by hot dust, are all confirmed sgB[e] stars; their luminosities and velocities show that they simply represent the most luminous and massive of the sgB[e] class. There are very few SMC objects, but the sgB[e] stars are faster than their LMC counterparts, which may be consistent with expectations that lower-metallicity binaries are tighter, causing faster ejections. We also examine the distinct class of dust-free, weak-lined sgB[e] stars, finding that the SMC objects have the fastest velocities of the entire sample.</description>

      <title>JWST-IPA: Chemical Inventory and Spatial Mapping of Ices in the Protostar HOPS370 -- Evidence for an Opacity Hole and Thermal Processing of Ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The composition of protoplanetary disks, and hence the initial conditions of planet formation, may be strongly influenced by the infall and thermal processing of material during the protostellar phase. Composition of dust and ice in protostellar envelopes, shaped by energetic processes driven by the protostar, serves as the fundamental building material for planets and complex organic molecules. As part of the JWST GO program, "Investigating Protostellar Accretion" (IPA), we observed an intermediate-mass protostar HOPS 370 (OMC2-FIR3) using NIRSpec/IFU and MIRI/MRS. This study presents the gas and ice phase chemical inventory revealed with the JWST in the spectral range of $\sim$2.9 to 28 $\mu$m and explores the spatial variation of volatile ice species in the protostellar envelope. We find evidence for thermal processing of ice species throughout the inner envelope. We present the first high-spatial resolution ($\sim 80$ au) maps of key volatile ice species H$_{2}$O, CO$_{2}$, $^{13}$CO$_2$, CO, and OCN$^-$, which reveal a highly structured and inhomogeneous density distribution of the protostellar envelope, with a deficiency of ice column density that coincides with the jet/outflow shocked knots. Further, we observe high relative crystallinity of H$_{2}$O ice around the shocked knot seen in the H$_2$ and OH wind/outflow, which can be explained by a lack of outer colder material in the envelope along the line of sight due to the irregular structure of the envelope. These observations show clear evidence of thermal processing of the ices in the inner envelope, close to the outflow cavity walls, heated by the luminous protostar.</description>

      <title>Predicting Stellar Metallicity: A Comparative Analysis of Regression Models for Solar Twin Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The research focuses on determining the metallicity ([Fe/H]) predicted in the solar twin stars by using various regression modeling techniques which are, Random Forest, Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector, and Gradient Boosting. The data set that is taken into account here includes Stellar parameters and chemical abundances derived from a high-accuracy abundance catalog of solar twins from the GALAH survey. To overcome the missing values, intensive preprocessing techniques involving, imputation are done. Each model will subjected to training using different critical observables, which include, Mean Squared Error(MSE), Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE), and R-squared. Modeling is done by using, different feature sets like temperature: effective temperature(Teff), surface gravity: log g of 14-chemical-abundances namely, (([Na/Fe], [Mg/Fe], [Al/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Ca/Fe], [Sc/Fe], [Ti/Fe], [Cr/Fe], [Mn/Fe], [Ni/Fe], [Cu/Fe], [Zn/Fe], [Y/Fe], [Ba/Fe])).
  The target variable considered is the metallicity ([Fe/H]). The findings indicate that the Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy, with an MSE of 0.001628 and an R-squared value of 0.9266. The results highlight the efficacy of ensemble methods in handling complex datasets with high dimensionality. Additionally, this study underscores the importance of selecting appropriate regression models for astronomical data analysis, providing a foundation for future research in predicting stellar properties with machine learning techniques.</description>

      <title>Systematic collapse of the accretion disc in AGN confirmed by UV photometry and broad line spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent study on the spectral energy distribution (SED) of AGN combined unobscured X-ray sources from the eROSITA eFEDS Survey with high quality optical imaging from Subaru's Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC). The HSC data enabled accurate host galaxy subtraction as well as giving a uniform black hole mass estimator from the stellar mass. The resulting stacked optical/X-ray SEDs for black holes at fixed mass show a dramatic transition, where the dominating disc component in bright AGN evaporates into an X-ray hot plasma below $L/L_{\rm Edd}\sim 0.01$. The models fit to these datasets predicted the largest change in SED in the rest frame UV ($&lt; 3000\,\r{A}$), but this waveband was not included in the original study. Here we use archival $u$-band and UV photometry to extend the SEDs into this range, and confirm the UV is indeed intrinsically faint in AGN below $L/L_{\rm Edd}\sim 0.01$ as predicted. This dramatic drop in UV photo-ionising flux is also seen from its effect on the broad emission lines. We stack the recently released SDSS DR18 optical spectra for this sample, and show that the broad H$\beta$ line disappears along with the UV bright component at $L/L_{\rm Edd}\sim 0.01$. This shows that there is a population of unobscured, X-ray bright, UV faint AGN which lack broad emission lines (true type 2 Seyferts).</description>

      <title>Discovery of Two New Eruptions of the Ultrashort Recurrence Time Nova M31N 2017-01e</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the recent discovery of two new eruptions of the recurrent nova M31N 2017-01e in the Andromeda galaxy. The latest eruption, M31N 2024-08c, reached $R=17.8$ on 2024 August 06.85 UT, $\sim2$ months earlier than predicted. In addition to this recent eruption, a search of archival PTF data has revealed a previously unreported eruption on 2014 June 18.46 UT that reached a peak brightness of $R\sim17.9$ approximately a day later. The addition of these two eruption timings has allowed us to update the mean recurrence time of the nova. We find $\langle T_\mathrm{rec} \rangle = 924.0\pm7.0$ days ($2.53\pm0.02$ yr), which is slightly shorter than our previous determination. Thus, M31N 2017-01e remains the nova with the second shortest recurrence time known, with only M31N 2008-12a being shorter. We also present a low-resolution spectrum of the likely quiescent counterpart of the nova, a $\sim20.5$ mag evolved B star displaying an $\sim14.3$ d photometric modulation.</description>

      <title>Simulating realistic self-interacting dark matter models including small and large-angle scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) self-interactions alter the matter distribution on galactic scales and alleviate tensions with observations. A feature of the self-interaction cross section is its angular dependence, influencing offsets between galaxies and DM halos in merging galaxy clusters. While algorithms for modelling mostly forward-dominated or mostly large-angle scatterings exist, incorporating realistic angular dependencies, such as light mediator models, within $N$-body simulations remains challenging. We develop, validate and apply a novel and efficient method, combining existing approaches to describe small- and large-angle scattering regimes within a hybrid scheme. Below a critical angle the effective description via a drag force combined with transverse momentum diffusion is used, while above the angle-dependence is sampled explicitly. First, we verify the scheme using a test set-up with known analytical solutions, and check that our results are insensitive to the choice of the critical angle within an expected range. Next, we demonstrate that our scheme speeds up the computations by multiple orders of magnitude for realistic light mediator models. Finally, we apply the method to galaxy cluster mergers and discuss the sensitivity of the offset between galaxies and DM to the angle-dependence of the cross section. Our scheme ensures accurate offsets for mediator mass $m_\phi$ and DM mass $m_\chi$ within the range $0.1v/c\lesssim m_\phi/m_\chi\lesssim v/c$, while for larger (smaller) mass ratios the offsets obtained for isotropic (forward-dominated) self-scattering are approached. Here $v$ is the typical velocity scale. Equivalently, the upper condition can be expressed as $1.1\lesssim \sigma_{\rm tot}/\sigma_{\mathrm{\widetilde{T}}}\lesssim 10$ for the ratio of total and momentum transfer cross sections, with the ratio being $1$ ($\infty$) in the isotropic (forward-dominated) limits.</description>

      <title>JADES + JEMS: A Detailed Look at the Buildup of Central Stellar Cores and Suppression of Star Formation in Galaxies at Redshifts 3 &lt; z &lt; 4.5</title>

Abstract: We present a spatially resolved study of stellar populations in 6 galaxies with stellar masses $M_*\sim10^{10}M_\odot$ at $z\sim3.7$ using 14-filter JWST/NIRCam imaging from the JADES and JEMS surveys. The 6 galaxies are visually selected to have clumpy substructures with distinct colors over rest-frame $3600-4100\r{A}$, including a red, dominant stellar core that is close to their stellar-light centroids. With 23-filter photometry from HST to JWST, we measure the stellar-population properties of individual structural components via SED fitting using Prospector. We find that the central stellar cores are $\gtrsim2$ times more massive than the Toomre mass, indicating they may not form via single in-situ fragmentation. The stellar cores have stellar ages of $0.4-0.7$ Gyr that are similar to the timescale of clump inward migration due to dynamical friction, suggesting that they likely instead formed through the coalescence of giant stellar clumps. While they have not yet quenched, the 6 galaxies are below the star-forming main sequence by $0.2-0.7$ dex. Within each galaxy, we find that the specific star formation rate is lower in the central stellar core, and the stellar-mass surface density of the core is already similar to quenched galaxies of the same masses and redshifts. Meanwhile, the stellar ages of the cores are either comparable to or younger than the extended, smooth parts of the galaxies. Our findings are consistent with model predictions of the gas-rich compaction scenario for the buildup of galaxies' central regions at high redshifts. We are likely witnessing the coeval formation of dense central cores, along with the onset of galaxy-wide quenching at $z&gt;3$.</description>

Abstract: Dark Matter (DM) subhalos are predicted to perturb stellar streams; stream morphologies and dynamics can constrain the mass distribution of subhalos. Using FIRE-2 simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies, we show that presence of a Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)--analog significantly changes stream-subhalo encounter rates. Three key factors drive these changes. First, the LMC--analog brings in many subhalos, increasing encounter rates for streams near the massive satellite by up to 20--40%. Second, the LMC--analog displaces the host from its center-of-mass (inducing reflex motion), causing a north-south asymmetry in the density and radial velocity distribution of subhalos. This asymmetry results in encounter rates varying by 50--70% across the sky at the same distance. Finally, the LMC--mass satellite induces a density wake in the host's DM halo, further boosting the encounter rates near the LMC--analog. We also explore the influence of stream orbital properties, finding a 50% increase in encounters for streams moving retrograde to the LMC--analog's orbit in the opposite hemisphere. The dependence of encounter rates on stream location and orbit has important implications for where to search for new streams with spurs and gaps in the Milky Way.</description>

Abstract: The \textit{JWST} is allowing new measurements of gas-phase metallicities in galaxies between cosmic noon and cosmic dawn. The most robust approach uses luminosity ratios between the excited auroral transition, [\oiii] 4364\,\AA, and the lower [\oiii] 5008\,\AA/4960\,\AA\ lines to determine the gas temperature. The ratio of the luminosities in the latter transitions to those in hydrogen Balmer series lines then yield relatively clean metallicity estimates. In the absence of detection of the [\oiii] auroral line, the ratios of various [\oiii], [\oii], [\nii], and Balmer lines are used to determine metallicities. Here we present a refined approach for extracting metallicities from these ``strong line diagnostics''. Our method exploits empirical correlations between the temperature of \oiii/\oii\ regions and gas-phase metallicity. We then show, from first principles, how to extract metallicities and break degeneracies in these estimates using traditional strong line diagnostics, R2, R3, R23, and O3O2, and N2O2. We show that these ratios depend also on volume correction factors, i.e. on accounting for the fraction of the volume of HII regions that are in \oiii\ and \oii, but that these can be determined self-consistently along with the metallicities. We quantify the success of our method using metallicities derived from galaxies with auroral line determinations and show that it generally works better than previous empirical approaches. The scatter in the observed line ratios and redshift evolution are largely explained by O3O2 variations. We provide publicly available routines for extracting metallicities from strong line diagnostics using our methodology.</description>

      <title>Connecting stellar and galactic scales: Energetic feedback from stellar wind bubbles to supernova remnants</title>

Abstract: Energy and momentum feedback from stars is a key element of models for galaxy formation and interstellar medium dynamics, but resolving the relevant length scales to directly include this feedback remain out of reach of current-generation simulations. We aim to constrain the energy feedback by winds, photoionisation and supernovae (SNe) from massive stars. We measure the thermal and kinetic energy imparted to the interstellar medium on various length scales, calculated from high-resolution 1D radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. Our grid of simulations covers a broad range of densities, metallicities, and state-of-the-art evolutionary models of single and binary stars. We find that a single star or binary system can carve a cavity of tens-of-pc size into the surrounding medium. During the pre-SN phase, post-main-sequence stellar winds and photoionisation dominate. While SN explosions dominate the total energy budget, the pre-SN feedback is of great importance by reducing the circumstellar gas density and delaying the onset of radiative losses in the SN remnant. Contrary to expectations, the metallicity dependence of the stellar wind has little effect on the cumulative energy imparted by feedback to the ISM; the only requirement is the existence of a sufficient level of pre-SN radiative and mechanical feedback. The ambient medium density determines how much and when feedback energy reaches to distance $\gtrsim 10-20$ pc and affects the division between kinetic and thermal feedback. Our results can be used as a sub-grid model for feedback in large-scale simulations of galaxies. The results reinforce that the uncertain mapping of stellar evolution sequences to SN explosion energy is very important to determining the overall feedback energy from a stellar population.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters involves hundreds of galaxies over a large redshift range and increases the likelihood of rare phenomena (supernovae, dark substructures, etc.). We present the detailed analysis of \elanz, a prominent quintuply imaged dusty star-forming galaxy ($\zs=2.29$), mainly lensed by three members of the massive galaxy cluster ACT-CL\,J0102$-$4915, also known as \elgor ($z_{\rm d}=0.87$). We leverage JWST/NIRCam images, which contain lensing features that were unseen in previous HST images, using a Bayesian, multi-wavelength, differentiable and GPU-accelerated modeling framework that combines \herculens (lens modeling) and \nifty (field model and inference) software packages. For one of the deflectors, we complement lensing constraints with stellar kinematics measured from VLT/MUSE data. In our lens model, we explicitly include the mass distribution of the cluster, locally corrected by a constant shear field. We find that the two main deflectors (L1 and L2) have logarithmic mass density slopes steeper than isothermal, with $\gamma_{\rm L1} = 2.23\pm0.05$ and $\gamma_{\rm L2} = 2.21\pm0.04$. We argue that such steep density profiles can arise due to tidally truncated mass distributions, which we probe thanks to the cluster lensing boost and the strong asymmetry of the lensing configuration. Moreover, our three-dimensional source model captures most of the surface brightness of the lensed galaxy, revealing a clump with a maximum diameter of $400$ parsecs at the source redshift, visible at wavelengths $\lambda_{\rm rest}\gtrsim0.6$ $\mu$m. Finally, we caution on using point-like features within extended arcs to constrain galaxy-scale lens models before securing them with extended arc modeling.</description>

      <title>HELLO project: High-$z$ Evolution of Large and Luminous Objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the High-$z$ Evolution of Large and Luminous Objects (HELLO) project, a set of $\sim\!30$ high-resolution cosmological simulations aimed to study Milky Way analogues ($M_\star\sim10^{10-11}$\,\Msun) at high redshift ($z\sim [2-4]$). Based on the Numerical Investigation of a Hundred Astrophysical Objects (NIHAO), HELLO features an updated scheme for chemical enrichment and the addition of local photoionization feedback. Independently of redshift and mass, our galaxies exhibit a smooth progression along the star formation main sequence until $M_\star \sim\!10^{10.5}$, around which our sample at $z \sim 4$ remains mostly unperturbed while the most massive galaxies at $z \sim 2$ reach their peak star formation rate (SFR) and its subsequent decline, due to a mix of gas consumption and stellar feedback. While AGN feedback remains subdominant with respect to stellar feedback for energy deposition, its localised nature likely adds to the physical processes leading to declining SFRs. The phase in which a galaxy in our mass range can be found at a given redshift is set by its gas reservoir and assembly history. Finally, our galaxies are in excellent agreement with various scaling relations observed with the \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} and the \textit{James Webb Space Telescope}, and hence can be used to provide the theoretical framework to interpret current and future observations from these facilities and shed light on the transition from star-forming to quiescent galaxies.</description>

      <title>Accretion properties of X-ray AGN: Evidence for radiation-regulated obscuration with redshift-dependent host galaxy contribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We adopt a Bayesian X-ray spectral approach to investigate the accretion properties of unobscured ($20&lt;\log(N_{\rm H}/{\rm cm}^{-2}&lt;22$) and obscured ($22&lt; \log(N_{\rm H}/{\rm cm}^{-2}&lt;24$) active galactic nuclei (AGN) to shed light on the orientation vs evolution scenarios for the origin of the obscuring material. For a sample of 3882 X-ray-selected AGN from the {\it Chandra} COSMOS Legacy, AEGIS and CDFS extragalactic surveys, we constrain their stellar masses, $M_\star$, intrinsic X-ray luminosities, $L_{\rm X}$, obscuring column densities, $N_{\rm H}$, and specific accretion rates $\lambda\propto L_{\rm X}/M_\star$. By combining these observables within a Bayesian non-parametric approach, we infer, for the first time, the specific accretion rate distribution (SARD) of obscured and unobscured AGN to $z\approx3$, i.e. the probability of a galaxy with mass $M_\star$ at redshift $z$ hosting an AGN with column density $N_{\rm H}$ and specific accretion rate $\lambda$. Our findings indicate that (1) both obscured and unobscured SARDs share similar shapes, shifting towards higher accretion rates with redshift, (2) unobscured SARDs exhibit a systematic offset towards higher $\lambda$ compared to obscured SARD for all redshift intervals, (3) the obscured AGN fraction declines sharply at $\log\lambda_{\rm break} \sim-2$ for $z &lt;0.5$, but shifts to higher $\lambda$ values with increasing redshift, (4) the incidence of AGN within the theoretically unstable blow-out region of the $\lambda-N_{\rm H}$ plane increases with redshift. These observations provide compelling evidence for AGN "downsizing" and radiation-regulated nuclear-scale obscuration with an increasing host galaxy contribution towards higher redshifts.</description>

      <title>JWST MIRI detections of H$\alpha$ and [O III] and direct metallicity measurement of the $z=10.17$ lensed galaxy MACS0647$-$JD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16200v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST spectroscopy has revolutionized our understanding of galaxies in the early universe. Covering wavelengths up to $5.3\,{\rm \mu m}$, NIRSpec can detect rest-frame optical emission lines H$\alpha$ out to $z = 7$ and [O III] to $z = 9.5$. Observing these lines in more distant galaxies requires longer wavelength spectroscopy with MIRI. Here we present MIRI MRS IFU observations of the lensed galaxy merger MACS0647$-$JD at $z = 10.165$. With exposure times of 4.2 hours in each of two bands, we detect H$\alpha$ at $9\sigma$, [O III]$\,\lambda5008$ at $11\sigma$, and [O III]$\,\lambda4960$ at $3\sigma$. Combined with previously reported NIRSpec spectroscopy that yields seven emission lines including the auroral line [O III]$\,\lambda4363$, we present the first direct metallicity measurement of a $z &gt; 10$ galaxy: $12+{\rm log(O/H)}= 7.79\pm0.09$, or $0.13^{+0.02}_{-0.03}\,Z_{\odot}$. This is similar to galaxies at $z \sim 4 - 9$ with direct metallicity measurements, though higher than expected given the high specific star formation rate ${\rm log(sSFR / yr^{-1})} = -7.4 \pm 0.3$. We further constrain the ionization parameter ${\rm log}(U)$ = $-1.9 \pm 0.1$, ionizing photon production efficiency ${\rm log}(\xi_{\rm ion})$ = $25.3\pm0.1$, and star formation rate $5.0\pm0.6\,M_{\odot}/{\rm yr}$ within the past $10\,{\rm Myr}$. These observations demonstrate the combined power of JWST NIRSpec and MIRI for studying galaxies in the first $500$ million years.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a Galaxy at z &gt; 10 Explored by JWST Integral Field Spectroscopy: Hints of Rotating Disk Suggesting Weak Feedback</title>

Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of GN-z11, a luminous galaxy at $z=10.60$, carefully analyzing the public deep integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data taken with JWST NIRSpec IFU. While the observations of the IFS data originally targeted a He II clump near GN-z11, we find that CIII]$\lambda\lambda$1907,1909 emission from ionized gas at GN-z11 is bright and spatially extended significantly beyond the point-spread function (PSF). The spatially extended CIII emission of GN-z11 shows a velocity gradient, red- and blue-shifted components in the north and south directions, respectively, which cannot be explained by the variation of [CIII]$\lambda$1907/CIII]$\lambda$1909 line ratios. Assuming the velocity gradient is produced by disk rotation, we perform forward modeling with GalPak$^{3D}$, including the effects of PSF smearing and line blending, and obtain a rotation velocity of $v_{rot}=257^{+138}_{-117}$ km s$^{-1}$, a velocity dispersion of $\sigma_v=91^{+18}_{-32}$ km s$^{-1}$, and a ratio of $v_{rot}/\sigma_v=2.83^{+1.82}_{-1.41}$. The $v_{rot}/\sigma_v$ value would suggest a rotation-dominated disk existing at $z&gt;10$ albeit with the large uncertainties. The rotation velocity agrees with those of numerical simulations predicting a rotating disk formed in the early universe under the condition of mass compaction and weak feedback. While the velocity gradient is consistent with the rotating disk solution, we recognize that galactic outflows can also explain the velocity gradient as well as the extended morphology and the high velocity dispersion found in the outskirt. Higher S/N and resolution data are necessary to conclude the physical origin of the velocity gradient in GN-z11.</description>

Abstract: Measurements of the accelerations of stars enabled by time-series extreme-precision spectroscopic observations, from pulsar timing, and from eclipsing binary stars in the Solar Neighborhood offer insights into the mass distribution of the Milky Way that do not rely on traditional equilibrium modeling. Given the measured accelerations, we can determine a total mass density, and from this, by accounting for the mass in stars, gas, and dust, we can infer the amount of dark matter. Leveraging the FIRE-2 simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies, we compare vertical acceleration profiles between cold dark matter (CDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) with constant cross-section of 1 cm$^2$ g$^{-1}$ across three halos with diverse assembly histories. Notably, significant asymmetries in vertical acceleration profiles near the midplane at fixed radii are observed in both CDM and SIDM, particularly in halos recently affected by mergers with satellites of Sagittarius/SMC-like masses or greater. These asymmetries offer a unique window into exploring the merger history of a galaxy. We show that SIDM halos consistently exhibit higher local stellar and dark matter densities and steeper vertical acceleration gradients, up to 30% steeper near the Solar Neighborhood. SIDM halos also manifest a more oblate halo shape in the Solar Neighborhood. Furthermore, enhanced precision in acceleration measurements and larger datasets promise to provide better constraints on the local dark matter density, complementing our understanding from kinematic analysis of their distribution within galaxies.</description>

      <title>How do the successive buckling events affect a galaxy bar and stellar disk? Potential Observable Signatures For Spotting the Buckling Action -- I</title>

Abstract: Until now, observations have caught up only a handful of galaxies in ongoing buckling action. Interestingly, N-body simulations over the past several decades show that almost every bar buckles or vertically thickens as soon as it reaches its peak strength during its evolution and leads to box$/$ peanut$/$ x (BPX) shapes. In order to understand the effect of multiple buckling events on the observable properties of galactic bar and disk, we perform an N-body simulation of a Milky Way-type disk. The axisymmetric galaxy disk forms a bar within a Gyr of its evolution and the bar undergoes two successive buckling events. We report that the time spans of these two buckling events are 220 Myr and 1 Gyr which have almost similar strengths of the bending modes. As a result of these two buckling events, the sizes of BPX shapes are around 5.8 kpc and 8.6 kpc which are around two-thirds of the bar length at the end of each buckling event. We find that the first buckling occurs at a smaller scale (radius less than 3 kpc) with a shorter time span affecting the larger length scales of the disk which is quantified in terms of changes in $m$ =2 and $m$ = 4 Fourier modes. While the second buckling occurs at larger scales (radius of around 6 kpc) affecting the inner disk the most. Finally, we provide observable kinematic signatures (for example quadrupolar patterns of the line-of-sight velocities) which can potentially differentiate the successive buckling events.</description>

Abstract: Spatial, kinematic, and orbital properties, along with ages and chemical compositions of the thin disc, thick disc, and various stellar substructures in the halo, are studied based on data from the LAMOST and Gaia surveys. The star formation in the Galactic thin and thick disc, with peak metallicities of $-0.20$ and $-0.45$ dex, is found to have peaked about 5.5 and 12.5 Gyr ago, respectively. The thin disc is also found to have experienced an initial star formation burst about 12.5 Gyr ago. The pro-grade population Splash and hot-disc (HD), with peak metallicity of about $-0.60$ and $-0.43$, are found to be about 13.03 and 12.21 Gyr old, respectively, with peak eccentricity of 0.70 and 0.35, are understood to be of in situ origin. The Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage (GE/S), Thamnos, and Sequoia, with peak metallicity of about $-1.31$, $-1.36$, and $-1.56$, are found to be about 11.66, 12.89, and 12.18 Gyr old, respectively, and are understood to be remnants of dwarf galaxies merged with the Milky Way. The HD, Splash, and Thamnos are found to have experienced chemical evolution similar to the thick disc while GE/S, Sequoia, and Helmi stream are found to have experienced distinct chemical enrichment of iron and $\alpha$-process elements.</description>

      <title>IllustrisTNG in the HSC-SSP: No Shortage of Thin Disk Galaxies in TNG50</title>

Abstract: We perform a thorough analysis of the projected shapes of nearby galaxies in both observations and cosmological simulations. We implement a forward-modeling approach to overcome the limitations in previous studies, which hinder accurate comparisons between observations and simulations. We measure axis ratios of $z=0$ (snapshot 99) TNG50 galaxies from their synthetic Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) images and compare them with those obtained from real HSC-SSP images of a matched galaxy sample. Remarkably, the comparison shows excellent agreement between the observations and the TNG50 simulation, challenging previous claims that $\Lambda$CDM models underproduced the abundance of thin galaxies. Specifically, for galaxies with stellar masses $10\leq \log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \leq 11.5$, we find $\lesssim 0.1\sigma$ tensions between the observations and the simulation, a stark contrast to the previously reported $\gtrsim 10\sigma$ tensions. We reveal that low-mass galaxies ($M_{\star}\lesssim 10^{9.5}\,M_{\odot}$) in TNG50 are thicker than their observed counterparts in HSC-SSP and attribute this to the spurious dynamical heating effects that artificially puff up galaxies. We also find that, despite the overall broad agreement, TNG50 galaxies are more concentrated than the HSC-SSP ones at the low- and high-mass end of the stellar mass range of $9.0\leq \log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \leq 11.2$ and are less concentrated at intermediate stellar masses. But we argue that the higher concentrations of the low-mass TNG50 galaxies are not likely the cause of their thicker/rounder appearances. Our study underscores the critical importance of conducting mock observations of simulations and applying consistent measurement methodologies to facilitate proper comparison with observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02230v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, galaxy samples have been generated using mock observation techniques based on the results of TNG100-1 simulations to investigate three forms of intrinsic alignment: satellite-central alignment between the orientation of the brightest group galaxies (BGG) and the spatial distribution of their satellites, radial alignment between the satellites' orientation and the direction toward their BGG, as well as direct alignment between the orientation of BGG and that of its satellites. Overall, the predictions of galaxy alignment generally align with observations, although minor discrepancies have been identified. For satellite-central alignment, the alignment strength and color-dependence trends are well replicated by the mock observations. Regarding radial alignment, the signals are weak but discernible, with no apparent color dependence. As for direct alignment, no signal is detected, nor is there any color dependence. We also investigate the alignment dependencies on halo or the BGG properties, and proximity effect. For satellite-central alignment, the predicted alignment signal shows a positive correlation with halo and BGG mass, consistent with observations and previous predictions. Similar correlations have also been observed with the BGG age and metallicity, which merit future observational analysis for confirmation. Proximity effects have been observed for all three types of alignment, with satellites closer to the BGG exhibiting stronger alignment signals. The influence of galaxy definition and shape determination on alignment studies is also analyzed. This study underscores the importance of employing mock observation techniques for a fair comparison between predictions and observations.</description>

      <title>On the kinematic nature of apparent discs at high redshifts: Local counterparts are not dominated by ordered rotation but by tangentially anisotropic random motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is not straightforward to physically interpret the apparent morphology of galaxies. Recent observations by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) revealed a dominant galaxy population at high redshifts ($z&gt;2$) that were visually classified as discs for their flattened shapes and/or exponential light profiles. The extensively accepted interpretation is that they are dynamically cold discs supported by bulk rotation. However, it is long known that flattened shapes and exponential profiles are not exclusive for rotating disc structure. To break degeneracy and assess the rotational support of typical high-$z$ galaxies in the JWST samples, those with active star formation and stellar masses $\mathrm{lg}(\mathcal{M}_{\star}/\mathcal{M}_{\odot})\sim9$, we study the kinematics of their equal-mass counterparts at $z=0$. While these local star-forming low-mass galaxies are photometrically similar to real dynamically cold discs, they are not supported by ordered rotation but primarily by random motion, and their flattened shapes result largely from tangential orbital anisotropy. Given the empirical and theoretical evidence that young galaxies are dynamically hotter at higher redshifts, our results suggest that the high-$z$ JWST galaxies may not be cold discs but are dynamically warm/hot galaxies with flattened shapes driven by anisotropy. While both having low rotational support, local low-mass galaxies possess oblate shapes, contrasting the prolate shapes (i.e. cigar-like) of low-mass systems at high redshifts. Such shape transition (prolate$\Rightarrow$oblate) indicates an associated change in orbital anisotropy (radial$\Rightarrow$tangential), with roots likely in the assembly of their host dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Absorption in LAMOST low Resolution Normalized Spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to the hierarchical clustering scenario, galaxies like the Milky Way form hierarchically, and many supporting evidences have been found in the Galactic halo. However, most stars in the Milky Way are disk stars. Disk stars have almost lost their spatial distribution and kinematic features at birth, retaining solely chemical signatures. Identifying such substructures using abundances of iron or light elements is difficult due to their high degeneracy. Heavy elements, especially neutron capture elements have limited sources so have lower degeneracy, but spectral line fitting of these elements is tough, requiring mid to high resolution spectra, which are currently limited in sample size. This work utilizes the collective effect of many spectral lines from several elements, especially neutron capture elements to weaken the degeneracy of [Fe/H]. The analysis suggests the presence of at least 12 clusters, due to the hierarchical absorption in LAMOST low resolution normalized Spectra. More detailed work is needed to ascertain whether this hierarchical absorption is natural.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a set of photometric catalogs primarily aimed at providing the community with a comprehensive database for the study of galaxy populations in the high redshift Universe. The set gathers data from eight JWST NIRCam observational programs, targeting the Abell 2744 (GLASS-JWST, UNCOVER, DDT2756 and GO3990), EGS (CEERS), COSMOS and UDS (PRIMER), and GOODS North and South (JADES and NGDEEP) deep fields, for a total area of $\sim$0.2 sq. degrees. Photometric estimates are obtained by means of well-established techniques, including tailored improvements designed to enhance the performance on the specific dataset. We also include new measurements from HST archival data, thus collecting 16 bands spanning from 0.44 to 4.44 $\mu$m. A grand total of $\sim$530 thousand sources is detected on stacks of NIRCam 3.56 and 4.44 $\mu$m mosaics. We assess the photometric accuracy by comparing fluxes and colors against archival catalogs. We also provide photometric redshift estimates, statistically validated against a large set of robust spectroscopic data. The catalogs are publicly available on the Astrodeep website.</description>

      <title>Deciphering spatially resolved Lyman-alpha profiles in reionization analogs: the Sunburst Arc at cosmic noon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hydrogen Lyman-alpha (Lya) emission line, the brightest spectral feature of a photoionized gas, is considered an indirect tracer of the escape of Lyman continuum (LyC) photons, particularly when the intergalactic medium is too opaque for direct detection. However, resonant scattering complicates interpreting the empirical properties of Lya photons, necessitating radiative transfer simulations to capture their strong coupling with underlying gas kinematics. In this study, we leverage the exceptional spatial resolution from strong gravitational lensing to investigate the connection between Lya line profiles and LyC leakage on scales of a few 100 pc in the Sunburst Arc galaxy at $z\sim2.37$. New optical echelle spectra obtained using Magellan MIKE show that both the LyC leaking and non-leaking regions exhibit a classic double-peak Lya feature with an enhanced red peak, indicating outflows at multiple locations in the galaxy. Both regions also show a central Gaussian peak atop the double peaks, indicating directly escaped Lya photons independent of LyC leakage. We introduce a machine learning-based method for emulating Lya simulations to quantify intrinsic dynamics ($\sigma_{\mathrm{int}}$), neutral hydrogen column density ($N_{\mathrm{HI}}$), outflow velocity ($v_{\mathrm{exp}}$), and effective temperature ($T$) across continuous parameter spaces. By comparing the spatially and spectrally resolved Lya lines in Sunburst, we argue that the directly escaped Lya photons originate in a volume-filling, warm ionized medium spanning $\sim1$ kpc, while the LyC leakage is confined to regions of $\lesssim200$ pc. These sub-kpc variations in Lya profiles highlight the complexity of interpreting integrated properties in the presence of inhomogeneous mixtures of gas and young stars, emphasizing the need for spatially and spectrally resolved observations of distant galaxies.</description>

      <title>Loki: an ancient system hidden in the Galactic plane?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse high-resolution ESPaDOnS/CFHT spectra of 20 very metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]~$&lt;-2.0$) in the solar neighbourhood (within $\sim2$ kpc) selected to be on planar orbits (with a maximum height of $\lesssim4$ kpc). Targets include 11 prograde and 9 retrograde stars, spanning a wide range of eccentricities ($0.20-0.95$). Their chemical abundances are consistent with those observed in the Galactic halo but show a smaller spread, with no notable difference between progrades and retrogrades. This suggests a common chemical evolution and likely a shared formation site (except for one star). In this case, chemical evolution models indicate that the formation site would have had a baryonic mass of $\sim1.4\times10^9\msun$, similar to classical dwarf galaxies. High-energy supernovae and hypernovae are needed to reproduce the [X/Fe] up to the Fe-peak, while fast-rotating massive stars and neutron star merger events explain the [X/Fe] of the neutron-capture elements. The absence of Type Ia supernova signatures suggests a star formation duration of $\lesssim1$~Gyr. Cosmological zoom-in simulations support the scenario that an in-plane infall of a single system could disperse stars over a wide range of angular momenta during the early Galactic assembly. We propose that these stars originated in a proto-Galactic building block, which we name Loki. Less likely, if progrades and retrogrades formed in two different systems, their chemical evolution must have been very similar, with a combined baryonic mass twice that of a single system. Forthcoming surveys will provide a large and homogeneous dataset to investigate whether Loki is associated with any of the known detected structures. A comparison (primarily [$\alpha$/Fe]) with other VMPs moving in planar orbits suggests multiple systems contributed to the Galactic planar population, presenting some differences in their kinematical parameters.</description>

      <title>oMEGACat IV: Constraining Ages of Omega Centauri sub-giant branch stars with HST and MUSE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present age estimates for over 8100 sub-giant branch (SGB) stars in Omega Centauri ($\omega$ Cen) to study its star formation history. Our large data set, which combines multi-wavelength HST photometry with MUSE metallicities, provides an unprecedented opportunity to measure individual stellar ages. We do this by fitting each star's photometry and metallicity with theoretical isochrones, that are embedded with an empirical [C+N+O]-[Fe/H] relation specifically for $\omega$ Cen. The bulk of the stars have ages between 13 and 10 Gyr, with the mean stellar age being 12.08$\pm$0.01 Gyrs and the median age uncertainty being 0.68 Gyrs. From these ages we construct the most complete age-metallicity relation (AMR) for $\omega$ Cen to date. We find that the mean age of stars decreases with increasing metallicity and find two distinct streams in the age-metallicity plane, hinting at different star formation pathways. We derive an intrinsic spread in the ages of 0.75$\pm$0.01 Gyr for the whole cluster, with the age spread showing a clear increase with metallicity. We verify the robustness of our age estimations by varying isochrone parameters and constraining our systematics. We find the C+N+O relation to be the most critical consideration for constraining the AMR. We also present the SGB chromosome map with age information. In the future, these stellar ages could be combined with chemical abundances to study age differences in subpopulations, and uncover the chemical evolution history of this massive nuclear star cluster.</description>

Abstract: The extended ultraviolet (XUV) disks of nearby galaxies show ongoing massive star formation, but their parental molecular clouds remain mostly undetected despite searches in CO(1-0) and CO(2-1). The recent detection of 23 clouds in the higher excitation transition CO(3-2) within the XUV disk of M83 requires an explanation. We test the hypothesis: the clouds in XUV disks have a clump-envelope structure similar to those in Galactic star-forming clouds, having star-forming dense clumps (or concentrations of multiple clumps) at their centers, which predominantly contribute to the CO(3-2) emission, surrounded by less-dense envelopes, where CO molecules are photo-dissociated due to the low-metallicity environment there. We utilize new high-resolution ALMA CO(3-2) observations of a subset (11) of the 23 clouds in the XUV disk. We confirm the compactness of the CO(3-2)-emitting dense clumps (or their concentrations), finding clump diameters below the spatial resolution of 6-9~pc. This is similar to the size of the dense gas region in the Orion A molecular cloud, the local star-forming cloud with massive star formation. The dense star-forming clumps are common between normal and XUV disks. This may also indicate that once the cloud structure is set, the process of star formation is governed by the cloud internal physics rather than by external triggers. This simple model explains the current observations of the clouds with ongoing massive star formation, although it may require some adjustment, e.g., including an effect of cloud evolution, for a general scenario of star formation in molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>Merian: A Wide-Field Imaging Survey of Dwarf Galaxies at z~0.06-0.10</title>

Abstract: We present the Merian Survey, an optical imaging survey optimized for studying the physical properties of bright star-forming dwarf galaxies. Merian is carried out with two medium-band filters ($N708$ and $N540$, centered at $708$ and $540$ nm), custom-built for the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the Blanco telescope. Merian covers $\sim 750\,\mathrm{deg}^2$ of equatorial fields, overlapping with the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) wide, deep, and ultra-deep fields. When combined with the HSC-SSP imaging data ($grizy$), the new Merian DECam medium-band imaging allows for photometric redshift measurements via the detection of H$\rm\alpha$ and [OIII] line emission flux excess in the $N708$ and $N540$ filters, respectively, at $0.06&lt;z&lt;0.10$. We present an overview of the survey design, observations taken to date, data reduction using the LSST Science Pipelines, including aperture-matched photometry for accurate galaxy colors, and a description of the data included in the first data release (DR1). The key science goals of Merian include: probing the dark matter halos of dwarf galaxies out to their virial radii using high signal-to-noise weak lensing profile measurements, decoupling the effects of baryonic processes from dark matter, and understanding the role of black holes in dwarf galaxy evolution. This rich dataset will also offer unique opportunities for studying extremely metal-poor galaxies via their strong [OIII] emission and H$\rm\alpha$ lines, as well as [OIII] emitters at $z\sim 0.4$, and Ly$\rm\alpha$ emitters at $z\sim 3.3$ and $z\sim 4.8$. Merian showcases the power of utilizing narrow and medium-band filters alongside broad-band filters for sky imaging, demonstrating their synergistic capacity to unveil astrophysical insights across diverse astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Spin-Polarized Electrons from Magnetically Aligned Grains and Chiral Symmetry Breaking: Effects of Cosmic Rays in Protostellar Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-energy spin-polarized electrons (SPEs) are thought to cause symmetry breaking and could explain the origin of homochirality of prebiotic molecules such as amino acids and sugars. Here we study the effect of cosmic rays (CRs) on the emission of SPEs from aligned grains in dense protostellar environments and explore the SPE effects on chiral asymmetry of prebiotic molecules. We first show that icy grains in protostellar environments can align with magnetic fields due to magnetically enhanced radiative torque mechanism. We then study the production of thermal electrons by CR ionization of the H$_2$ gas and the CR-induced UV radiation using the attenuated CR spectra in dense cores obtained from a continous slowing down model. Next, we show that thermal electrons with initial random spins captured by aligned grains will quickly become spin-polarized due to the Barnett effect, converting unpolarized incident electrons into SPEs. We calculate the rate of photoemission of such SPEs by CRs-induced UV radiation and secondary electron emission from aligned grains and find that the photoemission by CRs-induced UV radiation is dominant. Finally, we calculate the total production rate of SPEs inside aligned dust grains by CRs. Low-energy secondary SPEs from aligned grains induced by CRs would cause the chiral asymmetry of chiral prebiotic molecules formed in the ice mantle of aligned grains, in analogous to UV circularly polarized light. We propose that amino acids and sugars of chiral assymmetry detected in meteorite/asteroids/comets might be formed in the ice mantle of grains under the irradiation of SPEs released from aligned grains by CRs in protostellar environments.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Low Mass End of the Stellar Halo Mass Relation with Surveys of Satellite Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The abundance of satellite galaxies is set by the hierarchical assembly of their host halo. We leverage this to investigate the low mass end ($M_{\mathrm{H}} &lt; 10^{11} M_{\odot}$) of the Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation (SHMR), which is key to constraining theories of galaxy formation and cosmology. We argue that recent analyses of satellite galaxies in the Local Group environment have not adequately modelled the dominant source of scatter in satellite stellar mass functions: the variance in accretion histories for a fixed host halo mass. We present a novel inference framework that not only properly accounts for this halo-to-halo variance but also naturally identifies the amount of host halo mass mixing, which is generally unknown. Specifically, we use the semi-analytical SatGen model to construct mock satellite galaxy populations consistent with the third data release of the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) survey. We demonstrate that even under the most idealized circumstances, the halo-to-halo variance makes it virtually impossible to put any meaningful constraints on the scatter in the SHMR. Even a satellite galaxy survey made up 100 hosts can at best only place an upper limit of $\sim 0.5$dex on the scatter (at the 95\% confidence level). This is because the large variance in halo assembly histories dominates over the scatter in the SHMR. This problem can be overcome by increasing the sample size of the survey by an order of magnitude ($\sim 1000$ host galaxies), something that should be fairly straightforward with forthcoming spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>The CluMPR Galaxy Cluster-Finding Algorithm and DESI Legacy Survey Galaxy Cluster Catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10426v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters enable unique opportunities to study cosmology, dark matter, galaxy evolution, and strongly-lensed transients. We here present a new cluster-finding algorithm, CluMPR (Clusters from Masses and Photometric Redshifts), that exploits photometric redshifts (photo-z's) as well as photometric stellar mass measurements. CluMPR uses a 2-dimensional binary search tree to search for overdensities of massive galaxies with similar redshifts on the sky and then probabilistically assigns cluster membership by accounting for photo-z uncertainties. We leverage the deep DESI Legacy Survey grzW1W2 imaging over one-third of the sky to create a catalogue of ~ 300,000 galaxy cluster candidates out to z = 1, including tabulations of member galaxies and estimates of each cluster's total stellar mass. Compared to other methods, CluMPR is particularly effective at identifying clusters at the high end of the redshift range considered (z = 0.75-1), with minimal contamination from low-mass groups. These characteristics make it ideal for identifying strongly lensed high-redshift supernovae and quasars that are powerful probes of cosmology, dark matter, and stellar astrophysics. As an example application of this cluster catalogue, we present a catalogue of candidate wide-angle strongly-lensed quasars in Appendix C. The five best candidates identified from this sample include two known lensed quasar systems and a possible changing-look lensed QSO with SDSS spectroscopy. All code and catalogues produced in this work are publicly available (see Data Availability).</description>

      <title>The IACOB project XII. A new grid of northern standards for the spectral classification of B-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advent of large spectroscopic surveys, automated stellar parameter determination has become commonplace. Nevertheless, spectral classification still offers a quick and useful alternative for obtaining parameter estimates for large samples of spectra of varying quality. We present a new atlas of stellar spectra covering the B-type range, with the intention of providing detailed classification criteria valid for modern spectra and improving the grid of reliable standards. This new grid will be used in future works to provide classification criteria beyond the classical classification range and addressing, in particular, the use of Gaia/RVS spectra. We analysed historical standards by means of multiple high-resolution spectra, marking out problematic cases and complementing the grid with a new set of reliable comparators. We then elaborated on a new set of classification criteria based on high-quality R=4000 spectra. Our new classification grid is much thicker than any previous set of standards, presenting a high degree of self-consistency. Although it is based entirely on morphological criteria, the grid demonstrates a much better correlation with different physical parameters. The new grid can be used to study classification criteria in other spectral ranges, providing a valuable tool for the study of B-type stars that covers a very wide range of temperatures, luminosities, and stellar masses. The very process of classification also offers valuable insights into stellar evolution.</description>

      <title>Mildly Super-Eddington Accretion Onto Slowly-Spinning Black Holes Explains the X-Ray Weakness of the Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: JWST has revealed a population of low-luminosity AGN at $z&gt;4$ in compact, red hosts (the "Little Red Dots", or LRDs), which are largely undetected in X-rays. We investigate this phenomenon using GRRMHD simulations of super-Eddington accretion onto a SMBH with $M_\bullet=10^7 \,\rm M_\odot$ at $z\sim6$, representing the median population; the SEDs that we obtain are intrinsically X-ray weak. The highest levels of X-ray weakness occur in SMBHs accreting at mildly super-Eddington rates ($1.4&lt;f_{\rm Edd}&lt;4$) with zero spin, viewed at angles $&gt;30^\circ$ from the pole. X-ray bolometric corrections in the observed $2-10$ keV band reach $\sim10^4$ at $z=6$, $\sim5$ times higher than the highest constraint from X-ray stacking. Most SEDs are extraordinarily steep and soft in the X-rays (median photon index $\Gamma=3.1$, mode of $\Gamma=4.4$). SEDs strong in the X-rays have harder spectra with a high-energy bump when viewed near the hot ($&gt;10^8$ K) and highly-relativistic jet, whereas X-ray weak SEDs lack this feature. Viewing a SMBH within $10^\circ$ of its pole, where beaming enhances the X-ray emission, has a $\sim1.5\%$ probability, matching the LRD X-ray detection rate. Next-generation observatories like AXIS will detect X-ray weak LRDs at $z\sim6$ from any viewing angle. Although many SMBHs in the LRDs are already estimated to accrete at super-Eddington rates, our model explains $50\%$ of their population by requiring that their masses are overestimated by a mere factor of $\sim3$. In summary, we suggest that LRDs host slowly spinning SMBHs accreting at mildly super-Eddington rates, with large covering factors and broad emission lines enhanced by strong winds, providing a self-consistent explanation for their X-ray weakness and complementing other models.</description>

      <title>ExoMol line lists -- LX. Molecular line list for the ammonia isotopologue $^{15}$NH$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A theoretical line list for $^{15}$NH$_3$ CoYuTe-15 is presented based on the empirical potential energy and ab initio dipole moments surfaces developed and used for the production of the ExoMol line list CoYuTe for $^{14}$NH$_3$. The ro-vibrational energy levels and wavefunctions are computed using the variational program TROVE. The line list ranges up to 10000 cm$^{-1}$ ($\lambda \geq 1$ $\mu$m) and contains 929 795 249 transitions between 1 269 961 states with $J\le 30$. The line list should be applicable for temperatures up to $\sim$1000 K. To improve the accuracy of the line positions, a set of experimentally-derived energy levels of $^{15}$NH$_3$ is produced using the MARVEL procedure. To this end, 37 experimental sources of the line positions of $^{15}$NH$_3$ available in the literature are collected, combined and systematised to produce a self-consistent spectroscopic network of 21095 $^{15}$NH$_3$ transitions covering 40 vibrational bands ranging up to 6818 cm$^{-1}$ and resulting in 2777 energy term values. These MARVEL energies are then used to replace the theoretical values in the CoYuTe-15 line list and also complemented by pseudo-MARVEL energies obtained by an isotopologue extrapolation using the previously reported MARVEL energies of the $^{14}$NH$_3$ parent isotopologue of ammonia. A list of 53856 high resolution transitions between MARVEL states and theoretical intensities is provided in the HITRAN format. Comparison with the recent experimental spectra of $^{15}$NH$_3$ illustrate the potential of the line list for detections and as an efficient assistant in spectroscopic assignments. The line list is available from www.exomol.com.</description>
