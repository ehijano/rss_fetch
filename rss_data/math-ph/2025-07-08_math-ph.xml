      <title>Mixed dynamics from the classical and quantum ergodic hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the classical and quantum ergodic hierarchy, a framework for mixed systems with a phase space composed by two uncorrelated integrable and chaotic regions is presented. It provides some features of mixed systems connecting the intuitive notion of a mixed phase space with the mixing level of the ergodic hierarchy. The formalism is illustrated with the kicked rotator.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study semiclassical 1D Schr\"odinger operators with a power-like singularity at $0$. We show that WKB expansions can be extended on any interval of the form [h^{1-},b]. Using a different approximation near 0 and a matching procedure we obtain an asymptotic expansion for the Cauchy Data at 0 of such WKB solutions that involves non-integer powers of h.</description>

      <title>Moduli space of spin connections on three-dimensional homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we aim to classify and characterize the moduli space of homogeneous spin connections and homogeneous $SU(2)$ connections on three-dimensional Riemannian homogeneous spaces. An analysis of the topology of the associated moduli spaces reveals that they are finite-dimensional topological manifolds (possibly with boundary) possessing trivial homotopy groups.
  Owing to their deep connection with cosmological models in the Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi formulation of General Relativity, this study offers a mathematically rigorous interpretation of the Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi-Sen connection within a cosmological context. In particular, we show that a correct formulation of the theory relies crucially on identifying the moduli space of homogeneous spin connections, thereby emphasizing the essential role of the spin structure in ensuring consistency with the physical content of the theory.
  The favorable topological properties of these moduli spaces circumvent many of the usual difficulties associated with singularities and the definition of regular measures in Quantum Field Theory and Quantum Gravity. As a result, they provide a solid foundation for the rigorous implementation of quantum theory in the cosmological setting.</description>

      <title>A Homothetic Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the principle of local gauge invariance forms the bedrock of modern physics, the symmetry of scale invariance has traditionally been treated on a different footing. This paper develops a \emph{homothetic gauge theory} (HGT) that elevates local scale transformations to a genuine gauge symmetry, placing them within the same geometric framework as conventional interactions. We introduce a novel mathematical structure based on an extended vector bundle that linearizes the action of local scaling, allowing for the definition of a homothetic connection and a corresponding gauge-covariant field strength. When this formalism is applied to classical U(1) electromagnetism, the theory yields a generalized field-strength tensor that naturally incorporates both the standard Maxwell field and a new scalar partner field governing the local scale. The resulting dynamics, including modified conservation laws and wave equations, are shown to be fully consistent. As a significant physical application, this framework provides a compelling resolution to the classical problem of the infinite self-energy of a point charge. By modeling the source as a penalized Dirichlet boundary condition on a shrinking interface, we construct a non-singular electrostatic potential, thereby removing the divergence in a natural, geometric manner without introducing ad-hoc regularization schemes. The emergence of penalty terms due to essentially geometric transformations promises a physically meaningful theory, and encourages to re-examining the role of scale invariance in other areas of classical and quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>An explanation of the number or points and symmetries of starbursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starbursts are the light intensity patterns seen when small bright sources are looked at night, typically stars. Starburst shapes are produced when the presence of the eye's wave aberrations generates caustics (light concentration) at the retina. A fascinating, but never explained fact about starbursts is that they usually present a $p$-fold symmetry pattern. We provide a theoretical explanation of the number of points and symmetries of starbursts, based on the geometric and algebraic properties of the wave aberration function expressed as a Zernike polynomial expansion. Specifically, we investigate the number and distribution of saddle cusps of Gauss of the Hessian of the wave aberration function. We also establish the connections between those points with the symmetries and the number of starburst points. We found that starbursts are likely generated by axially symmetric dominated wave aberrations with some amount of non-axially symmetric terms. For instance, whereas a wave aberration with a dominant spherical aberration (Zernike polynomial $Z_4^{0}$) plus $Z_3^{3}$ may induce a $3$ points starburst with a $3$-fold symmetry, a wave aberration combining $Z_4^{0}$ and $Z_4^{4}$ may induce a $4$-fold symmetry starburst with $4$ or $8$ points.</description>

      <title>Unified Framework for Quantum Code Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code, it is sometimes necessary to modify the stabilizer code by adding an arbitrary number of physical qubits and parity checks. Motivations may include embedding a high-dimensional quantum low-density parity check (LDPC) code into finite-dimensional Euclidean space, or reducing the weights of an arbitrary CSS code. During this embedding, it is essential that the modified CSS code possesses an isomorphic set of logical qubits as the original CSS code. However, despite numerous explicit constructions, the conditions of when such a property holds true is not known in general. Therefore, using the language of homological algebra, we provide a unified framework that guarantees a natural isomorphism between the output and input codes. In particular, we explicitly show how previous works fit into our framework.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the space of solutions to the Ward identities associated with the WLZZ models. We mostly concentrate on the case of these models described by a two-matrix model with the cubic potential in one of the matrices. We study how this space of solutions can be described by the freedom in choosing integration contours in the matrix integral.</description>

      <title>Model-based study of a nanowire heating and dynamic axisymmetric necking by surface electromigration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axisymmetric solid-state necking of a single-crystal metallic nanowire in a thermal contact with a substrate and subjected to a surface electromigration current is accompanied by a local current crowding and a sharp rise of a resistivity of a wire material in a thinning neck. This results in a temperature spike at the neck, which feedback affects the necking via thermomigration and the temperature-dependent surface diffusivity of the adatoms. A model that incorporates these effects and couples the nonlinear dynamics of a wire temperature and a wire radius for a necking wire is presented. Conditions on the physical parameters are derived that ensure a straight wire is in the solid state prior to an onset of a morphological instability that ultimately breaks a wire via a pinch-off. The impacts of a wire radius and a wire length on the temperature spike at the break junction are studied.</description>

      <title>Approximate direct and inverse scattering for the AKNS system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the direct and inverse scattering problems for the AKNS (Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur) system. New representations for the Jost solutions are obtained in the form of the power series in terms of a transformed spectral parameter. In terms of that parameter, the Jost solutions are convergent power series in corresponding unit disks. For the coefficients of the series simple recurrent integration procedures are devised. Solution of the direct scattering problem reduces to computing the coefficients and locating zeros of corresponding analytic functions in the interior of the unit disk. Solution of the inverse scattering problem reduces to the solution of two systems of linear algebraic equations for the power series coefficients, while the potentials are recovered from the first coefficients. The overall approach leads to a simple and efficient method for the numerical solution of both direct and inverse scattering problems, which is illustrated by numerical examples.</description>

      <title>PINNs Study for the Bekki-Nozaki Chaos in the Non-linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study chaotic behavior in the forced dissipative non-linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, so called the Bekki-Nozaki equation. Chaotic systems are often seen in a strong sensitivity to initial conditions,leading to error accumulation over time when traditional numerical methods are applied. To address this difficulty, we employ Physics-Informed Neural Networks(PINNs), a mesh-free deep learning framework. PINNs mitigate error accumulation in chaotic systems by solving partial differential equations without discretizing the computational domain. We demonstrate that PINNs successfully reproduce chaotic behavior of the Bekki-Nozaki equation. The results of the inverse analysis indicate a correlation between the governing equation's predictability and its chaotic nature of the solution.</description>

      <title>Mixed states for reference frames transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the concept of transformations among reference frames (classical or quantum). Usually transformations among classical reference frames have sharply defined parameters; geometrically they can be considered as pure states in the parameters' space, and they form a group. It is however possible that the distributions in the parameters' space are mixed state; such states form a semigroup. Similarly, transformations among quantum reference frames can be either pure or mixed. This gives rise to interesting consequences, in particular, the state of a system S can be pure with respect to a reference frame and mixed with respect to another. We argue that these nonpure transformations are natural, and give an application to the connections of time and (inverse) temperature for thermal states.</description>

      <title>On the detection of medium inhomogeneity by contrast agent: wave scattering models and numerical implementations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the wave scattering and inverse scattering in an inhomogeneous medium embedded a homogeneous droplet with a small size, which is modeled by a constant mass density and a small bulk modulus. Based on the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation for scattering wave in inhomogeneous medium, we firstly develop an efficient approximate scheme for computing the scattered wave as well as its far-field pattern for any droplet located in the inhomogeneous background medium. By establishing the approximate relation between the far-field patterns of the scattered wave before and after the injection of a droplet, the scattered wave of the inhomogeneous medium after injecting the droplet is represented by a measurable far-field patterns, and consequently the inhomogeneity of the medium can be reconstructed from the Helmholtz equation. Finally, the reconstruction process in terms of the dual reciprocity method is proposed to realize the numerical algorithm for recovering the bulk modulus function inside a bounded domain in three dimensional space, by moving the droplet inside the bounded domain. Numerical implementations are given using the simulation data of the far-field pattern to show the validity of the reconstruction scheme, based on the mollification scheme for dealing with the ill-posedness of this inverse problem.</description>

      <title>Gravitational radiation at infinity with negative cosmological constant and AdS$_4$ holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The covariant characterization of the existence of gravitational radiation traversing infinity $\mathscr{J}$ in the presence of a negative cosmological constant is presented. It is coherent and consistent with the previous characterizations put forward for the cases of non-negative cosmological constant, relying on the properties of the asymptotic super-Poynting vector; or in more transparent terms, based on the intrinsic properties of the flux of tidal energy at infinity. The proposed characterization is fully satisfactory, it can be covariantly typified in terms of boundary data at infinity, and it can also be categorized according to the geometric properties of the rescaled Weyl tensor at $\mathscr{J}$. The cases with no incoming radiation entering from (or no outgoing radiation escaping at) $\mathscr{J}$ can similarly be determined in terms of the boundary data or geometric properties of the rescaled Weyl tensor. In particular, we identify the most general boundary conditions that, in an initial-boundary value problem, ensure absence of gravitational radiation traversing $\mathscr{J}$: linear dependency between the Cotton-York tensor and the holographic stress tensor at $\mathscr{J}$. We also present novel conditions ensuring the absence of just incoming (outgoing) radiation at $\mathscr{J}$. These are given in a covariant way and also in terms of standard rescaled Weyl tensor scalars.</description>

      <title>Modular functors from conformal blocks of rational vertex operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a vertex operator algebra $V$, one may naturally define spaces of conformal blocks following a construction of Frenkel--Ben-Zvi generalized by Damiolini--Gibney--Tarasca. If $V$ is strongly rational, these spaces of conformal blocks form vector bundles over a suitable moduli space of algebraic curves. In this article, we establish, under the same assumptions, the widely expected topological result that the spaces of conformal blocks produce a modular functor, i.e. a modular algebra over an extension of the surface operad. This entails that the category $\mathcal{C}_V$ of admissible $V$-modules inherits from the topology a ribbon Grothendieck--Verdier structure that leads even to the structure of a modular fusion category whose structure comes directly from the spaces of conformal blocks of $V$. As a direct consequence, we prove that the modular functor from conformal blocks extends to a three-dimensional topological field theory and comes with a description in terms of factorization homology.</description>

The coefficients of the renormalization constant and the necessary auxiliary vertices are found, as well as the asymptotic expansions of all three-loop diagrams, and their dependence on the type of regularizing function. A comparison is also made with the standard case of cutoff in the momentum representation.</description>

      <title>On the Spectral Geometry and Small Time Mass of Anderson Models on Planar Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Anderson Hamiltonian (AH) and the parabolic Anderson model (PAM) with white noise and Dirichlet boundary condition on a bounded planar domain $D\subset\mathbb R^2$. We compute the small time asymptotics of the AH's exponential trace up to order $O(\log t)$, and of the PAM's mass up to order $O(t\log t)$. Our proof is probabilistic, and relies on the asymptotics of intersection local times of Brownian motions and bridges in $\mathbb R^2$. Applications of our main result include the following:
  (i) If the boundary $\partial D$ is sufficiently regular, then $D$'s area and $\partial D$'s length can both be recovered almost surely from a single observation of the AH's eigenvalues. This extends Mouzard's Weyl law in the special case of bounded domains (Ann. Inst. H. Poincar\'e Probab. Statist. 58(3): 1385-1425).
  (ii) If $D$ is simply connected and $\partial D$ is fractal, then $\partial D$'s Minkowski dimension (if it exists) can be recovered almost surely from the PAM's small time asymptotics.
  (iii) The variance of the white noise can be recovered almost surely from a single observation of the AH's eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of a noisy classical nonlinear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of simulating dynamics of classical nonlinear dissipative systems with $N\gg 1$ degrees of freedom. To make the problem tractable for quantum computers, we add a weak Gaussian noise to the equation of motion and the initial state. Our main result is an end-to-end quantum algorithm for simulating the noisy dynamics of nonlinear systems satisfying certain sparsity and divergence-free conditions. For any constant nonzero noise rate, the quantum runtime scales polynomially with $\log{(N)}$, evolution time, inverse error tolerance, and the relative strength of nonlinearity and dissipation. Our main technical tool is the Kolmogorov partial differential equation describing time evolution of scalar functions of solutions, averaged over noise. To enable efficient quantum simulation, we project the Kolmogorov equation onto the space of low degree polynomials and derive a rigorous upper bound on the resulting approximation error, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we show that the considered simulation problem is BQP-complete, meaning that it is as hard as simulating the universal quantum computer. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm by simulating it numerically for two paradigmatic nonlinear systems: an anharmonic oscillator and the 2D Navier Stokes equation.</description>

      <title>Unitary designs in nearly optimal depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct $\varepsilon$-approximate unitary $k$-designs on $n$ qubits in circuit depth $O(\log k \log \log n k / \varepsilon)$. The depth is exponentially improved over all known results in all three parameters $n$, $k$, $\varepsilon$. We further show that each dependence is optimal up to exponentially smaller factors. Our construction uses $\tilde{{O}}(nk)$ ancilla qubits and ${O}(nk)$ bits of randomness, which are also optimal up to $\log(n k)$ factors. An alternative construction achieves a smaller ancilla count $\tilde{{O}}(n)$ with circuit depth ${O}(k \log \log nk/\varepsilon)$. To achieve these efficient unitary designs, we introduce a highly-structured random unitary ensemble that leverages long-range two-qubit gates and low-depth implementations of random classical hash functions. We also develop a new analytical framework for bounding errors in quantum experiments involving many queries to random unitaries. As an illustration of this framework's versatility, we provide a succinct alternative proof of the existence of pseudorandom unitaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define and study a collection of matroid isomorphism games corresponding to various axiomatic characterizations of matroids. These are nonlocal games played between two cooperative players. Each game is played on two matroids, and the matroids are isomorphic if and only if the game has a perfect classical winning strategy. We define notions of quantum isomorphism in terms of perfect quantum commuting strategies, and we find a pair of nonisomorphic matroids that are quantum isomorphic. We also give a purely algebraic characterization of quantum isomorphic matroids. Finally, we use this notion of quantum isomorphism to describe a new type of quantum automorphism group of a matroid and derive a sufficient condition for a matroid to have nonclassical quantum automorphism.</description>

      <title>Error Exponents for Quantum Packing Problems via An Operator Layer Cake Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we prove a one-shot random coding bound for classical-quantum channel coding, a problem conjectured by Burnashev and Holevo in 1998. By choosing the optimal input distribution, we recover the optimal error exponent (i.e., the reliability function) of classical-quantum channels for rates above the critical rate. Our result extends to various quantum packing-type problems, including classical communication over any fully quantum channel with or without entanglement-assistance, constant composition codes, and classical data compression with quantum side information via fixed-length or variable-length coding.
  Our technical ingredient is to establish an operator layer cake theorem - the directional derivative of an operator logarithm admits an integral representation of certain projections. This shows that a kind of pretty-good measurement is equivalent to a randomized Holevo-Helstrom measurement, which provides an operational explanation of why the pretty-good measurement is pretty good.</description>

      <title>Crisanti-Sommers formula and simultaneous symmetry breaking in multi-species spherical spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.14791v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a rich history of expressing the limiting free energy of mean-field spin glasses as a variational formula over probability measures on $[0,1]$, where the measure represents the similarity (or "overlap") of two independently sampled spin configurations. At high temperatures, the formula's minimum is achieved at a measure which is a point mass, meaning sample configurations are asymptotically orthogonal up to a magnetic field correction. At low temperatures, though, a very different behavior emerges known as replica symmetry breaking (RSB). The deep wells in the energy landscape create more rigid structure, and the optimal overlap measure is no longer a point mass. The exact size of its support remains in many cases an open problem.
  Here we consider these themes for multi-species spherical spin glasses. Following a companion work in which we establish the Parisi variational formula, here we present this formula's Crisanti-Sommers representation. In the process, we gain new access to a problem unique to the multi-species setting. Namely, if RSB occurs for one species, does it necessarily occur for other species as well? We provide sufficient conditions for the answer to be yes. For instance, we show that if two species share any quadratic interaction, then RSB for one implies RSB for the other. Moreover, the level of symmetry breaking must be identical, even in cases of full RSB. In the presence of an external field, any type of interaction suffices.</description>

      <title>Effective Mass of the Fr\"ohlich Polaron and the Landau-Pekar-Spohn Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13058v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that there is a constant $\overline C\in (0,\infty)$ such that the effective mass $m(\alpha)$ of the Fr\"ohlich Polaron satisfies $m(\alpha) \geq \overline C \alpha^4$, which is sharp according to a long-standing prediction of Landau-Pekar [19] from 1948 and of Spohn [36] from 1987.
  The method of proof, which demonstrates how the sharp quartic divergence rate of $m(\alpha)$ appears in a natural way, is based on analyzing the Gaussian representation of the Polaron measure and that of the associated tilted Poisson point process developed in [26]. Additionally, our technique here leads to accompanying results including, 1) an explicit identification of local interval process from [26] in the strong coupling limit in terms of functionals of the Pekar process [27], 2) strict monotonicity of the effective mass $m(\alpha)$ for all $\alpha&gt;0$ and 3) the quartic divergence of $m(\alpha)$ for a generalized class of Polaron type interactions.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{U}(1)^{n}$ Chern-Simons theory: partition function, reciprocity formula and Chern-Simons duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\mathrm{U}(1)$ Chern-Simons theory can be extended to a topological $\mathrm{U}(1)^n$ theory by taking a combination of Chern-Simons and BF actions, the mixing being achieved with the help of a collection of integer coupling constants. Based on the Deligne-Beilinson cohomology, a partition function can then be computed for such a $\mathrm{U}(1)^n$ Chern-Simons theory. This partition function is clearly a topological invariant of the closed oriented $3$-manifold on which the theory is defined. Then, by applying a reciprocity formula a new expression of this invariant is obtained which should be a Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant. Finally, a duality between $\mathrm{U}(1)^n$ Chern-Simons theories is demonstrated.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by research in metamaterials, we consider the challenging problem of acoustic wave scattering by a doubly periodic quadrant of sound-soft scatterers arranged in a square formation, which we have dubbed the quarter lattice. This leads to a Wiener--Hopf equation in two complex variables with three unknown functions for which we can reduce and solve exactly using a new analytic method. After some suitable truncations, the resulting linear system is inverted using elementary matrix arithmetic and the solution can be numerically computed. This solution is also critically compared to a numerical least squares collocation approach and to our previous method where we decomposed the lattice into semi-infinite rows or columns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12483v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct the beta function in the functorial formulation of two-dimensional quantum field theories (FQFT). A key feature of this approach is the absence of ultraviolet divergences. We show that, nevertheless, in the FQFT perturbation theory, the local observables of deformed theories acquire logarithmic dimension, leading to a conformal anomaly. The beta function arises in the functorial approach as an infinitesimal transformation of the partition function under the variation of the metric's conformal factor, without ultraviolet divergences, UV cutoff, or the traditional renormalization procedure.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16403v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, as a continuation of [Fernandez-Guasti, \textit{Celest Mech Dyn Astron} 137, 4 (2025)], we demonstrate the maximal superintegrability of the reduced Hamiltonian, which governs the four-body choreographic planar motion along the trisectrix lima\c{c}on (resembling a folded figure eight), in the six-dimensional space of relative motion. The pairwise interaction potential $V(r_{ij})$ among the four bodies is a quadratic expression in the relative distances $r_{ij}$, with a combination of positive and negative coefficients. The corresponding eleven integrals of motion in the Liouville-Arnold sense are presented explicitly. Specifically, it is shown that the reduced Hamiltonian admits complete separation of variables in Jacobi-like variables. The emergence of this choreography is not a direct consequence of maximal superintegrability. Rather, it originates from the existence of \textit{particular integrals} and the phenomenon of \textit{particular involution}. We also provide a detailed analysis of the fragmentation of a general four-body choreographic motion into two isomorphic two-body choreographies, as well as the reverse process, namely, the fusion of two-body choreographies into a four-body configuration. This model combines choreographic motion with maximal superintegrability, a seldom-studied interplay in classical mechanics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eshelby's inclusion problems have been generalized to arbitrary shape of polygonal, polyhedral, and ellipsoidal inclusions embedded in an infinite isotropic domain under transient heat transfer, and Eshelby's tensors have been analytically derived to evaluate disturbed thermal fields caused by inclusions with a polynomial-form eigen-field. Transformed coordinates are applied to arbitrarily shaped inclusions for domain integrals of transient fundamental solutions. This formulation is for general transient heat transfer, and it can recover classic Eshelby's tensor for the ellipsoidal subdomain with explicit expression for the spherical domain in the steady state, Michelitsch's solution in the harmonic state, and recent solution in the transient state. The formulae for a polyhedral inclusion is verified by comparison to closed-form solutions of a spherical inclusion when the sphere is divided into many polyhedrons. The discontinuity of domain integrals for Eshelby's tensor are investigated the temporal effects are elaborated. The generalized formulation for Eshelby's problems enables the simulation and modeling of particulate composites containing inhomogeneities of various shapes for steady-state, harmonic and transient heat transfer in both two- and three-dimensional space through the equivalent inclusion method.</description>

      <title>Improved geometric and recollision estimates for the invariance principle of the random Lorentz gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By improving geometric recollision estimates for a random Lorentz gas, we extend the timescale $T(r)$ of the invariance principle for a Lorentz gas with particle size $r$ obtained by Lutsko and Toth (2020) from $\lim_{r \rightarrow 0} T(r) r^{2} |\log(r)|^2 =0$ to $\lim_{r \rightarrow 0} T(r) r^{2} |\log(r)| =0$. We show that this is the maximal reachable timescale with the coupling of stochastic processes introduced in the original result. In our improved geometric estimates we make use of the convexity of scatterers to obtain better dispersive estimates for the associated billiard map. We provide additional estimates which potentially open the possibility to reach, with a more elaborate coupling argument, up to timescales just below of $T(r)\sim r^{-2}$ when recollision patterns of arbitrary length occur.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the dissipative abelian sandpile model, we analyze the trajectories of a one-dimensional random walk in a landscape of soft traps. These traps, placed at increasing distances from each other, correspond to dissipative sites in the associated dissipative abelian sandpile model. We identify a critical growth rate of the sizes of intervals between successive traps where there is a transition between finiteness and non-finiteness of the expected survival time of the random walk. This corresponds to a transition between non-criticality and criticality of the associated dissipative abelian sandpile model. Therefore, in this setting, we thus identify precisely how much dissipation can be added to the original abelian sandpile model in order to disrupt its criticality.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.09341v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central question in resource theory is whether one can construct a set of monotones that completely characterise the allowed transitions dictated by a set of free operations. A similar question is whether two distinct sets of free operations generate the same class of transitions. These questions are part of the more general problem of whether it is possible to pass from one characterisation of a resource theory to another. In the present letter we prove that in the context of quantum resource theories this class of problems is undecidable in general. This is done by proving the undecidability of the membership problem for CPTP maps, which subsumes all the other results.</description>

      <title>Free energy in multi-species mixed $p$-spin spherical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.14790v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a Parisi formula for the limiting free energy of multi-species spherical spin glasses with mixed $p$-spin interactions. The upper bound involves a Guerra-style interpolation and requires a convexity assumption on the model's covariance function. Meanwhile, the lower bound adapts the cavity method of Chen so that it can be combined with the synchronization technique of Panchenko; this part requires no convexity assumption. In order to guarantee that the resulting Parisi formula has a minimizer, we formalize the pairing of synchronization maps with overlap measures so that the constraint set is a compact metric space. This space is not related to the model's spherical structure and can be carried over to other multi-species settings.</description>

      <title>Subcritical Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos in the Wiener Space: Construction, Moments and Volume Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.08996v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct and study properties of an infinite dimensional analog of Kahane's theory of Gaussian multiplicative chaos \cite{K85}. Namely, if $H_T(\omega)$ is a random field defined w.r.t. space-time white noise $\dot B$ and integrated w.r.t. Brownian paths in $d\geq 3$, we consider the renormalized exponential, weighted w.r.t. the Wiener measure $\mathbb P_0$. We construct the almost sure limit $\mu_\gamma$ in the {\it entire weak disorder (subcritical)} regime and call it {\it subcritical GMC} on the Wiener space. We show that $$ \mu_\gamma\Big\{\omega: \lim_{T\to\infty} \frac{H_T(\omega)}{T(\phi\star\phi)(0)} \ne \gamma\Big\}=0 \qquad \mbox{almost surely,} $$ meaning, $\mu_\gamma$ is supported only on $\gamma$-{\it thick paths}, and consequently, the normalized version is singular w.r.t. the Wiener measure. We characterize uniquely the limit $\mu_\gamma$ w.r.t. the mollification scheme $\phi$ in the sense of Shamov \cite{S14} and the random {\it rooted} measure $\mathbb Q_{\mu_\gamma}(d\dot B d\omega)= \mu_\gamma(d\omega,\dot B)P(d\dot B)$.
  We then determine the fractal properties of the measure around $\gamma$-thick paths: $-C_2 \leq \liminf_{r\to 0} r^2 \log \widehat\mu_\gamma(\|\omega\| &lt; r) \leq \limsup_{r\to 0}\sup_\eta r^2 \log \widehat\mu_\gamma(\|\omega-\eta \| &lt; r) \leq -C_1$ w.r.t a weighted norm $\|\cdot\|$. Here $C_1&gt;0$ and $C_2&lt;\infty$ are the uniform upper (resp. pointwise lower) H\"older exponents which are {\it explicit} in the entire weak disorder regime. Moreover, they converge to the scaling exponent of the Wiener measure as the disorder approaches zero. Finally, we establish negative and $L^p$ ($p&gt;1$) moments for the total mass of $\mu_\gamma$ in the weak disorder regime.</description>

      <title>Mott's law for the v.r.h. random resistor network and for Mott's random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06318v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mott's variable range hopping (v.r.h.) is the phonon-induced hopping of electrons in disordered solids (such as doped semiconductors) within the regime of strong Anderson localization. It was introduced by N.~Mott to explain the anomalous low temperature conductivity decay in dimension $d\geq 2$, corresponding now to the so called Mott's law. We provide a rigorous derivation of this Physics law for two effective models of Mott v.r.h.: the random resistor network for v.r.h. of \cite[Section~IV]{AHL} and Mott's random walk. We also determine the constant multiplying the power of the inverse temperature in the exponent in Mott's law, which was an open problem also on a heuristic level.</description>

      <title>The Structure of the Majorana Clifford Group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum information science, Clifford operators and stabilizer codes play a central role for systems of qubits (or qudits). In this paper, we study their analogues for systems composed of Majorana fermions. In this case, a crucial role is played by fermion parity symmetry, which is an unbreakable symmetry present in any system with fundamentally fermionic degrees of freedom. We prove that the subgroup of parity-preserving Majorana Cliffords can be represented by the orthogonal group over the binary field $\F$, and we show how it can be generated by braiding operators and used to construct any (even-parity) Majorana stabilizer code. We also analyze the frame potential for this so-called p-Clifford group when acting on a fixed-parity sector of the Hilbert space, proving that it is equivalent to the frame potential of the ordinary Clifford group acting on the same sector.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological quantum mechanics I: phenomenology of quantum observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14410v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an exercise in which one attempts to deduce the formalism of quantum mechanics solely from phenomenological observations. The only assumed inputs are obtained through sequential probing of quantum systems; no presuppositions about the underlying mathematical structures are permitted. We demonstrate that it is indeed possible to derive, on this basis, a complete and fully functional formalism rooted in the structures of Hilbert spaces. However, the resulting formalism--the bi-trajectory formalism--differs significantly from the standard state-focused formulation. In Part I of the paper, we analyze the outcomes of various experiments involving sequential measurements of quantum observables. These outcomes are quantitatively described by phenomenological multi-time probability distributions, estimated from experimental data. Our first conclusion is that the theory describing these experiments must be non-classical: the measured sequences cannot be interpreted as sampling of a uni-trajectory representing the system's observable. The non-classical nature of the investigated systems manifests in a range of observed phenomena, including quantum interference, the quantum Zeno effect, and uncertainty relations between the measured observables.</description>

      <title>The transition from homeostasis to stochasticity induced catastrophe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17414v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What are the signatures of the onset of catastrophe? Here we present the rich system physics characterizing the transition from homeostasis to stochasticity driven breakdown in an experimentally motivated minimal model. Recent high-precision experiments on individual bacterial cells, growing and dividing repeatedly in a variety of environments, have revealed a previously unknown intergenerational scaling law which not only uniquely determines the stochastic map governing homeostasis, but also, as we show here, offers quantitative insights into the transition from the "conspiracy principle" regime (homeostasis) to the "catastrophe principle" regime and then to system breakdown. In fact, upon closer examination, the stochastic map turns out to be a one-dimensional Kesten process; these transitions occur as a single parameter, the strength of the multiplicative noise term, is continuously tuned. Emergence of asymptotically scale invariant distributions with quantifiable power law tails, outlier driven extremal behavior and reverse monotonicity of the conditional exceedance distribution characterize this transition to catastrophe. In turn, prevention of rapid increase in the extremal event-driven rate of failure, in the interest of system preservation, causes the catastrophe regime to be strategically unfavorable.</description>

      <title>3d SUSY enhancement and non-semisimple TQFTs from four dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been recently shown that the celebrated SCFT$_4$/VOA$_2$ correspondence can be bridged via three-dimensional field theories arising from a specific R-symmetry twisted circle reduction. We apply this twisted reduction to the $(A_1,A_{n})$ and $(A_1,D_{n})$ families of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ Argyres-Douglas SCFTs using their $\mathcal{N}=1$ Agarwal-Maruyoshi-Song Lagrangians. From $(A_1,A_{2n})$ we derive the Gang-Kim-Stubbs family of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories with SUSY enhancement to $\mathcal{N}=4$ in the infrared, generalizing a recent derivation made in the special cases $n=1,2$. Topological twists of these theories are known to yield $semisimple$ TQFTs supporting $rational$ VOAs on holomorphic boundaries. From $(A_1,A_{2n-1})$, $(A_1,D_{2n+1})$, and $(A_1,D_{2n})$, we obtain three new infinite families of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ abelian gauge theories, all with monopole superpotentials, flowing to $\mathcal{N}=4$ SCFTs without Coulomb branch, but with the same non-trivial Higgs branch as the four-dimensional parent. Their topological A-twist yields $non$-$semisimple$ TQFTs related to $logarithmic$ VOAs such as $\widehat{\mathfrak{su}}(2)_{-4/3}$.</description>

      <title>Rational solutions of Painlev\'e V from Hankel determinants and the asymptotics of their pole locations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the asymptotic behaviour of the poles of certain rational solutions of the fifth Painlev\'e equation. These solutions are constructed by relating the corresponding tau function with a Hankel determinant of a certain sequence of moments. This approach was also used by one of the authors and collaborators in the study of the rational solutions of the second Painlev\'e equation. More specifically we study the roots of the corresponding polynomial tau function, whose location corresponds to the poles of the associated rational solution. We show that, upon suitable rescaling, the roots fill a well-defined region bounded by analytic arcs when the degree of the polynomial tau function tends to infinity. Moreover we provide an approximate location of these roots within the region in terms of suitable quantization conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish new explicit connections between classical (scalar) and matrix Gegenbauer polynomials, which result in new symmetries of the latter and further give access to several properties that have been out of reach before: generating functions, distribution of zeros for individual entries of the matrices and new type of differential-difference structure. We further speculate about other potentials of the connection formulas found. Part of our proofs makes use of creative telescoping in a matrix setting$-$the strategy which is not yet developed algorithmically.</description>

      <title>On Cauchy problem to the modified Camassa-Holm equation: Painlev\'{e} asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Painlev\'{e} asymptotics for the Cauchy problem of the modified Camassa-Holm (mCH) equation with decaying initial data \begin{align*}\nonumber &amp;m_t+\left((u^2-u_x^2)m\right)_x+\kappa u_{x}=0, \ (x,t)\in\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^+,\\ &amp;u(x,0)=u_0(x), \end{align*} where $u_0(x)\in H^{4,2}(\mathbb{R})$ and $\kappa$ is a constant. Recently, Yang and Fan (Adv. Math. 402 (2022) 108340) reported the long-time asymptotic results for the mCH equation in the different solitonic regions. The main purpose of our work is to study the asymptotic behavior of the mCH equation in the transition regions, which are the critical regions between the different solitonic regions. The key is to establish a connection between the solution for the Cauchy problem of the mCH equation in the transition region and the Painlev\'{e} II equation. With the $\bar{\partial}$-generalization of the Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method and double scaling limit technique, in two transition regions defined by \begin{align}\nonumber \mathcal{P}_{I}:=\{(x,t):0\leqslant \left|\frac{x}{t}-2\right|t^{2/3}\leqslant C\},~~~~\mathcal{P}_{II}:=\{(x,t):0\leqslant \left|\frac{x}{t}+1/4\right|t^{2/3}\leqslant C\}, \end{align} where $C&gt;0$ is a constant, we obtain that the leading order approximation to the solution of the mCH equation can be expressed in terms of the Painlev\'{e} II equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that types of bracket-generating distributions lead to new classes of Lie systems with compatible geometric structures. Specifically, the $n$-trailer system is analysed, showing that its associated distribution is related to a Lie system if $n = 0$ or $n = 1$. These systems allow symmetry reductions and the reconstruction of solutions of the original system from those of the reduced one. The reconstruction procedure is discussed and indicates potential extensions for studying broader classes of differential equations through Lie systems and new types of superposition rules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01415v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the relation of the super Macdonald polynomials and the BPS state counting on the blow-up of $\mathbb{P}^2$, which is mathematically described by framed stable perverse coherent sheaves. Fixed points of the torus action on the moduli space of BPS states are labeled by super partitions. From the equivariant character of the tangent space at the fixed points we can define the Nekrasov factor for a pair of super partitions, which is used for the localization computation of the partition function. The Nekrasov factor also allows us to compute matrix elements of the action of the quantum toroidal algebra of type $\mathfrak{gl}_{1|1}$ on the $K$ group of the moduli space. We confirm that these matrix elements are consistent with the Pieri rule of the super Macdonald polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In supersymmetric theories, protected quantities can be reorganized into holomorphic-topological theories by twisting. Recently, it was observed by \cite{JKY} that residual super-Poincar\'e symmetries in certain twisted theories can receive higher corrections, turning them into $L_\infty$ algebras with non-strict actions on the twisted fields. In this note, we show that the same phenomenon occurs for the two admissible twists of eleven-dimensional supergravity. Along the way, we discuss in detail the connection between components of physical and twisted fields.</description>

      <title>Random Flights and Anomalous Diffusion: A Non-Markovian Take on Lorentz Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Lorentz processes in two different settings. Both cases are characterized by infinite expectation of the free-flight times, contrary to what happens in the classical Gallavotti-Spohn models. Under a suitable Boltzmann-Grad type scaling limit, they converge to non-Markovian random-flight processes with superdiffusive behavior. A further scaling limit yields another non Markovian process, i.e., a superdiffusion obtained by a suitable time-change of Brownian motion. Furthermore, we obtain the governing equations for our random flights and anomalous diffusion, which represent a non-local counterpart for the linear-Boltzmann and diffusion equations arising in the classical theory. It turns out that these equations have the form of fractional kinetic equations in both time and space. To prove these results, we develop a technique based on mixtures of Feller semigroups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this review and methodological article we discuss the main ideas of the integral invariants theory. This theory was originated by Poincare and Cartan. We show how ideas of this theory connect such a different fields of mathematical physics as Hamiltonian dynamics, optics and hydrodynamics. We focus our attention on the results that are rarely expounded in the literature.</description>

      <title>The windowed quadratic phase Fourier transform: structure, convolution theorem and application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The windowed quadratic phase Fourier transform (WQPFT) combines the localization capabilities of windowed transforms with the phase modulation structure of the quadratic phase Fourier transform (QPFT). This paper investigates fundamental properties of the WQPFT, including linearity, shifting, modulation, conjugation, and symmetry. In addition, we derive the reproducing kernel, establish a reconstruction formula, and characterize the range of the transform. Convolution theorems in both the spectral and spatial domains are developed, along with the existence results and norm estimates for the convolution operation associated with the WQPFT. Finally, as an application, the solution of a convolution equation is given using the convolution theorem of the WQPFT.</description>

      <title>The quantum Ramsey numbers $QR(2,k)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Operator systems of matrices can be viewed as quantum analogues of finite graphs. This analogy suggests many natural combinatorial questions in linear algebra. We determine the quantum Ramsey numbers $QR(2,k)$ and the lower quantum Tur\'an numbers $T^\downarrow(n, m)$ with $m \geq n/4$. In particular, we conclude that $QR(2,2) = 4$ and confirm Weaver's conjecture that $T^\downarrow(4, 1) = 4$. We also obtain a new result for the existence of anticliques in quantum graphs of low dimension.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological quantum mechanics II: deducing the formalism from experimental observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an exercise in which one attempts to deduce the formalism of quantum mechanics solely from phenomenological observations. The only assumed inputs are the multi-time probability distributions estimated from the results of sequential measurements of quantum observables; no presuppositions about the underlying mathematical structures are permitted. In the concluding Part II of the paper, we carry out the deduction of the formalism from the phenomenological inputs described in Part I. We show that the resulting formalism exhibits an affinity with Hilbert spaces, and we derive an explicit representation in terms of those mathematical structures. Analogues of the obtained elementary building blocks -- such as projection operators -- are readily identifiable within the standard formalism. However, once these building blocks are assembled according to the blueprint of the deduced bi-trajectory formalism, it becomes evident that the new and the standard formalisms differ substantially at the conceptual level. These differences do not negate the fact that both formalisms are in perfect agreement with respect to empirically testable predictions. Rather, the emergence of a novel, non-standard formulation should be seen as a relatively rare opportunity to reassess, from a fresh perspective, some of the long-standing foundational issues in the theory. The hope is that the new approach may prove more successful in addressing problems that have resisted resolution within the established theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Paired Explicit Relaxation Runge-Kutta Methods: Entropy-Conservative and Entropy-Stable High-Order Optimized Multirate Time Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present novel entropy-conservative and entropy-stable multirate Runge-Kutta methods based on Paired Explicit Runge-Kutta (P-ERK) schemes with relaxation for conservation laws and related systems of partial differential equations. Optimized schemes up to fourth-order of accuracy are derived and validated in terms of order of consistency, conservation of linear invariants, and entropy conservation/stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these P-ERRK methods when combined with a high-order, entropy-conservative/stable discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method on unstructured meshes. The Paired Explicit Relaxation Runge-Kutta methods(P-ERRK) are readily implemented for partitioned semidiscretizations arising from problems with equation-based scale separation such as non-uniform meshes. We highlight that the relaxation approach acts as a time-limiting technique which improves the nonlinear stability and thus robustness of the multirate schemes. The P-ERRK methods are applied to a range of problems, ranging from compressible Euler over compressible Navier-Stokes to the visco-resistive magnetohydrodynamics equations in two and three spatial dimensions. For each test case, we compare computational load and runtime to standalone relaxed Runge-Kutta methods which are outperformed by factors up to four. All results can be reproduced using a publicly available repository.</description>
