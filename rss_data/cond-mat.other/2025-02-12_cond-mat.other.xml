      <title>Does Entanglement Correlation in Ground State Guarantee Quantum Energy Teleportation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although extraction of energy from the ground state is forbidden, one can utilize Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET) protocol for energy extraction -- a two-step protocol involving quantum measurements followed by LOCC. This is an unique method to ``extract energy from ground states'' of quantum systems. QET requires some correlation in the ground state, and entanglement correlation plays a crucial roles as a resource. The general belief is that if the ground state is quantum-correlated via entanglement for two different sites in a quantum system, and if we perform measurements on one of the sites, we can find an LOCC for the other site to successfully accomplish QET. In this paper, we show that this belief may not be true in the case of the Toric Code. We demonstrate this by performing a PVM measurements on spins in the Toric Code. Based on the measurement outcomes, we found that there is no LOCC for successful QET.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Secondary and Backscattered Electron Energy Spectra and Yields Analysis: from Theory to Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07521v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, experimental microscopy and spectroscopy have made significant progress in the study of the morphological, optical, electronic and transport properties of materials. These developments include higher spatial resolution, shorter acquisition times, more efficient monochromators and electron analysers, improved contrast imaging and advancements in sample preparation techniques. These advances have driven the need for more accurate theoretical descriptions and predictions of material properties. Computer simulations based on first principles and Monte Carlo methods have emerged as a rapidly growing field for modeling the interaction of charged particles, such as electron, proton and ion beams, with various systems, such as slabs, nanostructures and crystals. This report delves into the theoretical and computational approaches to modeling the physico-chemical mechanisms that occur when charged beams interact with a medium. These mechanisms encompass single and collective electronic excitation, ionization of the target atoms and the generation of a secondary electron cascade that deposits energy into the irradiated material. We show that the combined application of ab initio methods, which are able to model the dynamics of interacting many-fermion systems, and Monte Carlo methods, which capture statistical fluctuations in energy loss mechanisms by random sampling, proves to be an optimal strategy for the accurate description of charge transport in solids. This joint quantitative approach enables the theoretical interpretation of excitation, loss and secondary electron spectra, the analysis of the chemical composition and dielectric properties of solids and contributes to our understanding of irradiation-induced damage in materials, including those of biological significance.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh interfacial thermal conductance for cooling gallium oxide electronics using cubic boron arsenide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gallium oxide (Ga$_2$O$_3$) has attracted significant interest for its unique potential especially in power electronics. However, its low and anisotropic thermal conductivity poses a major challenge for heat dissipation. Here, we explore an effective cooling strategy centering on the heterogeneous integration of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ devices with cubic boron arsenide (cBAs), an emerging material with an ultrahigh thermal conductivity $\kappa$ of ~1300 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$. Machine-learned potentials for representative $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$/cBAs interfaces are trained, enabling accurate and efficient calculation of the interfacial thermal conductance $G$ via nonequilibrium molecular dynamics. At 300 K, remarkable $G$ values of 749$\pm$33 MWm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$ and 824$\pm$35 MWm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$ are predicted for Ga-As and O-B bonding across the interface, respectively, which are primarily attributed to the well-matched phonon density of states considering the similar Debye temperatures of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and cBAs. Moreover, finite-element simulations directly show a notable device temperature reduction when comparing cBAs with other substrates. The simultaneously ultrahigh $\kappa$ and $G$ highlight cBAs as an ideal substrate for Ga$_2$O$_3$ electronics.</description>
