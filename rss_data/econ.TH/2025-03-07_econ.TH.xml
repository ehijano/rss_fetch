      <title>Kuhn's Theorem for Games of the Extensive Form with Unawareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend Kuhn's Theorem to games of the extensive form with unawareness. This extension is not obvious: First, games of the extensive form with non-trivial unawareness involve a forest of partially ordered game trees rather than just one game tree. An information set at a node in one tree may consist of nodes in a less expressive tree. Consequently, perfect recall takes a more complicated form as players may also become aware of new actions during the play. Second, strategies can only be partially an object of ex ante choice in games with unawareness. Finally, nodes that a player may expect to reach with a strategy profile may not be the nodes that actually occur with this strategy profile, requiring us to define appropriate notions of equivalence of strategies. We show if a game of the extensive form with unawareness has perfect recall, then for each mixed strategy there is an equivalent behavior strategy but the converse does not hold under unawareness.</description>

      <title>Control for Coalitions in Parliamentary Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The traditional election control problem focuses on the use of control to promote a single candidate. In parliamentary elections, however, the focus shifts: voters care no less about the overall governing coalition than the individual parties' seat count. This paper introduces a new problem: controlling parliamentary elections, where the goal extends beyond promoting a single party to influencing the collective seat count of coalitions of parties.
  We focus on plurality rule and control through the addition or deletion of parties. Our analysis reveals that, without restrictions on voters' preferences, these control problems are W[1]-hard. In some cases, the problems are immune to control, making such efforts ineffective.
  We then study the special case where preferences are symmetric single-peaked. We show that in the single-peaked setting, aggregation of voters into types allows for a compact representation of the problem. Our findings show that for the single-peaked setting, some cases are solvable in polynomial time, while others are NP-hard for the compact representation - but admit a polynomial algorithm for the extensive representation.</description>

      <title>You Are the Best Reviewer of Your Own Papers: The Isotonic Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.08149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) conferences including NeurIPS and ICML have experienced a significant decline in peer review quality in recent years. To address this growing challenge, we introduce the Isotonic Mechanism, a computationally efficient approach to enhancing the accuracy of noisy review scores by incorporating authors' private assessments of their submissions. Under this mechanism, authors with multiple submissions are required to rank their papers in descending order of perceived quality. Subsequently, the raw review scores are calibrated based on this ranking to produce adjusted scores. We prove that authors are incentivized to truthfully report their rankings because doing so maximizes their expected utility, modeled as an additive convex function over the adjusted scores. Moreover, the adjusted scores are shown to be more accurate than the raw scores, with improvements being particularly significant when the noise level is high and the author has many submissions -- a scenario increasingly prevalent at large-scale ML/AI conferences.
  We further investigate whether submission quality information beyond a simple ranking can be truthfully elicited from authors. We establish that a necessary condition for truthful elicitation is that the mechanism be based on pairwise comparisons of the author's submissions. This result underscores the optimality of the Isotonic Mechanism, as it elicits the most fine-grained truthful information among all mechanisms we consider. We then present several extensions, including a demonstration that the mechanism maintains truthfulness even when authors have only partial rather than complete information about their submission quality. Finally, we discuss future research directions, focusing on the practical implementation of the mechanism and the further development of a theoretical framework inspired by our mechanism.</description>

      <title>The reference interval in higher-order stochastic dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15401v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given two random variables taking values in a bounded interval, we study whether one dominates the other in higher-order stochastic dominance depends on the reference interval in the model setting. We obtain two results. First, the stochastic dominance relations get strictly stronger when the reference interval shrinks if and only if the order of stochastic dominance is larger than three. Second, for mean-preserving stochastic dominance relations, the reference interval is irrelevant if and only if the difference between the degree of the stochastic dominance and the number of moments is no larger than three. These results highlight complications arising from using higher-order stochastic dominance in economic applications.</description>
