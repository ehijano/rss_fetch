      <title>Spatio-Temporal Communication Compression for Distributed Prime-Dual Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, for the problem of distributed computing, we propose a general spatio-temporal compressor and discuss its compression methods. This compressor comprehensively considers both temporal and spatial information, encompassing many existing specific compressors. We use the average consensus algorithm as a starting point and further studies distributed optimization algorithms, the Prime-Dual algorithm as an example, in both continuous and discrete time forms. We find that under stronger additional assumptions, the spatio-temporal compressor can be directly applied to distributed computing algorithms, while its default form can also be successfully applied through observer-based differential compression methods, ensuring the linear convergence of the algorithm when the objective function is strongly convex. On this basis, we also discuss the acceleration of the algorithm, filter-based compression methods in the literature, and the addition of randomness to the spatio-temporal compressor. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the generality of the spatio-temporal compressor, compare different compression methods, and verify the algorithm's performance in the convex objective function scenario.</description>

      <title>Rationalising data collection for building energy systems using Value of Information Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of data collection to support decision making through the reduction of uncertainty is ubiquitous in the management, operation, and design of building energy systems. However, no existing studies in the building energy systems literature have quantified the economic benefits of data collection strategies to determine whether they are worth their cost. This work demonstrates that Value of Information analysis (VoI), a Bayesian Decision Analysis framework, provides a suitable methodology for quantifying the benefits of data collection. Three example decision problems in building energy systems are studied: air-source heat pump maintenance scheduling, ventilation scheduling for indoor air quality, and ground-source heat pump system design. Smart meters, occupancy monitoring systems, and ground thermal tests are shown to be economically beneficial for supporting these decisions respectively. It is proposed that further study of VoI in building energy systems would allow expenditure on data collection to be economised and prioritised, avoiding wastage.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Impact of Multiple DER Aggregators on Wholesale Energy Markets: A Hybrid Mean Field Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into wholesale energy markets can greatly enhance grid flexibility, improve market efficiency, and contribute to a more sustainable energy future. As DERs -- such as solar PV panels and energy storage -- proliferate, effective mechanisms are needed to ensure that small prosumers can participate meaningfully in these markets. We study a wholesale market model featuring multiple DER aggregators, each controlling a portfolio of DER resources and bidding into the market on behalf of the DER asset owners. The key of our approach lies in recognizing the repeated nature of market interactions the ability of participants to learn and adapt over time. Specifically, Aggregators repeatedly interact with each other and with other suppliers in the wholesale market, collectively shaping wholesale electricity prices (aka the locational marginal prices (LMPs)). We model this multi-agent interaction using a mean-field game (MFG), which uses market information -- reflecting the average behavior of market participants -- to enable each aggregator to predict long-term LMP trends and make informed decisions. For each aggregator, because they control the DERs within their portfolio under certain contract structures, we employ a mean-field control (MFC) approach (as opposed to a MFG) to learn an optimal policy that maximizes the total rewards of the DERs under their management. We also propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method to help each agent learn optimal strategies within the MFG framework, enhancing their ability to adapt to market conditions and uncertainties. Numerical simulations show that LMPs quickly reach a steady state in the hybrid mean-field approach. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the combination of energy storage and mean-field learning significantly reduces price volatility compared to scenarios without storage.</description>

      <title>Improving the Region of Attraction of a Multi-rotor UAV by Estimating Unknown Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a machine learning-aided approach to accurately estimate the region of attraction (ROA) of a multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) controlled using a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller. Conventional ROA estimation approaches rely on a nominal dynamic model for ROA calculation, leading to inaccurate estimation due to unknown dynamics and disturbances associated with the physical system. To address this issue, our study utilizes a neural network to predict these unknown disturbances of a planar quadrotor. The nominal model integrated with the learned disturbances is then employed to calculate the ROA of the planer quadrotor using a graphical technique. The estimated ROA is then compared with the ROA calculated using Lyapunov analysis and the graphical approach without incorporating the learned disturbances. The results illustrated that the proposed method provides a more accurate estimation of the ROA, while the conventional Lyapunov-based estimation tends to be more conservative.</description>

      <title>Characterizing nonlinear systems with mixed input-output properties through dissipation inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems that show different characteristics, such as finite-gain and passivity, depending on the nature of the inputs, are said to possess mixed input-output properties. In this paper, we provide a constructive method for characterizing mixed input-output properties of nonlinear systems using a dissipativity framework. Our results take inspiration from the generalized Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov lemma, and show that a system is ``mixed'' if it is dissipative with respect to highly specialized supply rates. The mixed input-output characterization is used for assessing stability of feedback interconnections in which the feedback components violate conditions of classical results such as the small-gain and passivity theorem, thereby significantly relaxing the results. We highlight applicability of the results through various examples, and provide connections with other input-output characterizations such as scaled graphs.</description>

      <title>The Dilemma of Electricity Grid Expansion Planning in Areas at the Risk of Wildfire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The utilities consider public safety power shut-offs imperative for the mitigation of wildfire risk. This paper presents expansion planning of power system under fire hazard weather conditions. The power lines are quantified based on the risk of fire ignition. A 10-year expansion planning scenario is discussed to supply power to customers by considering three decision variables: distributed solar generation; modification of existing power lines; addition of new lines. Two-stage robust optimization problem is formulated and solved using Column-and-Constraint Generation Algorithm to find improved balance among de-energization of customers, distributed solar generation, modification of power lines, and addition of new lines. It involves lines de-energization of high wildfire risk regions and serving the customers by integrating distributed solar generation. The impact of de-energization of lines on distributed solar generation is assessed. The number of hours each line is energized and total load shedding during a 10-year period is evaluated. Different uncertainty levels for system demand and solar energy integration are considered to find the impact on the total operation cost of the system. The effectiveness of the presented algorithm is evaluated on 6- and 118-bus systems.</description>

      <title>Facilitating AI and System Operator Synergy: Active Learning-Enhanced Digital Twin Architecture for Day-Ahead Load Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a synergistic approach between artificial intelligence and system operators through an innovative digital twin architecture, integrated with an active learning framework, to enhance short-term load forecasting. Central to this architecture is the incorporation of sophisticated data pipelines, facilitating the real-time ingestion, processing and analysis of grid-related data. Utilizing a recurrent neural network architecture, our model generates day-ahead load forecasts together with prediction confidence intervals, strengthening system operator trust in the model's predictive reliability and enhancing their ability to respond to evolving grid conditions effectively. The active learning framework iteratively refines the predictions by incorporating real-time feedback based on forecast uncertainty, utilizing newly available data to continuously enhance forecasting accuracy and confidence. This AI-assisted strategy is exemplified in a case study of the Greek transmission system. It demonstrates the potential to transform short-term load forecasting, thereby increasing the reliability and operational efficiency of modern power grids. This approach marks a significant step forward in the digitalization and intelligent management of power systems.</description>

      <title>Optimization-Based Control of Distributed Battery Storage in Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a combined global-local control approach to regulate voltage and minimize power losses in distribution networks with high integration of distributed energy resources (DERs). Local controllers embed the fast acting proportional volt-var-watt control law and have their gain (slope) coefficients updated regularly by a global optimization problem at a slower time-scale. Design of optimal coefficients preserve overall system stability and encapsulate inverter and energy limits of controllable DERs. The proposed approach is formulated based on a linear network model (LinDistFlow) and suitable approximations to produce a convex multi-period optimization formulation. Numerical simulations with real-world customer data and two different distribution feeders revealed that our approach provides substantial voltage regulation, while reducing losses by 11 per cent and peak substation power by 26 per cent compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Flexible Ramping Product Procurement in Day-Ahead Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible ramping products (FRPs) emerge as a promising instrument for addressing steep and uncertain ramping needs through market mechanisms. Initial implementations of FRPs in North American electricity markets, however, revealed several shortcomings in existing FRP designs. In many instances, FRP prices failed to signal the true value of ramping capacity, most notably evident in zero FRP prices observed in a myriad of periods during which the system was in acute need for rampable capacity. These periods were marked by scheduled but undeliverable FRPs, often calling for operator out-of-market actions. On top of that, the methods used for procuring FRPs have been primarily rule-based, lacking explicit economic underpinnings. In this paper, we put forth an alternative framework for FRP procurement, which seeks to set FRP requirements and schedule FRP awards such that the expected system operation cost is minimized. Using real world data from U.S. ISOs, we showcase the relative merits of the framework in (i) reducing the total system operation cost, (ii) improving price formation, (iii) enhancing the the deliverability of FRP awards, and (iv) reducing the need for out-of-market actions.</description>

      <title>Formal Verification and Control with Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this survey, we design formal verification and control algorithms for autonomous systems with practical safety guarantees using conformal prediction (CP), a statistical tool for uncertainty quantification. We focus on learning-enabled autonomous systems (LEASs) in which the complexity of learning-enabled components (LECs) is a major bottleneck that hampers the use of existing model-based verification and design techniques. Instead, we advocate for the use of CP, and we will demonstrate its use in formal verification, systems and control theory, and robotics. We argue that CP is specifically useful due to its simplicity (easy to understand, use, and modify), generality (requires no assumptions on learned models and data distributions, i.e., is distribution-free), and efficiency (real-time capable and accurate).
  We pursue the following goals with this survey. First, we provide an accessible introduction to CP for non-experts who are interested in using CP to solve problems in autonomy. Second, we show how to use CP for the verification of LECs, e.g., for verifying input-output properties of neural networks. Third and fourth, we review recent articles that use CP for safe control design as well as offline and online verification of LEASs. We summarize their ideas in a unifying framework that can deal with the complexity of LEASs in a computationally efficient manner. In our exposition, we consider simple system specifications, e.g., robot navigation tasks, as well as complex specifications formulated in temporal logic formalisms. Throughout our survey, we compare to other statistical techniques (e.g., scenario optimization, PAC-Bayes theory, etc.) and how these techniques have been used in verification and control. Lastly, we point the reader to open problems and future research directions.</description>

      <title>Review of meta-heuristic optimization algorithms to tune the PID controller parameters for automatic voltage regulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Proportional- Integral- Derivative (PID) controller is required to bring a system back to the stable operating region as soon as possible following a disturbance or discrepancy. For successful operation of the PID controller, it is necessary to design the controller parameters in a manner that will render low optimization complexity, less memory for operation, fast convergence, and should be able to operate dynamically. Recent investigations have postulated many different meta-heuristic algorithms for efficient tuning of PID controller under various system milieus. However, researchers have seldom compared their custom made objective functions with previous investigations while proposing new algorithmic methods. This paper focuses on a detailed study on the research progress, deficiency, accomplishment and future scopes of recently proposed heuristic algorithms to designing and tuning the PID controller parameters for an automatic voltage regulator (AVR) system. Objective functions, including ITSE, ITAE, IAE, ISE, and ZLG, are considered to enumerate a measurable outcome of the algorithms. Considering a slight variation in the sytem gain parameters of the algorithms, the observed PID gain with ITSE results in 0.81918 - 1.9499 for K_p, 0.24366 - 1.4608 for K_i, and 0.31840 - 0.9683 for K_d. Whereas with ITAE the values are 0.24420 - 1.2771, 0.14230 - 0.8471, and 0.04270 - 0.4775, respectively. The time domain and frequency domain characteristics also changes significantly with each objective function. Our outlined comparison will be a guideline for investigating any newer algorithms in the field.</description>

      <title>Learning and Control from Similarity Between Heterogeneous Systems: A Behavioral Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes basic definitions of similarity and similarity indexes between heterogeneous linear systems and presents a similarity-based learning control strategy. By exploring geometric properties of admissible behaviors of linear systems, the similarity indexes between two admissible behaviors of heterogeneous systems are defined as the principal angles between their subspace components, and an efficient strategy for calculating the similarity indexes is developed. By leveraging the similarity indexes, a similarity-based learning control strategy is proposed via projection techniques. With the application of the similarity-based learning control strategy, host system can efficiently accomplish the same tasks by leveraging the successful experience of guest system, without the necessity to repeat the trial-and-error process experienced by the guest system.</description>

      <title>CSAC Drift Modeling Considering GPS Signal Quality in the Case of GPS Signal Unavailability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Global Positioning System (GPS), one of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), provides accurate position, navigation and time (PNT) information to various applications. One of the application that is highly receiving attention is satellite vehicles, especially Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. Due to their limited ways to get PNT information and low performance of their onboard clocks, GPS system time (GPST) provided by GPS is a good reference clock to synchronize. However, GPS is well-known for its vulnerability to intentional or unintentional interference. This study aims to maintain the onboard clock with less error relative to the GPST even when the GPS signal is disrupted. In this study, we analyzed two major factors that affects the quality of the GPS measurements: the number of the visible satellites and the geometry of the satellites. Then, we proposed a weighted model for a Chip-Scale Atomic Clock (CSAC) that mitigates the clock error relative to the GPST while considering the two factors. Based on this model, a stand-alone CSAC could maintain its error less than 4 microseconds, even in a situation where no GPS signals are received for 12 hours.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we study a Networked Control System (NCS) with multiplexed communication and Bernoulli packet drops. Multiplexed communication refers to the constraint that transmission of a control signal and an observation signal cannot occur simultaneously due to the limited bandwidth. First, we propose an epsilon-greedy algorithm for the selection of the communication sequence that also ensures Mean Square Stability (MSS). We formulate the system as a Markovian Jump Linear System (MJLS) and provide the necessary conditions for MSS in terms of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) that need to be satisfied for three corner cases. We prove that the system is MSS for any convex combination of these three corner cases. Furthermore, we propose to use the epsilon-greedy algorithm with the epsilon that satisfies MSS conditions for training a Deep Q Network (DQN). The DQN is used to obtain an optimal communication sequence that minimizes a quadratic cost. We validate our approach with a numerical example that shows the efficacy of our method in comparison to the round-robin and a random scheme.</description>

      <title>Geometric Scaling Laws for Axial Flux Permanent Magnet Motors in In-Wheel Powertrain Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present geometric scaling models for axial flux motors (AFMs) to be used for in-wheel powertrain design optimization purposes. We first present a vehicle and powertrain model, with emphasis on the electric motor model. We construct the latter by formulating the analytical scaling laws for AFMs, based on the scaling concept of RFMs from the literature, specifically deriving the model of the main loss component in electric motors: the copper losses. We further present separate scaling models of motor parameters, losses and thermal models, as well as the torque limits and cost, as a function of the design variables. Second, we validate these scaling laws with several experiments leveraging high-fidelity finite-element simulations. Finally, we define an optimization problem that minimizes the energy consumption over a drive cycle, optimizing the motor size and transmission ratio for a wide range of electric vehicle powertrain topologies. In our study, we observe that the all-wheel drive topology equipped with in-wheel AFMs is the most efficient, but also generates the highest material cost.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear PDE Constrained Optimal Dispatch of Gas and Power: A Global Linearization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coordinated dispatch of power and gas in the electricity-gas integrated energy system (EG-IES) is fundamental for ensuring operational security. However, the gas dynamics in the natural gas system (NGS) are governed by the nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE), making the dispatch problem of the EG-IES a complicated optimization model constrained by nonlinear PDE. To address it, we propose a globally linearized gas network model based on the Koopman operator theory, avoiding the commonly used local linearization and spatial discretization. Particularly, we propose a data-driven Koopman operator approximation approach for the globally linearized gas network model based on the extended dynamic mode decomposition, in which a physics-informed stability constraint is derived and embedded to improve the generalization ability and accuracy of the model. Based on this, we develop an optimal dispatch model for the EG-IES that first considers the nonlinear gas dynamics in the NGS. The case study verifies the effectiveness of this work. Simulation results reveal that the commonly used locally linearized gas network model fails to accurately capture the dynamic characteristics of NGS, bringing potential security threats to the system.</description>

      <title>Analyzing electric vehicle, load and photovoltaic generation uncertainty using publicly available datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to analyze three publicly available datasets for quantifying seasonal and annual uncertainty for efficient scenario creation. The datasets from Elaad, Elia and Fluvius are utilized to statistically analyze electric vehicle charging, normalized solar generation and low-voltage consumer load profiles, respectively. Frameworks for scenario generation are also provided for these datasets. The datasets for load profiles and solar generation analyzed are for the year 2022, thus embedding seasonal information. An online repository is created for the wider applicability of this work. Finally, the extreme load week(s) are identified and linked to the weather data measured at EnergyVille in Belgium.</description>

      <title>An Investigation of Denial of Service Attacks on Autonomous Driving Software and Hardware in Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research investigates the impact of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, specifically Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) flood attacks, on Autonomous Driving (AD) systems, focusing on their control modules. Two experimental setups were created: the first involved an ICMP flood attack on a Raspberry Pi running an AD software stack, and the second examined the effects of single and double ICMP flood attacks on a Global Navigation Satellite System Real-Time Kinematic (GNSS-RTK) device for high-accuracy localization of an autonomous vehicle that is available on the market. The results indicate a moderate impact of DoS attacks on the AD stack, where the increase in median computation time was marginal, suggesting a degree of resilience to these types of attacks. In contrast, the GNSS device demonstrated significant vulnerability: during DoS attacks, the sample rate dropped drastically to approximately 50% and 5% of the nominal rate for single and double attacker configurations, respectively. Additionally, the longest observed time increments were in the range of seconds during the attacks. These results underscore the vulnerability of AD systems to DoS attacks and the critical need for robust cybersecurity measures. This work provides valuable insights into the design requirements of AD software stacks and highlights that external hardware and modules can be significant attack surfaces.</description>

      <title>Performance-Aware Self-Configurable Multi-Agent Networks: A Distributed Submodular Approach for Simultaneous Coordination and Network Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the first, to our knowledge, rigorous approach that enables multi-agent networks to self-configure their communication topology to balance the trade-off between scalability and optimality during multi-agent planning. We are motivated by the future of ubiquitous collaborative autonomy where numerous distributed agents will be coordinating via agent-to-agent communication to execute complex tasks such as traffic monitoring, event detection, and environmental exploration. But the explosion of information in such large-scale networks currently curtails their deployment due to impractical decision times induced by the computational and communication requirements of the existing near-optimal coordination algorithms. To overcome this challenge, we present the AlterNAting COordination and Network-Design Algorithm (Anaconda), a scalable algorithm that also enjoys near-optimality guarantees. Subject to the agents' bandwidth constraints, Anaconda enables the agents to optimize their local communication neighborhoods such that the action-coordination approximation performance of the network is maximized. Compared to the state of the art, Anaconda is an anytime self-configurable algorithm that quantifies its suboptimality guarantee for any type of network, from fully disconnected to fully centralized, and that, for sparse networks, is one order faster in terms of decision speed. To develop the algorithm, we quantify the suboptimality cost due to decentralization, i.e., due to communication-minimal distributed coordination. We also employ tools inspired by the literature on multi-armed bandits and submodular maximization subject to cardinality constraints. We demonstrate Anaconda in simulated scenarios of area monitoring and compare it with a state-of-the-art algorithm.</description>

      <title>Terminal Soft Landing Guidance Law Using Analytic Gravity Turn Trajectory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative terminal landing guidance law that utilizes an analytic solution derived from the gravity turn trajectory. The characteristics of the derived solution are thoroughly investigated, and the solution is employed to generate a reference velocity vector that satisfies terminal landing conditions. A nonlinear control law is applied to effectively track the reference velocity vector within a finite time, and its robustness against disturbances is studied. Furthermore, the guidance law is expanded to incorporate ground collision avoidance by considering the shape of the gravity turn trajectory. The proposed method's fuel efficiency, robustness, and practicality are demonstrated through comprehensive numerical simulations, and its performance is compared with existing methods.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Global $\mathcal{K}$-exponential Tracking Control of Multiple Mobile Robots -- Extended Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the cooperative tracking control problem for multiple mobile robots over a directed communication network. First, it is shown that the closed-loop system is uniformly globally asymptotically stable under the proposed distributed continuous feedback control law, where an explicit strict Lyapunov function is constructed. Then, by investigating the convergence rate, it is further proven that the closed-loop system is globally $\mathcal{K}$-exponentially stable. Moreover, to make the proposed control law more practical, the distributed continuous feedback control law is generalized to a distributed sampled-data feedback control law using the emulation approach, based on the strong integral input-to-state stable Lyapunov function. Numerical simulations are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control methods.</description>

      <title>LiDAR-Aided Millimeter-Wave Range Extension using a Passive Mirror Reflector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive reflectors mitigate millimeter-wave (mmwave) link blockages by extending coverage to non-line-ofsight (NLoS) regions. However, their deployment often leads to irregular reflected beam patterns and coverage gaps. This results in rapid channel fluctuations and potential outages. In this paper, we propose two LiDAR-aided link enhancement techniques to address these challenges. Leveraging user position information, we introduce a location-dependent link control strategy and a user selection technique to improve NLoS link reliability and coverage. Experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed techniques in reducing outages and enhancing NLoS signal strength.</description>

      <title>Design and Operation Principles of a Wave-Controlled Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Reflective Intelligent Surface (RIS) consists of many small reflective elements whose reflection properties can be adjusted to change the wireless propagation environment. Envisioned implementations require that each RIS element be connected to a controller, and as the number of RIS elements on a surface may be on the order of hundreds or more, the number of required electrical connectors creates a difficult wiring problem, especially at high frequencies where the physical space between the elements is limited. A potential solution to this problem was previously proposed by the authors in which "biasing transmission lines" carrying standing waves are sampled at each RIS location to produce the desired bias voltage for each RIS element. This solution has the potential to substantially reduce the complexity of the RIS control. This paper presents models for the RIS elements that account for mutual coupling and realistic varactor characteristics, as well as circuit models for sampling the transmission line to generate the RIS control signals. For the latter case, the paper investigates two techniques for conversion of the transmission line standing wave voltage to the varactor bias voltage, namely an envelope detector and a sample-and-hold circuit. The paper also develops a modal decomposition approach for generating standing waves that are able to generate beams and nulls in the resulting RIS radiation pattern that maximize either the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) or the Signal-to-Leakage-plus-Noise Ratio (SLNR). Extensive simulation results are provided for the two techniques, together with a discussion of computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Hardware-Based Microgrid Coupled to Real-Time Simulated Power Grids for Evaluating New Control Strategies in Future Energy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of new control strategies for future energy systems can neither be directly tested in real power grids nor be evaluated based on only current grid situations. In this regard, extensive tests are required in laboratory settings using real power system equipment. However, since it is impossible to replicate the entire grid section of interest, even in large-scale experiments, hardware setups must be supplemented by detailed simulations to reproduce the system under study fully. This paper presents a unique test environment in which a hardware-based microgrid environment is physically coupled with a large-scale real-time simulation framework. The setup combines the advantages of developing new solutions using hardware-based experiments and evaluating the impact on large-scale power systems using real-time simulations. In this paper, the interface between the microgrid-under-test environment and the real-time simulations is evaluated in terms of accuracy and communication delays. Furthermore, a test case is presented showing the approach's ability to test microgrid control strategies for supporting the grid. It is observed that the communication delays via the physical interface depend on the simulation sampling time and do not significantly affect the accuracy in the interaction between the hardware and the simulated grid.</description>

      <title>COOCK project Smart Port 2025 D3.2: "Variability in Twinning Architectures"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document is a result of the COOCK project "Smart Port 2025: improving and accelerating the operational efficiency of a harbour eco-system through the application of intelligent technologies". The project is mainly aimed at SMEs, but also at large corporations. Together, they form the value-chain of the harbour. The digital maturity of these actors will be increased by model and data-driven digitization. The project brings together both technology users and providers/integrators. In this report, the broad spectrum of model and data-based digitization approaches is structured, under the unifying umbrella of "Digital Twins". During the (currently quite ad-hoc) digitization process and in particular, the creations of Digital Twins, a variety of choices have an impact on the ultimately realised system. This document identifies three stages during which this "variability" appears: the Problem Space Goal Construction Stage, the (Conceptual) Architecture Design Stage and the Deployment Stage. To illustrate the workflow, two simple use-cases are used: one of a ship moving in 1 dimension and, at a different scale and level of detail, a macroscopic model of the Port of Antwerp.</description>

      <title>Mixed Regular and Impulsive Sampled-data LQR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the benefits of combining regular and impulsive inputs for the control of sampled-data linear time-invariant systems. We first observe that adding an impulsive term to a regular, zero-order-hold controller may help enlarging the set of sampling periods under which controllability is preserved by sampling. In this context, we provide a tailored Hautus-like necessary and sufficient condition under which controllability of the mixed regular, impulsive (MRI) sampled-data model is preserved. We then focus on LQR optimal control. After having presented the optimal controllers for the sampled-data LQR control in the MRI setting, we consider the scenario where an impulsive disturbance affects the dynamics and is known ahead of time. The solution to the so-called preview LQR is presented exploiting both regular and impulsive input components. Numerical examples, that include an insulin infusion benchmark, illustrate that leveraging both future disturbance information and MRI controls may lead to significant performance improvements.</description>

      <title>Modeling IoT Traffic Patterns: Insights from a Statistical Analysis of an MTC Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet-of-Things (IoT) is rapidly expanding, connecting numerous devices and becoming integral to our daily lives. As this occurs, ensuring efficient traffic management becomes crucial. Effective IoT traffic management requires modeling and predicting intrincate machine-type communication (MTC) dynamics, for which machine-learning (ML) techniques are certainly appealing. However, obtaining comprehensive and high-quality datasets, along with accessible platforms for reproducing ML-based predictions, continues to impede the research progress. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by characterizing the Smart Campus MTC dataset provided by the University of Oulu. Specifically, we perform a comprehensive statistical analysis of the MTC traffic utilizing goodness-of-fit tests, including well-established tests such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling, chi-squared, and root mean square error. The analysis centers on examining and evaluating three models that accurately represent the two most significant MTC traffic types: periodic updating and event-driven, which are also identified from the dataset. The results demonstrate that the models accurately characterize the traffic patterns. The Poisson point process model exhibits the best fit for event-driven patterns with errors below 11%, while the quasi-periodic model fits accurately the periodic updating traffic with errors below 7%.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Stochastic Predictive Control from Noisy Data: A Sampling-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, an adaptive predictive control scheme for linear systems with unknown parameters and bounded additive disturbances is proposed. In contrast to related adaptive control approaches that robustly consider the parametric uncertainty, the proposed method handles all uncertainties stochastically by employing an online adaptive sampling-based approximation of chance constraints. The approach requires initial data in the form of a short input-output trajectory and distributional knowledge of the disturbances. This prior knowledge is used to construct an initial set of data-consistent system parameters and a distribution that allows for sample generation. As new data stream in online, the set of consistent system parameters is adapted by exploiting set membership identification. Consequently, chance constraints are deterministically approximated using a probabilistic scaling approach by sampling from the set of system parameters. In combination with a robust constraint on the first predicted step, recursive feasibility of the proposed predictive controller and closed-loop constraint satisfaction are guaranteed. A numerical example demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Planning to avoid ambiguous states through Gaussian approximations to non-linear sensors in active inference agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In nature, active inference agents must learn how observations of the world represent the state of the agent. In engineering, the physics behind sensors is often known reasonably accurately and measurement functions can be incorporated into generative models. When a measurement function is non-linear, the transformed variable is typically approximated with a Gaussian distribution to ensure tractable inference. We show that Gaussian approximations that are sensitive to the curvature of the measurement function, such as a second-order Taylor approximation, produce a state-dependent ambiguity term. This induces a preference over states, based on how accurately the state can be inferred from the observation. We demonstrate this preference with a robot navigation experiment where agents plan trajectories.</description>

      <title>Navigating the sociotechnical labyrinth: Dynamic certification for responsible embodied AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sociotechnical requirements shape the governance of artificially intelligent (AI) systems. In an era where embodied AI technologies are rapidly reshaping various facets of contemporary society, their inherent dynamic adaptability presents a unique blend of opportunities and challenges. Traditional regulatory mechanisms, often designed for static -- or slower-paced -- technologies, find themselves at a crossroads when faced with the fluid and evolving nature of AI systems. Moreover, typical problems in AI, for example, the frequent opacity and unpredictability of the behaviour of the systems, add additional sociotechnical challenges.
  To address these interconnected issues, we introduce the concept of dynamic certification, an adaptive regulatory framework specifically crafted to keep pace with the continuous evolution of AI systems. The complexity of these challenges requires common progress in multiple domains: technical, socio-governmental, and regulatory. Our proposed transdisciplinary approach is designed to ensure the safe, ethical, and practical deployment of AI systems, aligning them bidirectionally with the real-world contexts in which they operate. By doing so, we aim to bridge the gap between rapid technological advancement and effective regulatory oversight, ensuring that AI systems not only achieve their intended goals but also adhere to ethical standards and societal values.</description>

      <title>GNN-Empowered Effective Partial Observation MARL Method for AoI Management in Multi-UAV Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), due to their low cost and high flexibility, have been widely used in various scenarios to enhance network performance. However, the optimization of UAV trajectories in unknown areas or areas without sufficient prior information, still faces challenges related to poor planning performance and low distributed execution. These challenges arise when UAVs rely solely on their own observation information and the information from other UAVs within their communicable range, without access to global information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Qedgix framework, which combines graph neural networks (GNNs) and the QMIX algorithm to achieve distributed optimization of the Age of Information (AoI) for users in unknown scenarios. The framework utilizes GNNs to extract information from UAVs, users within the observable range, and other UAVs within the communicable range, thereby enabling effective UAV trajectory planning. Due to the discretization and temporal features of AoI indicators, the Qedgix framework employs QMIX to optimize distributed partially observable Markov decision processes (Dec-POMDP) based on centralized training and distributed execution (CTDE) with respect to mean AoI values of users. By modeling the UAV network optimization problem in terms of AoI and applying the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, the Qedgix framework achieves efficient neural network training through parameter sharing based on permutation invariance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves convergence speed while reducing the mean AoI values of users. The code is available at https://github.com/UNIC-Lab/Qedgix.</description>

      <title>AI-Powered Dynamic Fault Detection and Performance Assessment in Photovoltaic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intermittent nature of photovoltaic (PV) solar energy, driven by variable weather, leads to power losses of 10-70% and an average energy production decrease of 25%. Accurate loss characterization and fault detection are crucial for reliable PV system performance and efficiency, integrating this data into control signal monitoring systems. Computational modeling of PV systems supports technological, economic, and performance analyses, but current models are often rigid, limiting advanced performance optimization and innovation. Conventional fault detection strategies are costly and often yield unreliable results due to complex data signal profiles. Artificial intelligence (AI), especially machine learning algorithms, offers improved fault detection by analyzing relationships between input parameters (e.g., meteorological and electrical) and output metrics (e.g., production). Once trained, these models can effectively identify faults by detecting deviations from expected performance. This research presents a computational model using the PVlib library in Python, incorporating a dynamic loss quantification algorithm that processes meteorological, operational, and technical data. An artificial neural network (ANN) trained on synthetic datasets with a five-minute resolution simulates real-world PV system faults. A dynamic threshold definition for fault detection is based on historical data from a PV system at Universidad de los Andes. Key contributions include: (i) a PV system model with a mean absolute error of 6.0% in daily energy estimation; (ii) dynamic loss quantification without specialized equipment; (iii) an AI-based algorithm for technical parameter estimation, avoiding special monitoring devices; and (iv) a fault detection model achieving 82.2% mean accuracy and 92.6% maximum accuracy.</description>

      <title>Towards Battery-Free Wireless Sensing via Radio-Frequency Energy Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diverse Wi-Fi-based wireless applications have been proposed, ranging from daily activity recognition to vital sign monitoring. Despite their remarkable sensing accuracy, the high energy consumption and the requirement for customized hardware modification hinder the wide deployment of the existing sensing solutions. In this paper, we propose REHSense, an energy-efficient wireless sensing solution based on Radio-Frequency (RF) energy harvesting. Instead of relying on a power-hungry Wi-Fi receiver, REHSense leverages an RF energy harvester as the sensor and utilizes the voltage signals harvested from the ambient Wi-Fi signals to enable simultaneous context sensing and energy harvesting. We design and implement REHSense using a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) RF energy harvester. Extensive evaluation of three fine-grained wireless sensing tasks (i.e., respiration monitoring, human activity, and hand gesture recognition) shows that REHSense can achieve comparable sensing accuracy with conventional Wi-Fi-based solutions while adapting to different sensing environments, reducing the power consumption by 98.7% and harvesting up to 4.5mW of power from RF energy.</description>

      <title>Scalable analysis of stop-and-go waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing stop-and-go waves at the scale of miles and hours of data is an emerging challenge in traffic research. In the past, datasets were of limited scale and could be easily analyzed by hand or with rudimentary methods to identify a very limited set of traffic waves present within the data. This paper introduces an automatic and scalable stop-and-go wave identification method capable of capturing wave generation, propagation, dissipation, as well as bifurcation and merging, which have previously been observed only very rarely. Using a concise and simple critical-speed based definition of a stop-and-go wave, the proposed method identifies all wave boundaries that encompass spatio-temporal points where vehicle speed is below a chosen critical speed. The method is built upon a graph-based representation of the spatio-temporal points associated with stop-and-go waves, specifically wave front (start) points and wave tail (end) points, and approaches the solution as a graph component identification problem. The method is implemented in Python and demonstrated on a large-scale dataset, I-24 MOTION INCEPTION. New insights revealed from this demonstration with emerging phenomena include: (a) we demonstrate that waves do generate, propagate, and dissipate at a scale (miles and hours) and ubiquity never observed before; (b) wave fronts and tails travels at a consistent speed for a critical speed between 10-20 mph, with propagation variation across lanes, where wave speed on the outer lane are less consistent compared to those on the inner lane; (c) wave fronts and tails propagate at different speeds; (d) wave boundaries capture rich and non-trivial wave topologies, highlighting the complexity of waves.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Joint Chance-Constrained Optimization for Electricity Imbalance in Iran: Integrating Renewables and Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iran's power grid faces mounting challenges due to the widening gap between rapidly increasing peak demand and lagging sustainable capacity expansion or load management. Prosumers have become key players in reducing grid load and offering valuable flexible services, but their effectiveness is hampered by a lack of knowledge about uncertain parameters and their probability distributions. This study introduces a novel two-stage multi-time scale distributionally robust optimization framework integrated with joint chance constraints to effectively manage the operation of prosumers and their energy sharing to mitigate overall peak load imbalances under uncertainties. In a data-driven setting and by leveraging historical data, the proposed model is reformulated as a tractable second-order conic constrained quadratic programing (SOCP). By considering real-world complexities based on realistic-data such as diverse load profiles and intermittent renewable generation, our approach demonstrates enhanced energy management system performance, even in out-of-sample scenarios. The synergy of distributed energy resources and coordinated flexibility within the network is instrumental in achieving substantial reductions in peak load and improving grid resilience.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Neural ODE Feedback Control Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly used as an effective way to represent control policies in a wide-range of learning-based control methods. For continuous-time optimal control problems (OCPs), which are central to many decision-making tasks, control policy learning can be cast as a neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) problem wherein state and control constraints are naturally accommodated. This paper presents a Lyapunov-NODE control (L-NODEC) approach to solving continuous-time OCPs for the case of stabilizing a known constrained nonlinear system around a terminal equilibrium point. We propose a Lyapunov loss formulation that incorporates a control-theoretic Lyapunov condition into the problem of learning a state-feedback neural control policy. We establish that L-NODEC ensures exponential stability of the controlled system, as well as its adversarial robustness to uncertain initial conditions. The performance of L-NODEC is illustrated on a benchmark double integrator problem and for optimal control of thermal dose delivery using a cold atmospheric plasma biomedical system. L-NODEC can substantially reduce the inference time necessary to reach the equilibrium state.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Bistable Vibration Energy Harvesters with Tunable Circuits: A Comparative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present an analysis of the effects of nonlinear circuits on bistable vibration energy harvesters. We begin by introducing an analytical model for bistable vibration energy harvesters and demonstrate that the impact of nonlinear circuits can be characterized by two factors: electrically-induced damping and electrically-induced stiffness. Subsequently, we investigate how these factors influence the power-frequency response of the harvester. Our findings reveal that electrically-induced damping significantly affects the bistable vibration energy harvester dynamics, whereas electrically-induced stiffness has minimal impact, which is a notable difference from the behavior of linear harvesters connected to nonlinear circuits. Thereafter, we conduct a comparative study of bistable energy harvesters connected to different nonlinear circuits already well documented in the literature. Our analysis demonstrates that, in most cases, the parallel synchronized switch harvesting on inductor circuit yields superior performance due to its ability to maximize electrically-induced damping. These comparative assessments and conclusions are evaluated within the framework of our proposed models and are contrasted with results obtained from linear vibration energy harvesters. The derived comparison maps presented at the end of this paper offer quantitative justification for selecting the optimal circuit for bistable energy harvesters, while deepening our comprehension of the intricate dynamics associated with nonlinear harvesters coupled with nonlinear circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previously, using forward-flux sampling (FFS) and machine learning (ML), we developed multivariate alarm systems to counter rare un-postulated abnormal events. Our alarm systems utilized ML-based predictive models to quantify committer probabilities as functions of key process variables (e.g., temperature, concentrations, and the like), with these data obtained in FFS simulations. Herein, we introduce a novel and comprehensive benchmark framework for rare-event prediction, comparing ML algorithms of varying complexity, including Linear Support-Vector Regressor and k-Nearest Neighbors, to more sophisticated algorithms, such as Random Forests, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Dense Neural Networks, and TabNet. This evaluation uses comprehensive performance metrics, such as: $\textit{RMSE}$, model training, testing, hyperparameter tuning and deployment times, and number and efficiency of alarms. These balance model accuracy, computational efficiency, and alarm-system efficiency, identifying optimal ML strategies for predicting abnormal rare events, enabling operators to obtain safer and more reliable plant operations.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Prosumer Networks for Peak Load Management in Iran: A Distributed Contextual Stochastic Optimization Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Renewable prosumers face the complex challenge of balancing self-sufficiency with seamless grid and market integration. This paper introduces a novel prosumers network framework aimed at mitigating peak loads in Iran, particularly under the uncertainties inherent in renewable energy generation and demand. A cost-oriented integrated prediction and optimization approach is proposed, empowering prosumers to make informed decisions within a distributed contextual stochastic optimization (DCSO) framework. The problem is formulated as a bi-level two-stage multi-time scale optimization to determine optimal operation and interaction strategies under various scenarios, considering flexible resources. To facilitate grid integration, a novel consensus-based contextual information sharing mechanism is proposed. This approach enables coordinated collective behaviors and leverages contextual data more effectively. The overall problem is recast as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) by incorporating optimality conditions and linearizing complementarity constraints. Additionally, a distributed algorithm using the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is presented for computational tractability and privacy preservation. Numerical results highlights that integrating prediction with optimization and implementing a contextual information-sharing network among prosumers significantly reduces peak loads as well as total costs.</description>

      <title>Leaky Wave Antenna-Equipped RF Chipless Tags for Orientation Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate orientation estimation of an object in a scene is critical in robotics, aerospace, augmented reality, and medicine, as it supports scene understanding. This paper introduces a novel orientation estimation approach leveraging radio frequency (RF) sensing technology and leaky-wave antennas (LWAs). Specifically, we propose a framework for a radar system to estimate the orientation of a \textit{dumb} LWA-equipped backscattering tag, marking the first exploration of this method in the literature. Our contributions include a comprehensive framework for signal modeling and orientation estimation with multi-subcarrier transmissions, and the formulation of a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). Moreover, we analyze the impact of imperfect tag location information, revealing that it minimally affects estimation accuracy. Exploiting related results, we propose an approximate MLE and introduce a low-complexity radiation-pointing angle-based estimator with near-optimal performance. We derive the feasible orientation estimation region of the latter and show that it depends mainly on the system bandwidth. Our analytical results are validated through Monte Carlo simulations and reveal that the low-complexity estimator achieves near-optimal accuracy and that its feasible orientation estimation region is also approximately shared by the other estimators. Finally, we show that the optimal number of subcarriers increases with sensing time under a power budget constraint.</description>

      <title>Generalized Multi-hop Traffic Pressure for Heterogeneous Traffic Perimeter Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perimeter control prevents loss of traffic network capacity due to congestion in urban areas. Homogeneous perimeter control allows all access points to a protected region to have the same maximal permitted inflow. However, homogeneous perimeter control performs poorly when the congestion in the protected region is heterogeneous (e.g., imbalanced demand) since the homogeneous perimeter control does not consider location-specific traffic conditions around the perimeter. When the protected region has spatially heterogeneous congestion, it can often make sense to modulate the perimeter inflow rate to be higher near low-density regions and vice versa for high-density regions. To assist with this modulation, we can leverage the concept of 1-hop traffic pressure to measure intersection-level traffic congestion. However, as we show, 1-hop pressure turns out to be too spatially myopic for perimeter control and hence we formulate multi-hop generalizations of pressure that look ``deeper'' inside the perimeter beyond the entry intersection. In addition, we formulate a simple heterogeneous perimeter control methodology that can leverage this novel multi-hop pressure to redistribute the total permitted inflow provided by the homogeneous perimeter controller. Experimental results show that our heterogeneous perimeter control policies leveraging multi-hop pressure significantly outperform homogeneous perimeter control in scenarios where the origin-destination flows are highly imbalanced with high spatial heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Distributed Optimization under Edge Agreement with Application in Battery Network Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a distributed optimization problem under edge agreements, where each agent in the network is also subject to local convex constraints. Generalized from the concept of consensus, a group of edge agreements represents the constraints defined for neighboring agents, with each pair of neighboring agents required to satisfy one edge agreement constraint. Edge agreements are defined locally to allow more flexibility than a global consensus, enabling heterogeneous coordination within the network. This paper proposes a discrete-time algorithm to solve such problems, providing a theoretical analysis to prove its convergence. Additionally, this paper illustrates the connection between the theory of distributed optimization under edge agreements and distributed model predictive control through a distributed battery network energy management problem. This approach enables a new perspective to formulate and solve network control and optimization problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose hardware and software enhancements for the Pepper robot to improve its human-robot interaction capabilities. This includes the integration of an NVIDIA Jetson GPU to enhance computational capabilities and execute real time algorithms, and a RealSense D435i camera to capture depth images, as well as the computer vision algorithms to detect and localize the humans around the robot and estimate their body orientation and gaze direction. The new stack is implemented on ROS and is running on the extended Pepper hardware, and the communication with the robot s firmware is done through the NAOqi ROS driver API. We have also collected a MoCap dataset of human activities in a controlled environment, together with the corresponding RGB-D data, to validate the proposed perception algorithms.</description>

      <title>Learning in Hybrid Active Inference Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An open problem in artificial intelligence is how systems can flexibly learn discrete abstractions that are useful for solving inherently continuous problems. Previous work in computational neuroscience has considered this functional integration of discrete and continuous variables during decision-making under the formalism of active inference (Parr, Friston &amp; de Vries, 2017; Parr &amp; Friston, 2018). However, their focus is on the expressive physical implementation of categorical decisions and the hierarchical mixed generative model is assumed to be known. As a consequence, it is unclear how this framework might be extended to learning. We therefore present a novel hierarchical hybrid active inference agent in which a high-level discrete active inference planner sits above a low-level continuous active inference controller. We make use of recent work in recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS) which implement end-to-end learning of meaningful discrete representations via the piecewise linear decomposition of complex continuous dynamics (Linderman et al., 2016). The representations learned by the rSLDS inform the structure of the hybrid decision-making agent and allow us to (1) specify temporally-abstracted sub-goals in a method reminiscent of the options framework, (2) lift the exploration into discrete space allowing us to exploit information-theoretic exploration bonuses and (3) `cache' the approximate solutions to low-level problems in the discrete planner. We apply our model to the sparse Continuous Mountain Car task, demonstrating fast system identification via enhanced exploration and successful planning through the delineation of abstract sub-goals.</description>

      <title>A blueprint for large-scale quantum-network deployments</title>

Abstract: Quantum Communications is a field that promises advances in cryptography, quantum computing and clock synchronisation, among other potential applications. However, communication based on quantum phenomena requires an extreme level of isolation from external disturbances, making the transmission of quantum signals together with classical ones difficult. A range of techniques has been tested to introduce quantum communications in already deployed optical networks which also carry legacy traffic. This comes with challenges, not only at the physical layer but also at the operations and management layer. To achieve a broad acceptance among network operators, the joint management and operation of quantum and classical resources, compliance with standards, and quality and legal assurance need to be addressed. This article presents a detailed account of solutions to the above issues, deployed and evaluated in the MadQCI (Madrid Quantum Communication Infrastructure) testbed. This network is designed to integrate quantum communications in the telecommunications ecosystem by installing quantum-key-distribution modules from multiple providers in production nodes of two different operators. The modules were connected through an optical-switched network with more than 130 km of deployed optical fibre. The tests were done in compliance with strict service level agreements that protected the legacy traffic of the pre-existing classical network. The goal was to achieve full quantum-classical compatibility at all levels, while limiting the modifications of optical transport and encryption and complying with as many standards as possible. This effort was intended to serve as a blueprint, which can be used as the foundation of large-scale quantum network deployments. To demonstrate the capabilities of MadQCI, end-to-end encryption services were deployed and a variety of use-cases were showcased.</description>

      <title>Flying a Quadrotor with Unknown Actuators and Sensor Configuration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Though control algorithms for multirotor Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) are well understood, the configuration, parameter estimation, and tuning of flight control algorithms takes quite some time and resources. In previous work, we have shown that it is possible to identify the control effectiveness and motor dynamics of a multirotor fast enough for it to recover to a stable hover after being thrown 4 meters in the air. In this paper, we extend this to include estimation of the position of the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) relative to the Center of Gravity (CoG), estimation of the IMU rotation, the thrust direction of all motors and the optimal combined thrust direction. In order to guarantee a correct IMU position estimation, two prior throw-and-catches of the vehicle with spin around different axes are required. For these throws, a height as low as 1 meter is sufficient. Quadrotor flight experimentation confirms the efficacy of the approach, and a simulation shows its applicability to fully-actuated crafts with multiple possible hover orientations.</description>

      <title>Massive Random Access in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems for High-Speed Mobility with OTFS Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the research of next-generation wireless communication technologies, orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is emerging as a promising technique for high-speed mobile environments due to its superior efficiency and robustness in doubly selective channels. Additionally, the cell-free architecture, which eliminates the issues associated with cell boundaries, offers broader coverage for radio access networks. By combining cell-free network architecture with OTFS modulation, the system may meet the demands of massive random access required by machine-type communication devices in high-speed scenarios. This paper explores a massive random access scheme based on OTFS modulation within a cell-free architecture. A transceiver model for uplink OTFS signals involving multiple access points (APs) is developed, where channel estimation with fractional channel parameters is approximated as a block sparse matrix recovery problem. Building on existing superimposed and embedded preamble schemes, a hybrid preamble scheme is proposed. This scheme leverages superimposed and embedded preambles to respectively achieve rough and accurate active user equipment (UEs) detection (AUD), as well as precise channel estimation, under the condition of supporting a large number of access UEs. Moreover, this study introduces a generalized approximate message passing and pattern coupling sparse Bayesian learning with Laplacian prior (GAMP-PCSBL-La) algorithm, which effectively captures block sparse features after discrete cosine transform (DCT), delivering precise estimation results with reduced computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is effective and provides superior performance compared to other existing schemes.</description>

      <title>PACSBO: Probably approximately correct safe Bayesian optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safe Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithms promise to find optimal control policies without knowing the system dynamics while at the same time guaranteeing safety with high probability. In exchange for those guarantees, popular algorithms require a smoothness assumption: a known upper bound on a norm in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The RKHS is a potentially infinite-dimensional space, and it is unclear how to, in practice, obtain an upper bound of an unknown function in its corresponding RKHS. In response, we propose an algorithm that estimates an upper bound on the RKHS norm of an unknown function from data and investigate its theoretical properties. Moreover, akin to Lipschitz-based methods, we treat the RKHS norm as a local rather than a global object, and thus reduce conservatism. Integrating the RKHS norm estimation and the local interpretation of the RKHS norm into a safe BO algorithm yields PACSBO, an algorithm for probably approximately correct safe Bayesian optimization, for which we provide numerical and hardware experiments that demonstrate its applicability and benefits over popular safe BO algorithms.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity of the Sign-Perturbed Sums Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the sample complexity of the Sign-Perturbed Sums (SPS) method, which constructs exact, non-asymptotic confidence regions for the true system parameters under mild statistical assumptions, such as independent and symmetric noise terms. The standard version of SPS deals with linear regression problems, however, it can be generalized to stochastic linear (dynamical) systems, even with closed-loop setups, and to nonlinear and nonparametric problems, as well. Although the strong consistency of the method was rigorously proven, the sample complexity of the algorithm was only analyzed so far for scalar linear regression problems. In this paper we study the sample complexity of SPS for general linear regression problems. We establish high probability upper bounds for the diameters of SPS confidence regions for finite sample sizes and show that the SPS regions shrink at the same, optimal rate as the classical asymptotic confidence ellipsoids. Finally, the difference between the theoretical bounds and the empirical sizes of SPS confidence regions is investigated experimentally.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Artificial Time Delay Control for Robotic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial time delay controller was conceptualised for nonlinear systems to reduce dependency on precise system modelling unlike the conventional adaptive and robust control strategies. In this approach unknown dynamics is compensated by using input and state measurements collected at immediate past time instant (i.e., artificially delayed). The advantage of this kind of approach lies in its simplicity and ease of implementation. However, the applications of artificial time delay controllers in robotics, which are also robust against unknown state-dependent uncertainty, are still missing at large. This thesis presents the study of this control approach toward two important classes of robotic systems, namely a fully actuated bipedal walking robot and an underactuated quadrotor system. In the first work, we explore the idea of a unified control design instead of multiple controllers for different walking phases in adaptive bipedal walking control while bypassing computing constraint forces, since they often lead to complex designs. The second work focuses on quadrotors employed for applications such as payload delivery, inspection and search-and-rescue. The effectiveness of this controller is validated using experimental results.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Soft-Maximum Barrier Functions for Safety in Unmapped and Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a closed-form optimal feedback control method that ensures safety in an a prior unknown and potentially dynamic environment. This article considers the scenario where local perception data (e.g., LiDAR) is obtained periodically, and this data can be used to construct a local control barrier function (CBF) that models a local set that is safe for a period of time into the future. Then, we use a smooth time-varying soft-maximum function to compose the N most recently obtained local CBFs into a single barrier function that models an approximate union of the N most recently obtained local sets. This composite barrier function is used in a constrained quadratic optimization, which is solved in closed form to obtain a safe-and-optimal feedback control. We also apply the time-varying soft-maximum barrier function control to 2 robotic systems (nonholonomic ground robot with nonnegligible inertia, and quadrotor robot), where the objective is to navigate an a priori unknown environment safely and reach a target destination. In these applications, we present a simple approach to generate local CBFs from periodically obtained perception data.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap Between Central and Local Decision-Making: The Efficacy of Collaborative Equilibria in Altruistic Congestion Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Congestion games are popular models often used to study the system-level inefficiencies caused by selfish agents, typically measured by the price of anarchy. One may expect that aligning the agents' preferences with the system-level objective--altruistic behavior--would improve efficiency, but recent works have shown that altruism can lead to more significant inefficiency than selfishness in congestion games. In this work, we study to what extent the localness of decision-making causes inefficiency by considering collaborative decision-making paradigms that exist between centralized and distributed in altruistic congestion games. In altruistic congestion games with convex latency functions, the system cost is a super-modular function over the player's joint actions, and the Nash equilibria of the game are local optima in the neighborhood of unilateral deviations. When agents can collaborate, we can exploit the common-interest structure to consider equilibria with stronger local optimality guarantees in the system objective, e.g., if groups of k agents can collaboratively minimize the system cost, the system equilibria are the local optima over k-lateral deviations. Our main contributions are in constructing tractable linear programs that provide bounds on the price of anarchy of collaborative equilibria in altruistic congestion games. Our findings bridge the gap between the known efficiency guarantees of centralized and distributed decision-making paradigms while also providing insights into the benefit of inter-agent collaboration in multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>On the Sample Complexity of Imitation Learning for Smoothed Model Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work in imitation learning has shown that having an expert controller that is both suitably smooth and stable enables stronger guarantees on the performance of the learned controller. However, constructing such smoothed expert controllers for arbitrary systems remains challenging, especially in the presence of input and state constraints. As our primary contribution, we show how such a smoothed expert can be designed for a general class of systems using a log-barrier-based relaxation of a standard Model Predictive Control (MPC) optimization problem. At the crux of this theoretical guarantee on smoothness is a new lower bound we prove on the optimality gap of the analytic center associated with a convex Lipschitz function, which we hope could be of independent interest. We validate our theoretical findings via experiments, demonstrating the merits of our smoothing approach over randomized smoothing.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Reward Functions in Policy Synthesis for Markov Decision Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Markov decision processes often seek to maximize a reward function, but onlookers may infer reward functions by observing the states and actions of such systems, revealing sensitive information. Therefore, in this paper we introduce and compare two methods for privatizing reward functions in policy synthesis for multi-agent Markov decision processes, which generalize Markov decision processes. Reward functions are privatized using differential privacy, a statistical framework for protecting sensitive data. The methods we develop perturb either (1) each agent's individual reward function or (2) the joint reward function shared by all agents. We show that approach (1) provides better performance. We then develop a polynomial-time algorithm for the numerical computation of the performance loss due to privacy on a case-by-case basis. Next, using approach (1), we develop guidelines for selecting reward function values to preserve ``goal" and ``avoid" states while still remaining private, and we quantify the increase in computational complexity needed to compute policies from privatized rewards. Numerical simulations are performed on three classes of systems and they reveal a surprising compatibility with privacy: using reasonably strong privacy ($\epsilon =1.3$) on average induces as little as a~$5\%$ decrease in total accumulated reward and a $0.016\%$ increase in computation time.</description>

      <title>The Fragile Nature of Road Transportation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00924v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Major cities worldwide experience problems with the performance of their road transportation systems, and the continuous increase in traffic demand presents a substantial challenge to the optimal operation of urban road networks and the efficiency of traffic control strategies. The operation of transportation systems is widely considered to display fragile property, i.e., the loss in performance increases exponentially with the linearly increasing magnitude of disruptions. Meanwhile, the risk engineering community is embracing the novel concept of antifragility, enabling systems to learn from historical disruptions and exhibit improved performance under black swan events. In this study, based on established traffic models, namely fundamental diagrams and macroscopic fundamental diagrams, we first conducted a rigorous mathematical analysis to prove the fragile nature of the systems theoretically. Subsequently, we propose a skewness-based indicator that can be readily applied to cross-compare the degree of fragility for different networks solely dependent on the MFD-related parameters. At last, by taking real-world stochasticity into account, we implemented a numerical simulation with realistic network data to bridge the gap between the theoretical proof and the real-world operations, to reflect the potential impact of uncertainty on the fragility of the systems. This work aims to demonstrate the fragile nature of road transportation systems and help researchers better comprehend the necessity to consider explicitly antifragile design for future traffic control strategies.</description>

      <title>Risk-Aware Real-Time Task Allocation for Stochastic Multi-Agent Systems under STL Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the control synthesis of heterogeneous stochastic linear multi-agent systems with real-time allocation of signal temporal logic (STL) specifications. Based on previous work, we decompose specifications into sub-specifications on the individual agent level. To leverage the efficiency of task allocation, a heuristic filter evaluates potential task allocation based on STL robustness, and subsequently, an auctioning algorithm determines the definitive allocation of specifications. Finally, a control strategy is synthesized for each agent-specification pair using tube-based model predictive control (MPC), ensuring provable probabilistic satisfaction. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods using a multi-shuttle scenario that highlights a promising extension to automated driving applications like vehicle routing.</description>

      <title>Emergent Cooperation for Energy-efficient Connectivity via Wireless Power Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of incentivizing energy-constrained, non-cooperative user equipment (UE) to serve as cooperative relays. We consider a source UE with a non-line-of-sight channel to an access point (AP), where direct communication may be infeasible or may necessitate a substantial transmit power. Other UEs in the vicinity are viewed as relay candidates, and our aim is to enable energy-efficient connectivity for the source, while accounting for the self-interested behavior and private channel state information of these candidates, by allowing the source to ``pay" the candidates via wireless power transfer (WPT). We propose a cooperation-inducing protocol, inspired by Myerson auction theory, which ensures that candidates truthfully report power requirements while minimizing the expected power used by the source. Through rigorous analysis, we establish the regularity of valuations for lognormal fading channels, which allows for the efficient determination of the optimal source transmit power. Extensive simulation experiments, employing real-world communication and WPT parameters, validate our theoretical framework. Our results demonstrate over 71% reduction in outage probability with as few as 4 relay candidates, compared to the non-cooperative scenario, and as much as 70% source power savings compared to a baseline approach, highlighting the efficacy of our proposed methodology.</description>

Abstract: Unmanned Vehicles (UVs) functioning as autonomous agents are anticipated to play a crucial role in the 6th Generation of wireless networks. Their seamless integration, cost-effectiveness, and the additional controllability through motion planning make them an attractive deployment option for a wide range of applications, both as assets in the network (e.g., mobile base stations) and as consumers of network services (e.g., autonomous delivery systems). However, despite their potential, the convergence of UVs and wireless systems brings forth numerous challenges that require attention from both academia and industry. This paper then aims to offer a comprehensive overview encompassing the transformative possibilities as well as the significant challenges associated with UV-assisted next-generation wireless communications. Considering the diverse landscape of possible application scenarios, problem formulations, and mathematical tools related to UV-assisted wireless systems, the underlying core theme of this paper is the unification of the problem space, providing a structured framework to understand the use cases, problem formulations, and necessary mathematical tools. Overall, the paper sets forth a clear understanding of how unmanned vehicles can be integrated in the 6G ecosystem, paving the way towards harnessing the full potential at this intersection.</description>

      <title>A Two-sided Model for EV Market Dynamics and Policy Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diffusion of Electric Vehicles (EVs) plays a pivotal role in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in the U.S., where ambitious zero-emission and carbon neutrality objectives have been set. In pursuit of these goals, many states have implemented a range of incentive policies aimed at stimulating EV adoption and charging infrastructure development, especially public EV charging stations (EVCS). This study examines the indirect network effect observed between EV adoption and EVCS deployment within urban landscapes. We developed a two-sided log-log regression model with historical data on EV purchases and EVCS development to quantify this effect. To test the robustness, we then conducted a case study of the EV market in Los Angeles (LA) County, which suggests that a 1% increase in EVCS correlates with a 0.35% increase in EV sales. Additionally, we forecasted the future EV market dynamics in LA County, revealing a notable disparity between current policies and the targeted 80% EV market share for private cars by 2045. To bridge this gap, we proposed a combined policy recommendation that enhances EV incentives by 60% and EVCS rebates by 66%, facilitating the achievement of future EV market objectives.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Monotonicity to Design an Adaptive PI Passivity-Based Controller for a Fuel-Cell System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05350v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a controller for a power electronic system composed of a fuel cell (FC) connected to a boost converter which feeds a resistive load. The controller aims to regulate the output voltage of the converter regardless of the uncertainty of the load. Leveraging the monotonicity feature of the fuel cell polarization curve we prove that the nonlinear system can be controlled by means of a passivity-based proportional-integral approach. We afterward extend the result to an adaptive version, allowing the controller to deal with parameter uncertainties, such as inductor parasitic resistance, load, and FC polarization curve parameters. This adaptive design is based on an indirect control approach with online parameter identification performed by a ``hybrid'' estimator which combines two techniques: the gradient-descent and immersion-and-invariance algorithms. The overall system is proved to be stable with the output voltage regulated to its reference. Experimental results validate our proposal under two real-life scenarios: pulsating load and output voltage reference changes.</description>

      <title>A General Framework for Load Forecasting based on Pre-trained Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate load forecasting is crucial for maintaining the power balance between generators and consumers,particularly with the increasing integration of renewable energy sources, which introduce significant intermittent volatility. With the advancement of data-driven methods, machine learning and deep learning models have become the predominant approaches for load forecasting tasks. In recent years, pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress, demonstrating superior performance across various fields. This paper proposes a load forecasting method based on LLMs, offering not only precise predictive capabilities but also broad and flexible applicability. Additionally, a data modeling method is introduced to effectively transform load sequence data into natural language suitable for LLM training. Furthermore, a data enhancement strategy is designed to mitigate the impact of LLM hallucinations on forecasting results. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using two real-world datasets. Compared to existing methods, our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across all validation metrics.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Neural Networks for Heterogeneous Poroelastic Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a novel physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for modeling poroelasticity in heterogeneous media with material interfaces. The approach introduces a composite neural network (CoNN) where separate neural networks predict displacement and pressure variables for each material. While sharing identical activation functions, these networks are independently trained for all other parameters. To address challenges posed by heterogeneous material interfaces, the CoNN is integrated with the Interface-PINNs or I-PINNs framework (Sarma et al. 2024, https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2024.117135), allowing different activation functions across material interfaces. This ensures accurate approximation of discontinuous solution fields and gradients. Performance and accuracy of this combined architecture were evaluated against the conventional PINNs approach, a single neural network (SNN) architecture, and the eXtended PINNs (XPINNs) framework through two one-dimensional benchmark examples with discontinuous material properties. The results show that the proposed CoNN with I-PINNs architecture achieves an RMSE that is two orders of magnitude better than the conventional PINNs approach and is at least 40 times faster than the SNN framework. Compared to XPINNs, the proposed method achieves an RMSE at least one order of magnitude better and is 40% faster.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Reachability Analysis of Stochastic Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the reachability problem for continuous-time stochastic dynamic systems. Our objective is to present a unified framework that characterizes the reachable set of a dynamic system in the presence of both stochastic disturbances and deterministic inputs. To achieve this, we devise a strategy that effectively decouples the effects of deterministic inputs and stochastic disturbances on the reachable sets of the system. For the deterministic part, many existing methods can capture the deterministic reachability. As for the stochastic disturbances, we introduce a novel technique that probabilistically bounds the difference between a stochastic trajectory and its deterministic counterpart. The key to our approach is introducing a novel energy function termed the Averaged Moment Generating Function that yields a high probability bound for this difference. This bound is tight and exact for linear stochastic dynamics and applicable to a large class of nonlinear stochastic dynamics. By combining our innovative technique with existing methods for deterministic reachability analysis, we can compute estimations of reachable sets that surpass those obtained with current approaches for stochastic reachability analysis. We validate the effectiveness of our framework through various numerical experiments. Beyond its immediate applications in reachability analysis, our methodology is poised to have profound implications in the broader analysis and control of stochastic systems. It opens avenues for enhanced understanding and manipulation of complex stochastic dynamics, presenting opportunities for advancements in related fields.</description>

      <title>An RF-Domain Leakage Cancellation Scheme for FMCW Radars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel solution to address the leakage from the transmitter (TX) to the receiver (RX) in frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radars. The proposed scheme replicates the leakage using an in-phase and quadrature mixer (IQ-mixer) and performs leakage cancellation in the radio-frequency (RF) domain. This approach utilizes a Wilkinson power combiner after the RX antenna to subtract the replicated leakage signal from the received signal, ensuring that only the true target signal reaches the low-noise amplifier (LNA). This scheme enhances the dynamic range and the receiver's ability to discern proximate targets from previously indistinguishable low beat-frequency clutter. In addition, the proposed technique incorporates a second IQ-mixer based complex modulator in the transmitter to tune the leakage beat frequency. This allows for accurate estimation of the leakage amplitude and phase without additional hardware. Simulation results show more than 20 dB of leakage cancellation.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Power Quality Issues in Grid-Microgrid Network Using Microgrid Building Blocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microgrids are evolving as promising options to enhance reliability of the connected transmission and distribution systems. Traditional design and deployment of microgrids require significant engineering analysis. Microgrid Building Blocks (MBB), consisting of modular blocks that integrate seamlessly to form effective microgrids, is an enabling concept for faster and broader adoption of microgrids. Back-to-Back converter placed at the point of common coupling of microgrid is an integral part of the MBB. This paper presents applications of MBB to decouple power quality issues in grid-microgrid network serving power quality sensitive loads such as data centers, new grid-edge technologies such as vehicle-to-grid generation, and serving electric vehicle charging loads during evacuation before disaster events. Simulation results show that MBB effectively decouples the power quality issues across networks and helps maintain good power quality in the power quality sensitive network based on the operational scenario.</description>

      <title>Active Search for Low-altitude UAV Sensing and Communication for Users at Unknown Locations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14067v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies optimal unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) placement to ensure line-of-sight (LOS) communication and sensing for a cluster of ground users possibly in deep shadow, while the UAV maintains backhaul connectivity with a base station (BS). The key challenges include unknown user locations, uncertain channel model parameters, and unavailable urban structure. Addressing these challenges, this paper focuses on developing an efficient online search strategy which jointly estimates channels, guides UAV positioning, and optimizes resource allocation. Analytically exploiting the geometric properties of the equipotential surface, this paper develops an LOS discovery trajectory on the equipotential surface while the closed-form search directions are determined using perturbation theory. Since the explicit expression of the equipotential surface is not available, this paper proposes to locally construct a channel model for each user in the LOS regime utilizing polynomial regression without depending on user locations or propagation distance. A class of spiral trajectories to simultaneously construct the LOS channels and search on the equipotential surface is developed. An optimal radius of the spiral and an optimal measurement pattern for channel gain estimation are derived to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) of the locally constructed channel. Numerical results on real 3D city maps demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves over 94% of the performance of a 3D exhaustive search scheme with just a 3-kilometer search.</description>

      <title>Risk-Averse Resilient Operation of Electricity Grid Under the Risk of Wildfire</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wildfires and other extreme weather conditions due to climate change are stressing the aging electrical infrastructure. Power utilities have implemented public safety power shutoffs as a method to mitigate the risk of wildfire by proactively de-energizing some power lines, which leaves customers without power. System operators have to make a compromise between de-energizing of power lines to avoid the wildfire risk and energizing those lines to serve the demand. In this work, with a quantified wildfire ignition risk of each line, a resilient operation problem is presented in power systems with a high penetration level of renewable generation resources. A two-stage robust optimization problem is formulated and solved using column-and-constraint generation algorithm to find improved balance between the de-energization of power lines and the customers served. Different penetration levels of renewable generation to mitigate the impact of extreme fire hazard situations on the energization of customers is assessed. The validity of the presented robust optimization algorithm is demonstrated on various test cases.</description>

      <title>Safe Barrier-Constrained Control of Uncertain Systems via Event-triggered Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While control barrier functions are employed in addressing safety, control synthesis methods based on them generally rely on accurate system dynamics. This is a critical limitation, since the dynamics of complex systems are often not fully known. Supervised machine learning techniques hold great promise for alleviating this weakness by inferring models from data. We propose a novel control barrier function-based framework for safe control through event-triggered learning, which switches between prioritizing control performance and improving model accuracy based on the uncertainty of the learned model. By updating a Gaussian process model with training points gathered online, the approach guarantees the feasibility of control barrier function conditions with high probability, such that safety can be ensured in a data-efficient manner. Furthermore, we establish the absence of Zeno behavior in the triggering scheme, and extend the algorithm to sampled-data realizations by accounting for inter-sampling effects. The effectiveness of the proposed approach and theory is demonstrated in simulations.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Blockchain and ANFIS for Optimal Supply Chain Management</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The supply chain is a critical segment of the product manufacturing cycle, continuously influenced by risky, uncertain, and undesirable events. Optimizing flexibility in the supply chain presents a complex, multi-objective, and nonlinear programming challenge. In the poultry supply chain, the development of mass customization capabilities has led manufacturing companies to increasingly focus on offering tailored and customized services for individual products. To safeguard against data tampering and ensure the integrity of setup costs and overall profitability, a multi-signature decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, integrated with the IoT on a blockchain platform, is proposed. Managing the poultry supply chain involves uncertainties that may not account for parameters such as delivery time to retailers, reorder time, and the number of requested products. To address these challenges, this study employs an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), combining neural networks with fuzzy logic to compensate for the lack of data training in parameter identification. Through MATLAB simulations, the study investigates the average shop delivery duration, the reorder time, and the number of products per order. By implementing the proposed technique, the average delivery time decreases from 40 to 37 minutes, the reorder time decreases from five to four days, and the quantity of items requested per order grows from six to eleven. Additionally, the ANFIS model enhances overall supply chain performance by reducing transaction times by 15\% compared to conventional systems, thereby improving real-time responsiveness and boosting transparency in supply chain operations, effectively resolving operational issues.</description>

      <title>Towards 6G-V2X: Aggregated RF-VLC for Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06287v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are witnessing a transition to a new era where driverless cars will be pervasively connected to deliver significantly improved safety, traffic efficiency, and travel experiences. A diverse set of advanced vehicular use cases including connected autonomous vehicles will be made possible by building upon the emerging sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. Among many 6G wireless technologies, the principal objective of this paper is to introduce the potential benefits of the hybrid integration of Vehicular Visible Light Communication (V VLC) and Vehicular Radio Frequency (V RF) communication systems by studying the impact of interference as well as various meteorological phenomenon viz. rain, fog and dry snow. In particular, we show that regardless of any meteorological impact, a properly configured link-aggregated hybrid V-VLC/V-RF system is capable of meeting stringent ultra high reliability (&gt;99.999%) and ultra-low latency (&lt;3 ms) requirements, making it a promising candidate for 6G Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) Communications. To stimulate future research in the hybrid RF-VLC V2X space, we also highlight the potential challenges and research directions.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity and Contraction on Polyhedral Cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11576v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study monotone dynamical systems with respect to polyhedral cones. Using the half-space representation and the vertex representation, we propose three equivalent conditions to certify monotonicity of a dynamical system with respect to a polyhedral cone. We then introduce the notion of gauge norm associated with a cone and provide closed-from formulas for computing gauge norms associated with polyhedral cones. A key feature of gauge norms is that contractivity of monotone systems with respect to them can be efficiently characterized using simple inequalities. This result generalizes the well-known criteria for Hurwitzness of Metzler matrices and provides a scalable approach to search for Lyapunov functions of monotone systems with respect to polyhedral cones. Finally, we study the applications of our results in transient stability of dynamic flow networks and in scalable control design with safety guarantees.</description>

      <title>Active Learning of Discrete-Time Dynamics for Uncertainty-Aware Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12583v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model-based control requires an accurate model of the system dynamics for precisely and safely controlling the robot in complex and dynamic environments. Moreover, in the presence of variations in the operating conditions, the model should be continuously refined to compensate for dynamics changes. In this paper, we present a self-supervised learning approach that actively models the dynamics of nonlinear robotic systems. We combine offline learning from past experience and online learning from current robot interaction with the unknown environment. These two ingredients enable a highly sample-efficient and adaptive learning process, capable of accurately inferring model dynamics in real-time even in operating regimes that greatly differ from the training distribution. Moreover, we design an uncertainty-aware model predictive controller that is heuristically conditioned to the aleatoric (data) uncertainty of the learned dynamics. This controller actively chooses the optimal control actions that (i) optimize the control performance and (ii) improve the efficiency of online learning sample collection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a series of challenging real-world experiments using a quadrotor system. Our approach showcases high resilience and generalization capabilities by consistently adapting to unseen flight conditions, while it significantly outperforms classical and adaptive control baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.18237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of autonomous aerial systems, particularly for multi-robot configurations, is a complex challenge requiring multidisciplinary expertise. Unlike ground robotics, aerial robotics has seen limited standardization, leading to fragmented development efforts. To address this gap, we introduce Aerostack2, a comprehensive, open-source ROS 2 based framework designed for creating versatile and robust multi-robot aerial systems. Aerostack2 features platform independence, a modular plugin architecture, and behavior-based mission control, enabling easy customization and integration across various platforms. In this paper, we detail the full architecture of Aerostack2, which has been tested with several platforms in both simulation and real flights. We demonstrate its effectiveness through multiple validation scenarios, highlighting its potential to accelerate innovation and enhance collaboration in the aerial robotics community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15438v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In small satellites there is less room for heat control equipment, scientific instruments, and electronic components. Furthermore, the near proximity of electronic components makes power dissipation difficult, with the risk of not being able to control the temperature appropriately, reducing component lifetime and mission performance. To address this challenge, taking advantage of the advent of increasing intelligence on board satellites, an autonomous thermal control tool that uses deep reinforcement learning is proposed for learning the thermal control policy onboard. The tool was evaluated in a real space edge processing computer that will be used in a demonstration payload hosted in the International Space Station (ISS). The experiment results show that the proposed framework is able to learn to control the payload processing power to maintain the temperature under operational ranges, complementing traditional thermal control systems.</description>

      <title>Nonsmooth Projection-Free Optimization with Functional Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a subgradient-based algorithm for constrained nonsmooth convex optimization that does not require projections onto the feasible set. While the well-established Frank-Wolfe algorithm and its variants already avoid projections, they are primarily designed for smooth objective functions. In contrast, our proposed algorithm can handle nonsmooth problems with general convex functional inequality constraints. It achieves an $\epsilon$-suboptimal solution in $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations, with each iteration requiring only a single (potentially inexact) Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO) call and a (possibly inexact) subgradient computation. This performance is consistent with existing lower bounds. Similar performance is observed when deterministic subgradients are replaced with stochastic subgradients. In the special case where there are no functional inequality constraints, our algorithm competes favorably with a recent nonsmooth projection-free method designed for constraint-free problems. Our approach utilizes a simple separation scheme in conjunction with a new Lagrange multiplier update rule.</description>

      <title>Measurement and Modeling on Terahertz Channels in Rain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Terahertz (THz) frequency band offers a wide range of bandwidths, from tens to hundreds of gigahertz (GHz) and also supports data speeds of several terabits per second (Tbps). Because of this, maintaining THz channel reliability and efficiency in adverse weather conditions is crucial. Rain, in particular, disrupts THz channel propagation significantly and there is still lack of comprehensive investigations due to the involved experimental difficulties. This work explores how rain affects THz channel performance by conducting experiments in a rain emulation chamber and under actual rainy conditions outdoors. We focus on variables like rain intensity, raindrop size distribution (RDSD), and the channel's gradient height. We observe that the gradient height (for air-to-ground channel) can induce changes of the RDSD along the channel's path, impacting the precision of modeling efforts. To address this, we propose a theoretical model, integrating Mie scattering theory with considerations of channel's gradient height. Both our experimental and theoretical findings confirm this model's effectiveness in predicting THz channel behavior in rainy conditions. This work underscores the necessary in incorporating the variation of RDSD when THz channel travels in scenarios involving ground-to-air or air-to-ground communications.</description>

      <title>An experimental evaluation of Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms for HVAC control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05737v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems are a major driver of energy consumption in commercial and residential buildings. Recent studies have shown that Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms can outperform traditional reactive controllers. However, DRL-based solutions are generally designed for ad hoc setups and lack standardization for comparison. To fill this gap, this paper provides a critical and reproducible evaluation, in terms of comfort and energy consumption, of several state-of-the-art DRL algorithms for HVAC control. The study examines the controllers' robustness, adaptability, and trade-off between optimization goals by using the Sinergym framework. The results obtained confirm the potential of DRL algorithms, such as SAC and TD3, in complex scenarios and reveal several challenges related to generalization and incremental learning.</description>

      <title>AirPilot: Interpretable PPO-based DRL Auto-Tuned Nonlinear PID Drone Controller for Robust Autonomous Flights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00204v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Navigation precision, speed and stability are crucial for safe Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flight maneuvers and effective flight mission executions in dynamic environments. Different flight missions may have varying objectives, such as minimizing energy consumption, achieving precise positioning, or maximizing speed. A controller that can adapt to different objectives on the fly is highly valuable. Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controllers are one of the most popular and widely used control algorithms for drones and other control systems, but their linear control algorithm fails to capture the nonlinear nature of the dynamic wind conditions and complex drone system. Manually tuning the PID gains for various missions can be time-consuming and requires significant expertise. This paper aims to revolutionize drone flight control by presenting the AirPilot, a nonlinear Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) - enhanced Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) drone controller using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). AirPilot controller combines the simplicity and effectiveness of traditional PID control with the adaptability, learning capability, and optimization potential of DRL. This makes it better suited for modern drone applications where the environment is dynamic, and mission-specific performance demands are high. We employed a COEX Clover autonomous drone for training the DRL agent within the simulator and implemented it in a real-world lab setting, which marks a significant milestone as one of the first attempts to apply a DRL-based flight controller on an actual drone. Airpilot is capable of reducing the navigation error of the default PX4 PID position controller by 90%, improving effective navigation speed of a fine-tuned PID controller by 21%, reducing settling time and overshoot by 17% and 16% respectively.</description>

      <title>Perfecting Periodic Trajectory Tracking: Model Predictive Control with a Periodic Observer ($\Pi$-MPC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Model Predictive Control (MPC), discrepancies between the actual system and the predictive model can lead to substantial tracking errors and significantly degrade performance and reliability. While such discrepancies can be alleviated with more complex models, this often complicates controller design and implementation. By leveraging the fact that many trajectories of interest are periodic, we show that perfect tracking is possible when incorporating a simple observer that estimates and compensates for periodic disturbances. We present the design of the observer and the accompanying tracking MPC scheme, proving that their combination achieves zero tracking error asymptotically, regardless of the complexity of the unmodelled dynamics. We validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating asymptotically perfect tracking on a high-dimensional soft robot with nearly 10,000 states and a fivefold reduction in tracking errors compared to a baseline MPC on small-scale autonomous race car experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we make use of graphon theory to study opinion dynamics on large undirected networks. The opinion dynamics models that we take into consideration allow for negative interactions between the individuals, i.e. competing entities whose opinions can grow apart. We consider both the repelling model and the opposing model that are studied in the literature. We define the repelling and the opposing dynamics on graphons and we show that their initial value problem's solutions exist and are unique. We then show that the graphon dynamics well approximate the dynamics on large graphs that converge to a graphon. This result applies to large random graphs that are sampled according to a graphon. All these facts are illustrated in an extended numerical example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator framework holds promise for spectral analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems based on linear operators. Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator, so-called Koopman eigenvalues and Koopman eigenfunctions, respectively, mirror global properties of the system's flow. In this paper we perform the Koopman analysis of the singularly-perturbed van der Pol system. First, we show the spectral signature depending on singular perturbation: how two Koopman {principal} eigenvalues are ordered and what distinct shapes emerge in their associated Koopman eigenfunctions. Second, we discuss the singular limit of the Koopman operator, which is derived through the concatenation of Koopman operators for the fast and slow subsystems. From the spectral properties of the Koopman operator for the {singularly}-perturbed system and the singular limit, we suggest that the Koopman eigenfunctions inherit geometric properties of the singularly-perturbed system. These results are applicable to general planar singularly-perturbed systems with stable limit cycles.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Incentive Design with Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can the system operator learn an incentive mechanism that achieves social optimality based on limited information about the agents' behavior, who are dynamically updating their strategies? To answer this question, we propose an \emph{adaptive} incentive mechanism. This mechanism updates the incentives of agents based on the feedback of each agent's externality, evaluated as the difference between the player's marginal cost and society's marginal cost at each time step. The proposed mechanism updates the incentives on a slower timescale compared to the agents' learning dynamics, resulting in a two-timescale coupled dynamical system. Notably, this mechanism is agnostic to the specific learning dynamics used by agents to update their strategies. We show that any fixed point of this adaptive incentive mechanism corresponds to the optimal incentive mechanism, ensuring that the Nash equilibrium coincides with the socially optimal strategy. Additionally, we provide sufficient conditions that guarantee the convergence of the adaptive incentive mechanism to a fixed point. Our results apply to both atomic and non-atomic games. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism, we verify the convergence conditions in two practically relevant games: atomic networked quadratic aggregative games and non-atomic network routing games.</description>

      <title>Control of Unknown Quadrotors from a Single Throw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11723v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a method to recover quadrotor UAV from a throw, when no control parameters are known before the throw. We leverage the availability of high-frequency rotor speed feedback available in racing drone hardware and software to find control effectiveness values and fit a motor model using recursive least squares (RLS) estimation. Furthermore, we propose an excitation sequence that provides large actuation commands while guaranteeing to stay within gyroscope sensing limits. After 450ms of excitation, an INDI attitude controller uses the 52 fitted parameters to arrest rotational motion and recover an upright attitude. Finally, a NDI position controller drives the craft to a position setpoint. The proposed algorithm runs efficiently on microcontrollers found in common UAV flight controllers, and was shown to recover an agile quadrotor every time in 57 live experiments with as low as 3.5m throw height, demonstrating robustness against initial rotations and noise. We also demonstrate control of randomized quadrotors in simulated throws, where the parameter fitting RMS error is typically within 10% of the true value.

      <title>PID Accelerated Temporal Difference Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-horizon tasks, which have a large discount factor, pose a challenge for most conventional reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Algorithms such as Value Iteration and Temporal Difference (TD) learning have a slow convergence rate and become inefficient in these tasks. When the transition distributions are given, PID VI was recently introduced to accelerate the convergence of Value Iteration using ideas from control theory. Inspired by this, we introduce PID TD Learning and PID Q-Learning algorithms for the RL setting, in which only samples from the environment are available. We give a theoretical analysis of the convergence of PID TD Learning and its acceleration compared to the conventional TD Learning. We also introduce a method for adapting PID gains in the presence of noise and empirically verify its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Efficient Discovery of Actual Causality using Abstraction-Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16629</link>

Abstract: Causality is the relationship where one event contributes to the production of another, with the cause being partly responsible for the effect and the effect partly dependent on the cause. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective method to formally reason about the causal effect of events in engineered systems, with application for finding the root-cause of safety violations in embedded and cyber-physical systems. We are motivated by the notion of actual causality by Halpern and Pearl, which focuses on the causal effect of particular events rather than type-level causality, which attempts to make general statements about scientific and natural phenomena. Our first contribution is formulating discovery of actual causality in computing systems modeled by transition systems as an SMT solving problem.
  Since datasets for causality analysis tend to be large, in order to tackle the scalability problem of automated formal reasoning, our second contribution is a novel technique based on abstraction-refinement that allows identifying for actual causes within smaller abstract causal models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach (by several orders of magnitude) using three case studies to find the actual cause of violations of safety in (1) a neural network controller for a Mountain Car, (2) a controller for a Lunar Lander obtained by reinforcement learning, and (3) an MPC controller for an F-16 autopilot simulator.</description>

      <title>Online-Score-Aided Federated Learning: Taming the Resource Constraints in Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While FL is a widely popular distributed ML strategy that protects data privacy, time-varying wireless network parameters and heterogeneous system configurations of the wireless device pose significant challenges. Although the limited radio and computational resources of the network and the clients, respectively, are widely acknowledged, two critical yet often ignored aspects are (a) wireless devices can only dedicate a small chunk of their limited storage for the FL task and (b) new training samples may arrive in an online manner in many practical wireless applications. Therefore, we propose a new FL algorithm called OSAFL, specifically designed to learn tasks relevant to wireless applications under these practical considerations. Since it has long been proven that under extreme resource constraints, clients may perform an arbitrary number of local training steps, which may lead to client drift under statistically heterogeneous data distributions, we leverage normalized gradient similarities and exploit weighting clients' updates based on optimized scores that facilitate the convergence rate of the proposed OSAFL algorithm. Our extensive simulation results on two different tasks -- each with three different datasets -- with four popular ML models validate the effectiveness of OSAFL compared to six existing state-of-the-art FL baselines.</description>

      <title>Behavioral Learning of Dish Rinsing and Scrubbing based on Interruptive Direct Teaching Considering Assistance Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robots are expected to manipulate objects in a safe and dexterous way. For example, washing dishes is a dexterous operation that involves scrubbing the dishes with a sponge and rinsing them with water. It is necessary to learn it safely without splashing water and without dropping the dishes. In this study, we propose a safe and dexterous manipulation system. The robot learns a dynamics model of the object by estimating the state of the object and the robot itself, the control input, and the amount of human assistance required (assistance rate) after the human corrects the initial trajectory of the robot's hands by interruptive direct teaching. By backpropagating the error between the estimated and the reference value using the acquired dynamics model, the robot can generate a control input that approaches the reference value, for example, so that human assistance is not required and the dish does not move excessively. This allows for adaptive rinsing and scrubbing of dishes with unknown shapes and properties. As a result, it is possible to generate safe actions that require less human assistance.</description>
