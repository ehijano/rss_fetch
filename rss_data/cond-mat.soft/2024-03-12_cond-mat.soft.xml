      <title>Migration and separation of polymers in non-uniform active baths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer-like structures are ubiquitous in nature and synthetic materials. Their configurational and migration properties are often affected by crowded environments leading to non-thermal fluctuations. Here, we study an ideal Rouse chain in contact with a non-homogeneous active bath, characterized by the presence of active self-propelled agents which exert time-correlated forces on the chain. By means of a coarse-graining procedure, we derive an effective evolution for the center of mass of the chain and show its tendency to migrate towards and preferentially localize in regions of high/low bath activity depending on the model parameters. In particular, we demonstrate that an active bath with non-uniform activity can be used to separate efficiently polymeric species with different lengths and/or connectivity.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Balance for Differential Constitutive Models under Oscillatory Shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harmonic balance (HB) is a popular Fourier-Galerkin method used in the analysis of nonlinear vibration problems where dynamical systems are subjected to periodic forcing. We adapt HB to find the periodic steady-state response of nonlinear differential constitutive models subjected to large amplitude oscillatory shear flow. By incorporating the alternating-frequency-time scheme into HB, we develop a computer program called FLASH (acronym for Fast Large Amplitude Simulation using Harmonic balance), which makes it convenient to apply HB to any differential constitutive model. We validate FLASH by considering two representative constitutive models, viz., the exponential Phan-Thien Tanner model and a nonlinear temporary network model. In terms of accuracy and speed, FLASH outperforms the conventional approach of solving initial value problems by numerical integration via time-stepping methods often by several orders of magnitude. We discuss how FLASH can be conveniently extended for other nonlinear constitutive models, which opens up potential applications in model calibration and selection, and stability analysis.</description>

      <title>Training physical matter to matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological systems offer a great many examples of how sophisticated, highly adapted behavior can emerge from training. Here we discuss how training might be used to impart similarly adaptive properties in physical matter. As a special form of materials processing, training differs in important ways from standard approaches of obtaining sought after material properties. In particular, rather than designing or programming the local configurations and interactions of constituents, training uses externally applied stimuli to evolve material properties. This makes it possible to obtain different functionalities from the same starting material (pluripotency). Furthermore, training evolves a material in-situ or under conditions similar to those during the intended use; thus, material performance can improve rather than degrade over time. We discuss requirements for trainability, outline recently developed training strategies for creating soft materials with multiple, targeted and adaptable functionalities, and provide examples where the concept of training has been applied to materials on length scales from the molecular to the macroscopic.</description>

      <title>Multiphysics Modeling of Surface Diffusion Coupled with Large Deformation in 3D Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical and computational model that explores the behavior of a thin hydrated film bonded to a non-hydrated / impermeable soft substrate in the context of surface and bulk elasticity coupled with surface diffusion kinetics. This type of coupling can manifests as an integral aspect in diverse engineering processes encountered in optical interference coatings, tissue engineering, soft electronics, and can prove important in design process for the next generation of sensors and actuators, especially as the focus is shifted to systems in smaller lengthscales. The intricate interplay between solvent diffusion and deformation of the film is governed by surface poroelasticity, and the viscoelastic deformation of the substrate. While existing methodologies offer tools for studying coupled poroelasticity involving solvent diffusion and network deformation, there exists a gap in understanding how coupled poroelastic processes occurring in a film attached to the boundary of a highly deformable solid can influence its response. In this study, we introduce a non-equilibrium thermodynamics formulation encompassing the multiphysical processes of surface poroelasticity and bulk viscoelasticity, complemented by a corresponding finite element implementation. Our approach captures the complex dynamics between the finite deformation of the substrate and solvent diffusion on the surface. This work contributes valuable insights, particularly in scenarios where the coupling of surface diffusion kinetics and substrate elasticity is an important design factor.</description>

      <title>Beyond Pairwise: Higher-order physical interactions affect phase separation in multi-component liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase separation, crucial for spatially segregating biomolecules in cells, is well-understood in the simple case of a few components with pairwise interactions. Yet, biological cells challenge the simple picture in at least two ways: First, biomolecules, like proteins and nucleic acids, exhibit complex, higher-order interactions, where a single molecule may interact with multiple others simultaneously. Second, cells comprise a myriad of different components that form various droplets. Such multicomponent phase separation has been studied in the simple case of pairwise interactions, but an analysis of higher-order interactions is lacking. We propose such a theory and study the corresponding phase diagrams numerically. We find that interactions between three components are similar to pairwise interactions, whereas composition-dependent higher-order interactions between two components can oppose phase separation. This surprising result can only be revealed from the equilibrium phase diagrams, implying that the often-used stability analysis of homogeneous states is inadequate to study these systems. We thus show that higher-order interactions could play a crucial role in forming droplets in cells, and their manipulation could offer novel approaches to controlling multicomponent phase separation.</description>

      <title>Jeffery Orbits with Noise Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of non-spherical particles in a shear-flow is of significant practical and theoretical interest. These systems have been the object of numerous investigations since the pioneering work of Jeffery a century ago. His eponymous orbits describe the deterministic motion of an isolated, rod-like particle in a shear flow. Subsequently, the effect of adding noise was investigated. The theory has been applied to colloidal particles, macromolecules, anisometric granular particles and most recently to microswimmers, for example bacteria. We study the Jeffery orbits of elongated particles subject to noise using Langevin simulations and a Fokker-Planck equation. We extend the analytical solution for infinitely thin needles ($\beta=1$) obtained by Doi and Edwards to particles with arbitrary shape factor ($0\le \beta\le 1$) and validate the theory by comparing it with simulations. We examine the rotation of the particle around the vorticity axis and study the orientational order matrix. We use the latter to obtain scalar order parameters $s$ and $r$ describing nematic ordering and biaxiality from the orientational distribution function. The value of $s$ (nematic ordering) increases monotonically with increasing P\'eclet number, while $r$ (measure of biaxiality) displays a maximum value. From perturbation theory we obtain simple expressions that provide accurate descriptions at low noise (or large P\'eclet numbers). We also examine the orientational distribution in the v-grad v plane and in the perpendicular direction. Finally we present the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation for a strictly two-dimensional (2D) system. For the same noise amplitude the average rotation speed of the particle in 3D is larger than in 2D.</description>

      <title>A perspective on active glassy dynamics in biological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamics is central to living systems. In the last two decades, experiments have revealed that the dynamics in diverse biological systems - from intracellular cytoplasm to cellular and organismal aggregates - are remarkably similar to that in dense systems of inanimate particles in equilibrium. They show a glass transition from a solid-like jammed state to a fluid-like flowing state, where a moderate change in control parameter leads to an enormous variation in relaxation time. However, biological systems have crucial differences from the equilibrium systems: the former have activity that drives them out of equilibrium, novel control parameters, and enormous levels of complexity. These active systems showing glassy dynamics are known as active glasses. The field is at the interface of physics and biology, freely borrowing tools from both disciplines and promising novel, fascinating discoveries. We review the experiments that started this field, simulations that have been instrumental for insights, and theories that have helped unify diverse phenomena, reveal correlations, and make novel quantitative predictions. We discuss the primary characteristics that define a glassy system. For most concepts, we first discuss the known equilibrium scenario and then present the key aspects when activity is introduced. We end the article with a discussion of the challenges in the field and possible future directions.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Polyalkylfluorene Conjugated Polymers: Insights from Neutron Spectroscopy and Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamics of the conjugated polymers poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene) (PF8) and poly(9,9-didodecylfluorene) (PF12), differing by the length of their side chains, is investigated in the amorphous phase using the quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) technique. The neutron spectroscopy measurements are synergistically underpinned by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The probe is focused on the picosecond time scale where the structural dynamics of both PF8 and PF12 would mainly be dominated by the motions of their side chains. The measurements highlighted temperature-induced dynamics reflected in the broadening of the QENS spectra upon heating. The MD simulations reproduced well the observations, hence the neutron measurements validate the MD force fields, the adopted amorphous model structures and the numerical procedure. As the QENS spectra are dominated by the signal from the hydrogens on the backbones and side chains of PF8 and PF12, extensive analysis of the MD simulations allowed: (i) tagging these hydrogens, (ii) estimating their contributions to the self part of the van Hove functions and hence to the QENS spectra, and (iii) determining the activation energies of the different motions involving the tagged hydrogens. PF12 is found to exhibit broader QENS spectra than PF8, signature of a more pronounced motions of the didodecyl chains as compared to dioctyl chains. This is in agreement with the outcome of our MD analysis: (i) confirming a lower glass transition temperature of PF12 compared to PF8, (ii) showing PF12 having a lower density than PF8, and (iii) highlighting lower activation energies of the motions of PF12 in comparison with PF8. This study helped gaining insights into the temperature-induced side chains dynamics of the PF8 and PF12 conjugated polymers influencing their stability, and thus could practically impact the performance of the associated optoelectronic active layer.</description>

      <title>Memory in cyclically crumpled sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the crumpling of a sheet as it is repeatedly crushed onto itself by rolling it into a cylinder and twisting it axially while allowing the end-to-end length to evolve freely. As deduced from its plastic deformations, the sheet creases and collapses into structures which repeat and sharpen over hundreds of cycles to a remarkable degree before forming new configurations. The observed metastablilty increases with applied cycles leading to recurrent structures over a significant range of loading, but reconfigurations can continue to occur for large enough loading as the creases develop tears. The evolution of the sheet structure as measured by the mean curvature and the total crease length is found to increase logarithmically with cycle number with a rate which increases with degree of compression. We explain the overall extent of creasing using flat folding models, and show the logarithmic growth as being a consequence of individual creases becoming sharper with number of folding cycles, and due to the bifurcation in the curvature field leading to the formation of new creases and folding pathways. Thus, we show that elastoplastic sheets can follow complex folding pathways to form convergent structures after a sufficiently large number of training cycles provided material fatigue remains unimportant.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent droplet detachment behaviour from wettability-engineered fibers during fog harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water collection from natural and industrial fogs has recently been viewed as a viable freshwater source. An interesting outgrowth of the relevant research as focused on arresting of the drift losses (un-evaporated and re-condensed water droplets present in the exhaust plume from industrial cooling towers. Such exploits in fog collection have implemented metal and polyester meshes as fog water collectors (FWC). Fog droplets impinge and deposit on mesh fibers. They coalesce with previously deposited liquid to evolve as larger drops before detaching from the fibers under their own weight, an event largely dependent on the mesh fiber wettability, diameter and its arrangement relative to the fog flow. To better estimate drainage and hence collection from these fibers, the study, focuses on droplet detachment from differently wetted horizontally positioned cylindrical fibers of various diameters, placed orthogonally in the path of an oncoming fog. Droplet detachment volume is found to increase with fiber diameter and fiber surface wettability. Interestingly, in a typical fogging condition, the detachment volume is also found to exhibit a time-dependent behaviour, altering the droplet detachment criteria otherwise predicted from emulation. Our current study sheds light on this unexplored phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Universal Origin of Glassy Relaxation as Recognized by Configuration Pattern-matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relaxation processes are crucial in understanding the structural rearrangements of liquids and amorphous materials. However, the overarching principle that governs these processes across vastly different materials remains an open question. Substantial analysis has been carried out based on the motions of individual particles. Here, alternatively, we propose viewing the global configuration as a single entity. We introduce a global order parameter, namely the inherent structure minimal displacement (IS Dmin), to quantify the variability of configurations by a pattern-matching technique. Through atomic simulations of seven model glass-forming liquids, we unify the influences of temperature, pressure, and perturbation time on the relaxation dissipation, via a scaling law between the mechanical damping factor and IS Dmin. Fundamentally, this scaling reflects the curvature of the local potential energy landscape. Our findings uncover a universal origin of glassy relaxation and offer an alternative approach to studying disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Elasticity affects the shock-induced aerobreakup of a polymeric droplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boger fluids are viscoelastic liquids having constant viscosity for a broad range of shear rates. They are commonly used to separate the effects of liquid elasticity from viscosity in any experiment. We present an experimental study on the shock-induced aerobreakup of a Boger fluid droplet in the Shear-induced entrainment (SIE) and catastrophic breakup regime (Weber number ranging from ~ 800 to 5000). The results are compared with the aerobreakup of a Newtonian droplet having similar viscosity, and with shear-thinning droplets. The study aims to identify the role of liquid elasticity without the added complexity of simultaneous shear-thinning behavior. It is observed that at the early stages of droplet breakup, liquid elasticity plays an insignificant role, and all the fluids show similar behavior. However, during the late stages, the impact of liquid elasticity becomes dominant, which results in a markedly different morphology of the fragmenting liquid mass compared to a Newtonian droplet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective interactions that violate Newton's third law of action-reaction symmetry are common in systems where interactions are mediated by a non-equilibrium environment. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations are carried out on a two-dimensional Ising model, where the interactions are modified non-reciprocally. We demonstrate that the critical temperature decreases as the non-reciprocity increases and this decrease depends only on the magnitude of non-reciprocity. Further, travelling spin waves due to the local fluctuations in magnetisation are observed and these spin waves travel opposite to the non-reciprocity vector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work on distinct multicellular organisms has revealed a hitherto unknown type of biological noise; rather than a regular arrangement, cellular neighborhood volumes, obtained by Voronoi tessellations of the cell locations, are broadly distributed and consistent with gamma distributions. We propose an explanation for those observations in the case of the alga $Volvox$, whose somatic cells are embedded in an extracellular matrix (ECM) they export. Both a solvable one-dimensional model of ECM growth derived from bursty transcriptional activity and a two-dimensional "Voronoi liquid" model are shown to provide one-parameter families that smoothly interpolate between the empirically-observed near-maximum-entropy gamma distributions and the crystalline limit of Gaussian distributions governed by the central limit theorem. These results highlight a universal consequence of intrinsic biological noise on the architecture of certain tissues.</description>

      <title>Simulation aspects of patterning polymer films via evaporative lithography and composite substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The continuing development of evaporative lithography is important for many areas such as the creation of photonic crystals for optronics and microelectronics, the development of biosensors for medical applications and biotechnology, and for the formation of functional coatings for nanotechnology, including the application of thin, protective polymer coatings. The article proposes a mathematical model that allows us to explain the basic mechanisms of the formation of thin polymer films (less than 50 $\mu$m thick) during their deposition onto a composite substrate by methanol evaporation from a solution. If the thermal conductivity of the substrate is spatially non-uniform, this results in inhomogeneous evaporation along the free film surface. Therefore, as the film dries, a patterned polymer coating is left behind on the substrate. The mathematical model described here is based on the lubrication approximation and takes into account the dependence of the solution density on the concentration. The numerical computation results are in qualitative agreement with the experimental data of other authors. The article shows that solutal Marangoni flow plays a primary role in the process under consideration. This study allows us to better understand the mechanisms that can be used in evaporative lithography.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the reentrant condensation of sparsely charged polyelectrolytes in dilute solutions of small multivalent salts, whose phase-transition mechanism remains poorly understood. By extending the concept of cosolute-assisted "physical crosslinking" effect proposed recently by Sommer (DOIs: 10.1021/acs.macromol.8b00370 and 10.1021/acs.macromol.6b02231),in this work we construct a simple but effective mean-field model which can rationalize the essential features of the reentrant condensation including the phase diagram of sparsely charged polyelectrolyte. The model unveils that the strong adsorption between the ionic monomers and multivalent ions can be at the origin of the peculiar phenomenon that rather low concentrations of multivalent salts trigger both collapse and re-entry transitions. The analytical solution of the model indicates that a minimum of coupling energy due to sharing multivalent salt ions between ionic monomers is essential for a phase transition to occur, which can explain the enigmatic observation that the sparsely charged polyelectrolytes can only show phase transition in a dilute solution of salts with selective multivalency. Our analytical calculations also show that the incompatibility of the uncharged moieties of the polyelectrolytes with water is critical to regulate phase behaviors of sparsely charged polyelectrolytes in aqueous solutions. This is in agreement with recent experimental investigations on solution properties of amphiphilic proteins. We envisage that this work will shed light on the understanding of reentrant condensation in biological processes where the multivalent ions bound to biopolymers (such as RNAs and proteins) plays an essential role, which remains under debate.</description>

      <title>On quantum melting of superfluid vortex crystals: from Lifshitz scalar to dual gravity</title>

Abstract: Despite a long history of studies of vortex crystals in rotating superfluids, their melting due to quantum fluctuations is poorly understood. Here we develop a fracton-elasticity duality to investigate a two-dimensional vortex lattice within the fast rotation regime, where the Lifshitz model of the collective Tkachenko mode serves as the leading-order low-energy effective theory. We incorporate topological defects and discuss several quantum melting scenarios triggered by their proliferation. Furthermore, we lay the groundwork for a dual non-linear emergent gravity description of the superfluid vortex crystals.</description>

      <title>In situ coherent X-ray scattering reveals polycrystalline structure and discrete annealing events in strongly-coupled nanocrystal superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solution-phase bottom up self-assembly of nanocrystals into superstructures such as ordered superlattices is an attractive strategy to generate functional materials of increasing complexity, including very recent advances that incorporate strong interparticle electronic coupling. While the self-assembly kinetics in these systems have been elucidated and related to the product characteristics, the weak interparticle bonding interactions suggest the superstructures formed could continue to order within the solution long after the primary nucleation and growth have occurred, even though the mechanism of annealing remains to be elucidated. Here, we use a combination of Bragg coherent diffractive imaging and X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy to create real-space maps of supercrystalline order along with a real-time view of the strain fluctuations in aging strongly coupled nanocrystal superlattices while they remain suspended and immobilized in solution. By combining the results, we deduce that the self-assembled superstructures are polycrystalline, initially comprising multiple nucleation sites, and that shear avalanches at grain boundaries continue to increase crystallinity long after growth has substantially slowed. This multimodal approach should be generalizable to characterize a breadth of materials in situ in their native chemical environments, thus extending the reach of high-resolution coherent X-ray characterization to the benefit of a much wider range of physical systems.</description>
