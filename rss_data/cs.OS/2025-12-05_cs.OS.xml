      <title>VLCs: Managing Parallelism with Virtualized Libraries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the complexity and scale of modern parallel machines continue to grow, programmers increasingly rely on composition of software libraries to encapsulate and exploit parallelism. However, many libraries are not designed with composition in mind and assume they have exclusive access to all resources. Using such libraries concurrently can result in contention and degraded performance. Prior solutions involve modifying the libraries or the OS, which is often infeasible.
  We propose Virtual Library Contexts (VLCs), which are process subunits that encapsulate sets of libraries and associated resource allocations. VLCs control the resource utilization of these libraries without modifying library code. This enables the user to partition resources between libraries to prevent contention, or load multiple copies of the same library to allow parallel execution of otherwise thread-unsafe code within the same process.
  In this paper, we describe and evaluate C++ and Python prototypes of VLCs. Experiments show VLCs enable a speedup up to 2.85x on benchmarks including applications using OpenMP, OpenBLAS, and LibTorch.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Operating System Kernel Fuzzing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16165v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Operating System (OS) kernel is foundational in modern computing, especially with the proliferation of diverse computing devices. However, its development also comes with vulnerabilities that can lead to severe security breaches. Kernel fuzzing, a technique used to uncover these vulnerabilities, poses distinct challenges when compared to user-space fuzzing. These include the complexity of configuring the testing environment and addressing the statefulness inherent to both the kernel and the fuzzing process. Despite the significant interest from the community, a comprehensive understanding of kernel fuzzing remains lacking, hindering further progress in the field. In this paper, we present the first systematic study focused specifically on OS kernel fuzzing. We begin by outlining the unique challenges of kernel fuzzing, which distinguish it from those in user space. Following this, we summarize the progress of 107 academic studies from top-tier venues between 2017 and 2025. To structure this analysis, we introduce a stage-based fuzzing model and a novel fuzzing taxonomy that highlights nine core functionalities unique to kernel fuzzing. Each of these functionalities is examined in conjunction with the methodological approaches employed to address them. Finally, we identify remaining gaps in addressing challenges and outline promising directions to guide forthcoming research in kernel security.</description>
