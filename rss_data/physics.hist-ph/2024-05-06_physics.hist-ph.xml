      <title>Kolmogorovian Censorship, Predictive Incompleteness, and the locality loophole in Bell experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the foundations of quantum mechanics, the Kolmogorovian Censorship (KC) stipulates that quantum probabilities can be identified with classical, Kolmogorovian probabilities when considering a specified measurement context. Then in any given measurement context it is possible to build a Kolmogorovian probability distribution, or equivalently a hidden variable theory; however this distribution must be matched to the chosen context. In a loophole-free Bell test, the remote random choices of measurements (polarizers orientations) have the purpose to prevent that this matching can be obtained from any relativistically causal transmission between the source and the detectors. Then the matching (required to violate Bell's inequalities) may be obtained either by an instantaneous influence at a distance between the source and the detectors (explicit nonlocality), or by assuming that it is pre-established before the actual experiment takes place (super-determinism). If both influence at a distance and super-determinism are not accepted on physical grounds, a third way is still available, called "predictive incompleteness": it tells that the usual quantum state $\psi$ is incomplete, as long as the measurement context has not been specified. In agreement with the general quantum framework called CSM (Contexts, Systems and Modalities) we argue that predictive incompleteness is the correct quantum way to understand the violation of Bell's inequalities.</description>

      <title>The Decoherent Arrow of Time and the Entanglement Past Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If an asymmetry in time does not arise from the fundamental dynamical laws of physics, it may be found in special boundary conditions. The argument normally goes that since thermodynamic entropy in the past is lower than in the future according to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, then tracing this back to the time around the Big Bang means the universe must have started off in a state of very low thermodynamic entropy: the Thermodynamic Past Hypothesis. In this paper, we consider another boundary condition that plays a similar role, but for the decoherent arrow of time, i.e. the quantum state of the universe is more mixed in the future than in the past. According to what we call the Entanglement Past Hypothesis, the initial quantum state of the universe had very low entanglement entropy. We clarify the content of the Entanglement Past Hypothesis, compare it with the Thermodynamic Past Hypothesis, and identify some challenges and open questions for future research.</description>
