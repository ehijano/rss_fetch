      <title>Compartmental-reaction diffusion framework for microscale dynamics of extracellular serotonin in brain tissue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) is a major neurotransmitter whose release from densely distributed serotonergic varicosities shapes plasticity and network integration throughout the brain, yet its extracellular dynamics remain poorly understood due to the sub-micrometer and millisecond scales involved. We develop a mathematical framework that captures the coupled reaction-diffusion processes governing serotonin signaling in realistic tissue microenvironments. Formulating a two-dimensional compartmental-reaction diffusion system, we use strong localized perturbation theory to derive an asymptotically equivalent set of nonlinear integro-ODEs that preserve diffusive coupling while enabling efficient computation. We analyze period-averaged steady states, establish bounds using Jensen's inequality, obtain closed-form spike maxima and minima, and implement a fast marching-scheme solver based on sum-of-exponentials kernels. These mathematical results provide quantitative insight into how firing frequency, varicosity geometry, and uptake kinetics shape extracellular serotonin. The model reveals that varicosities form diffusively coupled microdomains capable of generating spatial "serotonin reservoirs," clarifies aspects of local versus volume transmission, and yields predictions relevant to interpreting high-resolution serotonin imaging and the actions of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of thrombin inhibition by protein S and the TFPI{\alpha}-fVshort-protein S complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein S (PS) is a notable anticoagulant implicated in both bleeding and thrombotic disorders, making it a promising drug target. Importantly, PS enhances the anticoagulant function of TFPI$\alpha$, likely circulating in the bloodstream together with TFPI$\alpha$ and a truncated form of factor V (fVshort) in the trimolecular complex, TFPI$\alpha$-fVshort-PS, which we call protein S complex (PSC). PSC has been proposed to strongly inhibit thrombin production by enhancing the ability of TFPI$\alpha$ to inhibit clotting factor Xa up to 100-fold and by localizing to platelet membranes, limiting fXa activity shortly after coagulation starts.
  Yet, exactly how PS functions with TFPI$\alpha$ as an anticoagulant remains poorly understood. To investigate, we extend an experimentally validated mathematical model of blood coagulation to include PSC and free PS (not part of PSC) in the plasma, as well as free PS and TFPI$\alpha$ in platelets. We find that shortly after coagulation initiation, PSC strongly inhibits thrombin production. We find that the (unknown) magnitude of the enhanced affinity of PSC binding to inhibit fXa critically regulates PSC's impact on thrombin production. We find that under flow, PSC can unexpectedly accumulate on platelets to concentrations ~50 times higher than in the plasma. We also find that PSC limits thrombin production by occupying fV-specific binding sites on platelets.
  Our results show that changes in PSC can dramatically impact severity of pathological bleeding disorders. For the east Texas bleeding disorder, elevated PSC concentrations eliminate thrombin bursts, leading to bleeding. With fV deficiency, reducing PSC rescues thrombin production in severe fV deficiency and returns thrombin production due to mild fV deficiency to normal. Finally, thrombin production in severe hemophilia A can be substantially improved by blocking PSC's anticoagulant function.</description>

      <title>Nano-engineered surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy substrates for probing tissue-material interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Innovation in biomaterials has brought both breakthroughs and new challenges in medicine, as implant materials have become increasingly multifunctional and complex. One of the greatest issues is the difficulty in assessing the temporal and multidimensional dynamics of tissue-implant interactions. Implant biology remains hard to decipher without a noninvasive and multiplexed technique that can accurately monitor real-time biological processes. To address this, we developed a multifunctional, self-sensing implant material composed of gold nano-columns patterned on a titanium surface (AuNC-Ti). This material acts as a nanoengineered surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) substrate that amplifies biological Raman signals at the tissue-implant interface, providing the ability to sense tissue-material interactions in a multiplexed and nondestructive manner. AuNC-Ti SERS substrates were fabricated using oblique angle deposition (OAD) and characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to show uniform formation of AuNCs ($360 \pm 40$ nm in length and $50 \pm 16$ nm in width). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and contact angle measurements demonstrated biocompatible surface chemistry with ideal wettability. Biocompatibility was further demonstrated via in vitro cytotoxicity assays on human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) cultured on AuNC-Ti surfaces. The median SERS enhancement factor (EF) was calculated to be $1.8 \times 10^5$, and spatial identification of reporter molecules and porcine tissue components on AuNC-Ti surfaces was demonstrated using confocal Raman imaging and multivariate analysis. Our approach utilizes unlabeled SERS and machine learning, promising multiplexed characterization of tissue-material interactions and subsequently enabling tissue state determination and non-invasive monitoring of implant-tissue interaction.</description>
