      <title>Dynamical correlation functions for the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the dynamical current and kinetic-energy correlation functions for the first Mott lobe of the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model. We employ the strong-coupling expansion up to sixth order in $x=t/U$, and the dynamical density-matrix renormalization group method on rings with 64 sites. The correlation functions are finite above the single-particle gap with a square-root onset, as is also found from field theory close to the Mott transition. The correlation functions display a featureless superposition of the primary and tertiary Hubbard bands. We find very good agreement between all methods in the interaction/frequency regimes where they are applicable.</description>

      <title>Quantics Tensor Train for solving Gross-Pitaevskii equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum-inspired solver for the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation in the Quantics Tensor-Train (QTT) representation. By evolving the system entirely within a low-rank tensor manifold, the method sidesteps the memory and runtime barriers that limit conventional finite-difference and spectral schemes. Two complementary algorithms are developed: an imaginary-time projector that drives the condensate toward its variational ground state and a rank-adapted fourth-order Runge-Kutta integrator for real-time dynamics. The framework captures a broad range of physical scenarios - including barrier-confined condensates, quasi-random potentials, long-range dipolar interactions, and multicomponent spinor dynamics - without leaving the compressed representation. Relative to standard discretizations, the QTT approach achieves an exponential reduction in computational resources while retaining quantitative accuracy, thereby extending the practicable regime of Gross-Pitaevskii simulations on classical hardware. These results position tensor networks as a practical bridge between high-performance classical computing and prospective quantum hardware for the numerical treatment of nonlinear Schrodinger-type partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Effective anisotropic interaction potentials for pairs of ultracold molecules shielded by a static electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum gases of ultracold polar molecules have novel properties because of the strong dipolar forces between molecules. Current experiments shield the molecules from destructive collisions by engineering long-range repulsive interactions using microwave or static electric fields. These shielding methods produce interaction potentials with large repulsive cores that are not well described with contact potentials. In this paper we explore the anisotropic interaction potentials that arise for pairs of polar molecules shielded with static electric fields. We derive computationally inexpensive approximations for the potentials that are suitable for use in calculations of many-body properties. The interaction potentials for molecules shielded with static fields are qualitatively different from those that arise from single-field microwave shielding and will produce quite different many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Index Theorem and Vortex Kinetics in Bose-Einstein Condensates on a Haldane Sphere with a Magnetic Monopole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometry-gauge interplay constitutes a fundamental issue in quantum physics, with profound implications spanning from quantum gravity to topological matter. Here, we investigate the dynamic effects of geometry-gauge interplay in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) on a Haldane sphere with a magnetic monopole. We reveal an index theorem that establishes a correspondence between BEC vortices and the topology of the gauge field, enabling the construction of vortex-monopole composites. Furthermore, we derive the universal logarithmic interaction between composites, which governs the structure of the ground-state vortex lattice. By developing a kinetic theory, we predict scale-invariant vortex dynamics and an emergent duality. Both are confirmed through numerical simulations. This work first presents the dynamical coupling mechanism between spatial geometry and gauge fields, providing deep insights into superfluid systems with topological gauge structures in curved space.</description>

      <title>Entropy production and statistical relaxation of dipolar bosons and fermions in interaction quench dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of dipolar bosons and fermions after a sudden change in the interaction strength from zero to a finite repulsive value. We simulate the interaction quench on the initial state which is the ground state of harmonic potential with noninteracting bosons and fermions. We solve the time-dependent many-boson Schr\"odinger equation exactly using numerical methods. To understand the many-body dynamics we analyze several measures of many-body information entropy, monitoring their time evolution and assessing their dependence on interaction strength. We establish that for weak interaction quench the dynamics is statistics independent, both dipolar bosons and fermions do not relax. Whereas it is significantly different for dipolar bosons from that of dipolar fermions in the stronger interaction quench. When dipolar bosons exhibit concurrent signature of relaxation in all entropy measures, dipolar fermions fail to relax. For dipolar bosons and for larger interaction quench, the many-body information entropy measures dynamically approach the value predicted for the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices, implying statistical relaxation. The relaxation time is uniquely determined when the orbital fragmentation exhibits a $1/M$ population in each orbital ($M$ is the number of orbitals) and all entropy measures saturate to the maximum entropy values. The relaxation time also becomes independent of the strength of dipolar interaction. Whereas, for the same quench protocol, dipolar fermions exhibit modulated oscillations in all entropy dynamics. Our study is also complemented by the measures of delocalization in Hilbert space, clearly establishing the onset of chaos for strongly interacting dipolar bosons. It highlights the importance of many-body effects with a possible exploration in quantum simulation with ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Microscopy of Ultracold Fermions in Optical Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lecture notes review recent progress in studying the Fermi-Hubbard model using ultracold gases in optical lattices. We focus on results from quantum gas microscope experiments that have allowed site-resolved measurements of charge and spin correlations in half-filled and doped Hubbard systems, as well as direct imaging of various types of polaronic quasiparticles. We also review experiments exploring dynamical properties of the Hubbard model through transport and spectroscopy. Moving beyond the plain-vanilla square-lattice Hubbard model, we present more recent work exploring Hubbard systems with novel lattice geometries and long-range interactions that stabilize new phases. Finally, we discuss the realization of entropy distribution protocols to cool these systems to ultralow temperatures where comparison to unbiased numerics is no longer possible.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological model of decaying Bose polarons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold atom experiments show that a mobile impurity particle immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate forms a well-defined quasiparticle (Bose polaron) for weak to moderate impurity-boson interaction strengths, whereas a significant line broadening is consistently observed for strong interactions. Motivated by this, we introduce a phenomenological theory based on the assumption that the most relevant states are characterized by the impurity correlated with at most one boson, since they have the largest overlap with the uncorrelated states to which the most common experimental probes couple. These experimentally relevant states can however decay to lower energy states characterised by correlations involving multiple bosons, and we model this using a minimal variational wave function combined with a complex impurity-boson interaction strength. We first motivate this approach by comparing to a more elaborate theory that includes correlations with up to two bosons. Our phenomenological model is shown to recover the main results of two recent experiments probing both the spectral and the non-equilibrium properties of the Bose polaron. Our work offers an intuitive framework for analyzing experimental data and highlights the importance of understanding the complicated problem of the Bose polaron decay in a many-body setting.</description>

      <title>Thermal relaxation and the complete set of second order transport coefficients for the unitary Fermi gas from kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the complete set of second order transport coefficients of the unitary Fermi gas, a dilute gas of spin 1/2 particles interacting via an $s$-wave interaction tuned to infinite scattering length. The calculation is based on kinetic theory and the Chapman-Enskog method at second order in the Knudsen expansion. We take into account the exact two-body collision integral. We extend previous results on second order coefficients related to shear stress by including terms related to heat flow and gradients of the fugacity. We confirm that the thermal relaxation time is given by the simple estimate $\tau_\kappa = \kappa m/(c_PT)$ even if the full collision kernel is taken into account. Here, $\kappa$ is the thermal conductivity, $m$ is the mass of the particles, $c_P$ is the specific heat at constant pressure, and $T$ is the temperature.</description>

      <title>Solving the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation with Quantic Tensor Trains: Ground States and Nonlinear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a tensor network framework based on the quantic tensor train (QTT) format to efficiently solve the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which governs Bose-Einstein condensates under mean-field theory. By adapting time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) and gradient descent methods, we accurately handle the GPE's nonlinearities within the QTT structure. Our approach enables high-resolution simulations with drastically reduced computational cost. We benchmark ground states and dynamics of BECs--including vortex lattice formation and breathing modes--demonstrating superior performance over conventional grid-based methods and stable long-time evolution due to saturating bond dimensions. This establishes QTT as a powerful tool for nonlinear quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Variational Approach to the Snake Instability of a Bose-Einstein Condensate Soliton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solitons are striking manifestations of nonlinearity, encountered in diverse physical systems such as water waves, nonlinear optics, and Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). In BECs, dark solitons emerge as exact stationary solutions of the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation. While they can be long-lived in elongated traps, their stability is compromised in higher dimensions due to the snake instability, which leads to the decay of the soliton into vortex structures among other excitations. We investigate the dynamics of a dark soliton in a Bose-Einstein condensate confined in an anisotropic harmonic trap. Using a variational ansatz that incorporates both the transverse bending of the soliton plane and the emergence of vortices along the nodal line, we derive equations of motion governing the soliton's evolution. This approach allows us to identify stable oscillation modes as well as the growth rates of the unstable perturbations. In particular, we determine the critical trap anisotropy required to suppress the snake instability. Our analytical predictions are in good agreement with full numerical simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.</description>

      <title>Spatial Leggett-Garg Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a spatial extension of the Leggett-Garg inequality by considering three distant observers locally measuring a many-body system at three subsequent times. The spatial form, in particular, is specially suited to analyze propagation of quantum perturbations through spin chains, by capturing how a measurement at one site can later affect distant sites due to the interactions. We illustrate our proposal for a Heisenberg chain in a magnetic field, showing indeed that the first inequality-violation time scales proportionally to the distance between measuring parties. We attribute this phenomenon to Lieb-Robinson physics and, confirming this connection, we find that violations are anticipated when increasing the interaction range. The inequality violation, readily observable in current experiments, demonstrates the incompatibility between two-point correlation functions and the macrorealistic hypothesis. In outlook, spatial Leggett-Garg inequalities constitute a new tool for analyzing the non-relativistic dynamics of many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Domain-wall melting and entanglement in free-fermion chains with a band structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the melting of a domain wall in free-fermion chains, where the periodic variation of the hopping amplitudes gives rise to a band structure. It is shown that the entanglement grows logarithmically in time, and the prefactor is proportional to the number of filled bands in the initial state. For a dimerized chain the particle density and current are found to have the same expressions as in the homogeneous case, up to a rescaling of the velocity. The universal contribution to the entropy profile is then doubled, while the non-universal part can be extracted numerically from block-Toeplitz matrices.</description>

      <title>Universal Bound States in Long-range Spin Chains with an Impurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how quasi-particles interact with impurities is crucial for unveiling novel properties of quantum many-body systems. A prominent example is the enhanced scattering between electrons and magnetic impurities in the low-energy limit, which gives rise to the Kondo effect. In this letter, motivated by recent developments in quantum simulation platforms, we investigate the universal behavior of long-range quantum spin chains with a single local impurity, focusing on systems that conserve the magnon number. Using effective field theory, we show that distinct classes of universal three-magnon states can emerge when the impurity-mediated two-magnon interaction is on resonance. When the long-range coupling decays as $1/r^\alpha$, we find that (i) for $\alpha\in (2,2.89)$, the system exhibits Efimov effects, with the three-body binding energy forming a geometric series $\ln|E^{(n)}_{\text{3-body}}|\sim-n (\alpha-1) \pi/s_0(\alpha)$, (ii) for $\alpha=2$, the system shows semi-super Efimov effects with $\ln|E^{(n)}_{\text{3-body}}|\sim-(n\pi-\theta)^2/8$. Our theoretical prediction is validated by the numerical solution of the Skorniakov-Ter-Martirosian equation. Our results could be tested experimentally in the future on quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Work and entropy of mixing in isolated quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mixing of two different gases is one of the most common natural phenomena, with applications ranging from CO$_2$ capture to water purification. Traditionally, mixing is analyzed in the context of local thermal equilibrium, where systems exchange energy with a heat bath. Here, we study mixing in an isolated system with potentially non-equilibrium initial states, characterized solely by macroscopic observables. We identify the entropy of mixing as a special case of observational entropy within an observer-dependent framework, where both entropy and extractable work depend on the resolution of measurement. This approach naturally resolves the Gibbs mixing paradox in quantum systems: while an observer experiences a discontinuous increase in entropy upon learning of the existence of two particle types, this knowledge does not provide an advantage in work extraction if the types of particles remain operationally indistinguishable in their measurements. Finally, we derive a Landauer-like bound on the difference in energy extracted by two observers, where an "observational temperature" emerges, determined by the accessible information. These results provide a foundation for rigorously determining the energy required to unmix in non-equilibrium settings and extend beyond quantum systems, offering insights into the thermodynamics of isolated classical gases.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii theory for a spin-1 Bose gas: Application to superfluidity in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops and implements the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation for spin-1 Bose gases, addressing key considerations for numerical simulations. As an application of the theory we explore equilibrium phases in a two-dimensional spin-1 gas, where quasi-long-range order emerges via a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Our analysis includes definition of superfluid densities for both mass and spin degrees of freedom, in a manner suitable for implementation within a stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation simulation. We present a finite-temperature phase diagram for the ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose gas and identify three distinct superfluid phases: two exhibiting conventional Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-like behavior and a novel phase that simultaneously supports independent mass and spin superflows. As temperature increases, the stability region of this novel phase shrinks. We provide characterization of the phase transitions through consideration of the spin-component densities and the unbinding of multiple types of vortices. This work provides a foundation for further studies of nonequilibrium and finite-temperature phenomena in spinor Bose gases.</description>

Abstract: Interacting one-dimensional bosons with long range hopping decaying as a power law $r^{-\alpha}$ with distance $r$ are considered with the renormalization group and the self-consistent harmonic approximation. For $\alpha\ge 3$, the ground state is always a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid, whereas for $\alpha &lt;3$, a ground state with long range order breaking the continuous global gauge symmetry becomes possible for sufficiently weak repulsion. At positive temperature, continuous symmetry breaking becomes restricted to $\alpha&lt;2$, and for $2&lt;\alpha&lt;3$, a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid with the Tomonaga-Luttinger exponent diverging at low temperature is found.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Charge and Exciton Transfer in Multi-mode Models using Engineered Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation offers a route to study open-system molecular dynamics in non-perturbative regimes by programming the interactions among electronic, vibrational, and environmental degrees of freedom on similar energy scales. Trapped-ion systems possess this capability, with their native spins, phonons, and tunable dissipation integrated within a single platform. Here, we demonstrate an open-system quantum simulation of charge and exciton transfer in a multi-mode linear vibronic coupling model. Employing tailored spin-phonon interactions alongside reservoir engineering techniques, we emulate a system with two dissipative vibrational modes coupled to donor and acceptor electronic sites and follow its non-equilibrium dynamics. We continuously tune the system from the charge transfer (CT) regime to the vibrationally assisted exciton transfer (VAET) regime by controlling the vibronic coupling strengths. We find that degenerate modes enhance CT and VAET rates at large energy gaps, while non-degenerate modes activate slow-mode pathways that reduce the energy-gap dependence, thus enlarging the window for efficient transfer. These results show that the presence of one additional vibration introduces interfering vibrationally assisted pathways and reshapes non-perturbative quantum excitation transfer. Our work establishes a scalable and hardware-efficient route to simulating chemically relevant, many-mode vibronic processes with engineered environments, guiding the design of next-generation organic photovoltaics and molecular electronics.</description>

      <title>Passive Quantum Interconnects: High-Fidelity Quantum Networking at Higher Rates with Less Overhead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity, high-rate quantum interconnect is a fundamental building block of scalable quantum technologies. The cavity-assisted photon scattering (CAPS) approach is an attractive alternative to commonly used active protocols based on photon emission and two-photon interference: it offers higher success probability and greater intrinsic robustness to imperfections, while remaining a passive operation that does not require complex atom excitation sequences or intermodule synchronization. Despite these advantages, CAPS has not been a primary choice for quantum interconnect protocols since the estimated fidelity and the rate of CAPS-based networking have been severely limited in existing protocols and analysis frameworks. In this work, we eliminate these limitations by protocol improvements aided by a thorough analysis of the atom-cavity dynamics, to demonstrate that existing or near-term optical cavity qualities are sufficient for achieving a fidelity of 0.999 with short optical pulses required for high-rate networking. We show that efficient time-multiplexed operation is possible with suppressed crosstalk, enabling high-rate entanglement generation. We also propose a hybrid network configuration leveraging both photon emission and CAPS gates, eliminating the need for external photon sources while maintaining performance and robustness. As a concrete example, with 200 ${}^{171}$Yb atoms coupled to a cavity with internal cooperativity 100, atom-atom entanglement generation rate of $4 \times 10^5~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ is estimated at a fidelity of 0.999, with further speedup beyond $10^6~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ anticipated by the use of multiple wavelength channels. Our results establish the CAPS-based network protocol as a leading candidate for scaling quantum information platforms.</description>
