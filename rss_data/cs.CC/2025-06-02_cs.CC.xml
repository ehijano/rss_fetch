      <title>A Minimal Substitution Basis for the Kalmar Elementary Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the class of Kalmar elementary functions can be inductively generated from the addition, the integer remainder and the base-two exponentiation, hence improving previous results by Marchenkov and Mazzanti. In addition, we further prove that the substitution basis defined by these three operations is minimal.</description>

      <title>How to Verify that a Small Device is Quantum, Unconditionally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A proof of quantumness (PoQ) allows a classical verifier to efficiently test if a quantum machine is performing a computation that is infeasible for any classical machine. In this work, we propose a new approach for constructing PoQ protocols where soundness holds unconditionally assuming a bound on the memory of the prover, but otherwise no restrictions on its runtime. In this model, we propose two protocols:
  1. A simple protocol with a quadratic gap between the memory required by the honest parties and the memory bound of the adversary. The soundness of this protocol relies on Raz's (classical) memory lower bound for matrix inversion (Raz, FOCS 2016).
  2. A protocol that achieves an exponential gap, building on techniques from the literature on the bounded storage model (Dodis et al., Eurocrypt 2023).
  Both protocols are also efficiently verifiable. Despite having worse asymptotics, our first protocol is conceptually simple and relies only on arithmetic modulo 2, which can be implemented with one-qubit Hadamard and CNOT gates, plus a single one-qubit non-Clifford gate.</description>

      <title>Output-sensitive Complexity of Multi-Objective Integer Network Flow Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01786v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the output-sensitive complexity for linear multi-objective integer minimum cost flow (MOIMCF) problems and provides insights about the time complexity for enumerating all supported nondominated vectors. The paper shows that there can not exist an output-polynomial time algorithm for the enumeration of all supported nondominated vectors that determine the vectors in an ordered way in the outcome space unless NP = P. Moreover, novel methods for identifying supported nondominated vectors in bi-objective minimum cost flow (BOIMCF) problems are proposed, accompanied by a numerical comparison between decision- and objective-space methods. A novel, equivalent and more compact formulation of the minimum cost flow ILP formulation used in the e-constrained-scalarization approach is introduced, demonstrating enhanced efficiency in the numerical tests</description>

      <title>Exact Algorithms for Multiagent Path Finding with Communication Constraints on Tree-Like Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08556v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the scenario where multiple agents have to move in an optimal way through a network, each one towards their ending position while avoiding collisions. By optimal, we mean as fast as possible, which is evaluated by a measure known as the makespan of the proposed solution. This is the setting studied in the Multiagent Path Finding problem. In this work, we additionally provide the agents with a way to communicate with each other. Due to size constraints, it is reasonable to assume that the range of communication of each agent will be limited. What should be the trajectories of the agents to, additionally, maintain a backbone of communication? In this work, we study the Multiagent Path Finding with Communication Constraint problem under the parameterized complexity framework.
  Our main contribution is three exact algorithms that are efficient when considering particular structures for the input network. We provide such algorithms for the case when the communication range and the number of agents (the makespan resp.) are provided in the input and the network has a tree topology, or bounded maximum degree (has a tree-like topology, i.e., bounded treewidth resp.). We complement these results by showing that it is highly unlikely to construct efficient algorithms when considering the number of agents as part of the input, even if the makespan is $3$ and the communication range is $1$.</description>

      <title>Local Test for Unitarily Invariant Properties of Bipartite Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04599v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the power of local test for bipartite quantum states. Our central result is that, for properties of bipartite pure states, unitary invariance on one part implies an optimal (over all global testers) local tester acting only on the other part. As an application, we show that
  - Purified samples offer no advantage in property testing of mixed states.
  - A matching lower bound $\Omega(r^2/\varepsilon^2)$ for testing the Schmidt rank of bipartite states with perfect completeness, settling an open question raised in the survey of Montanaro and de Wolf (ToC 2016).
  - A lower bound $\Omega((\sqrt{n}+\sqrt{r})\cdot\sqrt{r}/\varepsilon^2)$ for testing whether an $n$-partite state is a matrix product state of bond dimension $r$ or $\varepsilon$-far, improving the prior lower bounds $\Omega(\sqrt{n}/\varepsilon^2)$ by Soleimanifar and Wright (SODA 2022) and $\Omega(\sqrt{r})$ by Aaronson et al. (ITCS 2024).
  - A matching lower bound $\Omega(d/\varepsilon^2)$ for testing whether a $d$-dimensional bipartite state is maximally entangled or $\varepsilon$-far, showing that the algorithm of O'Donnell and Wright (STOC 2015) is optimal for this task.
  We also show other applications in sample complexity and query complexity. In addition, our central result can be extended when the tested state is mixed: one-way LOCC is sufficient to realize the optimal tester.</description>
