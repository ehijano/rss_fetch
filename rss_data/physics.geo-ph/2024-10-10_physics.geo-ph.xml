      <title>Leveraging spurious Omori-Utsu relation in the nearest-neighbor declustering method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stress changes in the Earth's crust induced by an earthquake typically trigger other earthquakes. Identifying such aftershocks is an important step in seismic hazard assessment but has remained challenging. Here we demonstrate that earthquake catalogs without triggering can lead to spurious Omori-Utsu and productivity relations for the commonly used nearest-neighbor declustering method. However, we show that the robustness of the Omori-Utsu exponent on newly introduced parameters of the method allows to identify true aftershocks. For a natural swarm catalog, which lacks a clear distinction between triggered and background events, we reveal that the catalog is dominated by aftershocks.</description>

      <title>Suitability Analysis of Ground Motion Prediction Equations for Western and Central Himalayas and Indo-Gangetic Plains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) play a key role in seismic hazard assessment (SHA). Considering the seismo-tectonic, geophysical and geotectonic characteristics of a target region, all the GMPEs may not be suitable in predicting the observed ground motion effectively. With a fairly large number of published GMPEs, the selection and ranking of suitable GMPEs for the design of logic trees in SHA for a particular target region has become a necessity of late. This paper presents a detailed quantitative evaluation of performance of 16 GMPEs against recorded ground motion data in two target regions, characterized by distinct seismo-tectonic, geophysical and geotectonical nature. The data set comprises of 465 three-component spectral accelerograms corresponding to 122 earthquake events. The suitability of a GMPE is tested by two widely accepted data-driven statistical methods, namely, likelihood (LH) and log-likelihood (LLH) method. Different suites of GMPEs are shown suitable for different periods of interest. The results will be useful to scientists and engineers for microzonation and estimation of seismic design parameters for the design of earthquake-resistant structures in these regions.</description>
