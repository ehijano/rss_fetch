      <title>Repairing General Game Descriptions (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Game Description Language (GDL) is a widely used formalism for specifying the rules of general games. Writing correct GDL descriptions can be challenging, especially for non-experts. Automated theorem proving has been proposed to assist game design by verifying if a GDL description satisfies desirable logical properties. However, when a description is proved to be faulty, the repair task itself can only be done manually. Motivated by the work on repairing unsolvable planning domain descriptions, we define a more general problem of finding minimal repairs for GDL descriptions that violate formal requirements, and we provide complexity results for various computational problems related to minimal repair. Moreover, we present an Answer Set Programming-based encoding for solving the minimal repair problem and demonstrate its application for automatically repairing ill-defined game descriptions.</description>

      <title>Modal definability in Euclidean modal logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is about the computability of the modal definability problem in classes of frames determined by Euclidean modal logics. We characterize those Euclidean modal logics such that the classes of frames they determine give rise to an undecidable modal definability problem.</description>

      <title>Why Cannot Large Language Models Ever Make True Correct Reasoning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, with the application progress of AIGC tools based on large language models (LLMs), led by ChatGPT, many AI experts and more non-professionals are trumpeting the "understanding ability" and "reasoning ability" of the LLMs. The present author considers that the so-called "understanding ability" and "reasoning ability" of LLMs are just illusions of those people who with vague concepts. In fact, the LLMs can never have the true understanding ability and true reasoning ability. This paper intents to explain that, because the essential limitations of their working principle, the LLMs can never have the ability of true correct reasoning.</description>

      <title>The phi-Process: Operator-Algebraic Embeddings of Possibilities, Transfinite Stabilization, and a Quantitative Application to Sensory Depletion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formalize a transfinite Phi process that treats all possibility embeddings as operators on structured state spaces including complete lattices, Banach and Hilbert spaces, and orthomodular lattices. We prove a determinization lemma showing that lifting to sets or distributions yields a deterministic global dynamic, an ordinal stabilization theorem sending operator transforms to the fixed subspace by stage omega under normal spectral contraction, and a product of Riesz projections theorem for commuting layers. We establish a compositionality law for lifted maps, show closure of Phi packings, and present a quantitative application to sensory depletion that models tissue removal as a projection and derives strict decreases in the attainable fixed point under minimal monotonicity and positivity assumptions. We also state measurable conditions for probabilistic lifts, give explicit non normal and non commuting counterexamples, and provide finite dimensional and stochastic witnesses together with per theorem scope tables and a small reproducible code appendix.</description>

      <title>Craig Interpolation for Decidable First-Order Fragments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08689v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the guarded-negation fragment is, in a precise sense, the smallest extension of the guarded fragment with Craig interpolation. In contrast, we show that full first-order logic is the smallest extension of both the two-variable fragment and the forward fragment with Craig interpolation. Similarly, we also show that all extensions of the two-variable fragment and of the fluted fragment with Craig interpolation are undecidable.</description>

      <title>Multiple Reachability in Linear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider reachability decision problems for linear dynamical systems: Given a linear map on $\mathbb{R}^d$ , together with source and target sets, determine whether there is a point in the source set whose orbit, obtained by repeatedly applying the linear map, enters the target set. When the source and target sets are semialgebraic, this problem can be reduced to a point-to-polytope reachability question. The latter is generally believed not to be substantially harder than the well-known Skolem and Positivity Problems. The situation is markedly different for multiple reachability, i.e. the question of whether the orbit visits the target set at least m times, for some given positive integer m. In this paper, we prove that when the source set is semialgebraic and the target set consists of a hyperplane, multiple reachability is undecidable; in fact we already obtain undecidability in ambient dimension d = 10 and with fixed m = 9. Moreover, as we observe that procedures for dimensions 3 up to 9 would imply strong results pertaining to effective solutions of Diophantine equations, we mainly focus on the affine plane ($\mathbb{R}^2$). We obtain two main positive results. We show that multiple reachability is decidable for halfplane targets, and that it is also decidable for general semialgebraic targets, provided the linear map is a rotation. The latter result involves a new method, based on intersections of algebraic subgroups with subvarieties, due to Bombieri and Zannier.</description>

      <title>A bargain for mergesorts -- How to prove your mergesort correct and stable, almost for free</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08173v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel characterization of stable mergesort functions using relational parametricity, and show that it implies the functional correctness of mergesort. As a result, one can prove the correctness of several variations of mergesort (e.g., top-down, bottom-up, tail-recursive, non-tail-recursive, smooth, and non-smooth mergesorts) by proving the characteristic property for each variation. Thanks to our characterization and the parametricity translation, we deduced the correctness results, including stability, of various implementations of mergesort for lists, including highly optimized ones, in the Rocq Prover (formerly the Coq Proof Assistant).</description>

      <title>The Vampire Diary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the past decade of continuous development, the theorem prover Vampire has become an automated solver for the combined theories of commonly-used data structures. Vampire now supports arithmetic, induction, and higher-order logic. These advances have been made to meet the demands of software verification, enabling Vampire to effectively complement SAT/SMT solvers and aid proof assistants. We explain how best to use Vampire in practice and review the main changes Vampire has undergone since its last tool presentation, focusing on the engineering principles and design choices we made during this process.</description>

      <title>Synthesis Benchmarks for Automated Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19827v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Program synthesis is the task of constructing a program conforming to a given specification. We focus on deductive synthesis, and in particular on synthesis problems with specifications given as $\forall\exists$-formulas, expressing the existence of an output corresponding to any input. So far there has been no canonical benchmark set for deductive synthesis using the $\forall\exists$-format and supporting the so-called uncomputable symbol restriction. This work presents such a data set, composed by complementing existing benchmarks by new ones. Our data set is dynamically growing and should motivate future developments in the theory and practice of automating synthesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a rough sets semantics for the three-valued extension of first-order Priest's da Costa logic, which we studied in [Castiglioni, J.L. and Ertola-Biraben, R.C. Modalities combining two negations. {\em Journal of Logic and Computation} 11:341--356, 2024]. This semantics follows the usual pattern of the semantics for first-order classical logic.</description>
