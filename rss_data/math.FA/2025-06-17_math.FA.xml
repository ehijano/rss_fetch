      <description>arXiv:2506.12191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study pseudodifferential operators associated to microlocally defined normed symbol spaces of limited regularity, introduced by J. Sj\"ostrand. Boundedness of such operators on modulation spaces is obtained under suitable conditions, and continuity properties of the Weyl composition product are established.</description>

      <title>On Levi operators between normed and vector lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of Levi operator is an operator abstraction of the Levy property of a norm. Various aspects of Levi operators have been studied recently by several authors. The present paper is devoted to Levi operators from a normed lattice to a vector lattice. It is proved that every finite rank operator is a Levi operator. An example is given showing that the sum of a positive rank one operator and a positive compact Levi operator need not to be a Levi operator. We prove that every quasi Levi operator is order continuous. By the Abramovich--Sirotkin theorem, this provides a generalization of the Chen--Zhang result of order boundedness of an operator that carries increasing bounded nets of a Banach lattice to very strong order convergent nets. It is shown that the set of Levi operators on the space of convergent sequences is not complete in the operator norm. Several results concerning the domination problem for Levi operators and the relations between Levi operators and KB-spaces are established.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the ALM-procedure introduced by Ando, Li, and Mathias for extending operator geometric means to multiple variables. We prove that the generalized procedure preserves all the properties required by the axioms of operator means, along with several additional desirable properties. Moreover, we examine the self-adjointness of the canonical geometric mean constructed through this procedure.</description>

      <title>On the equivalent p-th von Neumann-Jordan constant associated with isosceles orthogonality in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define a new geometric constant based on isosceles orthogonality, denoted by . Through research, we find that this constant is the equivalent p-th von Neumann Jordan constant in the sense of isosceles orthogonality. First, we obtain some basic properties of the constant. Then, we calculate the upper and lower bounds of the constant. Through three examples, it is found that the upper bound of the constant is attainable. We also compare the relationship between this constant and other constants. Finally, we establish the connection between the constant and some geometric properties in Banach spaces, such as uniform non-squareness, uniform smoothness.</description>

      <title>Regularized Moment Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the work "Dealing with moment measures via entropy and optimal transport", Santambrogio provided an optimal transport approach to study existence of solutions for the moment measure equation, that is: given $\mu$, find $u$ such that $ (\nabla u)_{\sharp}e^{-u}=\mu$. In particular he proves that $u$ satisfies the previous equation if and only if $e^{-u}$ is the minimizer of an entropy and a transport cost. Here we study a modified minimization problem, in which we add a strongly convex regularization depending on a positive $\alpha$ and we link its solutions to a modified moment measure equation $(\nabla u)_{\sharp}e^{-u-\frac{\alpha}{2} \|x\|^2}= \mu$. Exploiting the regularization term, we study the stability of the minimizers.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric Inequality on Manifolds with Quadratically Decaying Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the reverse improvement property of Sobolev inequalities on manifolds with quadratically decaying Ricci curvature. Specifically, we establish conditions under which the uniform decay of the heat kernel implies the validity of an isoperimetric inequality. As an application, we demonstrate the existence of isoperimetric sets in generalized Grushin spaces. Our approach is built on a weak-type Sobolev inequality, gradient estimates on remote balls, and a Hardy-type gluing technique. This method provides new insights into the deep connections between geometric and functional analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal embeddings for fractional Orlicz-Sobolev spaces into (generalized) Campanato spaces on the Euclidean space are exhibited.
  Embeddings into vanishing Campanato spaces are also characterized. Sharp embeddings into $\operatorname{BMO}(\mathbb R^n)$ and $\operatorname{VMO}(\mathbb R^n)$ are derived as special instances. Dissimilarities to corresponding embeddings for classical fractional Sobolev spaces are pointed out.</description>

      <title>Failure of the Flat Chain Conjecture and non-regularity of the prescribed Jacobian equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Flat Chain Conjecture in Lang's formulation (that is, without requiring finite mass of the underlying currents) fails for metric $k$-currents in $\mathbb{R}^d$ whenever $d\geq 2$ and $k\in\{1, \dots, d\}$. In all other cases, it holds. We first connect the conjecture to a regularity statement concerning the prescribed Jacobian equation near $L^\infty$. We then show that the equation does not have the required regularity. For a Lipschitz vector field $\pi$, its derivative $\mathrm{D}\pi$ exists a.e. and is identified with a matrix. Our non-regularity results for the prescribed Jacobian equation quantify how "small" the set
  \begin{equation*}
  \operatorname{conv}(\{\operatorname{det}\mathrm{D} \pi: \operatorname{Lip}(\pi)\leq L\})\subset L^\infty
  \end{equation*}
  is for every $L&gt;0$. The symbol "$\operatorname{conv}$" stands for the convex hull. The "smallness" is quantified in topological terms and is used to show that the Flat Chain Conjecture fails.</description>

      <title>Stable Polynomials via Undirected Colored Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper initiates a systematic study of connections between undirected colored graphs and associated two-variable stable polynomials obtained via Cauchy transform-type formulas. Examples of such stable polynomials have played crucial roles in other recent studies, though their general properties have remained rather opaque. Using linear algebra techniques, this paper characterizes when these stable polynomials have boundary zeros and studies the finer behavior, called contact order, of their zero sets near the guaranteed boundary zeros.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the theory of real noncommutative convex sets, following the recent and profound complex case developed by Davidson and Kennedy. The present paper focuses on the real case of the topics from the first several sections of their profound memoir.. Later results will be discussed in a future paper. We give many foundational structural results for real operator systems and their associated noncommutative (nc) convex sets, and elucidate how the complexification interacts with the basic convexity theory constructions. Several new features appear in the real case, including the novel notion of the complexification of a nc convex set.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of Physics-Informed Neural Networks via Variational Coercivity, Perturbation Bounds, and Concentration Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a rigorous stability framework for Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) grounded in variational analysis, operator coercivity, and explicit perturbation theory. PINNs approximate solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) by minimizing residual-based losses over sampled collocation points. We derive deterministic stability bounds that quantify how bounded perturbations in the network output propagate through both residual and supervised loss components. Probabilistic stability is established via McDiarmid's inequality, yielding non-asymptotic concentration bounds that link sampling variability to empirical loss fluctuations under minimal assumptions. Generalization from Sobolev-norm training loss to uniform approximation is analyzed using coercivity and Sobolev embeddings, leading to pointwise error control. The theoretical results apply to both scalar and vector-valued PDEs and cover composite loss formulations. Numerical experiments validate the perturbation sensitivity, sample complexity estimates, and Sobolev-to-uniform generalization bounds. This work provides a mathematically grounded and practically applicable stability framework for PINNs, clarifying the role of operator structure, sampling design, and functional regularity in robust training.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22972v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Bansah and Sehba studied in [3] the boundedness of a family of Hilbert-type integral operators, where they characterized the $L^{p}-L^{q}$ boundedness of the operators for $1\leq p\leq q\leq \infty$. In this paper, we deal with the corresponding discrete Hilbert-type operators acting on the weighted sequence spaces. We establish some sufficient and necessary conditions for the $l^{p}-l^{q}$ boundedness of the operators for $1\leq p\leq q\leq \infty$. We find out that the conditions of the boundedness of discrete Hilbert-type operators are different from those of the boundedness of Hilbert-type integral operators. Also, for some special cases, we obtain sharp norm estimates for discrete Hilbert-type operators. Finally, it is pointed out that certain extensions of the theorems given in [3] can be established by using our different arguments.</description>

      <title>Conjugate pairs of Hadamard subfactors and vertex models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01664v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any two Hadamard subfactors arising from a pair of distinct complex Hadamard matrices of order 3 are either equal or conjugate by a unitary in the relative commutant of their intersection. Moreover, when the Hadamard subfactors are not equal, we prove the factoriality of their intersection, and it turns out to be a vertex model subfactor. We compute the first relative commutant and characterize this subfactor by identifying it with a particular type of Krishnan-Sunder subfactor. A few key invariants, including the Pimsner-Popa probabilistic number, the angle, and the Connes-St{\o}rmer relative entropy for the pair of Hadamard subfactors are computed to understand their relative position.</description>

      <title>Note on the compactness of commutators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04993v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optimal sufficient conditions for the $L^p$-to-$L^q$ compactness of commutators of singular integral operators of both Calder\'on-Zygmund and of rough type are shown in the different exponent ranges $``q&gt;p"$, $``q=p"$ and $``q&lt;p"$ to quickly follow from each other. The approach is through classical compactness interpolation methods. We also present a new elementary off-diagonal to diagonal extrapolation principle for the compactness of commutators of linear operators, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Critical metrics of eigenvalue functionals via Clarke subdifferential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We set up a new framework to study critical points of functionals defined as combinations of eigenvalues of operators with respect to a given set of parameters: Riemannian metrics, potentials, etc. Our setting builds upon Clarke's differentiation theory to provide a novel understanding of critical metrics. In particular, we unify and refine previous research carried out on Laplace and Steklov eigenvalues. We also use our theory to tackle original examples such as the conformal GJMS operators, the conformal Laplacian, and the Laplacian with mixed boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Sharp estimates for the Cram\'{e}r transform of log-concave measures and geometric applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a new comparison between the Legendre transform of the cumulant generating function and the half-space depth of an arbitrary log-concave probability distribution on the real line, that carries on to the multidimensional setting. Combined with sharp estimates for the Cram\'{e}r transform of rotationally invariant measures, we are led to some new phase-transition type results for the asymptotics of the expected measure of random polytopes. As a byproduct of our analysis, we address a question on the sharp exponential separability constant for log-concave distributions, in the symmetric case.</description>

      <title>Splitting of Tensor Products and Intermediate Factor Theorem: Continuous Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a discrete group. Given unital $G$-$C^*$-algebras $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$, we give an abstract condition under which every $G$-subalgebra $\mathcal{C}$ of the form $\mathcal{A}\subset \mathcal{C}\subset \mathcal{A}\otimes_{\text{min}}\mathcal{B}$ is a tensor product. This generalizes the well-known splitting results in the context of $C^*$-algebras by Zacharias and Zsido. As an application, we prove a topological version of the Intermediate Factor theorem. When a product group $G=\Gamma_1\times\Gamma_2$ acts (by a product action) on the product of corresponding $\Gamma_i$-boundaries $\partial\Gamma_i$, using the abstract condition, we show that every intermediate subalgebra $C(X)\subset\mathcal{C}\subset C(X)\otimes_{\text{min}}C(\partial\Gamma_1\times \partial\Gamma_2)$ is a tensor product (under some additional assumptions on $X$). This can be considered as a topological version of the Intermediate Factor theorem. We prove that our assumptions are necessary and cannot generally be relaxed. We also introduce the notion of a uniformly rigid action for $C^*$-algebras and use it to give various classes of inclusions $\mathcal{A}\subset \mathcal{A}\otimes_{\text{min}}\mathcal{B}$ for which every invariant intermediate algebra is a tensor product.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21015v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the restriction of Brownian shifts to their invariant subspaces and classify when they are unitarily equivalent. Additionally, we prove an asymptotic property stating that normalized Brownian shifts belong to the classical $C_{00}$-class.</description>

      <title>Locally unital $C^*$-algebras do not admit frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study nonunital $C^*$-algebras such that for any element there exists a local unit and prove that in such algebras there are no frames. This fact was previously known only for commutative algebras. Among other results, we establish some necessary properties of frames in $C^*$-algebras (which are of independent interest in the noncommutative topology), and consider several examples of $C^*$-algebras that are new in this context.</description>
