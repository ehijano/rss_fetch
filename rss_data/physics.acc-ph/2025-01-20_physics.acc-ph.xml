      <title>HIBISCUS: a new ion beam radio-frequency quadrupole cooler-buncher for high-precision experiments with exotic radioactive ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HIBISCUS (Helium-Inflated Beam Improvement Setup that Cools and Undermines Spreads), a new radiofrequency quadrupole cooler-buncher device has been developed and commissioned offline at the Ion Guide Isotope Separator On-Line (IGISOL) facility in Jyv\"askyl\"a in Finland, as an in-kind contribution for the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research facility. HIBISCUS improves the ion optical properties of incident low-energy 6~keV beams with the option to have it ultimately extracted in temporally short bunches ($&lt;1$~$\mu$s). This paper provides technical descriptions of its main characteristics, along with a set of optimum working parameters and performance in terms of transmission efficiency, longitudinal energy spread of the cooled ions and temporal width of the extracted bunches.</description>

      <title>High-quality electron beam generation from laser wakefield accelerators for driving compact free electron lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the successful demonstration of compact free electron lasers (FELs) driven by laser wakefield accelerators (LWFAs), the pursuit of further enhancements in high-gain compact FELs presents a challenge due to the limitations in electron beam quality. In this work, we pinpoint the pivotal physics and optimization strategies for high-quality single-stage LWFAs that are crucial for high-gain FELs. We have delved into the synergistic injection mechanism, where the self-evolution injection threshold is far from reached at the injection position, with both the shock front and self-evolution of the laser playing a role in the injection process. A thorough discussion has been provided on the beam-quality degradation and optimization strategies, in terms of global (slice) energy spread and projected (slice) emittance. With the goal of achieving high-gain FELs driven by LWFAs, we have also explored the synthesis quality of the electron beam to determine an optimized power gain length. A comprehensive start-to-end simulation has been conducted, demonstrating the effectiveness of compact FELs powered by these high-quality electron beams. The resulting radiation reaches the saturation regime after a 4.5-meter-long undulator, with an energy of 17.4 {\mu}J and a power of 6.0 GW at a wavelength of 23.9 nm. This proposed scheme offers not only a framework for optimizing beam quality in LWFAs, but also a promising path for future compact LWFA-driven FELs to achieve saturated regimes, opening up new possibilities for widespread applications.</description>

      <title>Interplay of space charge and intrabeam scattering in the LHC ion injector chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03504v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ion injectors of the CERN accelerator chain, in particular the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) and the Low Energy Ion Ring (LEIR), operate in a strong space charge~(SC) and intrabeam scattering (IBS) regime, which can degrade beam quality. Optimizing the ion beam performance requires thus to study the interplay of these two effects in tracking simulations by incorporating both SC and IBS effects interleaved with lattice nonlinearities. In this respect, the kinetic theory approach of treating IBS effects has been deployed. A new, modified approach has been introduced using the formalism of the Bjorken and Mtingwa model and the complete elliptic integrals of the second kind for faster numerical evaluation. This IBS kick is implemented in PyORBIT and extensive benchmarking cases against analytical models are shown. Results of combined space charge and intrabeam scattering simulations for the SPS and LEIR are presented and compared with observations from beam measurements.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic excitations in graphene layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interaction of fast charged particles with graphene layers can generate electromagnetic modes. This wake effect has been recently proposed for short-wavelength, high-gradient particle acceleration and for obtaining brilliant radiation sources. In this study, the excitation of wakefields produced by a point-like charged particle moving parallel to a multilayer graphene array (which may be supported by an insulated substrate) is studied using the linearized hydrodynamic theory. General expressions for the excited longitudinal and transverse wakefields have been derived. The dependencies of the wakefields on the positions of the layers and the substrate, the velocity and the surface density have been extensively analyzed. This study provides a deeper understanding of the physical phenomena underlying plasmonic excitations in graphene layers, paving the way for potential applications of these structures in particle acceleration, nanotechnology and materials science.</description>
