      <title>Some L\^e-Greuel type formulae on stratified spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the circle of ideas from a previous paper on hypersurfaces to functions $f \colon (\mathbb C^n, 0) \to (\mathbb C^k, 0)$ with an isolated singularity in a stratified sense on an arbitrary, but fixed complex analytic germ $(X, 0)$. An extension of Tib{\u a}r's Bouquet Theorem to this setup allows for a topological definition of Milnor numbers $\mu(\alpha; f)$ for each stratum $V^\alpha$ of $X$ and we prove several formulas which compute these numbers as (alternating) sums of certain ``homological indices''. The main technical result at work in the background is a local Riemann-Roch type theorem, relating a topological obstruction to holomorphic Euler characteristics.</description>

Abstract: We show that if V is a subvariety of the affine N-space defined by polynomials of degree at most d, then the sum of its $\ell$-adic Betti numbers does not exceed $2(N + 1)^{2N +1}(d+ 1)^N$. This answers a question of Katz (FFA 2001).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drinfeld and Gaitsgory proved that $\mathrm{D}-\mathrm{mod}(\mathrm{Bun}_G)$ is compactly generated. Let $\mathrm{Bun}_G^{\mathrm{I}}$ be the algebraic stack of principal $G$-bundles on $X$ together with Iwahori level structure at a fixed point $x \in X$. More generally, for a finite collection of points $x_1, ..., x_k \in X$, let $\mathrm{Bun}_G^{(\mathrm{I}; x_1, ..., x_k)}$ be the algebraic stack of principal $G$-bundles on $X$ together with Iwahori level structure at each point $x_j$. We will show that $\mathrm{D}-\mathrm{mod}(\mathrm{Bun}_G^{\mathrm{I}})$ and $\mathrm{D}-\mathrm{mod}(\mathrm{Bun}_G^{(\mathrm{I}; x_1, ..., x_k)})$ are compactly generated.</description>

      <title>Decompositions of Powers of Quadrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the problem of determining Waring decompositions of the powers of any quadratic form over the field of complex numbers. Our main goal is to provide information about their rank and also to obtain decompositions whose size is as close as possible to this value. This problem is classical and these forms assume importance especially because of their invariance under the action of the special orthogonal group. We give the detailed procedure to prove that the apolar ideal of the $s$-th power of a quadratic form is generated by the harmonic polynomials of degree $s+1$. We also generalize and improve some of the results on real decompositions given by B. Reznick in his notes of 1992, focusing on possibly minimal decompositions and providing new ones, both real and complex. We investigate the rank of the second power of a non-degenerate quadratic form in $n$ variables, which in most cases is equal to $(n^2+n+2)/2$, and also give some results on powers of ternary quadratic forms.</description>

      <title>Algorithm for motivic Hilbert zeta function of monomial curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an algorithm for computing the motivic Hilbert zeta function for curve singularities with a monomial local ring. It is well known that the Hilbert scheme of points on a smooth curve is isomorphic to the symmetric product of the curve. However, the structure of Hilbert scheme of points of singular curves remains less understood. This work focuses on the germ of a unibranch plane curve singularity $(C,O)$ with a monomial complete local ring $\widehat{\mathcal{O}_{C,O}}= \mathbb{C}[[t^{\alpha_{1}}, \dots, t^{\alpha_{e}}]]$ and an associated valuation set $\Gamma$. The algorithm we propose computes the motivic Hilbert zeta function, $Z_{(C,O)}^{Hilb}(q)\in K_{0}(Var_{\mathbb{C}})[[q]]$, for such curve singularities. This function is represented as a series with coefficients in the Grothendieck ring of varieties over $\mathbb{C}$.
  The main computational challenge arises from the infinity of $\Gamma$. To address this, we approximate $\Gamma$ by truncating it to a finite subset to allow effective algorithm operation. We also analyze the time complexity and estimate the range of the effective finite length of $\Gamma$ necessary for reliable results. The Python implementation of our algorithm is available at https://github.com/whaozhu/motivic_hilbert.</description>

      <title>Local-global principles for semi-integral points on Markoff orbifold pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study local-global principles for semi-integral points on orbifold pairs of Markoff type. In particular, we analyse when these orbifold pairs satisfy weak weak approximation, weak approximation and strong approximation off a finite set of places. We show that Markoff orbifold pairs satisfy the semi-integral Hasse principle and we measure how often such orbifold pairs have strict semi-integral points but the corresponding Markoff surface lacks integral points.</description>

      <title>Perverse sheaves on twisted affine flag varieties and Langlands duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a description of Iwahori-Whittaker equivariant perverse sheaves on affine flag varieties associated to tamely ramified reductive groups, in terms of Langlands dual data. This extends the work of Arkhipov-Bezrukavnikov from the case of split reductive groups. To achieve this, we first extend the theory of Wakimoto sheaves to our context and prove convolution exact central objects admit a filtration by such. We then establish the tilting property of the Iwahori-Whittaker averaging of certain central objects arising from the geometric Satake equivalence, which enables us to address the absence of an appropriate analogue of Gaitsgory's central functor for non-split groups.</description>

      <title>Twist automorphism for a generalized root system of affine ADE type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a generalized root system of affine ADE type, we introduce a twist automorphism. We prove that the Dubrovin-Zhang extended affine Weyl group is isomorphic to our (modified) extended affine Weyl group, which is an extension of the affine Weyl group by the twist automorphism. We also show that the number of root bases with a Coxeter transformation modulo the twist automorphism is equal to the degree of the Lyashko-Looijenga map of the Frobenius manifold constructed by Dubrovin-Zhang. As analogues of the extended affine Weyl group, we define an extended Artin group and an extended Seidel-Thomas braid group. We study the relationship between the extended affine Weyl group and the extended Seidel-Thomas braid group.</description>

      <title>Linear relations of p-adic periods of 1-motives (thesis)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we aim to develop p-adic analogs of known results for classical periods, focusing specifically on 1-motives. We establish an integration theory for 1-motives with good reductions, which generalizes the Colmez-Fontaine-Messing p-adic integration for abelian varieties with good reductions. We also compare the integration pairing with other pairings such as those induced by crystalline theory. Additionally, we introduce a formalism for periods and formulate p-adic period conjectures related to p-adic periods arising from this integration pairing. Broadly, our p-adic period conjecture operates at different depths, with each depth revealing distinct relations among the p-adic periods. Notably, the classical period conjecture (Kontsevich-Zanier conjecture over $\bar{\mathbb{Q}}$) for 1-periods fits within our framework, and, according to the classical subgroup theorem of Huber-W\"ustholz for 1-motives, the conjecture for classical periods of 1-motives holds true at depth 1. Finally, we identify three $\mathbb{Q}$-structures arising from $\bar{\mathbb{Q}}$-rational points of the formal p-divisible group associated with a 1-motive $M$ with a good reduction at $p$, and we prove p-adic period conjectures at depths 2 and 1, relative to periods induced by the p-adic integration of $M$ and these $\mathbb{Q}$-structures. Our proof involves a p-adic version of the subgroup theorem that we obtain for 1-motives with good reductions.</description>

Abstract: For the distributions of finitely many binary random variables, we study the interaction of restrictions of the supports with conditional independence constraints. We prove a generalization of the Hammersley-Clifford theorem for distributions whose support is a natural distributive lattice: that is, any distribution which has natural lattice support and satisfies the pairwise Markov statements of a graph must factor according to the graph. We also show a connection to the Hibi ideals of lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a Riemann surface of genus $&gt; 1$, we discuss how to construct opers with apparent singularities from $SL_2(\mathbb{C})$ $\lambda$-connections $(E, \nabla_\lambda)$ and sub-line bundles $L$ of $E$. This construction defines a rational map from a space which captures important data of triples $(E, L, \nabla_\lambda)$ to a space which parametrises the positions and residue parameters of the induced apparent singularities. We show that this is a Poisson map with respect to natural Poisson structures. The relations to wobbly bundles and Lagrangians in the moduli spaces of Higgs bundles and $\lambda$-connections are discussed.</description>

      <title>Semiregularity as a consequence of Goodwillie's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.3111</link>
      <description>arXiv:1208.3111v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We realise Buchweitz and Flenner's semiregularity map (and hence a fortiori Bloch's semiregularity map) for a smooth variety $X$ as the tangent of a generalised Abel--Jacobi map on the derived moduli stack of perfect complexes on $X$. The target of this map is an analogue of Deligne cohomology defined in terms of cyclic homology, and Goodwillie's theorem on nilpotent ideals ensures that it has the desired tangent space (a truncated de Rham complex).
  Immediate consequences are the semiregularity conjectures: that the semiregularity maps annihilate all obstructions, and that if $X$ is deformed, semiregularity measures the failure of the Chern character to remain a Hodge class. This gives rise to reduced obstruction theories of the type featuring in the study of reduced Gromov--Witten and Pandharipande--Thomas invariants. We also give generalisations allowing $X$ to be singular, and even a derived stack.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1709.01678v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the existence of a power structure over the Grothendieck ring of geometric dg categories. We show that a conjecture by Galkin and Shinder (proved recently by Bergh, Gorchinskiy, Larsen, and Lunts) relating the motivic and categorical zeta functions of varieties can be reformulated as a compatibility between the motivic and categorical power structures. Using our power structure we show that the categorical zeta function of a geometric dg category can be expressed as a power with exponent the category itself. We give applications of our results for the generating series associated with Hilbert schemes of points, categorical Adams operations, and series with exponent a linear algebraic group.</description>

Abstract: We prove the Gersten conjecture for $p$-adic \'etale Tate twists for a smooth scheme $X$ in mixed characteristic in the Nisnevich topology. Our main observation is that, while $p$-adic \'etale Tate twists are not $\mathbb A^1$-invariant, for the proof of the Gersten conjecture it suffices that they satisfy the $\mathbb P^1$-bundle formula. This fits nicely with the emphasis on the projective bundle formula in non $\mathbb A^1$-invariant motivic cohomology recently developed by Elmanto-Morrow and Annala-Hoyois-Iwasa. Furthermore, identifying $p$-adic \'etale Tate twists with the syntomic cohomology defined by Bhatt-Morrow-Scholze, the result generalises the Gersten conjecture for logarithmic deRham-Witt sheaves due to Gros-Suwa to arbitrary characteristic. In the second part of the article, we revisit the cycle class map from thickened zero-cycles on the special fiber of $X$ to \'etale cohomology with coefficients in $p$-adic \'etale Tate twists previously studied in [27]. This cycle class map is important in the study of zero-cycles on smooth projective varieties over local fields and the approach to the cycle class map which we use in this article is more conceptual and, in contrast to the approach in loc. cit., works for arbitrary finite residue fields.</description>

      <title>The McKay Correspondence for Dihedral Groups: The Moduli Space and the Tautological Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A conjecture in [Ish20] states that for a finite subgroup $G$ of $GL(2; \mathbb{C})$, a resolution $Y$ of $\mathbb{C}^2/G$ is isomorphic to a moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{\theta}$ of $G$-constellations for some generic stability parameter $\theta$ if and only if $Y$ is dominated by the maximal resolution. This paper affirms the conjecture in the case of dihedral groups as a class of complex reflection groups, and offers an extension of McKay correspondence (via [IN1], [IN2], and [Ish02]).</description>

      <title>Grade restriction and D-brane transport for a non-abelian GLSM of an elliptic curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a simple model for D-brane transport in non-abelian GLSMs. The model is the elliptic curve version of a non-abelian GLSM introduced by Hori and Tong and has gauge group U(2). It has two geometric phases, both of which describe the same elliptic curve, once realised as a codimension five complete intersection in G(2,5) and once as a determinantal variety. The determinantal phase is strongly coupled with unbroken SU(2). There are two singular points in the moduli space where the theory has a Coulomb branch. Using grade restriction rules, we show how to transport B-branes between the two phases along paths avoiding the singular points. With the help of the GLSM hemisphere partition function we compute analytic continuation matrices and monodromy matrices, confirming results obtained by different methods.</description>
