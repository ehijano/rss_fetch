      <title>Elliptic Clausen Functions and Degenerations Circular, Elliptic, and Hyperbolic Parallelism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a unified elliptic extension of CL-type Clausen functions based on logarithmic primitives of the Jacobi theta function. The resulting elliptic Clausen family satisfies the same integral recursion as the classical circular case, with all differences encoded in boundary constants determined by the underlying logarithmic kernel. This separation clarifies a strict parallelism between circular, elliptic, and hyperbolic regimes and makes their degeneration limits transparent. We further discuss the general structure of the odd boundary constants, which organize naturally into modular families associated with the elliptic kernel. Possible extensions to SL-type frameworks and related master objects are briefly outlined.</description>

      <title>Structural Obstructions in Fixed-Shift Prime Correlations via Mellin-Laplace Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a Mellin-Laplace analytic framework for the fixed-shift prime correlation r_h(n) = Lambda(n) Lambda(n+h) for h not equal to 0. This sequence has no multiplicative structure, no Euler product, and no singularity at s = 1.
  For every compactly supported Mellin-Laplace admissible kernel W, the smoothed shifted sum S_{W,h}(N) admits an absolutely convergent Mellin representation that holds entirely in the half-plane Re(s) &gt; 1, with no use of analytic continuation.
  The Mellin transform of W provides quantitative vertical decay, enabling full contour control on the boundary line Re(s) = 1 + eps. A Tauberian boundary analysis shows that both components of the boundary integral grow like N^{1+eps}, while the oscillatory part contributes an unavoidable N^{1+eps} (log N)^2 term. As a result, the boundary integral cannot be decomposed into a dominant main term plus a smaller error term, revealing a structural obstruction to main-term extraction for fixed-shift correlations.
  These results give a complete analytic description of shifted prime correlations in their natural domain of convergence and clarify the analytic difficulties underlying problems such as the twin prime conjecture.</description>

      <title>A Logarithmic Spiral Formed by a Sequence of Regular Polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09060v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When the sequence of regular polygons with consecutively increasing numbers of sides is joined edge-to-edge in a single direction while minimizing bending, the resulting structure assumes the shape of a logarithmic spiral. This paper proves that this spiral takes the form r=exp(4{\theta}/{\pi}). Specifically, it is derived that the distances between the curve and the centers of the even-sided and odd-sided regular polygons converge to 5/6 and 7/12, respectively, with the centers extending outward along the inner side of the spiral. A similar analysis applied to the sequence of regular polygons with consecutively increasing odd numbers of sides reveals that it forms the same type of spiral, establishing that the distances to the centers converge to 7/24.</description>
