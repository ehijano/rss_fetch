      <title>Quantum Geometry of Altermagnetic Magnons Probed by Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnons with momentum-dependent chirality are a key signature of altermagnets. We identify bicircular light as a smoking-gun optical probe for chiral altermagnetic magnons, selectively targeting their quantum geometry induced by an alteration of magnonic chirality. We show that in $d$-wave altermagnets, under a canting magnetic field, the altermagnetic magnons realize a nontrivial quantum geometry, resulting in an enhancement of the nonlinear second-order light-magnon interactions. We find that the scattering of bicircular pulses probes the present magnon quantum geometry, even if the magnonic topology is trivial. Hence, our findings establish bicircular Raman response as an optical effect of choice to identify altermagnetic magnons. As such, we propose a universal experimental protocol to distinguish altermagnets from antiferromagnets by detecting their magnon chirality patterns with light, independently of the underlying magnon topology.</description>

      <title>Self-assembled fluorescent nanodiamond layers for quantum imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is emerging as a powerful tool for imaging magnetic and electric signals at the microscale and below. However, most imaging demonstrations thus far have relied on costly, millimeter-sized bulk diamond substrates, which cannot be easily scaled or integrated with other materials. Here, we report a scalable method for fabricating NV-containing dense and homogenous fluorescent nanodiamond (FND) layers through electrostatic self-assembly and demonstrate the utility of the FND layers for magnetic imaging. We investigate the effect of FND concentration in suspension, substrate immersion time, and solvent pH on the FND density on the substrate. We identify optimized self-assembly conditions that maximize the FND density while minimizing aggregation. Using FND layers on a quartz substrate, we demonstrate magnetic field and magnetic noise imaging at the microscale, based on NV optically detected magnetic resonance magnetometry and T$_1$ relaxometry, respectively. Our results provide a direction for the development of cost-effective and scalable FND layers and surface coatings. This paves the way for on-demand quantum sensing and imaging on a broad range of surfaces based on NV centers and other diamond quantum emitters.</description>

      <title>Observation of Embedded Topology in a Trivial Bulk via Projective Crystal Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bulk-boundary correspondence is the foundational principle of topological physics, first established in the quantum Hall effect, where a $D$-dimensional topologically nontrivial bulk gives rise to $(D-1)$-dimensional boundary states. The advent of higher-order topology has generalized this principle to a hierarchical chain, enabling topological states to appear at $(D-2)$ or even lower-dimensional boundaries. To date, all known realizations of topological systems must require a topologically nontrivial bulk to initiate the chain of action for bulk-boundary correspondence. Here, in an acoustic crystal platform, we experimentally demonstrate an exception to this paradigm--embedded topology in a trivial bulk--where the bulk-boundary correspondence originates from a trivial bulk. Rather than relying on global symmetries, we employ projective crystal symmetry, which induces nontrivial topology not at the outset in the $D$-dimensional bulk, but midway through the correspondence hierarchy in lower-dimensional boundaries. We further realize a three-dimensional system exhibiting embedded topology that supports zero-dimensional topological states, achieving the longest possible chain of action for such an unconventional bulk-boundary correspondence in physical space. Our work experimentally establishes a new form of bulk-boundary correspondence initiated from a trivial bulk, opening additional degrees of freedom for the design of robust topological devices.</description>

      <title>Dielectric Substrate Dependence of Thermoelectric Transport in BLG-GaAs-BLG Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study the thermoelectric transport S in a double-layer bilayer graphene (BLG-GaAs-BLG) system on dielectric substrates (h-BN, Al2O3, HfO2). Electrons interact with GaAs acoustic phonons via both the deformation potential (acDP) and piezoelectric (acPE) scattering. Results show that piezoelectric scattering dominates the total transport, especially at low carrier density and high dielectric constant. Substrate dielectric constant significantly influences thermopower S, and the thermopower of the materials is in the order of HfO2 &gt; Al2O3 &gt; h-BN. When densities on two BLG layers are unequal, the contribution from acDP scattering Sd decreases (increases) at low (high) densities versus equal densities, while acPE scattering Sg remains stable, making S largely Sg-dependent. Increasing interlayer distance d enhances S, while higher temperature boosts Sd (notably at low densities) with minimal effect on Sg. These insights and substrate-dependent trends demonstrate substrate engineering as a key parameter for optimizing BLG thermoelectric devices</description>

      <title>Quantum Bipolar Thermoelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectricity usually originates from energy-dependent transport asymmetries. In this Letter, we explore a purely quantum thermoelectric effect rooted in the emission/absorption asymmetry of a low-temperature quantum bath. We propose a gap-asymmetric S-I-S' superconducting tunnel junction in thermal equilibrium, coupled to a low-temperature electromagnetic environment, which develops a nonlinear quantum bipolar thermoelectric effect due to the dynamical Coulomb blockade. Key performance features are analyzed for realistic implementations.</description>

      <title>Organic altermagnets based in two-dimensional nanographene frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism stands as a third type of collinear magnetic order, whose band structure combines a net zero magnetization with a non-relativistic spin-splitting caused by a broken time reversal symmetry. So far, the strategy to design platforms displaying altermagnetism has relied mostly on inorganic crystals with d-metals as spin centers, where a representative example is the two-dimensional square lattice with antiparallel D2h magnetic blocks related by a pi/2 rotation. Despite the fact that there is no strong requirement for the magnetic atoms to be metals, the construction of an altermagnetic framework with light elements like carbon is challenging due to symmetric constrictions. We show how it is possible to overcome this by including non-alternant rings in pi-conjugated nanographenes. More specifically, dibenzo[ef,kl]heptalene, an S = 1 pi-conjugated hydrocarbon consisting of a graph of two fused heptagons and hexagons, represents a suitable building block for an altermagnetic 2D crystal. In this work, we confirm this hypothesis with DFT calculations of the spin polarized band structure, presenting a spin compensated ground state with broken time reversal symmetry, and a d-wave symmetry of the first valence and conduction bands. Consistent results are obtained for covalent organic frameworks based on dibenzo[ef,kl]heptalene units connected by linkers, paving the way for the realization of organic altermagnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Theory of Light-Induced Coherent Phonons Mediated by Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-induced coherent phonons provide a powerful platform for ultrafast control of material properties. However, the microscopic theory and quantum geometric nature of this phenomenon remain underexplored. Here, we develop a fully quantum-mechanical framework based on Feynman diagrams to systematically describe the generation of coherent phonons by light. We identify a dominant second-order, double-resonant process in noncentrosymmetric semiconductors that efficiently couples light to both electronic and phononic excitations. Crucially, we uncover the quantum geometric origin, encoded in the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) shift vector and the EPC quantum geometric tensor. Applying our theory to ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ and SnSe, we demonstrate the potential for light-induced modulation of ferroelectric polarization driven by coherent phonons. This work provides fundamental insights for designing efficient optical control strategies for both coherent phonons and ferroelectric polarization.</description>

      <title>Berry Curvature of Low-Energy Excitons in Rhombohedral Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate low energy excitons in rhombohedral pentalayer graphene encapsulated by hexagonal boron nitride (hBN/R5G/hBN), focusing on the regime at the experimental twist angle $\theta = 0.77^\circ$ and with an applied electric field. We introduce a new low-energy two-band model of rhombohedral graphene that captures the band structure more accurately than previous models while keeping the number of parameters low. Using this model, we show that the centres of the exciton Wannier functions are displaced from the moir\'e unit cell origin by a quantised amount -- they are instead localised at $C_3$-symmetric points on the boundary. We also find that the exciton shift is electrically tunable: by varying the electric field strength, the exciton Wannier centre can be exchanged between inequivalent corners of the moir\'e unit cell. Our results suggest the possibility of detecting excitonic corner or edge modes, as well as novel excitonic crystal defect responses in hBN/R5G/hBN. Lastly, we find that the excitons in hBN/R5G/hBN inherit excitonic Berry curvature from the underlying electronic bands, enriching their semiclassical transport properties. Our results position rhombohedral graphene as a compelling tunable platform for probing exciton topology in moir\'e materials.</description>

      <title>From Wye-Delta to Cross-Square Recursion Configurations in Graphene-Based Quantum Hall Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In electrical metrology, the quantum Hall effect is accessed at the Landau level filling factor {\nu} = 2 plateau to define and disseminate the unit of electrical resistance (ohm). The robustness of the plateau is only exhibited at this Landau level filling factor and thus places a constraint on the quantized resistances that are accessible when constructing quantized Hall array resistance standards (QHARS) using epitaxial graphene on SiC. To overcome devices constrained by using Hall elements in series or in parallel, this work approaches the fabrication of a cross-square network configuration, which is similar to but departs slightly from conventional wye-delta designs and achieves significantly higher effective quantized resistance outputs. Furthermore, the use of pseudofractal-like recursion amplifies the ability to reach high resistances. QHARS devices designed as the ones here are shown to achieve an effective resistance of 55.81 M$\Omega$ in one configuration and 27.61 G$\Omega$ in another, with a hypothetically projected 317.95 T$\Omega$ that could be accessed with more specialized equipment. Teraohmmeter measurements reveal the limits of conventional wet cryogenic systems due to resistance leakage. Ultimately, this work builds on the capability of realizing exceptionally high-value quantum resistance standards.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium nonlinear model of thermoelectricity in superconducting tunnel junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectricity in superconducting tunnel junctions has always been studied under the hypothesis of equilibrium between the cold side and the thermal bath, usually in the linear regime. We define a more complete out-of-equilibrium nonlinear numerical model that reduces to the equilibrium linear model in the low-power limit. We find that the linear model does not correctly describe the behavior of superconducting tunnel junctions for parameters that are reasonable in practical experimental setups. Subsequently, we present the qualitative and quantitative differences between the models, discovering that for high power, the junction saturates and then inverts its behavior. Finally, we also clarify the difference between linear and nonlinear thermoelectricity and devise a new criterion to find nonlinear thermoelectricity in the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spin Hall Effect with Extended Topologically Protected Features in Altermangetic Multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional topological classification theory dictates that time-reversal symmetry confines the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification, permitting only a single pair of gapless helical edge states. Here, we utilize the recently discovered altermagnetism to circumvent this fundamental constraint. We demonstrate the realization of a unique QSH phase possessing multiple pairs of gapless helical edge states in altermagnetic multilayers. This exotic QSH phase, characterized by a mirror-spin Chern number, emerges from the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and $d$-wave altermagnetic ordering. Moreover, using first-principles calculations, we identify altermagnetic Fe$_2$Se$_2$O multilayers as promising material candidates, in which the number of gapless helical edge states scales linearly with the number of layers, leading to a correspondingly large, exactly quantized, and experimentally accessible spin-Hall conductance. Our findings unveil a new mechanism for stabilizing multiple pairs of gapless helical edge states, significantly expanding the scope of QSH effects, and provide a blueprint for utilizing altermagnetism to engineer desired topological phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum mechanical Maxwell demon is proposed in a quantum dot setting. The demon avoids continuous-measurement induced decoherence by exploiting an undetailed charge detector. The control of coherent tunneling via Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg-Majorana driving allows for efficient feedback operations with no work invested. The local violation of the second law achieves simultaneous power generation and cooling. We discuss the response current fluctuations, and the demon backaction deriving from failures, finding optimal performance in the nonadiabatic regime.</description>

      <title>Observation of Purcell Effect in Electrically Coupled Cavity-Magnet System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of the Purcell effect in a cavity-metallic magnet hybrid system using electric-field-mediated coupling. In this configuration, microwave-induced axial currents in the microwire induce circular magnetic fields that drive the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) of the magnetized microwire. Field-dependent transmission and reflection spectroscopies reveal a clear cavity perturbation consistent with the Purcell regime, in which the magnetic loss rate exceeds the light-matter coupling strength. Despite the small magnetic volume ($\sim 10^{-13}\,\text{m}^3$), measurements performed at both room temperature and 7 mK show coupling rates as high as 56 MHz, one order of magnitude stronger than expected from conventional coupling at the magnetic antinode. Time-domain ringdown measurements directly show the magnetic-field-dependent modification of the cavity photon lifetime, in agreement with theoretical predictions. These results establish a versatile approach for coupling microwave fields to metallic magnets via geometric and electric-field-mediated interactions, opening new opportunities for hybrid cavity-magnet systems.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Inorganic Materials Discovery via Multi-Agent Physics-Aware Scientific Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional machine learning approaches accelerate inorganic materials design via accurate property prediction and targeted material generation, yet they operate as single-shot models limited by the latent knowledge baked into their training data. A central challenge lies in creating an intelligent system capable of autonomously executing the full inorganic materials discovery cycle, from ideation and planning to experimentation and iterative refinement. We introduce SparksMatter, a multi-agent AI model for automated inorganic materials design that addresses user queries by generating ideas, designing and executing experimental workflows, continuously evaluating and refining results, and ultimately proposing candidate materials that meet the target objectives. SparksMatter also critiques and improves its own responses, identifies research gaps and limitations, and suggests rigorous follow-up validation steps, including DFT calculations and experimental synthesis and characterization, embedded in a well-structured final report. The model's performance is evaluated across case studies in thermoelectrics, semiconductors, and perovskite oxides materials design. The results demonstrate the capacity of SparksMatter to generate novel stable inorganic structures that target the user's needs. Benchmarking against frontier models reveals that SparksMatter consistently achieves higher scores in relevance, novelty, and scientific rigor, with a significant improvement in novelty across multiple real-world design tasks as assessed by a blinded evaluator. These results demonstrate SparksMatter's unique capacity to generate chemically valid, physically meaningful, and creative inorganic materials hypotheses beyond existing materials knowledge.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous photonic and phononic bandgaps in a hexagonal lattice geometry with gradually transforming circular-to-triangular air gap holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of photonic and phononic bandgaps within a single scalable architecture promises transformative advances in optomechanical and acousto-optic devices. Here, we design and simulate a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice in silicon with air-gap holes that transition smoothly from circular to triangular via tuneable geometrical parameters R and l. This transformation enables suppression of both electromagnetic and elastic wave modes through Bragg scattering and symmetry modulation. We demonstrate that systematic variation of R and l allows tuning of photonic and phononic bandgaps by 18% and 21% respectively. This possibility of geometrical tuning of bandgaps provide strong foundations for applications in Bragg filters, sensors etc. without the need for complex defects and exotic materials.</description>

      <title>Electronic ordering driven by flat band nesting in a van der Waals magnet Fe5GeTe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state systems with flat electronic bands have a theoretical propensity to form electronic orders such as superconductivity and charge-density waves. However, for many flat-band systems such as Kagome and Clover lattices, the flat bands do not naturally appear at the Fermi level, hence not driving the low-energy electronic ordering. Here we demonstrate the concurrent formation of flat bands at the Fermi level and a $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}\, R30^\circ$ charge order in a van der Waals magnet Fe5GeTe2 using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. This charge order is manifested by clear band structure folding below 100 K, yet the band folding is limited to 30 meV below the Fermi level where the flat bands reside. The nesting vector in the reciprocal space connects segments of Fermi surfaces where pronounced flat bands are discovered. Taken together with calculations of the Lindhard response function, our results establish Fe5GeTe2 as a model system where flat bands promote inter-band nesting and electronic ordering. The appearance of the flat band at the Fermi level is reminiscent of the Kondo lattice effect, yet we point out that the flat bands may originate from the abundance of vacancies in the Fe(1) sublattice, where the vacancies induce flat dispersions via destructive charge or spin interactions.</description>

      <title>Topological invariants and topological charges in photonic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topology in photonics comes in two distinct flavors: global and local. Global topology considers invariants that are obtained by integrating over the energy band, whereas local topology considers defects, typically vortices, in the far-field emission. These topologies are described by a wide range of models built in both real and momentum space, which are connected only by computationally expensive numerical methods that lack physical intuition. Here we propose a general framework based on a real-space Hamiltonian capable of describing electric field as a vector in both near- and far fields, allowing us to bridge between topological defects in the far-field and global topological invariants. The proposed Hamiltonian is constructed from the symmetry-representations of the lattice, is deformable to both atomic localized-mode (tight-binding) and photonic delocalized-mode (long-range) limits, and allows for independent control over the energies of eigenmodes of different symmetries at high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. This symmetry-based approach enables the design of structures with almost arbitrary topological properties and is not limited to photonic systems, but could apply to any system with engineered real-space couplings.</description>

      <title>All Photonic Isolator using Atomically Thin (2D) Bismuth Telluride (Bi2Te3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study demonstrates that two-dimensional (2D) Bi2Te3 exhibits strong light-matter interaction, enabling a broadband Kerr nonlinear optical response. This characteristic is advantageous for nonreciprocal light propagation in passive photonic isolators. Using Spatial Self-Phase Modulation (SSPM) spectroscopy, self-induced diffraction patterns in the far field were observed at excitation wavelengths of 650 nm, 532 nm, and 405 nm to calculate the nonlinear refractive index (n2) and the third-order nonlinear optical susceptibility (chi^(3)) of the synthesized 2D Bi2Te3.
  The results show that 2D Bi2Te3 possesses a significantly higher nonlinear refractive index than graphene. The laser-induced hole coherence effect is responsible for the large magnitude of the third-order nonlinear susceptibility. Surface engineering techniques were also employed to enhance the response speed of the photonic system.
  Complementary ab initio simulations were performed to gain further insight into the observed nonlinear behavior. Leveraging the strong Kerr nonlinearity of 2D Bi2Te3, a nonlinear photonic isolator that breaks time-reversal symmetry and enables unidirectional light propagation was demonstrated. This work establishes Bi2Te3 as a novel 2D material for nonlinear photonics, expanding its potential applications in detectors, modulators, and optical switches.</description>

      <title>Engineering subgap states in superconductors by altermagnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the realization and control of subgap states by tailored altermagnetic fields on unconventional superconductors. When the symmetries of altermagnetism and unconventional superconductivity align, we demonstrate the emergence of bulk zero-energy flat bands, giving rise to a zero-bias conductance peak. The symmetry and strength of $d$- and $g$-wave altermagnets strongly affect the surface Andreev states from $d$-wave and chiral $d$- and $p$-wave superconductors. As a result, distinct types of subgap states are realized, including curved and flat bands, that can be detected by tunneling spectroscopy. Furthermore, we find that the altermagnetism-induced subgap states give rise to a large spin conductance at zero net magnetization which helps identify the strength of the underlying altermagnetism and superconductivity. Our results offer a solid route for designing and manipulating subgap states in superconducting systems, which can be useful for functionalizing superconducting spintronic devices.</description>

Abstract: We present a scheme for generating stable and tunable entanglement between two localized Bloch domain walls in nanomagnetic strips kept inside a chiral optical cavity. The entanglement is mediated by the effective optomechanical interaction between the cavity photons and the two macroscopic, collective modes of the pinned domain walls. By controlling the pinning potential and optical driving frequency, the robust, steady-state entanglement between the two macroscopic domain walls can survive beyond the typical milli-Kelvin temperature range.</description>

      <title>Revealing Polymorph-Specific Transduction in WO$_3$ during Acetone Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymorphs are distinct structural forms of the same compound and offer unique opportunities to tailor material properties without altering chemical composition. In particular, the polymorphs of WO$_3$ have been widely explored for their molecular sensing performance; yet, the mechanistic aspects behind their different chemoresistive properties have remained elusive or poorly understood. Here, we highlight the energetic allocation of transferred charge as a critical aspect for chemoresistive response generation, providing a new perspective beyond more conventional net-transfer metrics, which are usually deployed to investigate gas-solid interactions. To this, we combined operando work function, chemisorption analysis, and in situ spectroscopy with density functional theory calculations on the example of acetone. Both gamma- and $\varepsilon$-WO$_3$ exhibit comparable surface-level activation of acetone, mediated by electron-deficient, coordinatively unsaturated tungsten sites. However, only $\varepsilon$-WO$_3$ stabilizes analyte-induced electronic states derived from W(5d) orbitals lying just below the conduction band - an energetically favourable region for conductivity modulation under operating conditions. While being associated with marginal work function shifts, these states reflect deeper subsurface electronic rearrangements that may underlie the $\varepsilon$-WO$_3$'s superior transduction efficiency despite similar receptor chemistry. Our results offer a new framework for rational transducer development rooted in intrinsic electronic structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13099v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron-magnon coupling at the interface between a normal metal and a magnetically ordered insulator modifies the electrical conductivity of the normal metal, an effect known as spin-Hall magnetoresistance. It can also facilitate magnon-mediated current drag, the nonlocal electric current response of two normal metal layers separated by a magnetic insulator. Additionally, spin and heat transport are coupled both in the magnetic insulator and across the interfaces to normal metals. In this article, we present a theory of these spintronic and spin-caloritronic effects for time-dependent applied electric fields $E(\omega)$, with driving frequencies $\omega$ up to the THz regime. Our model describes how the dominant transport mechanism, coherent or incoherent magnons, evolves with the driving frequency $\omega$.</description>

      <title>Topological magnons and domain walls in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the magnetic excitations in the quantum anomalous Hall insulator phase of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ at a hole filling factor of $\nu=1$, focusing on magnon and domain wall excitations. Using a generalized interacting Kane-Mele model, we obtain the quantum anomalous Hall insualtor ground state with spin polarization. The magnon spectrum is then computed via the Bethe-Salpeter equation, revealing two low-energy topological magnon bands with opposite Chern numbers. To further explore the magnon topology, we construct a tight-binding model for the magnon bands, which is analogous to the Haldane model. We also calculate the energy cost of domain walls that separate regions with opposite Chern numbers and bind chiral edge states. Finally, we propose an effective spin model that describes both magnon and domain wall excitations, incorporating Heisenberg spin interactions and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. The coupling constants in this model are determined from the numerical results for magnons and domain walls. This model accounts for the Ising anisotropy of the system, captures the magnon topology, and allows for the estimation of the magnetic ordering temperature. Our findings provide a comprehensive analysis of magnetic excitations in twisted MoTe$_2$ and offer new insights into collective excitations in moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>Room-Temperature Pauli Spin Blockade and Current Rectification in 15-13-15 Armchair Graphene Nanoribbon Heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the electronic structures of 13-11-13 and 15-13-15 armchair graphene nanoribbon (AGNR) superlattices (SLs) using a tight-binding model. We demonstrate that the conduction and valence subbands of 15-13-15 AGNR SLs can be accurately described by the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, with topologically protected interface states emerging at the junctions between 15-AGNR and 13-AGNR segments. These interface states enable the formation of quantum dot arrays with energy levels well separated from bulk states, making them promising candidates for high-temperature solid-state quantum processors. For 15-13-15 AGNRH segments, we observe both localized zigzag edge states and topologically protected interface states under longitudinal electric fields, with the latter providing efficient tunneling channels in contrast to the less conductive edge states. We further explore nonlinear charge transport through these interface states under Pauli spin blockade, showing that tunneling current spectra reveal charge stability diagrams and Coulomb blockade oscillations, consistent with experimental findings in other serial double quantum dot systems. Additionally, we examine the impact of orbital offsets on tunneling current rectification and demonstrate that significant current rectification is achieved over a wide temperature range when level broadening is optimized. These results highlight the potential of 15-13-15 AGNRHs for robust spin-current conversion and applications in quantum devices, offering advantages over other proposed structures due to precise tunability of key parameters via bottom-up synthesis techniques and the ease of two-gate electrode integration.</description>

      <title>Enantiosensitive locking of photoelectron spin and cation orientation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22433v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chirality describes the asymmetry between an object and its mirror image, underpinning diverse functionalities across all scales of matter-from molecules and aggregates to thin films and bulk chiral materials. A particularly intriguing example is chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), where chiral structures orient electron spins enantio-sensitively. Despite extensive research, the fundamental origin of spin-chirality coupling, the unexpectedly large magnitude of the CISS effect, and the possible role of electromagnetic fields remain unclear. Here, we address these issues by examining the simplest scenario: spin-resolved photoionization of randomly oriented chiral molecules. We uncover two universal geometric mechanisms of spin-selective photodynamics, arising solely from electric-dipole interactions and previously unrecognized. These mechanisms operate effectively even in amorphous chiral media under isotropic illumination and persist at weak spin-orbit coupling, underscoring fundamental aspects of spin-chirality interplay. We further identify an unreported phenomenon central to CISS: locking of photoelectron spin orientation to molecular geometry. Our findings provide a unified geometric framework with broad implications, extending from CISS and asymmetric catalysis to spin textures in chiral crystals and chiral quantum materials such as Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological model for the direct and inverse Edelstein effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:1901.03095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have developed a phenomenological model that connects the direct and the inverse Edelstein effects. Our model implies a trade-off relation between the conversion coefficients for the direct and inverse effects. Thus, a large conversion coefficient for the inverse effect does not necessarily bring a large conversion coefficient for the direct effect. Instead of these coefficients, we propose a figure of merit of Edelstein effects which consists of two factors; one of them represents the magnitude of the spin-orbit coupling, and the other represents the strength of the hybridization between bulk and interface states. Both of them are quit important for the efficient conversion through Edelstein effects. To test our model, we measured the inverse and direct Edelstein effects at the Bi2O3/Cu interface using spin absorption method with a non-local spin valve structure and calculated the conversion coefficients. The effective spin Hall angle reaches ~0.09 in this system. This relatively large value is attributable to not only the large spin-orbit coupling but also the strong hybridization between the interface and bulk states at the Bi2O3/Cu interface.</description>

      <title>Topological Chiral Superconductivity Mediated by Intervalley Antiferromagnetic Fluctuations in Twisted Bilayer WSe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent observations of superconductivity in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ (tWSe$_2$), we theoretically investigate the superconductivity driven by electronic mechanism. We first demonstrate that the multi-band screened Coulomb interaction within the random phase approximation is insufficient to induce observable pairing instability. Nevertheless, by further including the intervalley antiferromagnetic fluctuations, the pairing interaction is substantially enhanced, yielding superconductivity with critical temperature $T_c$ of hundreds of millikelvin at van Hove singularities. The predicted $T_c$ increases with increasing the displacement field and corresponds to a doubly-degenerate $d$-wave-like pairing, which evolves into topological chiral $d \pm id$ superconductor below $T_c$. The interplay between superconductivity and intervalley antiferromagnetism results in a phase diagram consistent with experimental observations.These findings establish intervalley fluctuations as the primary pairing glue in tWSe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Interplay between altermagnetism and topological superconductivity on an unconventional superconducting platform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical model to investigate the interplay between altermagnetism and $p$-wave superconductivity, with a particular focus on topological phase transitions in a two-dimensional (2D) $p$-wave superconductor, considering both chiral and helical phases. Our study reveals that the emergence of helical and chiral Majorana states can be tuned by the amplitude of a $d-$wave altermagnetic order parameter, with the outcome depending on the nature of the superconducting state. In the helical superconductor, such an altermagnet can induce a topological phase transition into a gapless topological superconductor hosting Majorana flat edge modes. On the other hand, in the chiral superconductor, the topological transition takes place between a topologically nontrivial gapped phase and a gapless nodal-line superconductor, where the Bogoliubov quasiparticle bands intersect at an isolated line in momentum space. Remarkably, we show that when such an altermagnet is coupled to a mixed-pairing superconductor, with both chiral and helical components, a hybrid topological phase emerges, featuring dispersive Majorana edge modes that coexist with nearly flat Majorana edge states. Our findings therefore establish a novel platform for controlling and manipulating Majorana modes in unconventional superconductors with vanishing total magnetization.</description>

      <title>High-power readout of a transmon qubit using a nonlinear coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of superconducting qubits is constantly evolving with new circuit designs. However, when it comes to qubit readout, the use of simple transverse linear coupling remains overwhelmingly prevalent. This standard readout scheme has significant drawbacks: in addition to the Purcell effect, it suffers from a limitation on the maximal number of photons in the readout mode, which restricts the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the Quantum Non-Demolition (QND) nature of the readout. Here, we explore the high-power regime by engineering a nonlinear coupling between a transmon qubit and its readout mode. Our approach builds upon previous work by Dassonneville et al. [Physical Review X 10, 011045 (2020)], on qubit readout with a non-perturbative cross-Kerr coupling in a transmon molecule. We demonstrate a readout fidelity of 99.21% with 89 photons utilizing a parametric amplifier. At this elevated photon number, the QND nature remains high at 96.7%. Even with up to 300 photons, the QNDness is only reduced by a few percent. This is qualitatively explained by deriving a critical number of photons associated with the nonlinear coupling, yielding a theoretical value of $\bar{n}_r^\text{crit} = 377$ photons for our sample's parameters. These results highlight the promising performance of the transmon molecule in the high-power regime, establishing it as a compelling platform for high-fidelity qubit readout.</description>

Abstract: Plasmonic nanostructures enable efficient light-to-energy conversion by concentrating optical energy into nanoscale volumes. A key mechanism in this process is chemical interface damping (CID), where surface plasmons are damped by adsorbed molecules, enabling the transfer of charge to adsorbed molecules. In this study, we investigate the relationship between CID and adsorbate-induced changes in DC electrical resistivity for four molecular adsorbates-adenine, 4-aminothiophenol (ATP), biphenyl thiol (BPT), and 1-dodecanethiol (DDT)-on gold surfaces. Our results reveal two distinct CID regimes. BPT causes CID via direct electronic transitions to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), which is centered at approx. 2 eV above the Fermi level and can be resonantly excited by the plasmon. This mechanism is dependent on plasmon energy. In contrast, ATP, adenine and DDT lead to plasmon damping through inelastic electron scattering at the metal-molecule interface. This regime shows a weaker dependency on plasmon energy since it does not involve resonant electron excitation between hybridized metal-molecule states. This same mechanism contributes to adsorbate-induced changes in DC resistivity, suggesting that resistivity measurements can serve as a probe of plasmonic energy transfer, as highlighted by the good correlation between the two effects. These findings provide new insights into the microscopic origins of plasmon damping and offer a unified framework for understanding metal-adsorbate energy transfer.</description>

      <title>Magnetic and ferroelectric phase diagram of twisted CrI$_3$ layers</title>

Abstract: Twisting layers provide a rich ore for exotic physics in low dimensions. Despite the abundant discoveries of twistronics from the aspect of electronic structures, ferroic moir\'e textures are more plain and thus less concerned. Rigid lattice models are straightforward which can give a rough but intuitional description in most cases. However, taking CrI$_3$ as a model system, here we will demonstrate that the interlayer stacking potential can spontaneously lead to structural relaxation, which plays a vital role to understand the ferroicity in the twisted superlattices. The magnetic ground state is sensitive to the stacking mode and twisting angles, which can be seriously affected by the structural relaxation. In particular, the expected magnetic bubbles are annihilated in its bilayer. In contrast, due to topological protection, the ferroelectric vortices are more robust to structural relaxation, as well as twisting angle and thickness.Due to the universal existence of spontaneous structural relaxation in twisted superlattices, our work may lead to a general revisitation of emerging physics of twistronics.</description>

      <title>Anomalous charge density wave in altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploring the intricate interplay between magnetism and charge density waves has long been a fundamental pursuit at the forefront of condensed matter research. In this letter, based on symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we propose for the first time that anomalous charge density wave can be realized in two-dimensional altermagnetic WO. The anomalous charge density wave is characterized by three key features: (i) Unlike conventional charge density wave, whose stabilization is driven by the opening of a gap near the Fermi level, the anomalous charge density wave is stabilized by the occupied states with energies shifting lower far away from the Fermi level; (ii) the anomalous charge density wave increases the density of states near the Fermi level and then enhances-rather than diminishes-the metallicity of materials; (iii) altermagnetism plays a crucial role in stabilizing anomalous charge density wave. Thus, our work offers a pathway for exploring both the realization and the underlying mechanisms of anomalous charge density waves in magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Hybrid magnon -- Nambu-Goldstone excitations in topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator thin-film heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address a previously unexplored type of dynamical proximity effect that occurs in s-wave topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator (TS/FI) heterostructures. It is predicted that magnons in the FI and the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) collective superconducting phase mode in the TS are coupled, forming composite magnon-NG excitations. The mechanism of this coupling is associated with the complete spin-momentum locking of electrons in the helical surface state of the TS. The strength of the magnon-NG coupling is strongly anisotropic with respect to the mutual orientation of the magnon wave vector and the equilibrium magnetization of the FI. This effect provides a mechanism for the interconversion of spin signals and the spinless signals carried by collective superconducting excitations, thereby giving new impetus to the development of superconducting spintronics.</description>

      <title>Theory of hybrid collective excitations in topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a linear response theory for the dynamical proximity effect in topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator (TS/FI) hybrid structures. Our approach combines the nonequilibrium quasiclassical Keldysh-Usadel equations for the electronic Green's functions in the TS with the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation governing the magnetization dynamics in the FI. Within this framework, we study the proximity-induced coupling between magnons and superconducting collective excitations. We find that the spin-momentum locking intrinsic to the surface state of the TS leads to a hybridization between the superconducting Nambu-Goldstone (phase) collective mode and magnons, resulting in the emergence of composite magnon-Nambu-Goldstone excitations. The dependence of the coupling strength on relevant physical parameters is analyzed both analytically and numerically. In contrast, we show that the Higgs (amplitude) mode does not couple to magnons at linear order and therefore does not participate in the formation of hybrid collective excitations.</description>
