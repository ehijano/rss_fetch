      <title>Doubly charm tetraquark channel with isospin $1$ from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimentally, the doubly charm tetraquark channel $cc\bar q\bar q$ with $q\!=\!u,d$ features an exotic hadron, $T_{cc}$, with isospin $I\!=\!0$ near the $DD^*$ threshold, while no peak was observed for $I\!=\!1$. We present a lattice QCD study of this channel with $I\!=\!1$, $J^P\!=\!1^+$ and $m_\pi\simeq 280~$MeV. Finite-volume energies calculated across five charm quark masses consistently indicate a repulsive interaction in this channel. These energies are used to compute the $DD^*$ scattering amplitude using both the standard L\"uscher method and the recently proposed effective-field-theory-based approach in the plane-wave basis, which incorporates the long-range interactions and the left-hand cut. Both analyses reaffirm the repulsive interaction resulting in a scattering amplitude that does not feature any poles in the energy region near the $DD^*$ threshold, in line with LHCb results. We identify that the Wick contraction resembling $t$-channel isovector-vector meson exchanges between $D$ and $D^*$ plays a key role in distinguishing between the $I=0$ and $I=1$ channels, leading to repulsion in the $I=1$ and attraction in the $I=0$ channel.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD calculation of the $\pi^0$-pole contribution to the hadronic light-by-light scattering in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a method to compute the pion transition form factors directly at arbitrary photon momenta and use it to determine the $\pi^0$-pole contribution to the hadronic light-by-light scattering in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. The calculation is performed using eight gauge ensembles generated with 2+1 flavor domain wall fermions, incorporating multiple pion masses, lattice spacings, and volumes. By introducing a pion structure function and performing a Gegenbauer expansion, we demonstrate that about 98% of the $\pi^0$-pole contribution can be extracted in a model-independent manner, thereby ensuring that systematic effects are well controlled. After applying finite-volume corrections, as well as performing chiral and continuum extrapolations, we obtain the final result for the $\pi^0$-pole contribution to the hadronic light-by-light scatterintg in the muon's anomalous magnetic moment, $a_{\mu}^{\pi^0\mathrm{-pole}}=59.6(2.2)\times 10^{-11}$, and the $\pi^0$ decay width, $\Gamma_{\pi^0\to \gamma\gamma}=7.20(35)\mathrm{eV}$.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Categorical Construction of Instanton Density in Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the inception of lattice QCD, a natural definition for the Yang-Mills instanton on lattice has been long sought for. In a recent work, one of authors showed the natural solution has to be organized in terms of bundle gerbes in higher homotopy theory / higher category theory, and introduced the principles for such a categorical construction. To pave the way towards actual numerical implementation in the near future, nonetheless, an explicit construction is necessary. In this paper we provide such an explicit construction for $SU(2)$ gauge theory, with technical aspects inspired by L\"{u}scher's 1982 geometrical construction. We will see how the latter is in a suitable sense a saddle point approximation to the full categorical construction. The generalization to $SU(N)$ will be discussed. The construction also allows for a natural definition of lattice Chern-Simons-Yang-Mills theory in three spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>String Breaking in the Heavy Quark Limit with Scalable Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of non-Abelian gauge theories require efficient mappings onto quantum computers and practical state preparation and measurement procedures. A truncation of the Hilbert space of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories with matter in the heavy quark limit is developed. This truncation is applied to $SU(2)$ lattice gauge theory in $1+1D$ to map the theory efficiently onto a quantum computer. Scalable variational circuits are found to prepare the vacuum and single meson states. It is also shown how these state preparation circuits can be used to perform measurements of the number of mesons produced during the system's time evolution. A state with a single $q\overline{q}$ pair is prepared on quantum hardware and the inelastic production of $q\overline{q}$ pairs is observed using $104$ qubits on IBM's Heron quantum computer ibm_torino.</description>

      <title>Exploring electromagnetic characteristics of the vector and axial-vector $B_c$ mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic moments of the $B_c$ mesons provide significant insights into their inner structure and geometric shape. Furthermore, a comprehensive understanding of the electromagnetic characteristics of $B_c$ mesons is essential for advancing our knowledge of confinement and heavy flavor effects. In light of this, we proceed to extract the magnetic moments of the ground-state vector and axial-vector $B_c$ mesons through the medium of the QCD light-cone sum rules. The magnetic moments of the axial-vector and vector $B_c$ mesons are found to be $\mu_{B_c}= -0.47 \pm 0.07~\mu_N$, and $\mu_{B_c}= 0.15 \pm 0.02~\mu_N$, respectively. A comparison of our results for the vector $B_c$ meson with other theoretical predictions has revealed discrepancies between the various predictions, which could prove useful as a complementary tool for interpreting the vector $B_c$ meson. The current experimental data set is limited to a small number of observed states of beauty-charm mesons. However, theoretical studies can play a valuable role in elucidating their nature and guiding future experimental investigations.</description>

      <title>Improved entanglement entropy estimates from filtered bitstring probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The von Neumann entanglement entropy provides important information regarding critical points and continuum limits for analog simulators such as arrays of Rydberg atoms. The easily accessible mutual information associated with the bitstring probabilities of complementary subsets $A$ and $B$ of one-dimensional quantum chains, provide reasonably sharp lower bounds on the corresponding bipartite von Neumann quantum entanglement entropy $S^{vN}_A$. Here, we show that these bounds can in most cases be improved by removing the bitstrings with a probability lower than some value $p_{min}$ and renormalizing the remaining probabilities (filtering). Surprisingly, in some cases, as we increase $p_{min}$ the filtered mutual information tends to plateaus at values very close to $S^{vN}_A$ over some range of $p_{min}$. We discuss the dependence on the size of the system, the lattice spacing, and the bipartition of the system. These observations were found for ladders of Rydberg atoms using numerical methods. We also compare with analog simulations involving Rubidium atoms performed remotely with the Aquila device.</description>

      <title>Tetraquark systems $\bar bb\bar du$ in the static limit and lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.08560v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two hadrons with exotic quark content $Z_b^+\simeq \bar bb \bar du$ were discovered by Belle. We present a lattice study of the $\bar bb\bar du$ systems with various quantum numbers using static bottom quarks. Only one set of quantum numbers that couples to $Z_b$ and $\Upsilon\;\pi$ was explored on the lattice before; these studies found an attractive potential between $B$ and $\bar B^*$ resulting in a bound state below the threshold. The present study considers the other three sets of quantum numbers. Eigenenergies of the $\bar bb \bar du$ system are extracted as a function of separation between $b$ and $\bar b$. The resulting eigenenergies do not show any sizable deviation from noninteracting energies of the systems $\bar bb+\bar du$ and $\bar bu+\bar db$, so no significant attraction or repulsion is found. A slight exception is a small attraction between $B$ and $\bar B^*$ at small distance for the quantum number that couples to $Z_b$ and $\eta_b\;\rho$.</description>

      <title>Scale setting and hadronic properties in light quark sector with $(2+1)$-flavor Wilson fermions at the physical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16665v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report scale setting and hadronic properties for our new lattice QCD gauge configuration set (HAL-conf-2023). We employ $(2+1)$-flavor nonperturbatively improved Wilson fermions with stout smearing and the Iwasaki gauge action on a $96^4$ lattice, and generate configurations of 8,000 trajectories at the physical point. We show the basic properties of the configurations such as the plaquette value, topological charge distribution and their auto-correlation times. The scale setting is performed by detailed analyses of the $\Omega$ baryon mass. We calculate the physical results of quark masses, decay constants of pseudoscalar mesons and single hadron spectra in light quark sector. The masses of the stable hadrons are found to agree with the experimental values within a sub-percent level.</description>

      <title>Extraction of the $S$-wave and $P$-wave $DD^*$ scattering phase shifts using twisted boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results of a lattice study of the $S$-wave and $P$-wave $DD^*$ scattering phase shifts using L\"uscher's method under the twisted boundary conditions to investigate the doubly charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}^+$ observed by the LHCb collaboration. Although the scattering phase shift at zero momentum gives information about the number of bound states according to Levinson's theorem, L\"uscher's method under the periodic boundary condition only accesses the scattering phase shifts at some discrete momenta and is not suitable for watching the signal of bound state formation. On the other hand, the twisted boundary condition has the advantage that the scattering phase shift at any momentum can be calculated and that not only the $S$-wave scattering phase shift but also the $P$-wave scattering phase shift can be obtained simultaneously. In this study, we perform the simulation for the $DD^*$ and $BB^*$ systems in the $I=0$ channel using 2+1 flavor PACS-CS gauge ensembles simulated at $m_\pi=295$ and 411 $\mathrm{MeV}$.</description>

      <title>Analytic and numerical bootstrap for the long-range Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02742v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine perturbation theory with analytic and numerical bootstrap techniques to study the critical point of the long-range Ising (LRI) model in two and three dimensions. This model interpolates between short-range Ising (SRI) and mean-field behaviour. We use the Lorentzian inversion formula to compute infinitely many three-loop corrections in the two-dimensional LRI near the mean-field end. We further exploit the exact OPE relations that follow from bulk locality of the LRI to compute infinitely many two-loop corrections near the mean-field end, as well as some one-loop corrections near SRI. By including such exact OPE relations in the crossing equations for LRI we set up a very constrained bootstrap problem, which we solve numerically using SDPB. We find a family of sharp kinks for two- and three-dimensional theories which compare favourably to perturbative predictions, as well as some Monte Carlo simulations for the two-dimensional LRI.</description>

      <title>Nucleon charge and magnetisation distributions: flavour separation and zeroes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08088v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A symmetry-preserving truncation of the quantum field equations describing hadron properties is used to deliver parameter-free predictions for all nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors and their flavour separation to large values of momentum transfer, $Q^2$. The proton electric form factor, $G_E^p$, possesses a zero, whereas that of the neutron, $G_E^n$, does not. The difference owes to the behaviour of the Pauli form factor of the proton's singly-represented valence $d$-quark. Consequently, $G_E^n&gt;G_E^p$ on a material large-$Q^2$ domain. These predictions can be tested in modern experiments.</description>

      <title>Impressions of Parton Distribution Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (DFs) have long been recognised as key measures of hadron structure. Today, theoretical prediction of such DFs is becoming possible using diverse methods for continuum and lattice analyses of strong interaction (QCD) matrix elements. Recent developments include a demonstration that continuum and lattice analyses yield mutually consistent results for all pion DFs, with behaviour on the far valence domain of light-front momentum fraction that matches QCD expectations. Theory is also delivering an understanding of the distributions of proton mass and spin amongst its constituents, which varies, of course, with the resolving scale of the measuring probe. Aspects of the pion DF and proton spin developments are sketched herein, along with some novel perspectives on gluon and quark orbital angular momentum.</description>
