      <title>CBDC Stress Test in a Dual-Currency Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the potential impact of introducing a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) on financial stability in an emerging dual-currency economy (Romania), where the domestic currency (RON) coexists with the euro. It develops an integrated analytical framework combining econometrics, machine learning, and behavioural modelling. CBDC adoption probabilities are estimated using XGBoost and logistic regression models trained on behavioural and macro-financial indicators rather than survey data. Liquidity stress simulations assess how banks would respond to deposit withdrawals resulting from CBDC adoption, while VAR, MSVAR, and SVAR models capture the macro-financial transmission of liquidity shocks into credit contraction and changes in monetary conditions. The findings indicate that CBDC uptake (co-circulating Digital RON and Digital EUR) would be moderate at issuance, amounting to around EUR 1 billion, primarily driven by digital readiness and trust in the central bank. The study concludes that a non-remunerated, capped CBDC, designed primarily as a means of payment rather than a store of value, can be introduced without compromising financial stability. In dual currency economies, differentiated holding limits for domestic and foreign digital currencies (e.g., Digital RON versus Digital Euro) are crucial to prevent uncontrolled euroisation and preserve monetary sovereignty. A prudent design with moderate caps, non remuneration, and macroprudential coordination can transform CBDC into a digital liquidity buffer and a complementary monetary policy instrument that enhances resilience and inclusion rather than destabilising the financial system.</description>

      <title>From Path Coefficients to Targeted Estimands: A Comparison of Structural Equation Models (SEM) and Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01040</link>

Abstract: Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) has gained popularity in the social sciences and causal inference due to its flexibility in modeling complex relationships between variables and its availability in modern statistical software. To move beyond the parametric assumptions of SEM, this paper reviews targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), a doubly robust, machine learning-based approach that builds on nonparametric SEM. We demonstrate that both TMLE and SEM can be used to estimate standard causal effects and show that TMLE is robust to model misspecification. We conducted simulation studies under both correct and misspecified model conditions, implementing SEM and TMLE to estimate these causal effects. The simulations confirm that TMLE consistently outperforms SEM under misspecification in terms of bias, mean squared error, and the validity of confidence intervals. We applied both approaches to a real-world dataset to analyze the mediation effects of poverty on access to high school, revealing that the direct effect is no longer significant under TMLE, whereas SEM indicates significance. We conclude with practical guidance on using SEM and TMLE in light of recent developments in targeted learning for causal inference.</description>

      <title>Towards Causal Market Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Market generators using deep generative models have shown promise for synthetic financial data generation, but existing approaches lack causal reasoning capabilities essential for counterfactual analysis and risk assessment. We propose a Time-series Neural Causal Model VAE (TNCM-VAE) that combines variational autoencoders with structural causal models to generate counterfactual financial time series while preserving both temporal dependencies and causal relationships. Our approach enforces causal constraints through directed acyclic graphs in the decoder architecture and employs the causal Wasserstein distance for training. We validate our method on synthetic autoregressive models inspired by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, demonstrating superior performance in counterfactual probability estimation with L1 distances as low as 0.03-0.10 compared to ground truth. The model enables financial stress testing, scenario analysis, and enhanced backtesting by generating plausible counterfactual market trajectories that respect underlying causal mechanisms.</description>
