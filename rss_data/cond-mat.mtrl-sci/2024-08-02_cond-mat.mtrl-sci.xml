      <title>A generalized phase-field cohesive zone model ($\mu$PF-CZM) for fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work a generalized phase-field cohesive zone model ($\mu$PF-CZM) is proposed within the framework of the unified phase-field theory for brittle and cohesive fracture. With the introduction of an extra dissipation function for the crack driving force, in addition to the geometric function for the phase-field regularization and the degradation function for the constitutive relation, theoretical and application scopes of the original PF-CZM are broadened greatly. These characteristic functions are analytically determined from the conditions for the length scale insensitivity and a non-shrinking crack band in a universal, optimal and rationalized manner, for almost any specific traction-separation law. In particular, with an optimal geometric function, the crack irreversibility can be considered without affecting the target traction-separation softening law. Not only concave softening behavior but also high-order cohesive traction, both being limitations of the previous works, can be properly dealt with. The global fracture responses are insensitive not only to the phase-field length scale but also to the traction order parameter, though the crack bandwidth might be affected by both. Despite the loss of variational consistency in general cases, the resulting $\mu$PF-CZM is still thermodynamically consistent. Moreover, the existing numerical implementation can be adopted straightforwardly with minor modifications. Representative numerical examples are presented to validate the proposed $\mu$PF-CZM and to demonstrate its capabilities in capturing brittle and cohesive fracture with general softening behavior. The insensitivity to both the phase-field length scale and the traction order parameter is also sufficiently verified.</description>

      <title>Weak $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Supertopology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal symmetries can enforce all bands of a material to be topological, a property that is commonly referred to as "supertopology". Here, we determine the symmetry-enforced $\mathbb{Z}_2$ supertopologies of non-magnetic centrosymmetric materials with weak and strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). For weak (i.e., negligible) SOC, crystal symmetries can enforce Dirac nodal lines protected by a $\pi$-Berry phase, while for strong SOC, crystal symmetries can give rise to nontrival weak $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologies in 2D subplanes of the 3D Brillouin zone. We catalogue all centrosymmetric space groups whose symmetries enforce these $\mathbb{Z}_2$ supertopologies. Suitable material realizations are identified and experimental signatures of the supertopologies, such as quantum spin Hall states, are being discussed.</description>

      <title>Tailoring photostriction via superlattices engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report systematic first-principles investigation of light-induced mechanical deformations in monodomain (PbTiO$_{3}$)$_{n}$/(SrTiO$_{3}$)$_{n}$ superlattices ($n=1-5$). We reveal that photostriction in these heterostructures quantitatively and qualitatively depends on the chemical period $n$. Specifically, we show that by changing the chemical period, we can induce $\textit {positive}$ or $\textit {negative}$ photostriction. We also present a simple analytical model to account for the calculated deformations. Our findings indicate that superlattices architectures may be key to design novel optomechanical applications.</description>

      <title>Tuning photostriction in (PbTiO$_{3}$)$_{n}$/(SrTiO$_{3}$)$_{m}$ superlattices via chemical composition: An $\textit{ab-initio}$ study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-induced mechanical deformations in single-domain (PbTiO$_{3}$)$_{n}$/(SrTiO$_{3}$)$_{m}$ superlattices were simulated using first-principle calculations. By varying the chemical fraction PbTiO$_{3}$, we discover that these heterostructures' photostrictive behavior can be tuned quantitatively and qualitatively. Additionally, we present simple analytical models to explain the calculated deformations and predict a critical PbTiO$_{3}$ fraction with no photostriction. In addition to the report in [1], our results present another way for tuning the photostrictive behavior of (PbTiO$_{3}$)$_{n}$/(SrTiO$_{3}$)$_{m}$ superlattices, which could be utilized for innovative optomechanical applications.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Boosted Entropy-Engineered Synthesis of stable Nanometric Solid Solution CuCo Alloys for Efficient Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanometric solid solution alloys are utilized in a broad range of fields, including catalysis, energy storage, medical application, and sensor technology. Unfortunately, the synthesis of these alloys becomes increasingly challenging as the disparity between the metal elements grows, due to differences in atomic sizes, melting points, and chemical affinities. This study utilized a data-driven approach incorporating sample balancing enhancement techniques and multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms to improve the model's ability to handle imbalanced data, significantly boosting the efficiency of experimental parameter optimization. Building on this enhanced data processing framework, we developed an entropy-engineered synthesis approach specifically designed to produce stable, nanometric copper and cobalt (CuCo) solid solution alloys. Under conditions of -0.425 V (vs. RHE), the CuCo alloy exhibited nearly 100% Faraday efficiency (FE) and a high ammonia production rate of 232.17 mg h-1 mg-1. Stability tests in a simulated industrial environment showed that the catalyst maintained over 80% FE and an ammonia production rate exceeding 170 mg h-1 mg-1 over a testing period of 120 hours, outperforming most reported catalysts. To delve deeper into the synergistic interaction mechanisms between Cu and Co, in situ Raman spectroscopy was utilized for realtime monitoring, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations further substantiated our findings. These results not only highlight the exceptional catalytic performance of the CuCo alloy but also reflect the effective electronic and energy interactions between the two metals.</description>

      <title>Energy-lowering symmetry breaking creates a flat-band insulator in paramagnetic Nb3Cl8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ordinary band structure calculations of quantum materials often incorrectly predicted metallic, instead of insulating electronic structure, motivating Mott-Hubbard strong electron correlation as a gapping mechanism. More recently, allowing the formation of local structural symmetry breaking motifs in otherwise ordinary band theory was shown to lower the total energy while predicting insulating gaps when they are observed. An important counter example was recently pointed out whereby the flat band formed in Nb3Cl8 by symmetry breaking is by itself partially occupied, thus failing to account for the observed insulating state. It is shown here that a generalized symmetry breaking involving the cooperative structural and magnetic effects produces in mean-field-like density functional theory an energy lowering insulating phase.</description>

      <title>Ultrastrong Terahertz Coupling in a van der Waals Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of strongly coupled photon-matter systems aims to create novel hybrid phases that enhance or modify material properties. A key challenge has been developing versatile platforms for exploring cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) of quantum materials. Here, we demonstrate and probe ultrastrong light-matter coupling in atomically-thin van der Waals materials. We developed a broadband time-domain microscope that integrates exfoliated, dual-gated, two-dimensional quantum materials with sub-wavelength photon confinement at terahertz frequencies. Using bilayer graphene as a model system, we perform spectroscopic studies across a wide range of frequencies and gate voltages. For the first time, we measure the field-tunable band gap of bilayer graphene at terahertz frequencies while simultaneously observing clear signatures of ultrastrong coupling, with interaction strengths exceeding $\Omega/\omega\approx 40\%$. Our work bridges the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental implementation of cavity QED in van der Waals materials, paving the way for further studies of exotic phases and novel light-matter states.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a metallic room-temperature d-wave altermagnet KV2Se2O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond conventional ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, altermagnetism is a recently discovered unconventional magnetic phase characterized by time-reversal symmetry breaking and spin-split band structures in materials with zero net magnetization. This distinct magnetic phase not only enriches the understanding of fundamental physical concepts but also has profound impacts on condense-matter physics research and practical device applications. Spin-polarized band structures have been recently observed in semiconductors MnTe and MnTe2 with vanishing net magnetization, confirming the existence of this unconventional magnetic order. Metallic altermagnets have unique advantages for exploring novel physical phenomena related to low-energy quasiparticle excitations and for applications in spintronics as electrical conductivity in metals allows the direct manipulation of spin current through electric field. Here, through comprehensive characterization and analysis of the magnetic and electronic structures of KV2Se2O, we have unambiguously demonstrated a metallic room-temperature altermaget with d-wave spin-momentum locking. The highly anisotropic spin-polarized Fermi surfaces and the spin-density-wave order emerging in the altermagnetic phase make it an extraordinary platform for designing high-performance spintronic devices and studying many-body effects coupled with the unconventional magnetism.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of large anomalous Hall effect and topological magnetic skyrmions in a Weyl nodal ring ferromagnet Mn5Ge3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological magnetic materials are expected to show multiple transport responses because of their unusual bulk electronic topology in momentum space and topological spin texture in real space. However, such multiple topological properties-hosting materials are rare in nature. In this work, we reveal the coexistence of a large tunable anomalous Hall effect and topological magnetic skyrmions in a Weyl nodal ring ferromagnet Mn5Ge3, by using electrical transport and Lorentz transmission electronic microscope (TEM) measurements. It was found that the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) can reach up to 979.7 S/cm with current along [120] and magnetic field along [001] of the Mn5Ge3 single crystals. Our theoretical calculations reveal that the large AHC is closely related with two Weyl nodal rings in band structure near the Fermi level and is strongly modified by the content of Ge. Moreover, our Lorentz-TEM images and micromagnetic simulation results, together with the sizable topological Hall effect clearly point to the robust formation of magnetic skyrmions over a wide temperature-magnetic field region. These results prove Mn5Ge3 as a rare magnetic topological nodal-line semimetal with great significance to explore novel multiple topological phenomena, which facilitate the development of spintronics.</description>

      <title>Multiferroic Microstructure Created from Invariant Line Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroic materials enable a multitude of emerging applications, and optimum functional properties are achieved when ferromagnetic and ferroelectric properties are coupled to a first-order ferroelastic transition. In bulk materials, this first-order transition involves an invariant habit plane, connecting coexisting phases: austenite and martensite. Theory predicts that this plane should converge to a line in thin films, but experimental evidence is missing. Here, we analyze the martensitic and magnetic microstructure of a freestanding epitaxial magnetic shape memory film. We show that the martensite microstructure is determined by an invariant line constraint using lattice parameters of both phases as the only input. This line constraint explains most of the observable features, which differ fundamentally from bulk and constrained films. Furthermore, this finite-size effect creates a remarkable checkerboard magnetic domain pattern through multiferroic coupling. Our findings highlight the decisive role of finite-size effects in multiferroics.</description>

      <title>First-principles calculations of structural and bonding properties of Li-doped tetrahedrite thermoelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tetrahedrite (copper antimony sulfosalt) is promising p-type themoeletric material due to very low intrinsic thermal conductivity and moderately-high power factor, with one of the limitations being lack of n-type variant to create thermoelectric generator. In this paper, DFT calculations have been carried out to study tetrahedrite doped with Li into structural voids, LixCu12Sb4S13 (0 &lt;= x &lt;= 3). Enthalpies of formation shows that introduction of Li into both 6b and 24g sites is energetically favorable. Dopants in those positions differently affect rattling Cu(12e) behaviour, as well as vary in magnitude of induced local disorder. Topological analysis of charge density classifies tetrahedrite as closed-shell, ionic system of interactions with some degree of covalency. Addition of Li increases bond strain and decreases structure stability. Electronic band structure shows that for x&gt;2.0, material becomes n-type, however results are not precisely conclusive on whether structure will be synthesizable, which should be determined experimentally.</description>

      <title>Synchrotron x-ray diffraction and DFT study of non-centrosymmetric EuRhGe3 under high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic intermetallic compound EuRhGe3 crystalizes in a non-centrosymmetric BaNiSn3-type (I4mm) structure. We studied its pressure-dependent crystal structure by using synchrotron powder x-ray diffraction at room temperature. Our results show a smooth contraction of the unit cell volume by applying pressure while preserving I4mm symmetry. No structural transition was observed up to 35 GPa. By the equation of state fitting analysis, the bulk modulus and its pressure derivative were determined to be 73 (1) GPa and 5.5 (2), respectively. Furthermore, similar to the isostructural EuCoGe3, an anisotropic compression of a and c lattice parameters was observed. Our experimental results show a good agreement with the pressure-dependent structural evolution expected from theoretical calculations below 13 GPa. Reflecting a strong deviation from integer Eu valence, the experimental volume data appear to be smaller than those of DFT calculated values at higher pressures.</description>

      <title>Sliding Flexoelectricity in Two-Dimensional van der Waals Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional sliding ferroelectrics, with their unique stacking degrees of freedom, offer a different approach to manipulate polarization by interlayer sliding. Bending sliding ferroelectrics inevitably leads to interlayer sliding motion, thus altering stacking orders and polarization properties. Here, by using machine-learning force field, we investigate the effects of bending deformation on geometries, stackings, energies, and polarizations in sliding ferroelectric bilayer h-BN and 3R-MoS2. We predict that bent ferroelectric bilayer forms irreversible kinks instead of arc when the bending angle exceeds a critical value. We demonstrate that the kinks originate from the competition between bending energy and interlayer van der Waals energy. The kink contains a ferroelectric domain wall that reverses the polarization, effectively inducing a flexoelectric effect. We term this phenomenon "sliding flexoelectricity" to distinguish it from conventional strain-gradient-induced flexoelectricity.</description>

      <title>Acceptor and donor impurity levels in hexagonal-diamond silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in the characterization of hexagonal-diamond silicon (2H-Si) have shown that this material possesses remarkably different structural, electronic, and optical properties as compared to the common cubic-diamond (3C) polytype. Interestingly, despite the wide range of physical properties analyzed, to date no study has investigated impurity energy levels in 2H-Si. Here, we present results of ab initio DFT simulations to describe the effect of p- and n-type substitutional doping on the structural and electronic properties of hexagonal-diamond Si (2H-Si). We first provide a detailed analysis of how a given impurity can assume a different local symmetry depending on the host crystal phase. Then, by studying neutral and charged dopants, we carefully estimate donors and acceptors transition energy levels in 2H-Si and compare them with the cubic-diamond (3C) case. In the case of acceptors, the formation energy is always lower in 2H-Si and is associated with a shallower charge transition level with respect to 3C-Si. On the other hand, donors prefer the cubic phase and have transition energies smaller with respect to 2H-Si. Finally, by employing a simple model based on the 2H/3C band offset diagram, we prove the physical validity of our findings and we show how holes can be used to stabilize the 2H-Si phase.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Thermoelectric Potential: A Machine Learning Stacking Approach for Half Heusler Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric properties of Half Heusler alloys are predicted by adopting an ensemble modelling approach, specifically the stacking model integrated using Random Forest and XGBoost scheme. Leveraging a diverse dataset encompassing thermal conductivity, the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, and the figure of merit (ZT), the study demonstrates superior predictive performance of the stacking Model, outperforming individual base models with high R2 values. Key features such as temperature, mean Covalent Radius, and average deviation of the Gibbs energy per atom emerge as critical influencers, highlighting their pivotal roles in optimizing thermoelectric behavior. The unification of Random Forest and XGBoost in the stacking model effectively captures nuanced relationships, offering a holistic understanding of thermoelectric performance in Half Heusler alloys. This work advances predictive modelling in thermoelectricity and provides valuable insights for strategic material design, paving the way for enhanced efficiency and performance in thermoelectric applications. The ensemble modelling framework, coupled with insightful feature selection and meticulous engineering, establishes a robust foundation for future research in pursuing high-performance thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Substrate stabilization of Jahn--Teller distortion in a single molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge-state transitions of a single Cu-phthalocyanine molecule adsorbed on an insulating layer of NaCl on Cu(111) are probed by means of alternate charging scanning tunneling microscopy. Real-space imaging of the electronic transitions reveals the Jahn--Teller distortion occurring upon formation of the first and second anionic charge states. The experimental findings are rationalized by a theoretical many-body model which highlights the crucial role played by the substrate. The latter enhances and stabilizes the intrinsic Jahn--Teller distortion of the negatively charged molecule hosting a degenerate pair of single-particle frontier orbitals. Consequently, two excess electrons are found to occupy, in the ground state, the same localized orbital, despite a larger Coulomb repulsion than the one for the competing delocalized electronic configuration. Control over the charging sequence by varying the applied bias voltage is also predicted.</description>

      <title>Brittleness of metallic glasses dictated by their state at the fragile-to-strong transition temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of cooling on the brittleness of glasses in general, and bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) in particular, is usually studied with continuously varying cooling rates; slower cooling rates lead to stiffer, harder, and more brittle glasses than higher cooling rates. These protocols obscure any potential discontinuity that a glass might experience depending on whether its microstructure resembles that of a fragile or a strong glass-forming liquid. Here, we use large-scale molecular dynamics to simulate the nanoindentation behavior of model BMGs (Zr$_{0.6}$Cu$_{0.3}$Al$_{0.1}$) obtained by rapidly quenching equilibrium melts from temperatures above and below the fragile-to-strong transition temperature $T_\textrm{fst}$, leading to fragile and strong glasses, respectively. While the contact modulus deduced from the indentation simulation evolves smoothly with the temperature $T_\text{q}$ from which the melt is quenched, the plastic response changes quasi-discontinuously as $T_\text{q}$ passes through $T_\textrm{fst}$. In particular, strong glasses develop highly asymmetric flow profiles with mature shear bands, in contrast to fragile glasses. Quantitative differences reveal themselves not only through a formal von Mises localization parameter analysis but also through image analysis of flow patterns using pre-trained artificial intelligence models. Moreover, seemingly erratic flow profiles for our indentation geometry produced surprisingly reproducible and, thus, deterministic features. It remains to be determined to what extent other classes of glass formers follow our observation that the degree of brittleness is significantly influenced by whether the melt is fragile or strong when it falls out of equilibrium at the glass transition temperature.</description>

      <title>Controlled improvement in the radar absorption by bilayer magnetic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A strong increase of the reflection loss (from 25 up to 35 dBs) and an extension of the absorption bandwidth up to 20% under far-field real radar conditions are experimentally reported in this work by creating a functional bilayer system. Each layer consists of a composite material, typically a dielectric matrix filled with magnetic entities (powder or wires). Combining the two types of materials into a bilayer structure has shown unprecedented improvements in microwave absorption capacities compared to the former absorption of each layer. The potential of random magnets to create thin broadband absorbers is also demonstrated. The capacity to improve the shielding behavior is strongly related to each layer's permittivity, permeability, and thickness. This provides strong control over the design of novel materials for stealth applications.</description>

      <title>Droplet-confined electroplating for nanoscale additive manufacturing: current control of the initial stages of the growth of copper nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Droplet-confined electrodeposition enables a precise deposition of three dimensional, nanoscopic and high purity metal structures. It aspires to fabricate intricate microelectronic devices, metamaterials, plasmonic structures and functionalized surfaces. Yet, a major handicap of droplet-confined electrodeposition is the current lack of control over the process, which is owed to its dynamic nature and the nanoscopic size of the involved droplets. The deposition current offers itself as an obvious and real-time window into the deposition. Therefore, the current during droplet-confined deposition is analysed. Nucleation and growth dynamics are evaluated systematically. Our results indicate different deposition regimes and link current to both volume and morphology of deposited copper. This allows for optimized electroplating strategies and to calibrate the slicing algorithms necessary for a controlled deposition of 3D structures. The potential of selecting appropriate solvents further readies this novel technique for the reliable deposition of functional structures with submicron resolution.</description>

      <title>Thermal Conductivity Predictions with Foundation Atomistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have led to foundation models for atomistic materials chemistry, potentially enabling quantum-accurate descriptions of interatomic forces at reduced computational cost. These models are benchmarked by predicting materials' properties over large databases; however, these computationally intensive tests have been limited to basic quantities related to harmonic phonons, leaving uncertainty about the reliability for complex, technologically and experimentally relevant anharmonic heat-conduction properties. Here we present an automated framework that relies on foundation models to compute microscopic vibrational properties, and employs them within the Wigner formulation of heat transport to predict the macroscopic thermal conductivity in solids with arbitrary composition and structure. We apply this framework with the foundation models M3GNet, CHGNet, MACE-MP-0, and SevenNET to 103 diverse compounds, comparing predictions against first-principles references and introducing a benchmark metric based on conductivity. This framework paves the way for physics-aware, accurate predictions of vibrational and thermal properties, and for uncovering materials that violate semiclassical Boltzmann transport and feature exceptional heat-shielding or thermoelectric performance.</description>

      <title>Phonon-Assisted Auger Decay of Excitons in Doped Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The competition between the radiative and nonradiative lifetimes determines the optical quantum yield and plays a crucial role in the potential optoelectronic applications of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC). Here, we show that, in the presence of free carriers, an additional nonradiative decay channel opens for excitons in TMDC monolayers. Although the usual Auger decay channel is suppressed at low doping levels by the simultaneous momentum and energy conservation laws, exciton-phonon coupling relaxes this suppression. By solving a Bethe-Salpeter Equation, we calculate the phonon-assisted Auger decay rates in four typical TMDCs as a function of doping, temperature, and dielectric environment. We find that even for a relatively low doping of 10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, the nonradiative lifetime ranges from 16 ps to 165 ps in different TMDCs, offering competition to the radiative decay channel.</description>

      <title>Signature of point nodal superconductivity in the Dirac semimetal PdTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent Angle-Resolved Photo-emission Spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 046402 (2023)] on PdTe, a 3D-Dirac semimetal and a superconductor with the transition temperature Tc ~ 4.3 K, have revealed compelling evidence of the presence of bulk nodes in the superconducting order parameter. To investigate the validity of this proposition, here we present a detailed investigation of the magnetic field dependence of the specific heat of PdTe down to temperatures ~ 58 mK. We observed that the low temperature specific heat of PdTe with an externally applied magnetic field exhibits a power-law field dependence, a characteristic of unconventional superconductivity. Furthermore, the zero-field low-temperature electronic specific heat follows a cubic temperature dependence, which is a signature of the presence of bulk point nodes in PdTe. These intriguing observations suggest that PdTe is a rare and fascinating topological material that exhibits both Dirac semimetallic properties and superconductivity with point nodal gap symmetry.</description>

      <title>Invariant Discovery of Features Across Multiple Length Scales: Applications in Microscopy and Autonomous Materials Characterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical imaging is a foundational characterization method in areas from condensed matter physics and chemistry to astronomy and spans length scales from atomic to universe. Images encapsulate crucial data regarding atomic bonding, materials microstructures, and dynamic phenomena such as microstructural evolution and turbulence, among other phenomena. The challenge lies in effectively extracting and interpreting this information. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have emerged as powerful tools for identifying underlying factors of variation in image data, providing a systematic approach to distilling meaningful patterns from complex datasets. However, a significant hurdle in their application is the definition and selection of appropriate descriptors reflecting local structure. Here we introduce the scale-invariant VAE approach (SI-VAE) based on the progressive training of the VAE with the descriptors sampled at different length scales. The SI-VAE allows the discovery of the length scale dependent factors of variation in the system. Here, we illustrate this approach using the ferroelectric domain images and generalize it to the movies of the electron-beam induced phenomena in graphene and topography evolution across combinatorial libraries. This approach can further be used to initialize the decision making in automated experiments including structure-property discovery and can be applied across a broad range of imaging methods. This approach is universal and can be applied to any spatially resolved data including both experimental imaging studies and simulations, and can be particularly useful for exploration of phenomena such as turbulence, scale-invariant transformation fronts, etc.</description>

      <title>Second-order nonlocal shifts of scattered wave-packets: What can be measured by Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov effects ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scattering of wavepackets with arbitrary energy dispersion on surfaces has been analyzed. Expanding up to second order in scattering shifts, it is found that besides the known Goos-H\"anchen or Imbert-Fedorov spatial offset, as well as the Wigner delay time, new momentum and frequency shifts appear. Furthermore, the width of the scattered wave packet becomes modified as well, which can lead to a shrinking of pulses by multiple scattering. For a model of dielectric material characterized by a longitudinal and transverse dielectric function the shifts are calculated analytically. From the Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov shifts one can access the longitudinal and transversal dielectric function. Perfectly aligned crystal symmetry axes with respect to scattering beam shows no Imbert-Fedorov effect. It is found that the Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov effect are absent for homogeneous materials. Oppositely it is found that the Wigner delay time and the shrinking of the temporal pulse width allows to access the dielectric function independent on the beam geometry.</description>

      <title>Fast and scalable finite-element based approach for density functional theory calculations using projector-augmented wave method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a computationally efficient methodology that utilizes a local real-space formulation of the projector augmented wave (PAW) method discretized with finite-element (FE) basis to enable accurate and large-scale electronic structure calculations. This is achieved through the synergy of the PAW method's ability to transform the underlying all-electron DFT problem into a form that involves smoother electronic fields and the potential of systematically convergent higher-order finite-element basis to achieve significant computational gains. In particular, we employ higher-order quadrature rules to evaluate integrals involving PAW-atomic data accurately, allowing the use of coarser FE meshes for electronic fields. Further, we have developed efficient computational strategies for solving the underlying FE discretized PAW generalized eigenproblem by employing the Chebyshev filtered subspace iteration approach to compute the desired eigen spectrum in each self-consistent field iteration. These strategies leverage the low-rank perturbation of FE basis-overlap to invert FE discretized PAW overlap matrix in conjunction with exploiting the FE-cell level structure of both the local and nonlocal parts of the discretized PAW Hamiltonian and overlap matrices. Using the proposed approach we benchmark the accuracy and performance on various representative examples involving periodic and non-periodic systems with state-of-the-art plane wave based PAW implementations. Furthermore, we also demonstrate a significant computational advantage over state-of-the-art plane-wave basis for large-scale systems comprising of around 35,000 electrons. Our approach (PAW-FE) significantly reduces the degrees of freedom required to achieve desired accuracy when compared to norm-conserving pseudopotentials, thereby enabling large-scale DFT simulations at an order of magnitude lower computational cost.</description>

      <title>Quantum Order by Disorder: A Key to Understanding the Magnetic Phases of BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ (BCAO), a honeycomb cobaltate, is considered a promising candidate for materials displaying the Kitaev quantum spin liquid state. This assumption is based on the distinctive characteristics of Co$^{2+}$ ions (3$d^7$) within an octahedral crystal environment, resulting in spin-orbit-coupled $J_{\rm eff}$~=~1/2 doublet states. However, recent experimental observations and theoretical analyses have raised questions regarding this hypothesis. Despite these uncertainties, reports of continuum excitations reminiscent of spinon excitations have prompted further investigations. In this study, we explore the magnetic phases of BCAO under both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields, employing dc and ac magnetic susceptibilities, capacitance, and torque magnetometry measurement. Our results affirm the existence of multiple field-induced magnetic phases, with strong anisotropy of the phase boundaries between in-plane and out-of-plane fields. To elucidate the nature of these phases, we develop a minimal anisotropic exchange model. This model, supported by combined first principles calculations and theoretical modeling, quantitatively reproduces our experimental data. In BCAO, the combination of strong bond-independent XXZ anisotropy and geometric frustration leads to significant quantum order by disorder effects that stabilize collinear phases under both zero and finite magnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: Machine-learning-based interatomic potentials enable accurate materials simulations on extended time- and lengthscales. ML potentials based on the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) framework have recently shown promising performance for this purpose. Here, we describe a largely automated computational approach to optimizing hyperparameters for ACE potential models. We extend our openly available Python package, XPOT, to include an interface for ACE fitting, and discuss the optimization of the functional form and complexity of these models based on systematic sweeps across relevant hyperparameters. We showcase the usefulness of the approach for two example systems: the covalent network of silicon and the phase-change material Sb$_{2}$Te$_{3}$. More generally, our work emphasizes the importance of hyperparameter selection in the development of advanced ML potential models.</description>

      <title>Surface transfer doping of hydrogen-terminated diamond probed by shallow nitrogen-vacancy centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The surface conductivity of hydrogen-terminated diamond is a topic of great interest from both scientific and technological perspectives. This is primarily due to the fact that the conductivity is exceptionally high without the need for substitutional doping, thus enabling a wide range of electronic applications. Although the conductivity is commonly explained by surface transfer doping due to air-borne surface acceptors, there remains uncertainty regarding the main determining factors that govern the degree of band bending and hole density, which are crucial for the design of electronic devices. Here, we elucidate the dominant factor influencing band bending by creating shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers beneath the hydrogen-terminated diamond surface through nitrogen ion implantation at varying fluences. We measured the photoluminescence and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of the NV centers, as well as the surface conductivity, as a function of the nitrogen implantation fluence. The disappearance of the conductivity with increasing nitrogen implantation fluence coincides with the appearance of photoluminescence and ODMR signals from negatively charged NV centers. This finding indicates that band bending is not exclusively determined by the work-function difference between diamond and the surface acceptor material, but by the finite density of surface acceptors. This work emphasizes the importance of distinguishing work-function-difference-limited band bending and surface-acceptor-density-limited band bending when modeling the surface transfer doping, and provides useful insights for the development of devices based on hydrogen-terminated diamond.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative Simulation of Anharmonic Rattler Dynamics in Type-I Clathrates with Vibrational Dynamical Mean-Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use vibrational dynamical mean-field theory (VDMFT) to study the vibrational structure of type-I clathrate solids, specifically X$_8$Ga$_{16}$Ge$_{30}$, where X=Ba,Sr. These materials are cage-like chemical structures hosting loosely bound guest atoms, resulting in strong anharmonicity, short phonon lifetimes, and ultra-low thermal conductivities. Presenting the methodological developments necessary for this first application to three-dimensional, atomistic materials, we validate our approach through comparison to molecular dynamics simulations and show that VDMFT is extremely accurate at a fraction of the cost. Through the use of nonperturbative methods, we find that anharmonicity is dominated by four-phonon and higher-order scattering processes, and it causes rattler modes to shift up in frequency by 50% (10 cm$^{-1}$) and to have lifetimes of less than 1 ps; this behavior is not captured by traditional perturbation theory. Furthermore, we analyze the phonon self-energy and find that anharmonicity mixes guest rattling modes and cage acoustic modes, significantly changing the character of the harmonic phonons.</description>

      <title>Minority magnons and mode branching in monolayer Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We predict the presence of minority magnons in monolayer Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ using first principles calculations. Minority magnons constitute a new type of collective magnetic excitation which increase the magnetic moment -- contrary to ordinary (majority) magnons which lower it -- giving rise to spin-raising poles in the dynamic susceptibility $\chi^{-+}(\omega)$. The presence of such quasi-particles is made possible by the nontrivial ferromagnetic band structure of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. We calculate the susceptibility using time-dependent density functional theory and perform a detailed mode analysis, which allows us to identify and investigate individual magnon modes as well as the Stoner excitations that constitute the many-body spectrum. The analysis reveals a plethora of both majority and minority excitations, which in addition to the main magnon branches include both satellite, valley and spin-inversion magnons thanks to the electron itinerancy of the system. Crucially, the analysis allows us to separate peaks of a coherent collective nature from those of mixed magnon/Stoner nature. To this end, we predict that the lowest energy minority magnon mode of monolayer Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ indeed constitutes a coherent collective quasi-particle at long wavelengths and introduce a simplistic gaussian model for the observed minority magnon enhancement. The underlying physics is in no way restricted to Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$, and minority magnons are thus expected to be observable in other complex ferromagnetic materials as well.</description>

Abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulators hosting edge spin currents hold great potential for low-power spintronic devices. In this paper, we present a universal approach to achieve a high and near-quantized spin Hall conductance plateau within a sizable bulk gap. Using a nonmagnetic four-band model Hamiltonian, we demonstrate that an even-spin Chern (ESC) insulator can be accessed by tuning the sign of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) within a crystal symmetry-enforced orbital doublet. With the assistance of a high spin Chern number of $C_{S}=-2$ and spin $U$(1) quasisymmetry, this orbital-doublet-driven ESC phase is endowed with the near-double-quantized spin Hall conductance. We identify 12 crystallographic point groups supporting such a sign-tunable SOC. Furthermore, we apply our theory to realistic examples, and show the phase transition from a trivial insulator governed by positive SOC in the RuI$_{3}$ monolayer to an ESC insulator dominated by negative SOC in the RuBr$_{3}$ monolayer. This orbital-doublet-driven ESC insulator, RuBr$_{3}$, showcases nontrivial characteristics including helical edge states, near-double-quantized spin Hall conductance, and robust corner states. Our work provides different pathways in the pursuit of the long-sought quantum spin Hall insulators.</description>

      <title>Strategy for Direct Detection of Chiral Phonons with Phase-Structured Free Electrons</title>

Abstract: Chiral phonons possessing valley pseudo angular momentum (PAM) underlie a diversity of quantum phenomena of fundamental and applied importance, but are challenging to probe directly. We show that deficiencies of typical momentum-resolved electron energy loss measurements that make it impossible to distinguish the PAM of chiral phonons can be overcome by introducing pinwheel free electron states with well-defined PAM. Transitions between such states generate 2D periodic arrays of in-plane field vortices with polarization textures tailored to selectively couple to desired chiral mode symmetries.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of ferroelectric and ferrielectric phases in ultrathin antiferroelectric PbZrO3 thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whereas ferroelectricity may vanish in ultra-thin ferroelectric films, it is expected to emerge in ultra-thin anti-ferroelectric films, sparking people's interest in using antiferroelectric materials as an alternative to ferroelectric ones for high-density data storage applications. Lead Zirconate (PbZrO3) is considered the prototype material for antiferroelectricity, and indeed previous studies indicated that nanoscale PbZrO3 films exhibit ferroelectricity. The understanding of such phenomena from the microstructure aspect is crucial but still lacking. In this study, we fabricated a PbZrO3 film with thicknesses varying from 5 nm to 80 nm. Using Piezoresponse Force Microscopy, we discovered the film displayed a transition from antiferroelectric behaviour in the thicker areas to ferroelectric behaviour in the thinner ones, with a critical thickness between 10 and 15 nm. In this critical thickness range, a 12 nm PZO thin film was chosen for further study using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy. The investigation showed that the film comprises both ferroelectric and ferrielectric phases. The ferroelectric phase is characterized by polarisation along the pseudocubic [011] projection direction. The positions of Pb, Zr, and O were determined using the integrated differential phase contrast method. This allowed us to ascertain that the ferroelectric PbZrO3 unit cell is half the size of that in the antiferroelectric phase on the ab plane. The observed unit cell is different from the electric field-induced ferroelectric rhombohedral phases. Additionally, we identified a ferrielectric phase with a unique up-up-zero-zero dipole configuration. The finding is crucial for understanding the performance of ultrathin antiferroelectric thin films and the subsequent design and development of antiferroelectric devices.</description>

      <title>A general and modular approach to solid-state integration and readout of zero-dimensional quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic spectroscopy of zero-dimensional (0D) quantum systems, including point defects in solids, atomic states, and small molecules, is a critical tool for developing a fundamental understanding of these systems, with applications ranging from solid-state and molecular materials development to emerging technologies rooted in quantum information science. Toward this end, scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) has demonstrated atomic-scale sensitivity, but is not easily scalable for applications, whereas device-based approaches rely on embedding these systems within a solid-state tunnel junction (TJ) and are not generally applicable. Here we demonstrate an all-electrical readout mechanism for these quasi-0D states that is modular and general, dramatically expanding the phase space of accessible quantum systems and providing an approach that is amenable to scaling and integration with other solid-state quantum technologies. Our approach relies on the creation of high-quality tunnel junctions via the mechanical exfoliation and stacking of multi-layer graphene (MLG) and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) to encapsulate the target quantum system (QS) in an MLG/hBN/QS/hBN/MLG heterostructure. This structure allows for electronic spectroscopy and readout of candidate quantum systems through a combination of Coulomb and spin-blockade, providing access to entire classes of quantum systems that have previously only been accessible via optical spectroscopy or magnetic resonance measurements of large ensembles, if at all.</description>

      <title>Structure to Property: Chemical Element Embeddings and a Deep Learning Approach for Accurate Prediction of Chemical Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the elEmBERT model for chemical classification tasks. It is based on deep learning techniques, such as a multilayer encoder architecture. We demonstrate the opportunities offered by our approach on sets of organic, inorganic and crystalline compounds. In particular, we developed and tested the model using the Matbench and Moleculenet benchmarks, which include crystal properties and drug design-related benchmarks. We also conduct an analysis of vector representations of chemical compounds, shedding light on the underlying patterns in structural data. Our model exhibits exceptional predictive capabilities and proves universally applicable to molecular and material datasets. For instance, on the Tox21 dataset, we achieved an average precision of 96%, surpassing the previously best result by 10%.</description>

      <title>\textit{Ab initio} Wannier-representation-based calculations of photocurrent in semiconductors and metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general ab initio method based on Wannier functions using the covariant derivative for simulating the photocurrent in solids. The method is widely applicable to charge/spin DC and AC photocurrent at any perturbation levels in both semiconductors and metals for both linearly and circularly polarized light. This is because the method is theoretically complete (within the relaxation time approximation), that is to say, it includes all intraband, interband and their cross terms. It is also free from the degeneracy issue, i.e., applicable to arbitrary band structures with arbitrary numbers of degenerate bands. We apply the method to various semiconductors and metals, including GaAs, graphene-hBN heterostructure, monolayer WS2, a 2D ferroelectric material - monolayer GeS, bilayer anti-ferromagnetic MnBi2Te4 and topological Weyl semimetal RhSi, to simulate their charge and/or spin, DC and/or AC photocurrent. Our theoretical results are in agreement with previous theoretical works. Our numerical tests of GaAs, WS2 and GeS suggest setting the degeneracy threshold in the conventional method as \hbar\Gamma^{2}, with \Gamma^{2} the relaxation rate of the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix between two states with close energies. We find that compared with the conventional Wannier-function-based method using non-dgenerate perturbation theory, the numerical errors of optical susceptibilities of bilayer anti-ferromagnetic MnBi2Te4 with the PT symmetry can be reduced by 1-2 orders of magnitude by our method for circularly polarized light. Our method provides a universal computational tool for reliable and accurate predictions of abundant weak-field photocurrent phenomena in disparate materials.</description>

      <title>Scanning Tunneling Microscopy for Molecules: Manipulating Electron Transport through the Conduction Gap by varying Buffer Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In scanning tunneling microscopy of molecules, an insulating buffer layer is often introduced to reduce interactions between adsorbed molecules and the substrate. Focusing on tunneling through the molecule's electronic transport gap, we demonstrate that the buffer itself strongly influences the wave function of the tunneling electron at the molecule. This is exemplified for an adsorbed platinum phthalocyanine molecule by varying the composition and thickness of the buffer. We find that, in particular, the buffer's lattice parameter is crucial. By expanding the wave function of the tunneling electron in molecular orbitals (MOs), we illustrate how one can strongly vary the relative weights of different MOs, such as the highest occupied MO versus some low-lying MOs with few nodal surfaces. The set of MOs with significant weight are important for processes used to manipulate the state of the molecule by a tunneling electron, such as molecular luminescence. The choice of buffer therefore provides an important tool for manipulating these processes.</description>
