      <title>Searching for Synchrotron Emission from the Geminga TeV Halo using the Planck Satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsars convert a significant fraction of their total spin-down power into very high-energy electrons, leading to the formation of TeV halos. It is not yet known, however, whether these sources also efficiently accelerate electrons at lower energies and, if so, how those particles propagate through the surrounding environment. If pulsars produce $\sim 50-300 \, {\rm GeV}$ electrons, these particles would produce a spatially extended halo of synchrotron emission in the frequency range measured by Planck. Such emission could be used to constrain the low-energy diffusion coefficient in the regions surrounding these pulsars, as well as the spectrum and intensity of the electrons that are accelerated in this energy range. In this study, we attempt to use Planck data to constrain the nature of the Geminga pulsar's TeV halo. We find no conclusive evidence of this emission in Planck's frequency range, however, and calculate that the synchrotron flux from Geminga should be well below the total flux measured by Planck, even for models with favorable diffusion parameters or soft injection spectra. At this time, these measurements are not capable of significantly constraining the values of these parameters.</description>

      <title>Black Hole-Neutron Star Binaries near Neutron Star Disruption Limit in the Mass Regime of Event GW230529</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In May 2023, the LIGO Livingston observatory detected the likely black hole-neutron star (BHNS) merger GW230529_181500. That event is expected to be the merger of a 2.5-4.5 $M_{\odot}$ primary with a secondary compact object of mass between 1.2-2.0 $M_{\odot}$. This makes it the first BHNS merger with a significant potential for the production of electromagnetic (EM) counterparts, and provides further evidence for compact objects existing within the suspected lower mass gap. To produce post-merger EM transients, the component of the black hole spin aligned with the orbital angular momentum must be sufficiently high, allowing the neutron star to be tidally disrupted. The disrupting BHNS binary may then eject a few percent of a solar mass of matter, leading to an observable kilonova driven by radioactive decays in ejecta, and/or a compact-binary GRB (cbGRB) resulting from the formation of an accretion disk and relativistic jet. Determining which mergers lead to disruption of the neutron star is necessary to predict the prevalence of EM signals from BHNS mergers, yet most BHNS simulations so far have been performed far from the minimum spin required for tidal disruption. Here, we use the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC) to explore the behavior of BHNS mergers in a mass range consistent with GW230529_181500 close to that critical spin, and compare our results against the mass remnant model currently used by the LVK collaboration to predict the probability of tidal disruption. Our numerical results reveal the emergence of non-zero accretion disks even below the predicted NS disruption limit, of low mass but capable of powering cbGRBs. Our results also demonstrate that the remnant mass model underpredicts the disk mass for the DD2 EOS, while they are within expected modeling errors for SFHo. In all of our simulations, any kilonova signal would be dim and dominated by post-merger disk outflows.</description>

      <title>Light curves of the explosion of ONe WD+CO WD merger remnant and type Icn supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Icn supernovae (SNe Icn) are a newly detected rare subtype of interacting stripped-envelope supernovae which show narrow P-Cygni lines of highly ionized carbon, oxygen, and neon in their early spectra due to the interactions of the SNe ejecta with dense hydrogen- and helium-deficient circumstellar material (CSM). It has been suggested that SNe Icn may have multiple progenitor channels, such as the explosion of carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet stars, or the explosion of stripped-envelope SNe which undergo binary interactions. Among the SNe Icn, SN 2019jc shows unique properties, and previous work inferred that it may stem from the ultra-stripped supernova, but other possibilities still exist. In this work, we aim to simulate the light curves from the explosions of oxygen-neon and carbon-oxygen double white dwarf (WD) merger remnants, and to further investigate whether the corresponding explosions can appear as some particular SNe Icn. We generate the light curves from the explosive remnants and analyse the influence of different parameters on the light curves, such as the ejecta mass, explosion energy, mass of Ni56 and CSM properties. Comparing our results with some SNe Icn, we found that the light curves from the explosions of double WD merger remnants can explain the observable properties of SN 2019jc, which inferred that this special SN Icn may have a different progenitor. Our results indicated that double WD merger may be an alternative model in producing at least one of the SNe Icn.</description>

      <title>General Relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of accretion flows through traversable wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first dynamical model of plasma accretion onto traversable wormholes by performing General Relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical (GRMHD) simulations of the flow on both sides of the wormhole. We evolve the ideal MHD equations on a wormhole spacetime described by the spherically symmetric Simpson--Visser metric. The disk is initialized on one side of the wormhole and accretes onto the throat driven by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI). We show that the inflowing plasma quickly settles in the throat and forms a hot, rotating cloud. The wormhole cloud acts as an engine in which gas coming from one side accumulates at the center, dissipates energy, and powers a mildly relativistic thermal wind toward the other side. Our novel predictions show that accreting wormholes behave very differently from black holes (BHs) in astrophysical environments. In particular, one mouth presents outflows without accretion signatures, contradicting the jet-disk symbiotic relation that holds for black holes.</description>

      <title>Systematic Search and Study of Short-Timescale Flare Structures in BL Lac object Gamma-ray Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present here the first systematic search of short timescale $\gamma$-ray flares from 29 high Galactic latitude BL Lac objects over 14 years of Fermi Large Area Telescope data. Using a combined Bayesian Blocks and HOP algorithm, we identified seven high-quality orbital timescale flare segments from three sources and quantified 24 short-timescale flare structures. We then performed a comprehensive analysis of flare symmetry, power spectral density (PSD) of variability, and flux-photon index relation. The main results are as follows: (1) The flare symmetry parameter $A$ shows a "U-shaped" distribution. Short timescale flares are symmetric while long timescale flares are asymmetric. The number of fast-rise slow-decay and slow-rise fast-decay type flares are equal. No correlation is found between $A$ and peak/integral flux. No parameter evolution is seen between consecutive flares either. The observations support a scenario where longer timescale flares originate from superposition of short, symmetric sub-hour flares. (2) PSD from yearly to hourly timescales is modeled using the CARMA process. At lower frequencies, the PSD follows the typical broken power-law form. The high-frequency region of the PSD exhibits a continuous power-law shape, indicating that $\gamma$-ray variability originates from a single physical process across all probed timescales. (3) The flux-photon index distribution shows a pattern of "harder-when-brighter" or "softer-when-brighter," but becomes flat above a certain critical flux, with $\Gamma$ $\approx$ 2. This behavior cannot be simply explained by a two-component or blazar sequence model, and we speculate it may be related to complex interplay between electron acceleration and cooling.</description>

      <title>On the energy budget of starquake-induced repeating fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a growing sample of fast radio bursts (FRBs), we investigate the energy budget of different power sources within the framework of magnetar starquake triggering mechanism. During a starquake, the energy can be released in any form through magnetic, strain, rotational, and gravitational energies. Following findings are revealed: 1. The crust can store a free magnetic energy of the amount of at least $6.3\times10^{46}$ erg via toroidal fields, with frequent starquakes happening due to the instability of the crust. 2. The strain energy develops as a rigid object spins down, which can be released during a global starquake accompanied by a glitch. However, it takes a long time to accumulate enough strain energy via spin-down. 3. The rotational energy of a magnetar with $P\lesssim0.1\rm\,s$ can match the energy and luminosity budget of FRBs. 4. The budget of the total gravitational energy is high, but the mechanism and efficiency of converting this energy to radiation deserve further exploration.</description>

      <title>Radiation hydrodynamical simulations of super-Eddington mass transfer and black hole growth in close binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation-driven outflows play a crucial role in extracting mass and angular momentum from binary systems undergoing rapid mass transfer at super-Eddington rates. To study the mass transfer process from a massive donor star to a stellar-mass black hole (BH), we perform multi-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamical simulations that follow accretion flows from the first Lagrange point down to about a hundred times the Schwarzschild radius of the accreting BH. Our simulations reveal that rapid mass transfer occurring at over a thousand times the Eddington rate leads to significant mass loss from the accretion disk via radiation-driven outflows. Consequently, the inflow rates at the innermost radius are regulated by two orders of magnitude smaller than the transfer rates. We find that convective motions within the accretion disk drive outward energy and momentum transport, enhancing the radiation pressure in the outskirts of the disk and ultimately generating large-scale outflows with sufficient energy to leave the binary. Furthermore, we observe strong anisotropy in the outflows, which occur preferentially toward both the closest and furthest points from the donor star. However, when averaged over all directions, the specific angular momentum of the outflows is nearly comparable to the value predicted in the isotropic emission case. Based on our simulation results, we propose a formula that quantifies the mass growth rates on BHs and the mass loss rates from binaries due to radiation-driven outflows. This formula provides important implications for the binary evolution and the formation of merging binary BHs.</description>

      <title>A Generic Model for Persistent Radio Source around Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The repeated fast radio burst FRB 121102A and FRB 190520B has been reported, along with a spatially coincident, compact, persistent radio emission. In this paper, we present a parameterized one-zone model, with a basic scenario that a relativistic magnetized wind from the pulsar sweeps up the surroundings, e.g. freely expanding supernova ejecta, giving rise to a power-law distribution of electron filled between the forward shock and the termination shock. We show that via appropriate adjustment of the model parameters, we can obtain the synchrotron radio emission properties from the one-zone model bright enough to account for observation, simply and analytically fitting the observed spectra well. Through dynamical evolution of the model, we can also obtain time-varying of relevant properties. This parameterized model does not depend on concrete physical models such as central engine, instead we can constraint physical model via comparison between parameters and observation, indicating the information about the central engine and surroundings. We also discuss the synchrotron self-Compton emission in our scenario in the end, but find no clue on the counterparts at other waveband.</description>

      <title>The Energy Sources, the Physical Properties, and the Mass-loss History of SN 2017dio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the energy sources, the physical properties of the ejecta and the circumstellar medium (CSM), as well as the mass-loss history of the progenitor of SN 2017dio which is a broad-lined Ic (Ic-BL) supernova (SN) having unusual light curves (LCs) and signatures of hydrogen-rich CSM in its early spectrum. We find that the temperature of SN 2017dio began to increase linearly about 20 days after the explosion. We use the $^{56}$Ni plus the ejecta-CSM interaction (CSI) model to fit the LCs of SN 2017dio, finding that the masses of the ejecta, the $^{56}$Ni, and the CSM are $\sim$ 12.41 M$_\odot$, $\sim$ 0.17 M$_\odot$, and $\sim$ 5.82 M$_\odot$, respectively. The early-time photosphere velocity and the kinetic energy of the SN are respectively {$\sim$ 1.89 $\times 10^4$ km s$^{-1}$} and $\sim$ 2.66 $\times 10^{52}$ erg, which are respectively comparable to those of SNe Ic-BL and hypernovae (HNe). We suggest that the CSM of SN 2017dio might be {from an luminous-blue-variable-like outburst or} pulsational pair instability $\sim$ 1.2$-$11.4 yr prior to the SN explosion{, or binary mass transfer}. {Moreover,} we find that its ejecta mass is larger than those of many SNe Ic-BL, and that its $^{56}$Ni mass ($M_{\rm Ni}$) is approximately equal to the mean (or median) value of $M_{\rm Ni}$ of SNe Ic-BL in the literature, but lower than $M_{\rm Ni}$ of prototype HNe (e.g., SN 1998bw and SN 2003dh).</description>

      <title>A systematic study of the ultra-fast outflow responses to luminosity variations in active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extreme velocities and high ionization states of ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) make them a promising candidate for AGN feedback on the evolution of the host galaxy. However, their exact underlying driving mechanism is not yet fully understood. Given that the variability of UFOs may be used to distinguish among different launching mechanisms, we aim to search for and characterize the responses of the UFO properties to the variable irradiating luminosity. We performed a high-resolution spectroscopy of archival XMM-Newton observations on six highly-accreting NLS1 galaxies. The state-of-the-art methods of the blind Gaussian line scan and photoionization model scan are used to identify UFO solutions. We search for ionized winds and investigate the structure of ionized winds and their responses to the luminosity variations. The powerful photoionization model scan reveals three previously unreported UFOs in RE J1034+396, PG 1244+026 and I ZW 1, and two new WAs in RE J1034+396. The entrained UFOs are discovered in 4 (66%) AGN, supporting the shocked outflow interpretation for AGN ionized winds. 2 out of 7 (28%) UFOs seem to respond to the continuum and 3 (43%) UFOs hint at a radiatively accelerated nature. Combined with published works, we do not find any correlations between UFO responses and AGN properties except for a tentative ($\sim1.8\sigma$) anti-correlation between the UFO acceleration and the Eddington ratio, to be confirmed by further observations and an enlarged sample. The kinetic energy of UFOs, mostly detected in soft X-rays, is found to have a large uncertainty. We, therefore, cannot conclude whether soft X-ray UFOs have sufficient energy to drive the AGN feedback, although they are very promising based on some reasonable assumptions.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a shock-compressed magnetic field in the north-western rim of the young supernova remnant RX J1713.7-3946 with X-ray polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova remnants (SNRs) provide insights into cosmic-ray acceleration and magnetic field dynamics at shock fronts. Recent X-ray polarimetric measurements by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) have revealed radial magnetic fields near particle acceleration sites in young SNRs, including Cassiopeia A, Tycho, and SN 1006. We present here the spatially-resolved IXPE X-ray polarimetric observation of the northwestern rim of SNR RX J1713.7-3946. For the first time, our analysis shows that the magnetic field in particle acceleration sites of this SNR is oriented tangentially with respect to the shock front. Because of the lack of precise Faraday-rotation measurements in the radio band, this was not possible before. The average measured polarization degree (PD) of the synchtrotron emission is 12.5 {\pm} 3.3%, lower than the one measured by IXPE in SN 1006, comparable to the Tycho one, but notably higher than the one in Cassiopeia A. On sub-parsec scales, localized patches within RX J1713.7-3946 display PD up to 41.5 {\pm} 9.5%. These results are compatible with a shock-compressed magnetic field. However, in order to explain the observed PD, either the presence of a radial net magnetic field upstream of the shock, or partial reisotropization of the turbulence downstream by radial magneto-hydrodynamical instabilities, can be invoked. From comparison of PD and magnetic field distribution with {\gamma}-rays and 12 CO data, our results provide new inputs in favor of a leptonic origin of the {\gamma}-ray emission.</description>

      <title>Tidal disruption event AT2020ocn: early-time X-ray flares caused by a possible disc alignment process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tidal disruption event (TDE) may occur when a star is torn apart by the tidal force of a black hole (BH). Eventually, an accretion disc is thought to form out of stellar debris falling back towards the BH. If the star's orbital angular momentum vector prior to disruption is not aligned with the BH spin angular momentum vector, the disc will be tilted with respect to the BH equatorial plane. The disc will eventually be drawn into the BH equatorial plane due to a combination of the Bardeen-Petterson effect and internal torques. Here, we analyse the X-ray and UV observations of the TDE AT2020ocn obtained by Swift, XMM-Newton, and NICER. The X-ray light curve shows strong flares during the first $\approx100$ days, while, over the same period, the UV emission decays gradually. We find that the X-ray flares can be explained by a model that also explains the spectral evolution. This model includes a slim disc viewed under a variable inclination plus an inverse-Comptonisation component processing the slim disc emission. A scenario where the ongoing Lense-Thirring precession during the disc alignment process is responsible for the observed inclination variations is consistent with the data. In later observations, we find that the X-ray spectrum of AT2020ocn becomes harder, while the mass accretion rate remains at super-Eddington levels, suggesting the formation of a corona in line with accretion onto other compact objects. We constrain the BH mass to be $(7^{+13}_{-3})\times10^{5}$ M$_\odot$ at the 1$\sigma$ (68%) confidence level.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Very-high-energy Gamma-ray Emissions from the Low Luminosity AGN NGC 4278 by LHAASO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first source catalog of Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory reported the detection of a very-high-energy gamma ray source, 1LHAASO J1219+2915. In this paper a further detailed study of the spectral and temporal behavior of this point-like source have been carried. The best-fit position of the TeV source ($\rm{RA}=185.05^{\circ}\pm0.04^{\circ}$, $\rm{Dec}=29.25^{\circ}\pm0.03^{\circ}$) is compatible with NGC 4278 within $\sim0.03$ degree. Variation analysis shows an indication of the variability at a few months level in the TeV band, which is consistent with low frequency observations. Based on these observations, we report the detection of TeV $\gamma$-ray emissions from this low-luminosity AGN NGC 4278. The observations by LHAASO-WCDA during active period has a significance level of 8.8\,$\sigma$ with best-fit photon spectral index $\varGamma=2.56\pm0.14$ and a flux $f_{1-10\,\rm{TeV}}=(7.0\pm1.1_{\rm{sta}}\pm0.35_{\rm{syst}})\times10^{-13}\,\rm{photons\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$, or approximately $5\%$ of the Crab Nebula. The discovery of VHE from NGC 4278 indicates that the compact, weak radio jet can efficiently accelerate particles and emit TeV photons.</description>

      <title>High-energy neutrinos from late-time jets of gamma-ray bursts with cocoon photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), $\sim$ 100 - 1000 s after the prompt emission, afterglow observations have consistently shown X-ray excesses detected in the form of flares (XFs; in long GRBs) or extended emission (EEs; in short GRBs). These observations are interpreted as emissions from jets launched by late central engine activity. However, the characteristics of these late-time jets, particularly the dissipation radius ($r_{\rm diss}$), Lorentz factor ($\Gamma$), and cosmic-ray loading factor ($\xi_p$), remain unknown despite their importance. Here, in order to understand the properties of the late-time jets with future multi-messenger observations, we estimate the detectability of neutrinos associated with late-time emissions for a wide range of $r_{\rm diss}$ and $\Gamma$, assuming $\xi_p=10$. We take into account external seed photons from the cocoon around the jets, which can enhance the neutrino production through photohadronic interaction in the jet dissipation region. Our results are still consistent with the upper limit obtained by IceCube. Our calculations indicate a promising prospect for neutrino detection with IceCube-Gen2 through the stacking of $\sim 1000-2000$ events, for a wide range of $r_{\rm diss}$ and $\Gamma$. We found that setting an optimal energy threshold of 10 TeV can significantly reduce noise without negatively affecting neutrino detection. Furthermore, even in the case of non-detection, we show that meaningful constraints on the characteristics of the late-time jets can be obtained.</description>

      <title>The Red Supergiant Progenitor of Type II Supernova 2024ggi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the progenitor and its local environment for the recently discovered type II supernova (SN) 2024ggi at a distance of about 6.7~Mpc, by utilizing the pre-explosion images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and \textit{Spitzer} Space Telescope. The progenitor is identified as a red, bright variable star, with absolute $F814W$-band magnitudes being $-$6.2 mag in 1995 to $-$7.2 mag in 2003, respectively, consistent with that of a normal red supergiant (RSG) star. Combining with the historical mid-infrared light curves, a pulsational period of about 379~days can be inferred for the progenitor star. Fitting its spectral energy distribution with stellar spectral models yields the stellar parameters of temperature, radius and bolometric luminosity as $T_*=3290_{-27}^{+19}$~K, $R_*=887_{-51}^{+60}$~R$_{\odot}$, and log($L$/L$_{\odot}$)$=4.92_{-0.04}^{+0.05}$, respectively. The above parameters indicate that the progenitor of SN 2024ggi is consistent with the stellar evolutionary track of a solar-metallicity massive star with an initial mass of $13_{-1}^{+1}$~M$_{\odot}$. Moreover, our analysis indicates a relatively low mass loss rate (i.e., $&lt; 3\times10^{-6}$~M$_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$) for the progenitor compared to that inferred from the flashed spectra and X-ray detection (i.e., $10^{-2}$$-$$ 10$$^{-5}$~M$_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$), implying a significant enhancement in mass loss within a few years prior to the explosion.</description>

      <title>Long term variability of Cygnus X-1. VIII. A spectral-timing look at low energies with NICER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) monitoring campaign of Cyg X-1 allows us to study its spectral-timing behavior at energies ${&lt;}1$ keV across all states. The hard state power spectrum can be decomposed into two main broad Lorentzians with a transition at around 1 Hz. The lower-frequency Lorentzian is the dominant component at low energies. The higher-frequency Lorentzian begins to contribute significantly to the variability above 1.5 keV and dominates at high energies. We show that the low- and high-frequency Lorentzians likely represent individual physical processes. The lower-frequency Lorentzian can be associated with a (possibly Comptonized) disk component, while the higher-frequency Lorentzian is clearly associated with the Comptonizing plasma. At the transition of these components, we discover a low-energy timing phenomenon characterized by an abrupt lag change of hard (${\gtrsim}2$ keV) with respect to soft (${\lesssim}1.5$ keV) photons, accompanied by a drop in coherence, and a reduction in amplitude of the second broad Lorentzian. The frequency of the phenomenon increases with the frequencies of the Lorentzians as the source softens and cannot be seen when the power spectrum is single-humped. A comparison to transient low-mass X-ray binaries shows that this feature does not only appear in Cyg X-1, but that it is a general property of accreting black hole binaries. In Cyg X-1, we find that the variability at low and high energies is overall highly coherent in the hard and intermediate states. The high coherence shows that there is a process at work which links the variability, suggesting a physical connection between the accretion disk and Comptonizing plasma. This process fundamentally changes in the soft state, where strong red noise at high energies is incoherent to the variability at low energies.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detection of the pair-echo emission from TeV gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) present in the voids of large-scale structures is considered to be the weakest magnetic field in the Universe. Gamma-ray observations of blazars in the GeV-TeV domain have led to lower limits on the IGMF strength based on the search for delayed/extended emission. Nevertheless these results are obtained with strong assumptions on the unknown source properties. The recent discovery of TeV radiation from Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) has paved the way for IGMF studies with these bright transients. Among the current TeV-detected GRBs, GRB 190114C, located at redshift $z = 0.42$, is the best sampled and therefore representative of the properties of GRBs in the VHE domain while GRB 221009A ($z = 0.151$) is the brightest event ever detected. We present a phenomenological model based on the intrinsic properties of GRB 190114C and GRB 221009A to predict the delayed emission component (pair-echo) in the GeV-TeV band. We investigate the detectability of this component from low-redshift ($z \leq 1$) GRBs for three values of IGMF strength ($10^{-19}$ G, $10^{-18}$ G and $10^{-17}$ G), different observational times ($3$ hrs, $6$ hrs and $9$ hrs) and source intrinsic properties. We find that, for current and future generation $\gamma$-ray instruments, extending the observation for at least 3 hours after the GRB detection is a viable strategy to probe IGMF. We also confirm that GeV-TeV observations of GRBs can probe IGMF strengths at the order of $10^{-17} -10^{-19}$ G representing a competitive alternative to the current studies performed with AGNs.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Binary Precession: Impact on Eccentric Binary Accretion and Multi-Messenger Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent hydrodynamical simulations have shown that circumbinary gas disks drive the orbits of binary black holes to become eccentric, even when general relativistic corrections to the orbit are significant. Here, we study the general relativistic (GR) apsidal precession of eccentric equal-mass binary black holes in circumbinary disks (CBDs) via two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. We perform a suite of simulations comparing precessing and non-precessing binaries across a range of eccentricities, semi-major axes, and precession rates. We find that the GR precession of the binary's semi-major axis can introduce a dominant modulation in the binary's accretion rate and the corresponding high-energy electromagnetic light-curves. We discuss the conditions under which this occurs and its detailed characteristics and mechanism. Finally, we discuss the potential to observe these precession signatures in electromagnetic and gravitational wave (GW) observations, as well as the precession signal's unique importance as a potential tool to constrain the mass, eccentricity, and semi-major axis of binary merger events.</description>

      <title>Early phase simultaneous multi-band observations of Type II supernova SN 2024ggi with Mephisto</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present early-phase good cadence simultaneous multi-band ($ugi$, $vrz$--bands) imaging of nearby supernova SN 2024ggi, which exploded in the nearby galaxy, NGC~3621. A quick follow-up was conducted within less than a day after the explosion and continued $\sim$23 days. The $uvg$-band light curves display a rapid rise ($\sim$1.4 mag day$^{-1}$) to maximum in $\sim$4 days and absolute magnitude $M_{g}\sim$--17.75 mag. The post-peak decay rate in redder bands is $\sim$0.01 mag day$^{-1}$. Different colors (e.g., $u-g$ and $v-r$) of SN~2024ggi are slightly redder than SN~2023ixf. A significant rise ($\sim$12.5 kK) in black-body temperature (optical) was noticed within $\sim$2 days after the explosion, which successively decreased, indicating shock break out inside a dense circumstellar medium (CSM) surrounding the progenitor. Using semi-analytical modeling, the ejecta mass and progenitor radius were estimated as 1.2 M$_{\odot}$ and $\sim$550 R$_{\odot}$, respectively. The archival deep images ($g,r,i,z$-bands) from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) were examined, and a possible progenitor was detected in each band ($\sim$22--22.5 mag) and had a mass range of 14--17 M$_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Perfect nonradiating electromagnetic source and its self-action</title>

Abstract: Nonradiating sources and anapoles are curious objects from the physics of invisibility that illuminate subtle concepts of fundamental electrodynamics and have promising applications in nanophotonics. The present work shows that a perfectly conducting sphere with a hidden magnetic field is a simple nonradiating electromagnetic source with mechanical excitation and complete internal confinement of electromagnetic energy. It does not require external electromagnetic excitation and is excited by rotation, which induces internal charges and currents with a self-compensating external radiation. The constructed source acts on itself through Lorentz forces emerging from the interaction of charges and currents with electromagnetic fields inside the sphere and, when having a freedom of rotation about the fixed center, exhibits regular precession like a gyroscope. This self-action reveals an internal electromagnetic activity of the perfect nonradiating source, externally inactive and invisible. Neutron stars, these nanospheres of space, can be such natural nonradiating sources when their magnetic fields are buried.</description>

      <title>Superradiant clouds may be relevant for close compact object binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15003v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bosonic fields (within suitable mass range) may be collectively generated by rotating black holes through the black hole superradiance process. The resulting black hole is surrounded by a ``cloud" of particles whose wave function populates the superradiant energy level of the black hole. For comparable mass ratio binary black hole systems, it has been suggested that these clouds often deplete at large binary separations because of level mixing effects. As a result, these clouds may not be dynamically relevant for black hole and neutron star binaries that enter the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA and LISA detection frequency band. In this work, we point out that the common envelope process during a compact binary evolution may bring the binary to $\sim 0.01$AU in hundreds to thousands of years, so that depletion caused by certain level mixings are no longer important. We derive a relevant regime of binary parameters where the clouds are still present for binary entering the LISA band, and show that common envelop process does enlarge such parameter regime. When the binary separation further decreases due to gravitational wave radiation, we discuss the impact of possible cloud mass transfer between the binary objects.</description>

      <title>Exploring Large-Volume GAGG Scintillators for use in MeV Gamma-Ray Astrophysics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gamma-ray astrophysics in the MeV band is an exciting field in astronomy due to its potential for multi-messenger astrophysics. It has, however, remained under-explored when compared to other wavelengths. One reason for this observational gap is the difficulties with measuring these high-energy photons and the requirement of large amounts of detection material. In this work, we investigate the usage of large-volume GAGG scintillators for use as a calorimeter in future MeV telescopes. We developed a $5\times5$ array calorimeter utilizing $1\times1\times6 \ \mathrm{cm}^3$ GAGG crystals with C-series SiPM readout. The calorimeter was tested at the High Intensity Gamma-ray Facility (HIGS) with monoenergetic beams ranging from $2-25 \ \mathrm{MeV}$. Finally, we also investigated larger $1\times1\times8 \ \mathrm{cm}^3$ crystals and characterized their response across their depth when their surface treatment is either polished or frosted.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Leptogenesis with sub-GeV Axion Like Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A derivative coupling of an axion like particle (ALP) with a B-L current may lead to the baryon asymmetry of the universe via spontaneous leptogenesis provided a lepton number breaking interaction prevails in thermal equilibrium. Conventionally, such scenario works only for heavy ALPs and high reheating temperature due to the fact that the same lepton number breaking contribution is tied up with neutrino mass generation also. In this work, we propose inert Higgs doublet assisted lepton number violating operator to relieve such tension so as to generate lepton asymmetry (of freeze-in/out type) with a much lower reheating temperature that can accommodate light (sub-GeV) ALPs sensitive to current and future ALP searches.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of electrons and ions by an "almost" astrophysical shock in the heliosphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisionless shock waves, ubiquitous in the universe, are crucial for particle acceleration in various astrophysical systems. Currently, the heliosphere is the only natural environment available for their in situ study. In this work, we showcase the collective acceleration of electrons and ions by one of the fastest in situ shocks ever recorded, observed by the pioneering Parker Solar Probe at only 34.5 million kilometers from the Sun. Our analysis of this unprecedented, near-parallel shock shows electron acceleration up to 6 MeV amidst intense multi-scale electromagnetic wave emissions. We also present evidence of a variable shock structure capable of injecting and accelerating ions from the solar wind to high energies through a self-consistent process. The exceptional capability of the probe's instruments to measure electromagnetic fields in a shock traveling at 1% the speed of light has enabled us, for the first time, to confirm that the structure of a strong heliospheric shock aligns with theoretical models of strong shocks observed in astrophysical environments. This alignment offers viable avenues for understanding astrophysical shock processes and the acceleration of charged particles.</description>

      <title>A Fast Radio Burst monitor with a Compact All-Sky Phased Array (CASPA)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are short-duration radio transients that occur at random times in host galaxies distributed all over the sky. Large field of view instruments can play a critical role in the blind search for rare FRBs. We present a concept for an all-sky FRB monitor using a compact all-sky phased array (CASPA), which can efficiently achieve an extremely large field of view of $\sim10^4$ square degrees. Such a system would allow us to conduct a continuous, blind FRB search covering the entire southern sky. Using the measured FRB luminosity function, we investigate the detection rate for this all-sky phased array and compare the result to a number of other proposed large field-of-view instruments. We predict a rate of a few FRB detections per week and determine the dispersion measure and redshift distributions of these detectable FRBs. This instrument is optimal for detecting FRBs in the nearby Universe and for extending the high-end of the FRB luminosity function through finding ultraluminous events. Additionally, this instrument can be used to shadow the new gravitational-wave observing runs, detect high energy events triggered from Galactic magnetars and search for other bright, but currently unknown transient signals.</description>

      <title>Influence of Black Hole Kick Velocity on Microlensing Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The natal kick velocity distribution for black holes (BHs) is unknown regardless of its importance for understanding the BH formation process. Gravitational microlensing is a unique tool for studying the distribution of BHs in our Galaxy, and the first isolated stellar-mass BH event, OGLE-2011-BLG-0462/MOA-2011-BLG-191 (OB110462), was recently identified by astrometric microlensing. This study investigates how the natal kick velocity for Galactic BHs affects the microlensing event rate distribution. We consider a Maxwell distribution with various average kick velocities, as well as the consequent variation of the spatial distribution of BHs. We find that the event rate for the BH lenses toward the Galactic bulge decreases as $v_{\rm avg}$ increases, mainly due to the scale height inflation. We focus on the unique microlensing parameters measured for OB110462, with microlens parallax $\pi_{\rm E}$ larger than 0.06 for its long timescale of $t_{\rm E} &gt; 200~$ days. We calculate the expected number of BH events occurring with parameters similar to OB110462 during the OGLE-IV survey by Mr\'oz et al. (2017, 2019) and compare it with the actual number that occurred, at least one. Our fiducial model predicts 0.26, 0.19, 0.095, 0.020, and $1.8 \times 10^{-3}$ events occurring for $v_{\rm avg} =$ 25 km/sec, 50 km/sec, 100 km/sec, 200 km/sec, and 400 km/sec, respectively, which suggests that the average kick velocity is likely to be $v_{\rm avg} \lesssim 100~{\rm km/sec}$. The expected number smaller than unity even at maximum might indicate our luckiness of finding OB110462, which can be tested with future surveys by e.g. the Roman space telescope.</description>

Abstract: It is well-known that gravitational waves (GWs) undergo no absorption or dissipation when traversing through a perfect fluid. However, in the presence of a viscous fluid, GWs transfer energy to the fluid medium. In this essay, we present a review of our recent series of results regarding the interaction between gravitational waves and surrounding matter. Additionally, we examine the impact of a viscous fluid shell on gravitational wave propagation, focusing particularly on GW damping and GW heating. Furthermore, we explore the significance of these effects in various astrophysical scenarios such as core-collapse Supernovae and primordial gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Pulsar timing array constraints on the cosmological magnetic field from quark confinement epoch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent evidence for the stochastic gravitational wave backgorund reported by the pulsar timing arrays (PTA) can be interpreted as a signal from the cosmological phase transition. We use up-to-date models of the gravitational wave power spectra to compare constraints on the parameters of the phase transition for the three different available PTA measurements and to work out a refined estimate of the cosmological magnetic field that should result from this transition. We find that the PTA data, combined with a constraint from the abundance of primordial black holes, are consistent with a possibility of a moderate strength first-order phase transition during quark confinement and yield a rather precise prediction for the initial parameters of the magnetic field, with the magnetic field energy density in near equipartition with photon energy density and correlation length close to one co-moving parsec.</description>

      <title>The $\gamma$-process nucleosynthesis in core-collapse supernovae II. Effect of the explosive recipe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\gamma$-process in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) can produce a number of neutron-deficient stable isotopes heavier than iron (p-nuclei). However, current model predictions do to not fully reproduce the solar abundances. We investigate the impact of different explosion energies and parameters on the nucleosynthesis of p-nuclei, by studying stellar models with different initial masses and CCSN explosions. We find that the total p-nuclei yields are only marginally affected by the CCSN explosion prescriptions if the $\gamma$-process production is already efficient in the stellar progenitors due to a C-O shell merger. In most of CCSN explosions from progenitors without C-O shell merger, the $\gamma$-process yields increase with the explosion energy up to an order of magnitude, depending on the progenitor structure and the CCSN prescriptions. The trend of the p-nuclei production with the explosion energy is more complicated if we look at the production of single p-nuclei. The light p-nuclei tend to be the most enhanced with increasing the explosion energy. In particular, for the CCSN models where the $\alpha$-rich freeze-out component is ejected, the yields of the lightest p-nuclei increase by up to three orders of magnitude. We provide the first extensive study using different sets of massive stars of the impact of varying CCSN explosion prescriptions on the production of the p-nuclei. Unlike previous expectations and recent results in the literature, we find that the average production of p-nuclei tends to increase with the explosion energy. We also confirm that the pre-explosive production of p-nuclei in C-O shell mergers is a robust result, independently from the subsequent explosive nucleosynthesis. A realistic range of variations in the evolution of stellar progenitors and in the CCSN explosions might boost the CCSN contribution to the galactic chemical evolution of p-nuclei.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong magnetically dominated Alfv\'enic turbulence is an efficient engine of non-thermal particle acceleration in a relativistic collisionless plasma. We argue that in the limit of strong magnetization, the type of energy distribution attained by accelerated particles depends on the relative strengths of turbulent fluctuations $\delta B_0$ and the guide field $B_0$. If $\delta B_0\ll B_0$, the particle magnetic moments are conserved and the acceleration is provided by magnetic curvature drifts. Curvature acceleration energizes particles in the direction parallel to the magnetic field lines, resulting in log-normal tails of particle energy distribution functions. Conversely, if $\delta B_0 \gtrsim B_0$, interactions of energetic particles with intense turbulent structures can scatter particles, creating a population with large pitch angles. In this case, magnetic mirror effects become important, and turbulent acceleration leads to power-law tails of the energy distribution functions.</description>

Abstract: Sub-GeV neutrinos produced in a stellar core may emerge from main sequence stars, white dwarfs and brown dwarfs producing possible observable signals of dark matter capture. A distribution of these stars near the Milky Way galactic center will produce a neutrino flux that can be probed at Earth based neutrino observatories like Super-Kamiokande. We demonstrate that this can provide a handle to probe dark matter masses in the 100 MeV - 2 GeV mass scales that compares favourably with present day direct detection bounds.</description>

Abstract: Next-generation neutrino telescopes with significantly improved sensitivity are required to pinpoint the sources of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux detected by IceCube and uncover the century-old puzzle of cosmic ray origins. A detector near the equator will provide a unique viewpoint of the neutrino sky, complementing IceCube and other neutrino telescopes in the Northern Hemisphere. Here we present results from an expedition to the north-eastern region of the South China Sea, in the western Pacific Ocean. A favorable neutrino telescope site was found on an abyssal plain at a depth of $\sim$ 3.5km. At depths below 3km, the sea current speed, water absorption and scattering lengths for Cherenkov light, were measured to be $v_{\mathrm{c}}&lt;$10cm/s, $\lambda_{\mathrm{abs} }\simeq$ 27m and $\lambda_{\mathrm{sca} }\simeq$ 63m, respectively. Accounting for these measurements, we present the design and expected performance of a next-generation neutrino telescope, TRopIcal DEep-sea Neutrino Telescope (TRIDENT). With its advanced photon-detection technology and large dimensions, TRIDENT expects to observe the IceCube steady source candidate NGC 1068 with 5$\sigma$ significance within 1 year of operation. This level of sensitivity will open a new arena for diagnosing the origin of cosmic rays and probing fundamental physics over astronomical baselines.</description>

      <title>Production of $p$-nuclei from $r$-process seeds: the $\nu r$-process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new nucleosynthesis process that may take place on neutron-rich ejecta experiencing an intensive neutrino flux. The nucleosynthesis proceeds similarly to the standard $r$-process, a sequence of neutron-captures and beta-decays, however with charged-current neutrino absorption reactions on nuclei operating much faster than beta-decays. Once neutron capture reactions freeze-out the produced $r$-process neutron-rich nuclei undergo a fast conversion of neutrons into protons and are pushed even beyond the $\beta$-stability line producing the neutron-deficient $p$-nuclei. This scenario, which we denote as the $\nu r$-process, provides an alternative channel for the production of $p$-nuclei and the short-lived nucleus $^{92}$Nb. We discuss the necessary conditions posed on the astrophysical site for the $\nu r$-process to be realized in nature. While these conditions are not fulfilled by current neutrino-hydrodynamic models of $r$-process sites, future models, including more complex physics and a larger variety of outflow conditions, may achieve the necessary conditions in some regions of the ejecta.</description>

Abstract: A Thorne-\.{Z}ytkow object can be formed when a neutron star is absorbed by the envelope of its giant companion star, spirals toward the center of the giant star due to the drag from the surrounding envelope, and merges with the star's core. During in-spiral, dynamical friction is the main drag force acting on a neutron star inside the star envelope. However, dynamical friction is caused by the neutron star's gravitational interaction with its own gravitationally induced wake. Therefore, exactly the same gravitational drag force will act on a mirror neutron star, and if a significant part of the dark matter is in the form of mirror matter, then we expect the formation of Thorne-\.{Z}ytkow objects with a mirror neutron star inside. We explore the plausibility of the existence of such exotic Thorne-\.{Z}ytkow objects.</description>

      <title>Neutron stars in accreting systems -- signatures of the QCD phase transition</title>

Abstract: Neutron stars (NS) that are born in binary systems with a main-sequence star companion can experience mass transfer, resulting in the accumulation of material at the surface of the NS. This, in turn, leads to the continuous growth of the NS mass and the associated steepening of the gravitational potential. Supposing the central density surpasses the onset for the phase transition from nuclear, generally hadronic matter to deconfined quark-gluon plasma, which is a quantity currently constrained solely from an upper limit by asymptotic freedom in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the system may experience a dynamic response due to the appearance of additional degrees of freedom in the equation of state (EOS). This dynamical response might give rise to a rapid softening of the EOS during the transition in the hadron-quark matter co-existence region. While this phenomenon has long been studied in the context of hydrostatic configurations, the dynamical implications of this problem are still incompletely understood. It is the purpose of the present paper to simulate the dynamics of NSs with previously accreted envelopes caused by the presence of a first-order QCD phase transition. Therefore, we employed the neutrino radiation hydrodynamics treatment based on the fully general relativistic approach in spherical symmetry, implementing a three-flavor Boltzmann neutrino transport and a microscopic model EOS that contains a first-order hadron-quark phase transition. The associated neutrino signal shows a sudden rise in the neutrino fluxes and average energies, becoming observable for the present generation of neutrino detectors for a galactic event, and a gravitational wave mode analysis revealed the behaviors of the dominant $f$ mode and the first and the second gravity $g$ modes that are excited during the NS evolution across the QCD phase transition.</description>

Abstract: The recent discoveries of a remarkable glitch/antiglitch accompanied by fast radio burst (FRB)-like bursts from the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 have revealed the physical connection between the two. In this work, we study the statistical properties of radio bursts from the hyperactive repeating source FRB 20201124A and of glitches from the pulsar PSR B1737--30. For FRB 20201124A, we confirm that the probability density functions of fluctuations of energy, peak flux, duration, and waiting time well follow the Tsallis q-Gaussian distribution. The derived q values from q-Gaussian distribution keep approximately steady for different temporal interval scales, which indicate that there is a common scale-invariant structure in repeating FRBs. Similar scale-invariant property can be found in PSR B1737--30's glitches, implying an underlying association between the origins of repeating FRBs and pulsar glitches. These statistical features can be well understood within the same physical framework of self-organized criticality systems.</description>

Abstract: The dynamic spectra of pulsars frequently exhibit diverse interference patterns, often associated with parabolic arcs in the Fourier-transformed (secondary) spectra. Our approach differs from previous ones in two ways: first, we extend beyond the traditional Fresnel-Kirchhoff method by using the Green's function of the Helmholtz equation, i.e.\ we consider spherical waves originating from three dimensional space, not from a two dimensional screen. Secondly, the discrete structures observed in the secondary spectrum result from discrete scatterer configurations, namely plasma concentrations in the interstellar medium, and not from the selection of points by the stationary phase approximation. Through advanced numerical techniques, we model both the dynamic and secondary spectra, providing a comprehensive framework that describes all components of the latter spectra in terms of physical quantities. Additionally, we provide a thorough analytical explanation of the secondary spectrum.</description>

      <title>X-ray polarization measurement of the gold standard of radio-quiet active galactic nuclei : NGC 1068</title>

Abstract: We used the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) satellite to measure, for the first time, the 2-8 keV polarization of NGC 1068. We pointed IXPE for a net exposure time of 1.15 Ms on the target, in addition to two ~ 10 ks each Chandra snapshots in order to account for the potential impact of several ultraluminous X-ray source (ULXs) within IXPE's field-of-view. We measured a 2 - 8 keV polarization degree of 12.4% +/- 3.6% and an electric vector polarization angle of 101{\deg} +/- 8{\deg} at 68% confidence level. If we exclude the spectral region containing the bright Fe K lines and other soft X-ray lines where depolarization occurs, the polarization fraction rises up to 21.3% +/- 6.7% in the 3.5 - 6.0 keV band, with a similar polarization angle. The observed polarization angle is found to be perpendicular to the parsec scale radio jet. Using a combined Chandra and IXPE analysis plus multi-wavelength constraints, we estimated that the circumnuclear "torus" may sustain a half-opening angle of 50{\deg} - 55{\deg} (from the vertical axis of the system). Thanks to IXPE, we have measured the X-ray polarization of NGC 1068 and found comparable results, both in terms of polarization angle orientation with respect to the radio-jet and torus half-opening angle, to the X-ray polarimetric measurement achieved for the other archetypal Compton-thick AGN : the Circinus galaxy. Probing the geometric arrangement of parsec-scale matter in extragalactic object is now feasible thanks to X-ray polarimetry.</description>

      <title>Nucleosynthesis in the Innermost Ejecta of Magnetorotational Supernova Explosions in 3-dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosions powered by rotation and magnetic fields present an interesting astrophysical site for nucleosynthesis that potentially contributes to the production of $r$-process elements. Here we present yields of the innermost ejecta in 3D magnetorotational CCSN models simulated using the CoCoNuT-FMT code. Strong magnetic fields tap the rotational energy of the proto-neutron star and lead to earlier and more energetic ($\sim 3\times 10^{51}$ erg) explosions than typical neutrino-driven CCSNe. Compared to a reference non-magnetic model, the ejecta in the magnetorotational models have much more neutron-rich components with Ye down to $\sim$0.25. Our post-processing calculations with the reaction network SkyNet show significant production of weak $r$-process elements up to mass number $\sim$130. We find negligible differences in the synthesis of heavy elements between two magnetorotational models with different initial field strength of 10$^{10}$ and 10$^{12}$ G, in accord with their similar explosion dynamics. The magnetorotational models produce about $\sim$0.19 and 0.14 Msun of radioactive $^{56}$Ni, on the low end of inferred hypernova nickel masses. The yields are publicly available at Zenodo: doi:10.5281/zenodo.10578981 for comparison with stellar abundance patterns, inclusion in modelling galactic chemical evolution, and comparison with other yield calculations. Our results add to the yet restricted corpus of nucleosynthesis yields from 3D magnetorotational supernova simulations and will help quantify yield uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Sculpting the Morphology of Supernova Remnant Pa 30 via Efficient Ejecta Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate in a proof-of-concept numerical hydrodynamics calculation that the narrow radial filamentary structures seen in Pa 30 could be generated through highly efficient cooling (e.g. via line emission) in the ejecta. Efficient cooling in the ejecta causes a drop of pressure support in Rayleigh-Taylor fingers, leading them to be compressed, and suppressing the growth of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. Following this result, we make three predictions that could determine whether this is the mechanism responsible for shaping Pa 30: First, we predict very strong emission lines, strong enough to cool a significant fraction of the shock energy in an expansion time. Secondly, we predict that the forward shock should be highly corrugated on small scales, with the shock front closely following the structure of the filaments. Third, we predict that these filaments should be nearly ballistic, with velocities around 90% of the free-expansion velocity ($v \approx 0.9 ~r/t$). These predictions should be falsifiable in follow-up observations of this remnant.</description>

      <title>Revisiting High-Energy Polarization from Leptonic and Hadronic Blazar Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray and MeV polarization can be powerful diagnostics for leptonic and hadronic blazar models. Previous predictions are mostly based on a one-zone framework. However, recent IXPE observations of Mrk~421 and 501 strongly favor a multi-zone framework. Thus, the leptonic and hadronic polarization predictions need to be revisited. Here we identify two generic radiation transfer effects, namely, double depolarization and energy stratification, that can have an impact on the leptonic and hadronic polarization. We show how they are generalized from previously known multi-zone effects of the primary electron synchrotron radiation. Under our generic multi-zone model, the leptonic polarization degree is expected to be much lower than the one-zone prediction, unlikely detectable in most cases. The hadronic polarization degree can reach a value as high as the primary electron synchrotron polarization during simultaneous multi-wavelength flares, consistent with the one-zone prediction. Therefore, IXPE and future X-ray and MeV polarimeters such as eXTP, COSI, and AMEGO-X, have good chances to detect hadronic polarization during flares. However, the hadronic polarization cannot be well constrained during the quiescent state. Nonetheless, if some blazar jets possess relatively stable large-scale magnetic structures, as suggested by radio observations, a non-trivial polarization degree may show up for the hadronic model after a very long exposure time ($\gtrsim 1$ year).</description>

      <title>Insight-HXMT View of the BHC Swift J1727.8-1613 during its outburst in 2023</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transient Galactic black hole candidate Swift\,J1727.8-1613 went through an outburst for the very first time that started in August 2023 and lasted for almost 6 months. We study the timing and spectral properties of this source using publicly available archival {\it Insight-HXMT} data for the first 10 observation IDs that last from MJD 60181 to 60198 with a total of 92 exposures for all three energy bands. We extracted the quasi-periodic oscillation properties by model fitting the power density spectrum and from those properties we designate that the QPOs are type-C in nature. We also conclude that the origin of the QPOs could be the shock instabilities in the transonic advective accretion flows around black holes. The spectral analysis was performed using simultaneous data from the three on-board instruments LE, ME, and HE of \textit{Insight-HXMT} in the broad energy band of $2-150 $ keV. To achieve the best fit, spectral fitting required a combination of models e.g. interstellar absorption, power-law, multi-color disk-blackbody continuum, gaussian emission/absorption, and reflection by neutral material. From the spectral properties, we found that the source was in an intermediate state at the start of the analysis period and was making a transition toward the softer states. The inner edge of the accretion disk moved inward in progressive days following the spectral nature. We found that the source has a high inclination. The average hydrogen column density estimated from the model fitting is $0.27_{-0.17}^{+0.08}\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the isospin equilibration properties of neutrinoless nuclear ($npe$) matter in the temperature and density range that is relevant to neutron star mergers. Our analysis incorporates neutrino-transparency corrections to the isospin (``beta'') equilibrium condition which become noticeable at $T\gtrsim 1\,$MeV. We find that the isospin relaxation rate rises rapidly as temperature rises, and at $T\approx 5\,$MeV it is comparable to the timescale of the density oscillations that occur immediately after the merger. This produces a resonant peak in the bulk viscosity at $T\approx 5\,$MeV, which causes density oscillations to be damped on the timescale of the merger. Our calculations suggest that isospin relaxation dynamics may also be relevant when neutrinos are treated more accurately via neutrino transport schemes.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity-induced systematic error on parametrized tests of general relativity: Hierarchical Bayesian inference applied to a binary black hole population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One approach to testing general relativity (GR) introduces free parameters in the post-Newtonian (PN) expansion of the gravitational-wave (GW) phase. If systematic errors on these testing GR (TGR) parameters exceed the statistical errors, this may signal a false violation of GR. Here, we consider systematic errors produced by unmodeled binary eccentricity. Since the eccentricity of GW events in ground-based detectors is expected to be small or negligible, the use of quasicircular waveform models for testing GR may be safe when analyzing a small number of events. However, as the catalog size of GW detections increases, more stringent bounds on GR deviations can be placed by combining information from multiple events. In that case, even small systematic biases may become significant. We apply the approach of hierarchical Bayesian inference to model the posterior probability distributions of the TGR parameters inferred from a population of eccentric binary black holes (BBHs). We assume each TGR parameter value varies across the BBH population according to a Gaussian distribution. We compute the posterior distributions for these Gaussian hyperparameters. This is done for LIGO and Cosmic Explorer (CE). We find that systematic biases from unmodeled eccentricity can signal false GR violations for both detectors when considering constraints set by a catalog of events. We also compute the projected bounds on the $10$ TGR parameters when eccentricity is included as a parameter in the waveform model. We find that the first four dimensionless TGR deformation parameters can be bounded at $90\%$ confidence to $\delta \hat{\varphi}_i \lesssim 10^{-2}$ for LIGO and $\lesssim 10^{-3}$ for CE [where $i=(0,1,2,3)$]. In comparison to the circular orbit case, the combined bounds on the TGR parameters worsen by a modest factor of $\lesssim 2$ when eccentricity is included in the waveform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12487v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the phenomenological consequences of breaking discrete global symmetries in quantum gravity (QG). We extend a previous scenario where discrete global symmetries are responsible for scalar dark matter (DM) and domain walls (DWs), to the case of fermionic DM, considered as a feebly interacting massive particle, which achieves the correct DM relic density via the freeze-in mechanism. Due to the mixing between DM and the standard model neutrinos, various indirect DM detection methods can be employed to constrain the QG scale, the scale of freeze-in, and the reheating temperature simultaneously. Since such QG symmetry breaking leads to DW annihilation, this may generate the characteristic gravitational wave background, and hence explain the recent observations of the gravitational wave spectrum by pulsar timing arrays. This work therefore highlights a tantalizing possibility of probing the effective scale of QG from observations.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the role of cosmic-ray driven Alfv\'en waves in pre-existing magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. I. Turbulent damping rates and feedback on background fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alfv\'en waves (AWs) excited by the cosmic-ray (CR) streaming instability (CRSI) are a fundamental ingredient for CR confinement. The effectiveness of self-confinement relies on a balance between CRSI growth rate and damping mechanisms acting on quasi-parallel AWs excited by CRs. One relevant mechanism is the so-called turbulent damping, in which an AW packet injected in pre-existing turbulence undergoes a cascade process due to its nonlinear interaction with fluctuations of the background. The turbulent damping of an AW packet in pre-existing magnetohydrodynamic turbulence is re-examined, revised, and extended to include most-recent theories of MHD turbulence that account for dynamic alignment and reconnection-mediated regime. The case in which the role of feedback of CR-driven AWs on pre-existing turbulence is important will also be discussed. Particular attention is given to the nonlinearity parameter $\chi^w$ that estimates the strength of nonlinear interaction between CR-driven AWs and background fluctuations. We point out the difference between $\chi^w$ and $\chi^z$ that instead describes the strength of nonlinear interactions between pre-existing fluctuations. When $\chi^w$ is properly taken into account, one finds that (i) the turbulent damping rate of quasi-parallel AWs in anisotropic turbulence depends on the background-fluctuations' amplitude to the third power, hence is strongly suppressed, and (ii) the dependence on the AW's wavelength (and thus on the CR gyro-radius from which it is excited) is different from what has been previously obtained. Finally, (iii) when dynamic alignment of cascading fluctuations and the possibility of a reconnection-mediated range is included in the picture, the turbulent damping rate exhibits novel regimes and breaks. Finally, a criterion for CR-feedback is derived and simple phenomenological models of CR-modified turbulent scaling are provided.</description>

Abstract: The first loading of gadolinium (Gd) into Super-Kamiokande in 2020 was successful, and the neutron capture efficiency on Gd reached 50\%. To further increase the Gd neutron capture efficiency to 75\%, 26.1 tons of $\rm Gd_2(\rm SO_4)_3\cdot \rm 8H_2O$ was additionally loaded into Super-Kamiokande (SK) from May 31 to July 4, 2022. As the amount of loaded $\rm Gd_2(\rm SO_4)_3\cdot \rm 8H_2O$ was doubled compared to the first loading, the capacity of the powder dissolving system was doubled. We also developed new batches of gadolinium sulfate with even further reduced radioactive impurities. In addition, a more efficient screening method was devised and implemented to evaluate these new batches of $\rm Gd_2(\rm SO_4)_3\cdot \rm 8H_2O$. Following the second loading, the Gd concentration in SK was measured to be $333.5\pm2.5$ ppm via an Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS). From the mean neutron capture time constant of neutrons from an Am/Be calibration source, the Gd concentration was independently measured to be 332.7 $\pm$ 6.8(sys.) $\pm$ 1.1(stat.) ppm, consistent with the AAS result. Furthermore, during the loading the Gd concentration was monitored continually using the capture time constant of each spallation neutron produced by cosmic-ray muons,and the final neutron capture efficiency was shown to become 1.5 times higher than that of the first loaded phase, as expected.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the Magnetic Field in an Arbitrary Domain via Data-driven Bayesian Methods and Numerical Simulations</title>

Abstract: Inverse problems are prevalent in numerous scientific and engineering disciplines, where the objective is to determine unknown parameters within a physical system using indirect measurements or observations. The inherent challenge lies in deducing the most probable parameter values that align with the collected data. This study introduces an algorithm for reconstructing parameters by addressing an inverse problem formulated through differential equations underpinned by uncertain boundary conditions or variant parameters. We adopt a Bayesian approach for parameter inference, delineating the establishment of prior, likelihood, and posterior distributions, and the subsequent resolution of the maximum a posteriori problem via numerical optimization techniques. The proposed algorithm is applied to the task of magnetic field reconstruction within a conical domain, demonstrating precise recovery of the true parameter values.</description>
