      <title>Magnitude Pruning of Large Pretrained Transformer Models with a Mixture Gaussian Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large pretrained transformer models have revolutionized modern AI applications with their state-of-the-art performance in natural language processing (NLP). However, their substantial parameter count poses challenges for real-world deployment. To address this, researchers often reduce model size by pruning parameters based on their magnitude or sensitivity. Previous research has demonstrated the limitations of magnitude pruning, especially in the context of transfer learning for modern NLP tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new magnitude-based pruning algorithm called mixture Gaussian prior pruning (MGPP), which employs a mixture Gaussian prior for regularization. MGPP prunes non-expressive weights under the guidance of the mixture Gaussian prior, aiming to retain the model's expressive capability. Extensive evaluations across various NLP tasks, including natural language understanding, question answering, and natural language generation, demonstrate the superiority of MGPP over existing pruning methods, particularly in high sparsity settings. Additionally, we provide a theoretical justification for the consistency of the sparse transformer, shedding light on the effectiveness of the proposed pruning method.</description>

      <title>Automated Assessment of Residual Plots with Computer Vision Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plotting the residuals is a recommended procedure to diagnose deviations from linear model assumptions, such as non-linearity, heteroscedasticity, and non-normality. The presence of structure in residual plots can be tested using the lineup protocol to do visual inference. There are a variety of conventional residual tests, but the lineup protocol, used as a statistical test, performs better for diagnostic purposes because it is less sensitive and applies more broadly to different types of departures. However, the lineup protocol relies on human judgment which limits its scalability. This work presents a solution by providing a computer vision model to automate the assessment of residual plots. It is trained to predict a distance measure that quantifies the disparity between the residual distribution of a fitted classical normal linear regression model and the reference distribution, based on Kullback-Leibler divergence. From extensive simulation studies, the computer vision model exhibits lower sensitivity than conventional tests but higher sensitivity than human visual tests. It is slightly less effective on non-linearity patterns. Several examples from classical papers and contemporary data illustrate the new procedures, highlighting its usefulness in automating the diagnostic process and supplementing existing methods.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning with Relative Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a federated learning framework designed to achieve \textit{relative fairness} for clients. Traditional federated learning frameworks typically ensure absolute fairness by guaranteeing minimum performance across all client subgroups. However, this approach overlooks disparities in model performance between subgroups. The proposed framework uses a minimax problem approach to minimize relative unfairness, extending previous methods in distributionally robust optimization (DRO). A novel fairness index, based on the ratio between large and small losses among clients, is introduced, allowing the framework to assess and improve the relative fairness of trained models. Theoretical guarantees demonstrate that the framework consistently reduces unfairness. We also develop an algorithm, named \textsc{Scaff-PD-IA}, which balances communication and computational efficiency while maintaining minimax-optimal convergence rates. Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets confirm its effectiveness in maintaining model performance while reducing disparity.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws with Hidden Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical learning in high-dimensional spaces is challenging without a strong underlying data structure. Recent advances with foundational models suggest that text and image data contain such hidden structures, which help mitigate the curse of dimensionality. Inspired by results from nonparametric statistics, we hypothesize that this phenomenon can be partially explained in terms of decomposition of complex tasks into simpler subtasks. In this paper, we present a controlled experimental framework to test whether neural networks can indeed exploit such ``hidden factorial structures.'' We find that they do leverage these latent patterns to learn discrete distributions more efficiently, and derive scaling laws linking model sizes, hidden factorizations, and accuracy. We also study the interplay between our structural assumptions and the models' capacity for generalization.</description>

      <title>DSDE: Using Proportion Estimation to Improve Model Selection for Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model library is an effective tool for improving the performance of single-model Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detector, mainly through model selection and detector fusion. However, existing methods in the literature do not provide uncertainty quantification for model selection results. Additionally, the model ensemble process primarily focuses on controlling the True Positive Rate (TPR) while neglecting the False Positive Rate (FPR). In this paper, we emphasize the significance of the proportion of models in the library that identify the test sample as an OoD sample. This proportion holds crucial information and directly influences the error rate of OoD detection.To address this, we propose inverting the commonly-used sequential p-value strategies. We define the rejection region initially and then estimate the error rate. Furthermore, we introduce a novel perspective from change-point detection and propose an approach for proportion estimation with automatic hyperparameter selection. We name the proposed approach as DOS-Storey-based Detector Ensemble (DSDE). Experimental results on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in tackling OoD detection challenges. Specifically, the CIFAR10 experiments show that DSDE reduces the FPR from 11.07% to 3.31% compared to the top-performing single-model detector.</description>

      <title>Strategic Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a machine learning model is deployed, its predictions can alter its environment, as better informed agents strategize to suit their own interests. With such alterations in mind, existing approaches to uncertainty quantification break. In this work we propose a new framework, Strategic Conformal Prediction, which is capable of robust uncertainty quantification in such a setting. Strategic Conformal Prediction is backed by a series of theoretical guarantees spanning marginal coverage, training-conditional coverage, tightness and robustness to misspecification that hold in a distribution-free manner. Experimental analysis further validates our method, showing its remarkable effectiveness in face of arbitrary strategic alterations, whereas other methods break.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual explainability of black-box prediction models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is crucial to be able to explain black-box prediction models to use them effectively and safely in practice. Most existing tools for model explanations are associational rather than causal, and we use two paradoxical examples to show that such explanations are generally inadequate. Motivated by the concept of genetic heritability in twin studies, we propose a new notion called counterfactual explainability for black-box prediction models. Counterfactual explainability has three key advantages: (1) it leverages counterfactual outcomes and extends methods for global sensitivity analysis (such as functional analysis of variance and Sobol's indices) to a causal setting; (2) it is defined not only for the totality of a set of input factors but also for their interactions (indeed, it is a probability measure on a whole ``explanation algebra''); (3) it also applies to dependent input factors whose causal relationship can be modeled by a directed acyclic graph, thus incorporating causal mechanisms into the explanation.</description>

      <title>Denoising Diffusions with Optimal Transport: Localization, Curvature, and Multi-Scale Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adding noise is easy; what about denoising? Diffusion is easy; what about reverting a diffusion? Diffusion-based generative models aim to denoise a Langevin diffusion chain, moving from a log-concave equilibrium measure $\nu$, say isotropic Gaussian, back to a complex, possibly non-log-concave initial measure $\mu$. The score function performs denoising, going backward in time, predicting the conditional mean of the past location given the current. We show that score denoising is the optimal backward map in transportation cost. What is its localization uncertainty? We show that the curvature function determines this localization uncertainty, measured as the conditional variance of the past location given the current. We study in this paper the effectiveness of the diffuse-then-denoise process: the contraction of the forward diffusion chain, offset by the possible expansion of the backward denoising chain, governs the denoising difficulty. For any initial measure $\mu$, we prove that this offset net contraction at time $t$ is characterized by the curvature complexity of a smoothed $\mu$ at a specific signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scale $r(t)$. We discover that the multi-scale curvature complexity collectively determines the difficulty of the denoising chain. Our multi-scale complexity quantifies a fine-grained notion of average-case curvature instead of the worst-case. Curiously, it depends on an integrated tail function, measuring the relative mass of locations with positive curvature versus those with negative curvature; denoising at a specific SNR scale is easy if such an integrated tail is light. We conclude with several non-log-concave examples to demonstrate how the multi-scale complexity probes the bottleneck SNR for the diffuse-then-denoise process.</description>

      <title>Stein Variational Newton Neural Network Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural network ensembles are powerful tools for uncertainty quantification, which have recently been re-interpreted from a Bayesian perspective. However, current methods inadequately leverage second-order information of the loss landscape, despite the recent availability of efficient Hessian approximations. We propose a novel approximate Bayesian inference method that modifies deep ensembles to incorporate Stein Variational Newton updates. Our approach uniquely integrates scalable modern Hessian approximations, achieving faster convergence and more accurate posterior distribution approximations. We validate the effectiveness of our method on diverse regression and classification tasks, demonstrating superior performance with a significantly reduced number of training epochs compared to existing ensemble-based methods, while enhancing uncertainty quantification and robustness against overfitting.</description>

      <title>Learning Controlled Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identification of nonlinear dynamical systems is crucial across various fields, facilitating tasks such as control, prediction, optimization, and fault detection. Many applications require methods capable of handling complex systems while providing strong learning guarantees for safe and reliable performance. However, existing approaches often focus on simplified scenarios, such as deterministic models, known diffusion, discrete systems, one-dimensional dynamics, or systems constrained by strong structural assumptions such as linearity. This work proposes a novel method for estimating both drift and diffusion coefficients of continuous, multidimensional, nonlinear controlled stochastic differential equations with non-uniform diffusion. We assume regularity of the coefficients within a Sobolev space, allowing for broad applicability to various dynamical systems in robotics, finance, climate modeling, and biology. Leveraging the Fokker-Planck equation, we split the estimation into two tasks: (a) estimating system dynamics for a finite set of controls, and (b) estimating coefficients that govern those dynamics. We provide strong theoretical guarantees, including finite-sample bounds for \(L^2\), \(L^\infty\), and risk metrics, with learning rates adaptive to coefficients' regularity, similar to those in nonparametric least-squares regression literature. The practical effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments. Our method is available as an open-source Python library.</description>

      <title>Amortized Bayesian Experimental Design for Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many critical decisions, such as personalized medical diagnoses and product pricing, are made based on insights gained from designing, observing, and analyzing a series of experiments. This highlights the crucial role of experimental design, which goes beyond merely collecting information on system parameters as in traditional Bayesian experimental design (BED), but also plays a key part in facilitating downstream decision-making. Most recent BED methods use an amortized policy network to rapidly design experiments. However, the information gathered through these methods is suboptimal for down-the-line decision-making, as the experiments are not inherently designed with downstream objectives in mind. In this paper, we present an amortized decision-aware BED framework that prioritizes maximizing downstream decision utility. We introduce a novel architecture, the Transformer Neural Decision Process (TNDP), capable of instantly proposing the next experimental design, whilst inferring the downstream decision, thus effectively amortizing both tasks within a unified workflow. We demonstrate the performance of our method across several tasks, showing that it can deliver informative designs and facilitate accurate decision-making.</description>

      <title>Encoding Multi-level Dynamics in Effect Heterogeneity Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth Observation (EO) data are increasingly used in policy analysis by enabling granular estimation of treatment effects. However, a challenge in EO-based causal inference lies in balancing the trade-off between capturing fine-grained individual heterogeneity and broader contextual information. This paper introduces Multi-scale Concatenation, a family of composable procedures that transform arbitrary single-scale CATE estimation algorithms into multi-scale algorithms. We benchmark the performance of Multi-scale Concatenation on a CATE estimation pipeline combining Vision Transformer (ViT) models fine-tuned on satellite images to encode images of different scales with Causal Forests to obtain the final CATE estimate. We first perform simulation studies, showing how a multi-scale approach captures multi-level dynamics that single-scale ViT models fail to capture. We then apply the multi-scale method to two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in Peru and Uganda using Landsat satellite imagery. In the RCT analysis, the Rank Average Treatment Effect Ratio (RATE Ratio) measure is employed to assess performance without ground truth individual treatment effects. Results indicate that Multi-scale Concatenation improves the performance of deep learning models in EO-based CATE estimation without the complexity of designing new multi-scale architectures for a specific use case.</description>

      <title>SpecRaGE: Robust and Generalizable Multi-view Spectral Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-view representation learning (MvRL) has garnered substantial attention in recent years, driven by the increasing demand for applications that can effectively process and analyze data from multiple sources. In this context, graph Laplacian-based MvRL methods have demonstrated remarkable success in representing multi-view data. However, these methods often struggle with generalization to new data and face challenges with scalability. Moreover, in many practical scenarios, multi-view data is contaminated by noise or outliers. In such cases, modern deep-learning-based MvRL approaches that rely on alignment or contrastive objectives can lead to misleading results, as they may impose incorrect consistency between clear and corrupted data sources. We introduce $\textit{SpecRaGE}$, a novel fusion-based framework that integrates the strengths of graph Laplacian methods with the power of deep learning to overcome these challenges. SpecRage uses neural networks to learn parametric mapping that approximates a joint diagonalization of graph Laplacians. This solution bypasses the need for alignment while enabling generalizable and scalable learning of informative and meaningful representations. Moreover, it incorporates a meta-learning fusion module that dynamically adapts to data quality, ensuring robustness against outliers and noisy views. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SpecRaGE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with data contamination, paving the way for more reliable and efficient multi-view learning. Our code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Double Descent Meets Out-of-Distribution Detection: Theoretical Insights and Empirical Analysis on the role of model complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While overparameterization is known to benefit generalization, its impact on Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection is less understood. This paper investigates the influence of model complexity in OOD detection. We propose an expected OOD risk metric to evaluate classifiers confidence on both training and OOD samples. Leveraging Random Matrix Theory, we derive bounds for the expected OOD risk of binary least-squares classifiers applied to Gaussian data. We show that the OOD risk depicts an infinite peak, when the number of parameters is equal to the number of samples, which we associate with the double descent phenomenon. Our experimental study on different OOD detection methods across multiple neural architectures extends our theoretical insights and highlights a double descent curve. Our observations suggest that overparameterization does not necessarily lead to better OOD detection. Using the Neural Collapse framework, we provide insights to better understand this behavior. To facilitate reproducibility, our code will be made publicly available upon publication.</description>

Abstract: General state-space models (SSMs) are widely used in statistical machine learning and are among the most classical generative models for sequential time-series data. SSMs, comprising latent Markovian states, can be subjected to variational inference (VI), but standard VI methods like the importance-weighted autoencoder (IWAE) lack functionality for streaming data. To enable online VI in SSMs when the observations are received in real time, we propose maximising an IWAE-type variational lower bound on the asymptotic contrast function, rather than the standard IWAE ELBO, using stochastic approximation. Unlike the recursive maximum likelihood method, which directly maximises the asymptotic contrast, our approach, called online sequential IWAE (OSIWAE), allows for online learning of both model parameters and a Markovian recognition model for inferring latent states. By approximating filter state posteriors and their derivatives using sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, we create a particle-based framework for online VI in SSMs. This approach is more theoretically well-founded than recently proposed online variational SMC methods. We provide rigorous theoretical results on the learning objective and a numerical study demonstrating the method's efficiency in learning model parameters and particle proposal kernels.</description>

      <title>Targeted Learning for Variable Importance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variable importance is one of the most widely used measures for interpreting machine learning with significant interest from both statistics and machine learning communities. Recently, increasing attention has been directed toward uncertainty quantification in these metrics. Current approaches largely rely on one-step procedures, which, while asymptotically efficient, can present higher sensitivity and instability in finite sample settings. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method by employing the targeted learning (TL) framework, designed to enhance robustness in inference for variable importance metrics. Our approach is particularly suited for conditional permutation variable importance. We show that it (i) retains the asymptotic efficiency of traditional methods, (ii) maintains comparable computational complexity, and (iii) delivers improved accuracy, especially in finite sample contexts. We further support these findings with numerical experiments that illustrate the practical advantages of our method and validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Variable Selection in Convex Piecewise Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents Sparse Gradient Descent as a solution for variable selection in convex piecewise linear regression where the model is given as $\mathrm{max}\langle a_j^\star, x \rangle + b_j^\star$ for $j = 1,\dots,k$ where $x \in \mathbb R^d$ is the covariate vector. Here, $\{a_j^\star\}_{j=1}^k$ and $\{b_j^\star\}_{j=1}^k$ denote the ground-truth weight vectors and intercepts. A non-asymptotic local convergence analysis is provided for Sp-GD under sub-Gaussian noise when the covariate distribution satisfies sub-Gaussianity and anti-concentration property. When the model order and parameters are fixed, Sp-GD provides an $\epsilon$-accurate estimate given $\mathcal{O}(\max(\epsilon^{-2}\sigma_z^2,1)s\log(d/s))$ observations where $\sigma_z^2$ denotes the noise variance. This also implies the exact parameter recovery by Sp-GD from $\mathcal{O}(s\log(d/s))$ noise-free observations. Since optimizing the squared loss for sparse max-affine is non-convex, an initialization scheme is proposed to provide a suitable initial estimate within the basin of attraction for Sp-GD, i.e. sufficiently accurate to invoke the convergence guarantees. The initialization scheme uses sparse principal component analysis to estimate the subspace spanned by $\{ a_j^\star\}_{j=1}^k$ then applies an $r$-covering search to estimate the model parameters. A non-asymptotic analysis is presented for this initialization scheme when the covariates and noise samples follow Gaussian distributions. When the model order and parameters are fixed, this initialization scheme provides an $\epsilon$-accurate estimate given $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2}\max(\sigma_z^4,\sigma_z^2,1)s^2\log^4(d))$ observations. Numerical Monte Carlo results corroborate theoretical findings for Sp-GD and the initialization scheme.</description>

      <title>Towards safe Bayesian optimization with Wiener kernel regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a data-driven strategy for minimizing/maximizing black-box functions based on probabilistic surrogate models. In the presence of safety constraints, the performance of BO crucially relies on tight probabilistic error bounds related to the uncertainty surrounding the surrogate model. For the case of Gaussian Process surrogates and Gaussian measurement noise, we present a novel error bound based on the recently proposed Wiener kernel regression. We prove that under rather mild assumptions, the proposed error bound is tighter than bounds previously documented in the literature which leads to enlarged safety regions. We draw upon a numerical example to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed error bound in safe BO.</description>

      <title>Linear Causal Bandits: Unknown Graph and Soft Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing causal bandit algorithms depends on two central categories of assumptions: (i) the extent of information about the underlying causal graphs and (ii) the extent of information about interventional statistical models. There have been extensive recent advances in dispensing with assumptions on either category. These include assuming known graphs but unknown interventional distributions, and the converse setting of assuming unknown graphs but access to restrictive hard/$\operatorname{do}$ interventions, which removes the stochasticity and ancestral dependencies. Nevertheless, the problem in its general form, i.e., unknown graph and unknown stochastic intervention models, remains open. This paper addresses this problem and establishes that in a graph with $N$ nodes, maximum in-degree $d$ and maximum causal path length $L$, after $T$ interaction rounds the regret upper bound scales as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}((cd)^{L-\frac{1}{2}}\sqrt{T} + d + RN)$ where $c&gt;1$ is a constant and $R$ is a measure of intervention power. A universal minimax lower bound is also established, which scales as $\Omega(d^{L-\frac{3}{2}}\sqrt{T})$. Importantly, the graph size $N$ has a diminishing effect on the regret as $T$ grows. These bounds have matching behavior in $T$, exponential dependence on $L$, and polynomial dependence on $d$ (with the gap $d\ $). On the algorithmic aspect, the paper presents a novel way of designing a computationally efficient CB algorithm, addressing a challenge that the existing CB algorithms using soft interventions face.</description>

      <title>CausAdv: A Causal-based Framework for Detecting Adversarial Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has led to tremendous success in many real-world applications of computer vision, thanks to sophisticated architectures such as Convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, CNNs have been shown to be vulnerable to crafted adversarial perturbations in inputs. These inputs appear almost indistinguishable from natural images, yet they are incorrectly classified by CNN architectures. This vulnerability of adversarial examples has led researchers to focus on enhancing the robustness of deep learning models in general, and CNNs in particular, by creating defense and detection methods to distinguish adversarials inputs from natural ones. In this paper, we address the adversarial robustness of CNNs through causal reasoning.
  We propose CausAdv: a causal framework for detecting adversarial examples based on counterfactual reasoning. CausAdv learns causal and non-causal features of every input, and quantifies the counterfactual information (CI) of every filter of the last convolutional layer. Then we perform statistical analysis on the filters CI of every sample, whether clan or adversarials, to demonstrate how adversarial examples indeed exhibit different CI distributions compared to clean samples. Our results show that causal reasoning enhances the process of adversarials detection without the need to train a separate detector. In addition, we illustrate the efficiency of causal explanations as a helpful detection technique through visualizing the causal features. The results can be reproduced using the code available in the repository: https://github.com/HichemDebbi/CausAdv.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Perspective for Speculative Decoding Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based autoregressive sampling has been the major bottleneck for slowing down large language model inferences. One effective way to accelerate inference is \emph{Speculative Decoding}, which employs a small model to sample a sequence of draft tokens and a large model to validate. Given its empirical effectiveness, the theoretical understanding of Speculative Decoding is falling behind. This paper tackles this gap by conceptualizing the decoding problem via markov chain abstraction and studying the key properties, \emph{output quality and inference acceleration}, from a theoretical perspective. Our analysis covers the theoretical limits of speculative decoding, batch algorithms, and output quality-inference acceleration tradeoffs. Our results reveal the fundamental connections between different components of LLMs via total variation distances and show how they jointly affect the efficiency of decoding algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal prediction is inherently uncertain, but representing the ambiguity in natural image sequences is a challenging high-dimensional probabilistic inference problem. For natural scenes, the curse of dimensionality renders explicit density estimation statistically and computationally intractable. Here, we describe an implicit regression-based framework for learning and sampling the conditional density of the next frame in a video given previous observed frames. We show that sequence-to-image deep networks trained on a simple resilience-to-noise objective function extract adaptive representations for temporal prediction. Synthetic experiments demonstrate that this score-based framework can handle occlusion boundaries: unlike classical methods that average over bifurcating temporal trajectories, it chooses among likely trajectories, selecting more probable options with higher frequency. Furthermore, analysis of networks trained on natural image sequences reveals that the representation automatically weights predictive evidence by its reliability, which is a hallmark of statistical inference</description>

      <title>Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Dependent Features: Additive Effects of Collinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) emerged to reveal the internal mechanism of machine learning models and how the features affect the prediction outcome. Collinearity is one of the big issues that XAI methods face when identifying the most informative features in the model. Current XAI approaches assume the features in the models are independent and calculate the effect of each feature toward model prediction independently from the rest of the features. However, such assumption is not realistic in real life applications. We propose an Additive Effects of Collinearity (AEC) as a novel XAI method that aim to considers the collinearity issue when it models the effect of each feature in the model on the outcome. AEC is based on the idea of dividing multivariate models into several univariate models in order to examine their impact on each other and consequently on the outcome. The proposed method is implemented using simulated and real data to validate its efficiency comparing with the a state of arts XAI method. The results indicate that AEC is more robust and stable against the impact of collinearity when it explains AI models compared with the state of arts XAI method.</description>

      <title>Automatic feature selection and weighting using Differentiable Information Imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feature selection is a common process in many applications, but it is accompanied by uncertainties such as: What is the optimal dimensionality of an interpretable, reduced feature space to retain a maximum amount of information? How to account for different units of measure in features? How to weight different features according to their importance? To address these challenges, we introduce the Differentiable Information Imbalance (DII), an automatic data analysis method to rank information content between sets of features. Based on the nearest neighbors according to distances in the ground truth feature space, the method finds a low-dimensional subset of the input features, within which the pairwise distance relations are most similar to the ground truth. By employing the Differentiable Information Imbalance as a loss function, the relative feature weights of the inputs are optimized, simultaneously performing unit alignment and relative importance scaling, while preserving interpretability. Furthermore, this method can generate sparse solutions and determine the optimal size of the reduced feature space. We illustrate the usefulness of this approach on two prototypical benchmark problems: (1) Identifying a small set of collective variables capable of describing the conformational space of a biomolecule, and (2) selecting a subset of features for training a machine-learning force field. The results highlight the potential of the Differentiable Information Imbalance in addressing feature selection challenges and optimizing dimensionality in various applications. The method is implemented in the Python library DADApy.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Scale: The Efficacy of Fine-Tuned Open-Source LLMs in Large-Scale Reproducible Social Science Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are distinguished by their architecture, which dictates their parameter size and performance capabilities. Social scientists have increasingly adopted LLMs for text classification tasks, which are difficult to scale with human coders. While very large, closed-source models often deliver superior performance, their use presents significant risks. These include lack of transparency, potential exposure of sensitive data, challenges to replicability, and dependence on proprietary systems. Additionally, their high costs make them impractical for large-scale research projects.
  In contrast, open-source models, although available in various sizes, may underperform compared to commercial alternatives if used without further fine-tuning. However, open-source models offer distinct advantages: they can be run locally (ensuring data privacy), fine-tuned for specific tasks, shared within the research community, and integrated into reproducible workflows.
  This study demonstrates that small, fine-tuned open-source LLMs can achieve equal or superior performance to models such as ChatGPT-4. We further explore the relationship between training set size and fine-tuning efficacy in open-source models. Finally, we propose a hybrid workflow that leverages the strengths of both open and closed models, offering a balanced approach to performance, transparency, and reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Lung tumor segmentation in MRI mice scans using 3D nnU-Net with minimum annotations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In drug discovery, accurate lung tumor segmentation is an important step for assessing tumor size and its progression using \textit{in-vivo} imaging such as MRI. While deep learning models have been developed to automate this process, the focus has predominantly been on human subjects, neglecting the pivotal role of animal models in pre-clinical drug development. In this work, we focus on optimizing lung tumor segmentation in mice. First, we demonstrate that the nnU-Net model outperforms the U-Net, U-Net3+, and DeepMeta models. Most importantly, we achieve better results with nnU-Net 3D models than 2D models, indicating the importance of spatial context for segmentation tasks in MRI mice scans. This study demonstrates the importance of 3D input over 2D input images for lung tumor segmentation in MRI scans. Finally, we outperform the prior state-of-the-art approach that involves the combined segmentation of lungs and tumors within the lungs. Our work achieves comparable results using only lung tumor annotations requiring fewer annotations, saving time and annotation efforts. This work\footnote{\url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/lung-tumour-mice-mri-64BB}} is an important step in automating pre-clinical animal studies to quantify the efficacy of experimental drugs, particularly in assessing tumor changes.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Causal Message Passing for Experimentation with Complex Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of treatment effects is essential for decision-making across various scientific fields. This task, however, becomes challenging in areas like social sciences and online marketplaces, where treating one experimental unit can influence outcomes for others through direct or indirect interactions. Such interference can lead to biased treatment effect estimates, particularly when the structure of these interactions is unknown. We address this challenge by introducing a new class of estimators based on causal message-passing, specifically designed for settings with pervasive, unknown interference. Our estimator draws on information from the sample mean and variance of unit outcomes and treatments over time, enabling efficient use of observed data to estimate the evolution of the system state. Concretely, we construct non-linear features from the moments of unit outcomes and treatments and then learn a function that maps these features to future mean and variance of unit outcomes. This allows for the estimation of the treatment effect over time. Extensive simulations across multiple domains, using synthetic and real network data, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in estimating total treatment effect dynamics, even in cases where interference exhibits non-monotonic behavior in the probability of treatment.</description>

      <title>A Semiparametric Approach to Causal Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In causal inference, an important problem is to quantify the effects of interventions or treatments. Many studies focus on estimating the mean causal effects; however, these estimands may offer limited insight since two distributions can share the same mean yet exhibit significant differences. Examining the causal effects from a distributional perspective provides a more thorough understanding. In this paper, we employ a semiparametric density ratio model (DRM) to characterize the counterfactual distributions, introducing a framework that assumes a latent structure shared by these distributions. Our model offers flexibility by avoiding strict parametric assumptions on the counterfactual distributions. Specifically, the DRM incorporates a nonparametric component that can be estimated through the method of empirical likelihood (EL), using the data from all the groups stemming from multiple interventions. Consequently, the EL-DRM framework enables inference of the counterfactual distribution functions and their functionals, facilitating direct and transparent causal inference from a distributional perspective. Numerical studies on both synthetic and real-world data validate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

Abstract: Per-example gradient norms are a vital ingredient for estimating gradient noise scale (GNS) with minimal variance. Observing the tensor contractions required to compute them, we propose a method with minimal FLOPs in 3D or greater tensor regimes by simultaneously computing the norms while computing the parameter gradients. Using this method we are able to observe the GNS of different layers at higher accuracy than previously possible. We find that the total GNS of contemporary transformer models is predicted well by the GNS of only the normalization layers. As a result, focusing only on the normalization layer, we develop a custom kernel to compute the per-example gradient norms while performing the LayerNorm backward pass with zero throughput overhead. Tracking GNS on only those layers, we are able to guide a practical batch size schedule that reduces training time by 18% on a Chinchilla-optimal language model.</description>

      <title>Abstracted Shapes as Tokens -- A Generalizable and Interpretable Model for Time-series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In time-series analysis, many recent works seek to provide a unified view and representation for time-series across multiple domains, leading to the development of foundation models for time-series data. Despite diverse modeling techniques, existing models are black boxes and fail to provide insights and explanations about their representations. In this paper, we present VQShape, a pre-trained, generalizable, and interpretable model for time-series representation learning and classification. By introducing a novel representation for time-series data, we forge a connection between the latent space of VQShape and shape-level features. Using vector quantization, we show that time-series from different domains can be described using a unified set of low-dimensional codes, where each code can be represented as an abstracted shape in the time domain. On classification tasks, we show that the representations of VQShape can be utilized to build interpretable classifiers, achieving comparable performance to specialist models. Additionally, in zero-shot learning, VQShape and its codebook can generalize to previously unseen datasets and domains that are not included in the pre-training process. The code and pre-trained weights are available at https://github.com/YunshiWen/VQShape.</description>

      <title>Computation-Aware Gaussian Processes: Model Selection And Linear-Time Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model selection in Gaussian processes scales prohibitively with the size of the training dataset, both in time and memory. While many approximations exist, all incur inevitable approximation error. Recent work accounts for this error in the form of computational uncertainty, which enables -- at the cost of quadratic complexity -- an explicit tradeoff between computation and precision. Here we extend this development to model selection, which requires significant enhancements to the existing approach, including linear-time scaling in the size of the dataset. We propose a novel training loss for hyperparameter optimization and demonstrate empirically that the resulting method can outperform SGPR, CGGP and SVGP, state-of-the-art methods for GP model selection, on medium to large-scale datasets. Our experiments show that model selection for computation-aware GPs trained on 1.8 million data points can be done within a few hours on a single GPU. As a result of this work, Gaussian processes can be trained on large-scale datasets without significantly compromising their ability to quantify uncertainty -- a fundamental prerequisite for optimal decision-making.</description>

      <title>Contrasting with Symile: Simple Model-Agnostic Representation Learning for Unlimited Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, leverage naturally paired data-for example, images and their corresponding text captions-to learn general representations that transfer efficiently to downstream tasks. While such approaches are generally applied to two modalities, domains such as robotics, healthcare, and video need to support many types of data at once. We show that the pairwise application of CLIP fails to capture joint information between modalities, thereby limiting the quality of the learned representations. To address this issue, we present Symile, a simple contrastive learning approach that captures higher-order information between any number of modalities. Symile provides a flexible, architecture-agnostic objective for learning modality-specific representations. To develop Symile's objective, we derive a lower bound on total correlation, and show that Symile representations for any set of modalities form a sufficient statistic for predicting the remaining modalities. Symile outperforms pairwise CLIP, even with modalities missing in the data, on cross-modal classification and retrieval across several experiments including on an original multilingual dataset of 33M image, text and audio samples and a clinical dataset of chest X-rays, electrocardiograms, and laboratory measurements. All datasets and code used in this work are publicly available at https://github.com/rajesh-lab/symile.</description>

      <title>An unified approach to link prediction in collaboration networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates and compares three approaches to link prediction in colaboration networks, namely, an ERGM (Exponential Random Graph Model; Robins et al. 2007), a GCN (Graph Convolutional Network; Kipf and Welling 2017), and a Word2Vec+MLP model (Word2Vec model combined with a multilayer neural network; Mikolov et al. 2013a and Goodfellow et al. 2016). The ERGM, grounded in statistical methods, is employed to capture general structural patterns within the network, while the GCN and Word2Vec+MLP models leverage deep learning techniques to learn adaptive structural representations of nodes and their relationships. The predictive performance of the models is assessed through extensive simulation exercises using cross-validation, with metrics based on the receiver operating characteristic curve. The results clearly show the superiority of machine learning approaches in link prediction, particularly in large networks, where traditional models such as ERGM exhibit limitations in scalability and the ability to capture inherent complexities. These findings highlight the potential benefits of integrating statistical modeling techniques with deep learning methods to analyze complex networks, providing a more robust and effective framework for future research in this field.</description>

      <title>Relax and Merge: A Simple Yet Effective Framework for Solving Fair $k$-Means and $k$-sparse Wasserstein Barycenter Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fairness of clustering algorithms has gained widespread attention across various areas, including machine learning, In this paper, we study fair $k$-means clustering in Euclidean space. Given a dataset comprising several groups, the fairness constraint requires that each cluster should contain a proportion of points from each group within specified lower and upper bounds. Due to these fairness constraints, determining the optimal locations of $k$ centers is a quite challenging task. We propose a novel ``Relax and Merge'' framework that returns a $(1+4\rho + O(\epsilon))$-approximate solution, where $\rho$ is the approximate ratio of an off-the-shelf vanilla $k$-means algorithm and $O(\epsilon)$ can be an arbitrarily small positive number. If equipped with a PTAS of $k$-means, our solution can achieve an approximation ratio of $(5+O(\epsilon))$ with only a slight violation of the fairness constraints, which improves the current state-of-the-art approximation guarantee. Furthermore, using our framework, we can also obtain a $(1+4\rho +O(\epsilon))$-approximate solution for the $k$-sparse Wasserstein Barycenter problem, which is a fundamental optimization problem in the field of optimal transport, and a $(2+6\rho)$-approximate solution for the strictly fair $k$-means clustering with no violation, both of which are better than the current state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the empirical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can significantly outperform baseline approaches in terms of clustering cost.</description>

      <title>Axiomatic Explainer Globalness via Optimal Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainability methods are often challenging to evaluate and compare. With a multitude of explainers available, practitioners must often compare and select explainers based on quantitative evaluation metrics. One particular differentiator between explainers is the diversity of explanations for a given dataset; i.e. whether all explanations are identical, unique and uniformly distributed, or somewhere between these two extremes. In this work, we define a complexity measure for explainers, globalness, which enables deeper understanding of the distribution of explanations produced by feature attribution and feature selection methods for a given dataset. We establish the axiomatic properties that any such measure should possess and prove that our proposed measure, Wasserstein Globalness, meets these criteria. We validate the utility of Wasserstein Globalness using image, tabular, and synthetic datasets, empirically showing that it both facilitates meaningful comparison between explainers and improves the selection process for explainability methods.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning with Differentially Private Hyperdimensional Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is essential for efficient data exchange in Internet of Things (IoT) environments, as it trains Machine Learning (ML) models locally and shares only model updates. However, FL is vulnerable to privacy threats like model inversion and membership inference attacks, which can expose sensitive training data. To address these privacy concerns, Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms are often applied. Yet, adding DP noise to black-box ML models degrades performance, especially in dynamic IoT systems where continuous, lifelong FL learning accumulates excessive noise over time. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Federated HyperDimensional computing with Privacy-preserving (FedHDPrivacy), an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) framework that combines the neuro-symbolic paradigm with DP. FedHDPrivacy carefully manages the balance between privacy and performance by theoretically tracking cumulative noise from previous rounds and adding only the necessary incremental noise to meet privacy requirements. In a real-world case study involving in-process monitoring of manufacturing machining operations, FedHDPrivacy demonstrates robust performance, outperforming standard FL frameworks-including Federated Averaging (FedAvg), Federated Stochastic Gradient Descent (FedSGD), Federated Proximal (FedProx), Federated Normalized Averaging (FedNova), and Federated Adam (FedAdam)-by up to 38%. FedHDPrivacy also shows potential for future enhancements, such as multimodal data fusion.</description>

      <title>XNB: Explainable Class-Specific NaIve-Bayes Classifier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In today's data-intensive landscape, where high-dimensional datasets are increasingly common, reducing the number of input features is essential to prevent overfitting and improve model accuracy. Despite numerous efforts to tackle dimensionality reduction, most approaches apply a universal set of features across all classes, potentially missing the unique characteristics of individual classes. This paper presents the Explainable Class-Specific Naive Bayes (XNB) classifier, which introduces two critical innovations: 1) the use of Kernel Density Estimation to calculate posterior probabilities, allowing for a more accurate and flexible estimation process, and 2) the selection of class-specific feature subsets, ensuring that only the most relevant variables for each class are utilized. Extensive empirical analysis on high-dimensional genomic datasets shows that XNB matches the classification performance of traditional Naive Bayes while drastically improving model interpretability. By isolating the most relevant features for each class, XNB not only reduces the feature set to a minimal, distinct subset for each class but also provides deeper insights into how the model makes predictions. This approach offers significant advantages in fields where both precision and explainability are critical.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical and Density-based Causal Clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding treatment effect heterogeneity is vital for scientific and policy research. However, identifying and evaluating heterogeneous treatment effects pose significant challenges due to the typically unknown subgroup structure. Recently, a novel approach, causal k-means clustering, has emerged to assess heterogeneity of treatment effect by applying the k-means algorithm to unknown counterfactual regression functions. In this paper, we expand upon this framework by integrating hierarchical and density-based clustering algorithms. We propose plug-in estimators that are simple and readily implementable using off-the-shelf algorithms. Unlike k-means clustering, which requires the margin condition, our proposed estimators do not rely on strong structural assumptions on the outcome process. We go on to study their rate of convergence, and show that under the minimal regularity conditions, the additional cost of causal clustering is essentially the estimation error of the outcome regression functions. Our findings significantly extend the capabilities of the causal clustering framework, thereby contributing to the progression of methodologies for identifying homogeneous subgroups in treatment response, consequently facilitating more nuanced and targeted interventions. The proposed methods also open up new avenues for clustering with generic pseudo-outcomes. We explore finite sample properties via simulation, and illustrate the proposed methods in voting and employment projection datasets.</description>

      <title>Conformalized High-Density Quantile Regression via Dynamic Prototypes-based Probability Density Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent methods in quantile regression have adopted a classification perspective to handle challenges posed by heteroscedastic, multimodal, or skewed data by quantizing outputs into fixed bins. Although these regression-as-classification frameworks can capture high-density prediction regions and bypass convex quantile constraints, they are restricted by quantization errors and the curse of dimensionality due to a constant number of bins per dimension. To address these limitations, we introduce a conformalized high-density quantile regression approach with a dynamically adaptive set of prototypes. Our method optimizes the set of prototypes by adaptively adding, deleting, and relocating quantization bins throughout the training process. Moreover, our conformal scheme provides valid coverage guarantees, focusing on regions with the highest probability density. Experiments across diverse datasets and dimensionalities confirm that our method consistently achieves high-quality prediction regions with enhanced coverage and robustness, all while utilizing fewer prototypes and memory, ensuring scalability to higher dimensions.

      <description>arXiv:2411.01267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of spatiotemporal data remains challenging due to complex spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics. The inherent uncertainty and variability in such data often render deterministic models insufficient, prompting a shift towards probabilistic approaches, where diffusion-based generative models have emerged as effective solutions. In this paper, we present ProGen, a novel framework for probabilistic spatiotemporal time series forecasting that leverages Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) and diffusion-based generative modeling techniques in the continuous domain. By integrating a novel denoising score model, graph neural networks, and a tailored SDE, ProGen provides a robust solution that effectively captures spatiotemporal dependencies while managing uncertainty. Our extensive experiments on four benchmark traffic datasets demonstrate that ProGen outperforms state-of-the-art deterministic and probabilistic models. This work contributes a continuous, diffusion-based generative approach to spatiotemporal forecasting, paving the way for future research in probabilistic modeling and stochastic processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image Quality of MRI brain scans is strongly influenced by within scanner head movements and the resulting image artifacts alter derived measures like brain volume and cortical thickness. Automated image quality assessment is key to controlling for confounding effects of poor image quality. In this study, we systematically test for the influence of image quality on univariate statistics and machine learning classification. We analyzed group effects of sex/gender on local brain volume and made predictions of sex/gender using logistic regression, while correcting for brain size. From three large publicly available datasets, two age and sex-balanced samples were derived to test the generalizability of the effect for pooled sample sizes of n=760 and n=1094. Results of the Bonferroni corrected t-tests over 3747 gray matter features showed a strong influence of low-quality data on the ability to find significant sex/gender differences for the smaller sample. Increasing sample size and more so image quality showed a stark increase in detecting significant effects in univariate group comparisons. For the classification of sex/gender using logistic regression, both increasing sample size and image quality had a marginal effect on the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve for most datasets and subsamples. Our results suggest a more stringent quality control for univariate approaches than for multivariate classification with a leaning towards higher quality for classical group statistics and bigger sample sizes for machine learning applications in neuroimaging.</description>

      <title>Marginal Causal Flows for Validation and Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigating the marginal causal effect of an intervention on an outcome from complex data remains challenging due to the inflexibility of employed models and the lack of complexity in causal benchmark datasets, which often fail to reproduce intricate real-world data patterns. In this paper we introduce Frugal Flows, a novel likelihood-based machine learning model that uses normalising flows to flexibly learn the data-generating process, while also directly inferring the marginal causal quantities from observational data. We propose that these models are exceptionally well suited for generating synthetic data to validate causal methods. They can create synthetic datasets that closely resemble the empirical dataset, while automatically and exactly satisfying a user-defined average treatment effect. To our knowledge, Frugal Flows are the first generative model to both learn flexible data representations and also exactly parameterise quantities such as the average treatment effect and the degree of unobserved confounding.

      <description>arXiv:2411.01322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce FEET, a standardized protocol designed to guide the development and benchmarking of foundation models. While numerous benchmark datasets exist for evaluating these models, we propose a structured evaluation protocol across three distinct scenarios to gain a comprehensive understanding of their practical performance. We define three primary use cases: frozen embeddings, few-shot embeddings, and fully fine-tuned embeddings. Each scenario is detailed and illustrated through two case studies: one in sentiment analysis and another in the medical domain, demonstrating how these evaluations provide a thorough assessment of foundation models' effectiveness in research applications. We recommend this protocol as a standard for future research aimed at advancing representation learning models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized eigenvalue problems (GEPs) find applications in various fields of science and engineering. For example, principal component analysis, Fisher's discriminant analysis, and canonical correlation analysis are specific instances of GEPs and are widely used in statistical data processing. In this work, we study GEPs under generative priors, assuming that the underlying leading generalized eigenvector lies within the range of a Lipschitz continuous generative model. Under appropriate conditions, we show that any optimal solution to the corresponding optimization problems attains the optimal statistical rate. Moreover, from a computational perspective, we propose an iterative algorithm called the Projected Rayleigh Flow Method (PRFM) to approximate the optimal solution. We theoretically demonstrate that under suitable assumptions, PRFM converges linearly to an estimated vector that achieves the optimal statistical rate. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>The Implicit Bias of Gradient Descent on Separable Multiclass Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implicit bias describes the phenomenon where optimization-based training algorithms, without explicit regularization, show a preference for simple estimators even when more complex estimators have equal objective values. Multiple works have developed the theory of implicit bias for binary classification under the assumption that the loss satisfies an exponential tail property. However, there is a noticeable gap in analysis for multiclass classification, with only a handful of results which themselves are restricted to the cross-entropy loss. In this work, we employ the framework of Permutation Equivariant and Relative Margin-based (PERM) losses [Wang and Scott, 2024] to introduce a multiclass extension of the exponential tail property. This class of losses includes not only cross-entropy but also other losses. Using this framework, we extend the implicit bias result of Soudry et al. [2018] to multiclass classification. Furthermore, our proof techniques closely mirror those of the binary case, thus illustrating the power of the PERM framework for bridging the binary-multiclass gap.</description>

      <title>Network Causal Effect Estimation In Graphical Models Of Contagion And Latent Confounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key question in many network studies is whether the observed correlations between units are primarily due to contagion or latent confounding. Here, we study this question using a segregated graph (Shpitser, 2015) representation of these mechanisms, and examine how uncertainty about the true underlying mechanism impacts downstream computation of network causal effects, particularly under full interference -- settings where we only have a single realization of a network and each unit may depend on any other unit in the network. Under certain assumptions about asymptotic growth of the network, we derive likelihood ratio tests that can be used to identify whether different sets of variables -- confounders, treatments, and outcomes -- across units exhibit dependence due to contagion or latent confounding. We then propose network causal effect estimation strategies that provide unbiased and consistent estimates if the dependence mechanisms are either known or correctly inferred using our proposed tests. Together, the proposed methods allow network effect estimation in a wider range of full interference scenarios that have not been considered in prior work. We evaluate the effectiveness of our methods with synthetic data and the validity of our assumptions using real-world networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the educational effect of the Academic Support Center at Kogakuin University. Following the initial assessment, it was suggested that group bias had led to an underestimation of the Center's true impact. To address this issue, the authors applied the theory of causal inference. By using T-learner, the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) of the Center's face-to-face (F2F) personal assistance program was evaluated. Extending T-learner, the authors produced a new CATE function that depends on the number of treatments (F2F sessions) and used the estimated function to predict the CATE performance of F2F assistance.</description>

      <title>G-SPARC: SPectral ARchitectures tackling the Cold-start problem in Graph learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphs play a central role in modeling complex relationships across various domains. Most graph learning methods rely heavily on neighborhood information, raising the question of how to handle cold-start nodes - nodes with no known connections within the graph. These models often overlook the cold-start nodes, making them ineffective for real-world scenarios. To tackle this, we propose G-SPARC, a novel framework addressing cold-start nodes, that leverages generalizable spectral embedding. This framework enables extension to state-of-the-art methods making them suitable for practical applications. By utilizing a key idea of transitioning from graph representation to spectral representation, our approach is generalizable to cold-start nodes, capturing the global structure of the graph without relying on adjacency data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing models on cold-start nodes across various tasks like node classification, node clustering, and link prediction. G-SPARC provides a breakthrough built-in solution to the cold-start problem in graph learning. Our code will be publicly available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Conformal Inference by Particle Filtering under Hidden Markov Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal inference is a statistical method used to construct prediction sets for point predictors, providing reliable uncertainty quantification with probability guarantees. This method utilizes historical labeled data to estimate the conformity or nonconformity between predictions and true labels. However, conducting conformal inference for hidden states under hidden Markov models (HMMs) presents a significant challenge, as the hidden state data is unavailable, resulting in the absence of a true label set to serve as a conformal calibration set. This paper proposes an adaptive conformal inference framework that leverages a particle filtering approach to address this issue. Rather than directly focusing on the unobservable hidden state, we innovatively use weighted particles as an approximation of the actual posterior distribution of the hidden state. Our goal is to produce prediction sets that encompass these particles to achieve a specific aggregate weight sum, referred to as the aggregated coverage level. The proposed framework can adapt online to the time-varying distribution of data and achieve the defined marginal aggregated coverage level in both one-step and multi-step inference over the long term. We verify the effectiveness of this approach through a real-time target localization simulation study.</description>

      <title>Statistical guarantees for denoising reflected diffusion models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, denoising diffusion models have become a crucial area of research due to their abundance in the rapidly expanding field of generative AI. While recent statistical advances have delivered explanations for the generation ability of idealised denoising diffusion models for high-dimensional target data, implementations introduce thresholding procedures for the generating process to overcome issues arising from the unbounded state space of such models. This mismatch between theoretical design and implementation of diffusion models has been addressed empirically by using a \emph{reflected} diffusion process as the driver of noise instead. In this paper, we study statistical guarantees of these denoising reflected diffusion models. In particular, we establish minimax optimal rates of convergence in total variation, up to a polylogarithmic factor, under Sobolev smoothness assumptions. Our main contributions include the statistical analysis of this novel class of denoising reflected diffusion models and a refined score approximation method in both time and space, leveraging spectral decomposition and rigorous neural network analysis.</description>

      <title>Online Graph Learning via Time-Vertex Adaptive Filters: From Theory to Cardiac Fibrillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Signal Processing (GSP) provides a powerful framework for analysing complex, interconnected systems by modelling data as signals on graphs. Recent advances in GSP have enabled the learning of graph structures from observed signals, but these methods often struggle with time-varying systems and real-time applications. Adaptive filtering techniques, while effective for online learning, have seen limited application in graph topology estimation from a GSP perspective. To this end, we introduce AdaCGP, an online algorithm for adaptive estimation of the Graph Shift Operator (GSO) from multivariate time series. The GSO is estimated from an adaptive time-vertex autoregressive model through recursive update formulae designed to address sparsity, shift-invariance and bias. Through simulations, we show that AdaCGP performs consistently well across various graph topologies, and achieves improvements in excess of 82% for GSO estimation compared to baseline adaptive vector autoregressive models. In addition, our online variable splitting approach for enforcing sparsity enables near-perfect precision in identifying causal connections while maintaining low false positive rates upon optimisation of the forecast error. Finally, AdaCGP's ability to track changes in graph structure is demonstrated on recordings of ventricular fibrillation dynamics in response to an anti-arrhythmic drug. AdaCGP is shown to be able to identify the stability of critical conduction patterns that may be maintaining the arrhythmia in an intuitive way, together with its potential to support diagnosis and treatment strategies.</description>

      <title>Multiclass Transductive Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of multiclass transductive online learning when the number of labels can be unbounded. Previous works by Ben-David et al. [1997] and Hanneke et al. [2023b] only consider the case of binary and finite label spaces, respectively. The latter work determined that their techniques fail to extend to the case of unbounded label spaces, and they pose the question of characterizing the optimal mistake bound for unbounded label spaces. We answer this question by showing that a new dimension, termed the Level-constrained Littlestone dimension, characterizes online learnability in this setting. Along the way, we show that the trichotomy of possible minimax rates of the expected number of mistakes established by Hanneke et al. [2023b] for finite label spaces in the realizable setting continues to hold even when the label space is unbounded. In particular, if the learner plays for $T \in \mathbb{N}$ rounds, its minimax expected number of mistakes can only grow like $\Theta(T)$, $\Theta(\log T)$, or $\Theta(1)$. To prove this result, we give another combinatorial dimension, termed the Level-constrained Branching dimension, and show that its finiteness characterizes constant minimax expected mistake-bounds. The trichotomy is then determined by a combination of the Level-constrained Littlestone and Branching dimensions. Quantitatively, our upper bounds improve upon existing multiclass upper bounds in Hanneke et al. [2023b] by removing the dependence on the label set size. In doing so, we explicitly construct learning algorithms that can handle extremely large or unbounded label spaces. A key and novel component of our algorithm is a new notion of shattering that exploits the sequential nature of transductive online learning. Finally, we complete our results by proving expected regret bounds in the agnostic setting, extending the result of Hanneke et al. [2023b].</description>

      <title>Conformal Risk Minimization with Variance Reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a distribution-free framework for achieving probabilistic guarantees on black-box models. CP is generally applied to a model post-training. Recent research efforts, on the other hand, have focused on optimizing CP efficiency during training. We formalize this concept as the problem of conformal risk minimization (CRM). In this direction, conformal training (ConfTr) by Stutz et al.(2022) is a technique that seeks to minimize the expected prediction set size of a model by simulating CP in-between training updates. Despite its potential, we identify a strong source of sample inefficiency in ConfTr that leads to overly noisy estimated gradients, introducing training instability and limiting practical use. To address this challenge, we propose variance-reduced conformal training (VR-ConfTr), a CRM method that incorporates a variance reduction technique in the gradient estimation of the ConfTr objective function. Through extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that VR-ConfTr consistently achieves faster convergence and smaller prediction sets compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>A General Recipe for Contractive Graph Neural Networks -- Technical Report</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained significant popularity for learning representations of graph-structured data due to their expressive power and scalability. However, despite their success in domains such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and bioinformatics, GNNs often face challenges related to stability, generalization, and robustness to noise and adversarial attacks. Regularization techniques have shown promise in addressing these challenges by controlling model complexity and improving robustness. Building on recent advancements in contractive GNN architectures, this paper presents a novel method for inducing contractive behavior in any GNN through SVD regularization. By deriving a sufficient condition for contractiveness in the update step and applying constraints on network parameters, we demonstrate the impact of SVD regularization on the Lipschitz constant of GNNs. Our findings highlight the role of SVD regularization in enhancing the stability and generalization of GNNs, contributing to the development of more robust graph-based learning algorithms dynamics.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Spurious Correlations via Disagreement Probability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models trained with empirical risk minimization (ERM) are prone to be biased towards spurious correlations between target labels and bias attributes, which leads to poor performance on data groups lacking spurious correlations. It is particularly challenging to address this problem when access to bias labels is not permitted. To mitigate the effect of spurious correlations without bias labels, we first introduce a novel training objective designed to robustly enhance model performance across all data samples, irrespective of the presence of spurious correlations. From this objective, we then derive a debiasing method, Disagreement Probability based Resampling for debiasing (DPR), which does not require bias labels. DPR leverages the disagreement between the target label and the prediction of a biased model to identify bias-conflicting samples-those without spurious correlations-and upsamples them according to the disagreement probability. Empirical evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DPR achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing baselines that do not use bias labels. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis that details how DPR reduces dependency on spurious correlations.</description>

      <title>Clustering Based on Density Propagation and Subcluster Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the DPSM method, a density-based node clustering approach that automatically determines the number of clusters and can be applied in both data space and graph space. Unlike traditional density-based clustering methods, which necessitate calculating the distance between any two nodes, our proposed technique determines density through a propagation process, thereby making it suitable for a graph space. In DPSM, nodes are partitioned into small clusters based on propagated density. The partitioning technique has been proved to be sound and complete. We then extend the concept of spectral clustering from individual nodes to these small clusters, while introducing the CluCut measure to guide cluster merging. This measure is modified in various ways to account for cluster properties, thus provides guidance on when to terminate the merging process. Various experiments have validated the effectiveness of DOSM and the accuracy of these conclusions.</description>

      <title>Fixing the Loose Brake: Exponential-Tailed Stopping Time in Best Arm Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The best arm identification problem requires identifying the best alternative (i.e., arm) in active experimentation using the smallest number of experiments (i.e., arm pulls), which is crucial for cost-efficient and timely decision-making processes. In the fixed confidence setting, an algorithm must stop data-dependently and return the estimated best arm with a correctness guarantee. Since this stopping time is random, we desire its distribution to have light tails. Unfortunately, many existing studies focus on high probability or in expectation bounds on the stopping time, which allow heavy tails and, for high probability bounds, even not stopping at all. We first prove that this never-stopping event can indeed happen for some popular algorithms. Motivated by this, we propose algorithms that provably enjoy an exponential-tailed stopping time, which improves upon the polynomial tail bound reported by Kalyanakrishnan et al. (2012). The first algorithm is based on a fixed budget algorithm called Sequential Halving along with a doubling trick. The second algorithm is a meta algorithm that takes in any fixed confidence algorithm with a high probability stopping guarantee and turns it into one that enjoys an exponential-tailed stopping time. Our results imply that there is much more to be desired for contemporary fixed confidence algorithms.</description>

      <title>Risk-sensitive control as inference with R\'enyi divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the risk-sensitive control as inference (RCaI) that extends CaI by using R\'{e}nyi divergence variational inference. RCaI is shown to be equivalent to log-probability regularized risk-sensitive control, which is an extension of the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) control. We also prove that the risk-sensitive optimal policy can be obtained by solving a soft Bellman equation, which reveals several equivalences between RCaI, MaxEnt control, the optimal posterior for CaI, and linearly-solvable control. Moreover, based on RCaI, we derive the risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL) methods: the policy gradient and the soft actor-critic. As the risk-sensitivity parameter vanishes, we recover the risk-neutral CaI and RL, which means that RCaI is a unifying framework. Furthermore, we give another risk-sensitive generalization of the MaxEnt control using R\'{e}nyi entropy regularization. We show that in both of our extensions, the optimal policies have the same structure even though the derivations are very different.</description>

      <title>OwMatch: Conditional Self-Labeling with Consistency for Open-World Semi-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) offers a robust framework for harnessing the potential of unannotated data. Traditionally, SSL mandates that all classes possess labeled instances. However, the emergence of open-world SSL (OwSSL) introduces a more practical challenge, wherein unlabeled data may encompass samples from unseen classes. This scenario leads to misclassification of unseen classes as known ones, consequently undermining classification accuracy. To overcome this challenge, this study revisits two methodologies from self-supervised and semi-supervised learning, self-labeling and consistency, tailoring them to address the OwSSL problem. Specifically, we propose an effective framework called OwMatch, combining conditional self-labeling and open-world hierarchical thresholding. Theoretically, we analyze the estimation of class distribution on unlabeled data through rigorous statistical analysis, thus demonstrating that OwMatch can ensure the unbiasedness of the self-label assignment estimator with reliability. Comprehensive empirical analyses demonstrate that our method yields substantial performance enhancements across both known and unknown classes in comparison to previous studies.

      <title>ElasTST: Towards Robust Varied-Horizon Forecasting with Elastic Time-Series Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous industrial sectors necessitate models capable of providing robust forecasts across various horizons. Despite the recent strides in crafting specific architectures for time-series forecasting and developing pre-trained universal models, a comprehensive examination of their capability in accommodating varied-horizon forecasting during inference is still lacking. This paper bridges this gap through the design and evaluation of the Elastic Time-Series Transformer (ElasTST). The ElasTST model incorporates a non-autoregressive design with placeholders and structured self-attention masks, warranting future outputs that are invariant to adjustments in inference horizons. A tunable version of rotary position embedding is also integrated into ElasTST to capture time-series-specific periods and enhance adaptability to different horizons. Additionally, ElasTST employs a multi-scale patch design, effectively integrating both fine-grained and coarse-grained information. During the training phase, ElasTST uses a horizon reweighting strategy that approximates the effect of random sampling across multiple horizons with a single fixed horizon setting. Through comprehensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art time-series architectures and contemporary foundation models, we demonstrate the efficacy of ElasTST's unique design elements. Our findings position ElasTST as a robust solution for the practical necessity of varied-horizon forecasting.</description>

      <title>Differentially private and decentralized randomized power method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The randomized power method has gained significant interest due to its simplicity and efficient handling of large-scale spectral analysis and recommendation tasks. As modern datasets contain sensitive private information, we need to give formal guarantees on the possible privacy leaks caused by this method. This paper focuses on enhancing privacy preserving variants of the method. We propose a strategy to reduce the variance of the noise introduced to achieve Differential Privacy (DP). We also adapt the method to a decentralized framework with a low computational and communication overhead, while preserving the accuracy. We leverage Secure Aggregation (a form of Multi-Party Computation) to allow the algorithm to perform computations using data distributed among multiple users or devices, without revealing individual data. We show that it is possible to use a noise scale in the decentralized setting that is similar to the one in the centralized setting. We improve upon existing convergence bounds for both the centralized and decentralized versions. The proposed method is especially relevant for decentralized applications such as distributed recommender systems, where privacy concerns are paramount.</description>

      <title>RobPy: a Python Package for Robust Statistical Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust estimation provides essential tools for analyzing data that contain outliers, ensuring that statistical models remain reliable even in the presence of some anomalous data. While robust methods have long been available in R, users of Python have lacked a comprehensive package that offers these methods in a cohesive framework. RobPy addresses this gap by offering a wide range of robust methods in Python, built upon established libraries including NumPy, SciPy, and scikit-learn. This package includes tools for robust preprocessing, univariate estimation, covariance matrices, regression, and principal component analysis, which are able to detect outliers and to mitigate their effect. In addition, RobPy provides specialized diagnostic plots for visualizing casewise and cellwise outliers. This paper presents the structure of the RobPy package, demonstrates its functionality through examples, and compares its features to existing implementations in other statistical software. By bringing robust methods to Python, RobPy enables more users to perform robust data analysis in a modern and versatile programming language.</description>

      <title>EXAGREE: Towards Explanation Agreement in Explainable Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explanations in machine learning are critical for trust, transparency, and fairness. Yet, complex disagreements among these explanations limit the reliability and applicability of machine learning models, especially in high-stakes environments. We formalize four fundamental ranking-based explanation disagreement problems and introduce a novel framework, EXplanation AGREEment (EXAGREE), to bridge diverse interpretations in explainable machine learning, particularly from stakeholder-centered perspectives. Our approach leverages a Rashomon set for attribution predictions and then optimizes within this set to identify Stakeholder-Aligned Explanation Models (SAEMs) that minimize disagreement with diverse stakeholder needs while maintaining predictive performance. Rigorous empirical analysis on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates that EXAGREE reduces explanation disagreement and improves fairness across subgroups in various domains. EXAGREE not only provides researchers with a new direction for studying explanation disagreement problems but also offers data scientists a tool for making better-informed decisions in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Understanding Variational Autoencoders with Intrinsic Dimension and Information Imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents an analysis of the hidden representations of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) using the Intrinsic Dimension (ID) and the Information Imbalance (II). We show that VAEs undergo a transition in behaviour once the bottleneck size is larger than the ID of the data, manifesting in a double hunchback ID profile and a qualitative shift in information processing as captured by the II. Our results also highlight two distinct training phases for architectures with sufficiently large bottleneck sizes, consisting of a rapid fit and a slower generalisation, as assessed by a differentiated behaviour of ID, II, and KL loss. These insights demonstrate that II and ID could be valuable tools for aiding architecture search, for diagnosing underfitting in VAEs, and, more broadly, they contribute to advancing a unified understanding of deep generative models through geometric analysis.</description>

      <title>Optimal Classification under Performative Distribution Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Performative learning addresses the increasingly pervasive situations in which algorithmic decisions may induce changes in the data distribution as a consequence of their public deployment. We propose a novel view in which these performative effects are modelled as push-forward measures. This general framework encompasses existing models and enables novel performative gradient estimation methods, leading to more efficient and scalable learning strategies. For distribution shifts, unlike previous models which require full specification of the data distribution, we only assume knowledge of the shift operator that represents the performative changes. This approach can also be integrated into various change-of-variablebased models, such as VAEs or normalizing flows. Focusing on classification with a linear-in-parameters performative effect, we prove the convexity of the performative risk under a new set of assumptions. Notably, we do not limit the strength of performative effects but rather their direction, requiring only that classification becomes harder when deploying more accurate models. In this case, we also establish a connection with adversarially robust classification by reformulating the minimization of the performative risk as a min-max variational problem. Finally, we illustrate our approach on synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Theory-inspired Label Shift Adaptation via Aligned Distribution Mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a prominent challenge in addressing real-world issues within a dynamic environment, label shift, which refers to the learning setting where the source (training) and target (testing) label distributions do not match, has recently received increasing attention. Existing label shift methods solely use unlabeled target samples to estimate the target label distribution, and do not involve them during the classifier training, resulting in suboptimal utilization of available information. One common solution is to directly blend the source and target distributions during the training of the target classifier. However, we illustrate the theoretical deviation and limitations of the direct distribution mixture in the label shift setting. To tackle this crucial yet unexplored issue, we introduce the concept of aligned distribution mixture, showcasing its theoretical optimality and generalization error bounds. By incorporating insights from generalization theory, we propose an innovative label shift framework named as Aligned Distribution Mixture (ADM). Within this framework, we enhance four typical label shift methods by introducing modifications to the classifier training process. Furthermore, we also propose a one-step approach that incorporates a pioneering coupling weight estimation strategy. Considering the distinctiveness of the proposed one-step approach, we develop an efficient bi-level optimization strategy. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches, together with their effectiveness in COVID-19 diagnosis applications.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Tensors for Multi-Dimensional Markov Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a low-rank tensor model for multi-dimensional Markov chains. A common approach to simplify the dynamical behavior of a Markov chain is to impose low-rankness on the transition probability matrix. Inspired by the success of these matrix techniques, we present low-rank tensors for representing transition probabilities on multi-dimensional state spaces. Through tensor decomposition, we provide a connection between our method and classical probabilistic models. Moreover, our proposed model yields a parsimonious representation with fewer parameters than matrix-based approaches. Unlike these methods, which impose low-rankness uniformly across all states, our tensor method accounts for the multi-dimensionality of the state space. We also propose an optimization-based approach to estimate a Markov model as a low-rank tensor. Our optimization problem can be solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which enjoys convergence to a stationary solution. We empirically demonstrate that our tensor model estimates Markov chains more efficiently than conventional techniques, requiring both fewer samples and parameters. We perform numerical simulations for both a synthetic low-rank Markov chain and a real-world example with New York City taxi data, showcasing the advantages of multi-dimensionality for modeling state spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many risk-sensitive applications require well-calibrated prediction sets over multiple, potentially correlated target variables, for which the prediction algorithm may report correlated non-conformity scores. In this work, we treat the scores as random vectors and aim to construct the prediction set accounting for their joint correlation structure. Drawing from the rich literature on multivariate quantiles and semiparametric statistics, we propose an algorithm to estimate the $1-\alpha$ quantile of the scores, where $\alpha$ is the user-specified miscoverage rate. In particular, we flexibly estimate the joint cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the scores using nonparametric vine copulas and improve the asymptotic efficiency of the quantile estimate using its influence function. The vine decomposition allows our method to scale well to a large number of targets. We report desired coverage and competitive efficiency on a range of real-world regression problems, including those with missing-at-random labels in the calibration set.</description>

      <title>Finite-sample performance of the maximum likelihood estimator in logistic regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Logistic regression is a classical model for describing the probabilistic dependence of binary responses to multivariate covariates. We consider the predictive performance of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for logistic regression, assessed in terms of logistic risk. We consider two questions: first, that of the existence of the MLE (which occurs when the dataset is not linearly separated), and second that of its accuracy when it exists. These properties depend on both the dimension of covariates and on the signal strength. In the case of Gaussian covariates and a well-specified logistic model, we obtain sharp non-asymptotic guarantees for the existence and excess logistic risk of the MLE. We then generalize these results in two ways: first, to non-Gaussian covariates satisfying a certain two-dimensional margin condition, and second to the general case of statistical learning with a possibly misspecified logistic model. Finally, we consider the case of a Bernoulli design, where the behavior of the MLE is highly sensitive to the parameter direction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gauss-Newton (GN) matrix plays an important role in machine learning, most evident in its use as a preconditioning matrix for a wide family of popular adaptive methods to speed up optimization. Besides, it can also provide key insights into the optimization landscape of neural networks. In the context of deep neural networks, understanding the GN matrix involves studying the interaction between different weight matrices as well as the dependencies introduced by the data, thus rendering its analysis challenging. In this work, we take a first step towards theoretically characterizing the conditioning of the GN matrix in neural networks. We establish tight bounds on the condition number of the GN in deep linear networks of arbitrary depth and width, which we also extend to two-layer ReLU networks. We expand the analysis to further architectural components, such as residual connections and convolutional layers. Finally, we empirically validate the bounds and uncover valuable insights into the influence of the analyzed architectural components.</description>

      <title>Provably Transformers Harness Multi-Concept Word Semantics for Efficient In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have displayed remarkable creative prowess and emergence capabilities. Existing empirical studies have revealed a strong connection between these LLMs' impressive emergence abilities and their in-context learning (ICL) capacity, allowing them to solve new tasks using only task-specific prompts without further fine-tuning. On the other hand, existing empirical and theoretical studies also show that there is a linear regularity of the multi-concept encoded semantic representation behind transformer-based LLMs. However, existing theoretical work fail to build up an understanding of the connection between this regularity and the innovative power of ICL. Additionally, prior work often focuses on simplified, unrealistic scenarios involving linear transformers or unrealistic loss functions, and they achieve only linear or sub-linear convergence rates. In contrast, this work provides a fine-grained mathematical analysis to show how transformers leverage the multi-concept semantics of words to enable powerful ICL and excellent out-of-distribution ICL abilities, offering insights into how transformers innovate solutions for certain unseen tasks encoded with multiple cross-concept semantics. Inspired by empirical studies on the linear latent geometry of LLMs, the analysis is based on a concept-based low-noise sparse coding prompt model. Leveraging advanced techniques, this work showcases the exponential 0-1 loss convergence over the highly non-convex training dynamics, which pioneeringly incorporates the challenges of softmax self-attention, ReLU-activated MLPs, and cross-entropy loss. Empirical simulations corroborate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Powerful batch conformal prediction for classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a supervised classification split conformal/inductive framework with $K$ classes, a calibration sample of $n$ labeled examples is observed for inference on the label of a new unlabeled example. In this work, we explore the case where a "batch" of $m$ independent such unlabeled examples is given, and a multivariate prediction set with $1-\alpha$ coverage should be provided for this batch. Hence, the batch prediction set takes the form of a collection of label vectors of size $m$, while the calibration sample only contains univariate labels. Using the Bonferroni correction consists in concatenating the individual prediction sets at level $1-\alpha/m$ (Vovk 2013). We propose a uniformly more powerful solution, based on specific combinations of conformal $p$-values that exploit the Simes inequality (Simes 1986). Intuitively, the pooled evidence of fairly "easy" examples of the batch can help provide narrower batch prediction sets. We also introduced adaptive versions of the novel procedure that are particularly effective when the batch prediction set is expected to be large. The theoretical guarantees are provided when all examples are iid, as well as more generally when iid is assumed only conditionally within each class. In particular, our results are also valid under a label distribution shift since the distribution of the labels need not be the same in the calibration sample and in the new `batch'. The usefulness of the method is illustrated on synthetic and real data examples.</description>

      <title>On the Utilization of Unique Node Identifiers in Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks have inherent representational limitations due to their message-passing structure. Recent work has suggested that these limitations can be overcome by using unique node identifiers (UIDs). Here we argue that despite the advantages of UIDs, one of their disadvantages is that they lose the desirable property of permutation-equivariance. We thus propose to focus on UID models that are permutation-equivariant, and present theoretical arguments for their advantages. Motivated by this, we propose a method to regularize UID models towards permutation equivariance, via a contrastive loss. We empirically demonstrate that our approach improves generalization and extrapolation abilities while providing faster training convergence. On the recent BREC expressiveness benchmark, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other random-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Sample-Efficient Private Learning of Mixtures of Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning mixtures of Gaussians with approximate differential privacy. We prove that roughly $kd^2 + k^{1.5} d^{1.75} + k^2 d$ samples suffice to learn a mixture of $k$ arbitrary $d$-dimensional Gaussians up to low total variation distance, with differential privacy. Our work improves over the previous best result [AAL24b] (which required roughly $k^2 d^4$ samples) and is provably optimal when $d$ is much larger than $k^2$. Moreover, we give the first optimal bound for privately learning mixtures of $k$ univariate (i.e., $1$-dimensional) Gaussians. Importantly, we show that the sample complexity for privately learning mixtures of univariate Gaussians is linear in the number of components $k$, whereas the previous best sample complexity [AAL21] was quadratic in $k$. Our algorithms utilize various techniques, including the inverse sensitivity mechanism [AD20b, AD20a, HKMN23], sample compression for distributions [ABDH+20], and methods for bounding volumes of sumsets.</description>

      <title>Sparsing Law: Towards Large Language Models with Greater Activation Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Activation sparsity denotes the existence of substantial weakly-contributed elements within activation outputs that can be eliminated, benefiting many important applications concerned with large language models (LLMs). Although promoting greater activation sparsity within LLMs deserves deep studies, existing works lack comprehensive and quantitative research on the correlation between activation sparsity and potentially influential factors. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on the quantitative scaling properties and influential factors of the activation sparsity within decoder-only Transformer-based LLMs. Specifically, we propose PPL-$p\%$ sparsity, a precise and performance-aware activation sparsity metric that is applicable to any activation function. Through extensive experiments, we find several important phenomena. Firstly, different activation functions exhibit comparable performance but opposite training-time sparsity trends. The activation ratio (i.e., $1-\mathrm{sparsity\ ratio}$) evolves as a convergent increasing power-law and decreasing logspace power-law with the amount of training data for SiLU-activated and ReLU-activated LLMs, respectively. These demonstrate that ReLU is more efficient as the activation function than SiLU and can leverage more training data to improve activation sparsity. Secondly, the activation ratio linearly increases with the width-depth ratio below a certain bottleneck point, indicating the potential advantage of a deeper architecture at a fixed parameter scale. Finally, at similar width-depth ratios, we surprisingly find that the limit value of activation sparsity varies weakly with the parameter scale, i.e., the activation patterns within LLMs are insensitive to the parameter scale. These empirical laws towards LLMs with greater activation sparsity have important implications for making LLMs more efficient and interpretable.</description>

      <title>Causal effects based on distributional distances</title>

      <description>arXiv:1806.02935v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Comparing counterfactual distributions can provide more nuanced and valuable measures for causal effects, going beyond typical summary statistics such as averages. In this work, we consider characterizing causal effects via distributional distances, focusing on two kinds of target parameters. The first is the counterfactual outcome density. We propose a doubly robust-style estimator for the counterfactual density and study its rates of convergence and limiting distributions. We analyze asymptotic upper bounds on the $L_q$ and the integrated $L_q$ risks of the proposed estimator, and propose a bootstrap-based confidence band. The second is a novel distributional causal effect defined by the $L_1$ distance between different counterfactual distributions. We study three approaches for estimating the proposed distributional effect: smoothing the counterfactual density, smoothing the $L_1$ distance, and imposing a margin condition. For each approach, we analyze asymptotic properties and error bounds of the proposed estimator, and discuss potential advantages and disadvantages. We go on to present a bootstrap approach for obtaining confidence intervals, and propose a test of no distributional effect. We conclude with a numerical illustration and a real-world example.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization: Theory and Applications in Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:1908.08729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many decision problems in science, engineering and economics are affected by uncertain parameters whose distribution is only indirectly observable through samples. The goal of data-driven decision-making is to learn a decision from finitely many training samples that will perform well on unseen test samples. This learning task is difficult even if all training and test samples are drawn from the same distribution -- especially if the dimension of the uncertainty is large relative to the training sample size. Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization seeks data-driven decisions that perform well under the most adverse distribution within a certain Wasserstein distance from a nominal distribution constructed from the training samples. In this tutorial we will argue that this approach has many conceptual and computational benefits. Most prominently, the optimal decisions can often be computed by solving tractable convex optimization problems, and they enjoy rigorous out-of-sample and asymptotic consistency guarantees. We will also show that Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization has interesting ramifications for statistical learning and motivates new approaches for fundamental learning tasks such as classification, regression, maximum likelihood estimation or minimum mean square error estimation, among others.</description>

      <title>Improving the Reconstruction of Disentangled Representation Learners via Multi-Stage Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.13187v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current autoencoder-based disentangled representation learning methods achieve disentanglement by penalizing the (aggregate) posterior to encourage statistical independence of the latent factors. This approach introduces a trade-off between disentangled representation learning and reconstruction quality since the model does not have enough capacity to learn correlated latent variables that capture detail information present in most image data. To overcome this trade-off, we present a novel multi-stage modeling approach where the disentangled factors are first learned using a penalty-based disentangled representation learning method; then, the low-quality reconstruction is improved with another deep generative model that is trained to model the missing correlated latent variables, adding detail information while maintaining conditioning on the previously learned disentangled factors. Taken together, our multi-stage modelling approach results in a single, coherent probabilistic model that is theoretically justified by the principal of D-separation and can be realized with a variety of model classes including likelihood-based models such as variational autoencoders, implicit models such as generative adversarial networks, and tractable models like normalizing flows or mixtures of Gaussians. We demonstrate that our multi-stage model has higher reconstruction quality than current state-of-the-art methods with equivalent disentanglement performance across multiple standard benchmarks. In addition, we apply the multi-stage model to generate synthetic tabular datasets, showcasing an enhanced performance over benchmark models across a variety of metrics. The interpretability analysis further indicates that the multi-stage model can effectively uncover distinct and meaningful features of variations from which the original distribution can be recovered.</description>

      <title>Co-data Learning for Bayesian Additive Regression Trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical prediction applications often need to deal with small sample sizes compared to the number of covariates. Such data pose problems for prediction and variable selection, especially when the covariate-response relationship is complicated. To address these challenges, we propose to incorporate co-data, i.e. external information on the covariates, into Bayesian additive regression trees (BART), a sum-of-trees prediction model that utilizes priors on the tree parameters to prevent overfitting. To incorporate co-data, an empirical Bayes (EB) framework is developed that estimates, assisted by a co-data model, prior covariate weights in the BART model. The proposed method can handle multiple types of co-data simultaneously. Furthermore, the proposed EB framework enables the estimation of the other hyperparameters of BART as well, rendering an appealing alternative to cross-validation. We show that the method finds relevant covariates and that it improves prediction compared to default BART in simulations. If the covariate-response relationship is nonlinear, the method benefits from the flexibility of BART to outperform regression-based co-data learners. Finally, the use of co-data enhances prediction in an application to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma prognosis based on clinical covariates, gene mutations, DNA translocations, and DNA copy number data.

      <title>Enhancing Trade-offs in Privacy, Utility, and Computational Efficiency through MUltistage Sampling Technique (MUST)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Applying a randomized algorithm to a subset rather than the entire dataset amplifies privacy guarantees. We propose a class of subsampling methods ``MUltistage Sampling Technique (MUST)'' for privacy amplification (PA) in the context of differential privacy (DP). We conduct comprehensive analyses of the PA effects and utility for several 2-stage MUST procedures through newly introduced concept including strong vs weak PA effects and aligned privacy profile. We provide the privacy loss composition analysis over repeated applications of MUST via the Fourier accountant algorithm. Our theoretical and empirical results suggest that MUST offers stronger PA in $\epsilon$ than the common one-stage sampling procedures including Poisson sampling, sampling without replacement, and sampling with replacement, while the results on $\delta$ vary case by case. Our experiments show that MUST is non-inferior in the utility and stability of privacy-preserving (PP) outputs to one-stage subsampling methods at similar privacy loss while enhancing the computational efficiency of algorithms that require complex function calculations on distinct data points. MUST can be seamlessly integrated into stochastic optimization algorithms or procedures that involve parallel or simultaneous subsampling when DP guarantees are necessary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a general clustering setting in which we have $n$ elements to be clustered, and we aim to perform as few queries as possible to an oracle that returns a noisy sample of the weighted similarity between two elements. Our setting encompasses many application domains in which the similarity function is costly to compute and inherently noisy. We introduce two novel formulations of online learning problems rooted in the paradigm of Pure Exploration in Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandits (PE-CMAB): fixed confidence and fixed budget settings. For both settings, we design algorithms that combine a sampling strategy with a classic approximation algorithm for correlation clustering and study their theoretical guarantees. Our results are the first examples of polynomial-time algorithms that work for the case of PE-CMAB in which the underlying offline optimization problem is NP-hard.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01371v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-space graphical models and the variational autoencoder framework provide a principled apparatus for learning dynamical systems from data. State-of-the-art probabilistic approaches are often able to scale to large problems at the cost of flexibility of the variational posterior or expressivity of the dynamics model. However, those consolidations can be detrimental if the ultimate goal is to learn a generative model capable of explaining the spatiotemporal structure of the data and making accurate forecasts. We introduce a low-rank structured variational autoencoding framework for nonlinear Gaussian state-space graphical models capable of capturing dense covariance structures that are important for learning dynamical systems with predictive capabilities. Our inference algorithm exploits the covariance structures that arise naturally from sample based approximate Gaussian message passing and low-rank amortized posterior updates -- effectively performing approximate variational smoothing with time complexity scaling linearly in the state dimensionality. In comparisons with other deep state-space model architectures our approach consistently demonstrates the ability to learn a more predictive generative model. Furthermore, when applied to neural physiological recordings, our approach is able to learn a dynamical system capable of forecasting population spiking and behavioral correlates from a small portion of single trials.</description>

      <title>Sigmoid Gating is More Sample Efficient than Softmax Gating in Mixture of Experts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The softmax gating function is arguably the most popular choice in mixture of experts modeling. Despite its widespread use in practice, the softmax gating may lead to unnecessary competition among experts, potentially causing the undesirable phenomenon of representation collapse due to its inherent structure. In response, the sigmoid gating function has been recently proposed as an alternative and has been demonstrated empirically to achieve superior performance. However, a rigorous examination of the sigmoid gating function is lacking in current literature. In this paper, we verify theoretically that the sigmoid gating, in fact, enjoys a higher sample efficiency than the softmax gating for the statistical task of expert estimation. Towards that goal, we consider a regression framework in which the unknown regression function is modeled as a mixture of experts, and study the rates of convergence of the least squares estimator under the over-specified case in which the number of fitted experts is larger than the true value. We show that two gating regimes naturally arise and, in each of them, we formulate an identifiability condition for the expert functions and derive the corresponding convergence rates. In both cases, we find that experts formulated as feed-forward networks with commonly used activation such as ReLU and GELU enjoy faster convergence rates under the sigmoid gating than those under softmax gating. Furthermore, given the same choice of experts, we demonstrate that the sigmoid gating function requires a smaller sample size than its softmax counterpart to attain the same error of expert estimation and, therefore, is more sample efficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06257v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a wide array of machine learning algorithms are specific instances of one single paradigm: reciprocal learning. These instances range from active learning over multi-armed bandits to self-training. We show that all these algorithms do not only learn parameters from data but also vice versa: They iteratively alter training data in a way that depends on the current model fit. We introduce reciprocal learning as a generalization of these algorithms using the language of decision theory. This allows us to study under what conditions they converge. The key is to guarantee that reciprocal learning contracts such that the Banach fixed-point theorem applies. In this way, we find that reciprocal learning algorithms converge at linear rates to an approximately optimal model under relatively mild assumptions on the loss function, if their predictions are probabilistic and the sample adaption is both non-greedy and either randomized or regularized. We interpret these findings and provide corollaries that relate them to specific active learning, self-training, and bandit algorithms.</description>

      <title>The Central Role of the Loss Function in Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper illustrates the central role of loss functions in data-driven decision making, providing a comprehensive survey on their influence in cost-sensitive classification (CSC) and reinforcement learning (RL). We demonstrate how different regression loss functions affect the sample efficiency and adaptivity of value-based decision making algorithms. Across multiple settings, we prove that algorithms using the binary cross-entropy loss achieve first-order bounds scaling with the optimal policy's cost and are much more efficient than the commonly used squared loss. Moreover, we prove that distributional algorithms using the maximum likelihood loss achieve second-order bounds scaling with the policy variance and are even sharper than first-order bounds. This in particular proves the benefits of distributional RL. We hope that this paper serves as a guide analyzing decision making algorithms with varying loss functions, and can inspire the reader to seek out better loss functions to improve any decision making algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2001.05989v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses a counterpart of conformal prediction for e-values, conformal e-prediction. Conformal e-prediction is conceptually simpler and had been developed in the 1990s as precursor of conformal prediction. When conformal prediction emerged as result of replacing e-values by p-values, it seemed to have important advantages over conformal e-prediction without obvious disadvantages. This paper re-examines relations between conformal prediction and conformal e-prediction systematically from a modern perspective. Conformal e-prediction has advantages of its own, such as the ease of designing conditional conformal e-predictors and the guaranteed validity of cross-conformal e-predictors (whereas for cross-conformal predictors validity is only an empirical fact and can be broken with excessive randomization). Even where conformal prediction has clear advantages, conformal e-prediction can often emulate those advantages, more or less successfully.</description>

      <title>Automatic Organization of Neural Modules for Enhanced Collaboration in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.04088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a new perspective on the structure of Neural Networks (NNs). Traditional Neural Networks are typically tree-like structures for convenience, which can be predefined or learned by NAS methods. However, such a structure can not facilitate communications between nodes at the same level or signal transmissions to previous levels. These defects prevent effective collaboration, restricting the capabilities of neural networks. It is well-acknowledged that the biological neural system contains billions of neural units. Their connections are far more complicated than the current NN structure. To enhance the representational ability of neural networks, existing works try to increase the depth of the neural network and introduce more parameters. However, they all have limitations with constrained parameters. In this work, we introduce a synchronous graph-based structure to establish a novel way of organizing the neural units: the Neural Modules. This framework allows any nodes to communicate with each other and encourages neural units to work collectively, demonstrating a departure from the conventional constrained paradigm. Such a structure also provides more candidates for the NAS methods. Furthermore, we also propose an elegant regularization method to organize neural units into multiple independent, balanced neural modules systematically. This would be convenient for handling these neural modules in parallel. Compared to traditional NNs, our method unlocks the potential of NNs from tree-like structures to general graphs and makes NNs be optimized in an almost complete set. Our approach proves adaptable to diverse tasks, offering compatibility across various scenarios. Quantitative experimental results substantiate the potential of our structure, indicating the improvement of NNs.</description>

      <title>Agnostic Learning of General ReLU Activation Using Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.02711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a convergence analysis of gradient descent for the problem of agnostically learning a single ReLU function with moderate bias under Gaussian distributions. Unlike prior work that studies the setting of zero bias, we consider the more challenging scenario when the bias of the ReLU function is non-zero. Our main result establishes that starting from random initialization, in a polynomial number of iterations gradient descent outputs, with high probability, a ReLU function that achieves an error that is within a constant factor of the optimal error of the best ReLU function with moderate bias. We also provide finite sample guarantees, and these techniques generalize to a broader class of marginal distributions beyond Gaussians.</description>

      <title>DU-Shapley: A Shapley Value Proxy for Efficient Dataset Valuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02071v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the dataset valuation problem, that is, the problem of quantifying the incremental gain, to some relevant pre-defined utility of a machine learning task, of aggregating an individual dataset to others. The Shapley value is a natural tool to perform dataset valuation due to its formal axiomatic justification, which can be combined with Monte Carlo integration to overcome the computational tractability challenges. Such generic approximation methods, however, remain expensive in some cases. In this paper, we exploit the knowledge about the structure of the dataset valuation problem to devise more efficient Shapley value estimators. We propose a novel approximation, referred to as discrete uniform Shapley, which is expressed as an expectation under a discrete uniform distribution with support of reasonable size. We justify the relevancy of the proposed framework via asymptotic and non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees and illustrate its benefits via an extensive set of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Comparative Study on Semi-supervised Learning Applied for Anomaly Detection in Hydraulic Condition Monitoring System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Condition-based maintenance is becoming increasingly important in hydraulic systems. However, anomaly detection for these systems remains challenging, especially since that anomalous data is scarce and labeling such data is tedious and even dangerous. Therefore, it is advisable to make use of unsupervised or semi-supervised methods, especially for semi-supervised learning which utilizes unsupervised learning as a feature extraction mechanism to aid the supervised part when only a small number of labels are available. This study systematically compares semi-supervised learning methods applied for anomaly detection in hydraulic condition monitoring systems. Firstly, thorough data analysis and feature learning were carried out to understand the open-sourced hydraulic condition monitoring dataset. Then, various methods were implemented and evaluated including traditional stand-alone semi-supervised learning models (e.g., one-class SVM, Robust Covariance), ensemble models (e.g., Isolation Forest), and deep neural network based models (e.g., autoencoder, Hierarchical Extreme Learning Machine (HELM)). Typically, this study customized and implemented an extreme learning machine based semi-supervised HELM model and verified its superiority over other semi-supervised methods. Extensive experiments show that the customized HELM model obtained state-of-the-art performance with the highest accuracy (99.5%), the lowest false positive rate (0.015), and the best F1-score (0.985) beating other semi-supervised methods.</description>

      <title>QBSD: Quartile-Based Seasonality Decomposition for Cost-Effective RAN KPI Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05989v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forecasting time series patterns, such as cell key performance indicators (KPIs) of radio access networks (RAN), plays a vital role in enhancing service quality and operational efficiency. State-of-the-art forecasting approaches prioritize accuracy at the expense of computational performance, rendering them less suitable for data-intensive applications encompassing systems with a multitude of time series variables. They also do not capture the effect of dynamic operating ranges that vary with time. To address this issue, we introduce QBSD, a live single-step forecasting approach tailored to optimize the trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity. The method has shown significant success with our real network RAN KPI datasets of over several thousand cells. In this article, we showcase the performance of QBSD in comparison to other forecasting approaches on a dataset we have made publicly available. The results demonstrate that the proposed method excels in runtime efficiency compared to the leading algorithms available while maintaining competitive forecast accuracy that rivals neural forecasting methods.</description>

      <title>Sparse Bayesian Multidimensional Item Response Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17820v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multivariate Item Response Theory (MIRT) is sought-after widely by applied researchers looking for interpretable (sparse) explanations underlying response patterns in questionnaire data. There is, however, an unmet demand for such sparsity discovery tools in practice. Our paper develops a Bayesian platform for binary and ordinal item MIRT which requires minimal tuning and scales well on large datasets due to its parallelizable features. Bayesian methodology for MIRT models has traditionally relied on MCMC simulation, which cannot only be slow in practice, but also often renders exact sparsity recovery impossible without additional thresholding. In this work, we develop a scalable Bayesian EM algorithm to estimate sparse factor loadings from mixed continuous, binary, and ordinal item responses. We address the seemingly insurmountable problem of unknown latent factor dimensionality with tools from Bayesian nonparametrics which enable estimating the number of factors. Rotations to sparsity through parameter expansion further enhance convergence and interpretability without identifiability constraints. In our simulation study, we show that our method reliably recovers both the factor dimensionality as well as the latent structure on high-dimensional synthetic data even for small samples. We demonstrate the practical usefulness of our approach on three datasets: an educational assessment dataset, a quality-of-life measurement dataset, and a bio-behavioral dataset. All demonstrations show that our tool yields interpretable estimates, facilitating interesting discoveries that might otherwise go unnoticed under a pure confirmatory factor analysis setting.</description>

      <title>SASSL: Enhancing Self-Supervised Learning via Neural Style Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01187v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing data augmentation in self-supervised learning, while diverse, fails to preserve the inherent structure of natural images. This results in distorted augmented samples with compromised semantic information, ultimately impacting downstream performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose SASSL: Style Augmentations for Self Supervised Learning, a novel data augmentation technique based on Neural Style Transfer. SASSL decouples semantic and stylistic attributes in images and applies transformations exclusively to their style while preserving content, generating diverse samples that better retain semantic information. SASSL boosts top-1 image classification accuracy on ImageNet by up to 2 percentage points compared to established self-supervised methods like MoCo, SimCLR, and BYOL, while achieving superior transfer learning performance across various datasets. Because SASSL can be performed asynchronously as part of the data augmentation pipeline, these performance impacts can be obtained with no change in pretraining throughput.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-biased molecular dynamics for learning uniformly accurate interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiently creating a concise but comprehensive data set for training machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) is an under-explored problem. Active learning, which uses biased or unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) to generate candidate pools, aims to address this objective. Existing biased and unbiased MD-simulation methods, however, are prone to miss either rare events or extrapolative regions -- areas of the configurational space where unreliable predictions are made. This work demonstrates that MD, when biased by the MLIP's energy uncertainty, simultaneously captures extrapolative regions and rare events, which is crucial for developing uniformly accurate MLIPs. Furthermore, exploiting automatic differentiation, we enhance bias-forces-driven MD with the concept of bias stress. We employ calibrated gradient-based uncertainties to yield MLIPs with similar or, sometimes, better accuracy than ensemble-based methods at a lower computational cost. Finally, we apply uncertainty-biased MD to alanine dipeptide and MIL-53(Al), generating MLIPs that represent both configurational spaces more accurately than models trained with conventional MD.</description>

      <title>Consistency Models for Scalable and Fast Simulation-Based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05440v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is constantly in search of more expressive and efficient algorithms to accurately infer the parameters of complex simulation models. In line with this goal, we present consistency models for posterior estimation (CMPE), a new conditional sampler for SBI that inherits the advantages of recent unconstrained architectures and overcomes their sampling inefficiency at inference time. CMPE essentially distills a continuous probability flow and enables rapid few-shot inference with an unconstrained architecture that can be flexibly tailored to the structure of the estimation problem. We provide hyperparameters and default architectures that support consistency training over a wide range of different dimensions, including low-dimensional ones which are important in SBI workflows but were previously difficult to tackle even with unconditional consistency models. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that CMPE not only outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms on hard low-dimensional benchmarks, but also achieves competitive performance with much faster sampling speed on two realistic estimation problems with high data and/or parameter dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the expressivity and learning process for polynomial neural networks (PNNs) with monomial activation functions. The weights of the network parametrize the neuromanifold. In this paper, we study certain neuromanifolds using tools from algebraic geometry: we give explicit descriptions as semialgebraic sets and characterize their Zariski closures, called neurovarieties. We study their dimension and associate an algebraic degree, the learning degree, to the neurovariety. The dimension serves as a geometric measure for the expressivity of the network, the learning degree is a measure for the complexity of training the network and provides upper bounds on the number of learnable functions. These theoretical results are accompanied with experiments.</description>

Abstract: Bilevel optimization has gained prominence in various applications. In this study, we introduce a framework for solving bilevel optimization problems, where the variables in both the lower and upper levels are constrained on Riemannian manifolds. We present several hypergradient estimation strategies on manifolds and analyze their estimation errors. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive convergence and complexity analyses for the proposed hypergradient descent algorithm on manifolds. We also extend our framework to encompass stochastic bilevel optimization and incorporate the use of general retraction. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated through several applications.</description>

      <title>Improving the Worst-Case Bidirectional Communication Complexity for Nonconvex Distributed Optimization under Function Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective communication between the server and workers plays a key role in distributed optimization. In this paper, we focus on optimizing the server-to-worker communication, uncovering inefficiencies in prevalent downlink compression approaches. Considering first the pure setup where the uplink communication costs are negligible, we introduce MARINA-P, a novel method for downlink compression, employing a collection of correlated compressors. Theoretical analyses demonstrates that MARINA-P with permutation compressors can achieve a server-to-worker communication complexity improving with the number of workers, thus being provably superior to existing algorithms. We further show that MARINA-P can serve as a starting point for extensions such as methods supporting bidirectional compression. We introduce M3, a method combining MARINA-P with uplink compression and a momentum step, achieving bidirectional compression with provable improvements in total communication complexity as the number of workers increases. Theoretical findings align closely with empirical experiments, underscoring the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new algorithm for model-based distributional reinforcement learning (RL), and prove that it is minimax-optimal for approximating return distributions with a generative model (up to logarithmic factors), resolving an open question of Zhang et al. (2023). Our analysis provides new theoretical results on categorical approaches to distributional RL, and also introduces a new distributional Bellman equation, the stochastic categorical CDF Bellman equation, which we expect to be of independent interest. We also provide an experimental study comparing several model-based distributional RL algorithms, with several takeaways for practitioners.</description>

      <title>An SDP-based Branch-and-Cut Algorithm for Biclustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biclustering, also called co-clustering, block clustering, or two-way clustering, involves the simultaneous clustering of both the rows and columns of a data matrix into distinct groups, such that the rows and columns within a group display similar patterns. As a model problem for biclustering, we consider the $k$-densest-disjoint biclique problem, whose goal is to identify $k$ disjoint complete bipartite subgraphs (called bicliques) of a given weighted complete bipartite graph such that the sum of their densities is maximized. To address this problem, we present a tailored branch-and-cut algorithm. For the upper bound routine, we consider a semidefinite programming relaxation and propose valid inequalities to strengthen the bound. We solve this relaxation in a cutting-plane fashion using a first-order method. For the lower bound, we design a maximum weight matching rounding procedure that exploits the solution of the relaxation solved at each node. Computational results on both synthetic and real-world instances show that the proposed algorithm can solve instances approximately 20 times larger than those handled by general-purpose solvers.</description>

      <title>A Sober Look at the Robustness of CLIPs to Spurious Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large vision language models, such as CLIP, demonstrate impressive robustness to spurious features than single-modal models trained on ImageNet. However, existing test datasets are typically curated based on ImageNet-trained models, which aim to capture the spurious features inherited in ImageNet. Benchmarking CLIP models based on the ImageNet-oriented spurious features may not be sufficient to reflect the extent to which CLIP models are robust to spurious correlations within CLIP training data, e.g., LAION. To this end, we craft a new challenging dataset named CounterAnimal designed to reveal the reliance of CLIP models on realistic spurious features. Specifically, we split animal photos into groups according to the backgrounds, and then identify a pair of groups for each class where a CLIP model shows high-performance drops across the two groups. Our evaluations show that the spurious features captured by CounterAnimal are generically learned by CLIP models with different backbones and pre-train data, yet have limited influence for ImageNet models. We provide theoretical insights that the CLIP objective cannot offer additional robustness. Furthermore, we also re-evaluate strategies such as scaling up parameters and high-quality pre-trained data. We find that they still help mitigate the spurious features, providing a promising path for future developments.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Sharp Off-Policy Evaluation in Robust Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evaluation of a policy under best- and worst-case perturbations to a Markov decision process (MDP), using transition observations from the original MDP, whether they are generated under the same or a different policy. This is an important problem when there is the possibility of a shift between historical and future environments, $\textit{e.g.}$ due to unmeasured confounding, distributional shift, or an adversarial environment. We propose a perturbation model that allows changes in the transition kernel densities up to a given multiplicative factor or its reciprocal, extending the classic marginal sensitivity model (MSM) for single time-step decision-making to infinite-horizon RL. We characterize the sharp bounds on policy value under this model $\unicode{x2013}$ $\textit{i.e.}$, the tightest possible bounds based on transition observations from the original MDP $\unicode{x2013}$ and we study the estimation of these bounds from such transition observations. We develop an estimator with several important guarantees: it is semiparametrically efficient, and remains so even when certain necessary nuisance functions, such as worst-case Q-functions, are estimated at slow, nonparametric rates. Our estimator is also asymptotically normal, enabling straightforward statistical inference using Wald confidence intervals. Moreover, when certain nuisances are estimated inconsistently, the estimator still provides valid, albeit possibly not sharp, bounds on the policy value. We validate these properties in numerical simulations. The combination of accounting for environment shifts from train to test (robustness), being insensitive to nuisance-function estimation (orthogonality), and addressing the challenge of learning from finite samples (inference) together leads to credible and reliable policy evaluation.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning with Interactive Data Collection: Fundamental Hardness and Near-Optimal Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sim-to-real gap, which represents the disparity between training and testing environments, poses a significant challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). A promising approach to addressing this challenge is distributionally robust RL, often framed as a robust Markov decision process (RMDP). In this framework, the objective is to find a robust policy that achieves good performance under the worst-case scenario among all environments within a pre-specified uncertainty set centered around the training environment. Unlike previous work, which relies on a generative model or a pre-collected offline dataset enjoying good coverage of the deployment environment, we tackle robust RL via interactive data collection, where the learner interacts with the training environment only and refines the policy through trial and error. In this robust RL paradigm, two main challenges emerge: managing distributional robustness while striking a balance between exploration and exploitation during data collection. Initially, we establish that sample-efficient learning without additional assumptions is unattainable owing to the curse of support shift; i.e., the potential disjointedness of the distributional supports between the training and testing environments. To circumvent such a hardness result, we introduce the vanishing minimal value assumption to RMDPs with a total-variation (TV) distance robust set, postulating that the minimal value of the optimal robust value function is zero. We prove that such an assumption effectively eliminates the support shift issue for RMDPs with a TV distance robust set, and present an algorithm with a provable sample complexity guarantee. Our work makes the initial step to uncovering the inherent difficulty of robust RL via interactive data collection and sufficient conditions for designing a sample-efficient algorithm accompanied by sharp sample complexity analysis.</description>

      <title>Distribution-free Conformal Prediction for Ordinal Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a general distribution-free approach for constructing prediction sets combined with any machine learning algorithm that achieve valid marginal or conditional coverage in finite samples. Ordinal classification is common in real applications where the target variable has natural ordering among the class labels. In this paper, we discuss constructing distribution-free prediction sets for such ordinal classification problems by leveraging the ideas of conformal prediction and multiple testing with FWER control. Newer conformal prediction methods are developed for constructing contiguous and non-contiguous prediction sets based on marginal and conditional (class-specific) conformal $p$-values, respectively. Theoretically, we prove that the proposed methods respectively achieve satisfactory levels of marginal and class-specific conditional coverages. Through simulation study and real data analysis, these proposed methods show promising performance compared to the existing conformal method.</description>

      <title>Two-stage Conformal Risk Control with Application to Ranked Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many practical machine learning systems, such as ranking and recommendation systems, consist of two concatenated stages: retrieval and ranking. These systems present significant challenges in accurately assessing and managing the uncertainty inherent in their predictions. To address these challenges, we extend the recently developed framework of conformal risk control, originally designed for single-stage problems, to accommodate the more complex two-stage setup. We first demonstrate that a straightforward application of conformal risk control, treating each stage independently, may fail to maintain risk at their pre-specified levels. Therefore, we propose an integrated approach that considers both stages simultaneously, devising algorithms to control the risk of each stage by jointly identifying thresholds for both stages. Our algorithm further optimizes for a weighted combination of prediction set sizes across all feasible thresholds, resulting in more effective prediction sets. Finally, we apply the proposed method to the critical task of two-stage ranked retrieval. We validate the efficacy of our method through extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets, MSLR-WEB and MS MARCO, commonly used for ranked retrieval tasks.</description>

      <title>Metric Flow Matching for Smooth Interpolations on the Data Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matching objectives underpin the success of modern generative models and rely on constructing conditional paths that transform a source distribution into a target distribution. Despite being a fundamental building block, conditional paths have been designed principally under the assumption of Euclidean geometry, resulting in straight interpolations. However, this can be particularly restrictive for tasks such as trajectory inference, where straight paths might lie outside the data manifold, thus failing to capture the underlying dynamics giving rise to the observed marginals. In this paper, we propose Metric Flow Matching (MFM), a novel simulation-free framework for conditional flow matching where interpolants are approximate geodesics learned by minimizing the kinetic energy of a data-induced Riemannian metric. This way, the generative model matches vector fields on the data manifold, which corresponds to lower uncertainty and more meaningful interpolations. We prescribe general metrics to instantiate MFM, independent of the task, and test it on a suite of challenging problems including LiDAR navigation, unpaired image translation, and modeling cellular dynamics. We observe that MFM outperforms the Euclidean baselines, particularly achieving SOTA on single-cell trajectory prediction.</description>

      <title>Freya PAGE: First Optimal Time Complexity for Large-Scale Nonconvex Finite-Sum Optimization with Heterogeneous Asynchronous Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In practical distributed systems, workers are typically not homogeneous, and due to differences in hardware configurations and network conditions, can have highly varying processing times. We consider smooth nonconvex finite-sum (empirical risk minimization) problems in this setup and introduce a new parallel method, Freya PAGE, designed to handle arbitrarily heterogeneous and asynchronous computations. By being robust to "stragglers" and adaptively ignoring slow computations, Freya PAGE offers significantly improved time complexity guarantees compared to all previous methods, including Asynchronous SGD, Rennala SGD, SPIDER, and PAGE, while requiring weaker assumptions. The algorithm relies on novel generic stochastic gradient collection strategies with theoretical guarantees that can be of interest on their own, and may be used in the design of future optimization methods. Furthermore, we establish a lower bound for smooth nonconvex finite-sum problems in the asynchronous setup, providing a fundamental time complexity limit. This lower bound is tight and demonstrates the optimality of Freya PAGE in the large-scale regime, i.e., when $\sqrt{m} \geq n$, where $n$ is # of workers, and $m$ is # of data samples.</description>

      <title>Provably Mitigating Overoptimization in RLHF: Your SFT Loss is Implicitly an Adversarial Regularizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aligning generative models with human preference via RLHF typically suffers from overoptimization, where an imperfectly learned reward model can misguide the generative model to output undesired responses. We investigate this problem in a principled manner by identifying the source of the misalignment as a form of distributional shift and uncertainty in learning human preferences. To mitigate overoptimization, we first propose a theoretical algorithm that chooses the best policy for an adversarially chosen reward model; one that simultaneously minimizes the maximum likelihood estimation of the loss and a reward penalty term. Here, the reward penalty term is introduced to prevent the policy from choosing actions with spurious high proxy rewards, resulting in provable sample efficiency of the algorithm under a partial coverage style condition. Moving from theory to practice, the proposed algorithm further enjoys an equivalent but surprisingly easy-to-implement reformulation. Using the equivalence between reward models and the corresponding optimal policy, the algorithm features a simple objective that combines: (i) a preference optimization loss that directly aligns the policy with human preference, and (ii) a supervised learning loss that explicitly imitates the policy with a (suitable) baseline distribution. In the context of aligning large language models (LLM), this objective fuses the direct preference optimization (DPO) loss with the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) loss to help mitigate the overoptimization towards undesired responses, for which we name the algorithm Regularized Preference Optimization (RPO). Experiments of aligning LLMs demonstrate the improved performance of RPO compared with DPO baselines. Our work sheds light on the interplay between preference optimization and SFT in tuning LLMs with both theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence.</description>

      <title>Compressing Large Language Models using Low Rank and Low Precision Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prohibitive sizes of Large Language Models (LLMs) today make it difficult to deploy them on memory-constrained edge devices. This work introduces $\rm CALDERA$ -- a new post-training LLM compression algorithm that harnesses the inherent low-rank structure of a weight matrix $\mathbf{W}$ by approximating it via a low-rank, low-precision decomposition as $\mathbf{W} \approx \mathbf{Q} + \mathbf{L}\mathbf{R}$. Here, $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{R}$ are low rank factors, and the entries of $\mathbf{Q}$, $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{R}$ are quantized. The model is compressed by substituting each layer with its $\mathbf{Q} + \mathbf{L}\mathbf{R}$ decomposition, and the zero-shot performance of the compressed model is evaluated. Additionally, $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{R}$ are readily amenable to low-rank adaptation, consequently enhancing the zero-shot performance. $\rm CALDERA$ obtains this decomposition by formulating it as an optimization problem $\min_{\mathbf{Q},\mathbf{L},\mathbf{R}}\lVert(\mathbf{Q} + \mathbf{L}\mathbf{R} - \mathbf{W})\mathbf{X}^\top\rVert_{\rm F}^2$, where $\mathbf{X}$ is the calibration data, and $\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{L}, \mathbf{R}$ are constrained to be representable using low-precision formats. Theoretical upper bounds on the approximation error of $\rm CALDERA$ are established using a rank-constrained regression framework, and the tradeoff between compression ratio and model performance is studied by analyzing the impact of target rank and quantization bit budget. Results illustrate that compressing LlaMa-$2$ $7$B/$13B$/$70$B and LlaMa-$3$ $8$B models using $\rm CALDERA$ outperforms existing post-training LLM compression techniques in the regime of less than $2.5$ bits per parameter. The implementation is available at: https://github.com/pilancilab/caldera.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the nonparametric regression problem when the covariates are located on an unknown smooth compact submanifold of a Euclidean space. Under defining a random geometric graph structure over the covariates we analyze the asymptotic frequentist behaviour of the posterior distribution arising from Bayesian priors designed through random basis expansion in the graph Laplacian eigenbasis. Under Holder smoothness assumption on the regression function and the density of the covariates over the submanifold, we prove that the posterior contraction rates of such methods are minimax optimal (up to logarithmic factors) for any positive smoothness index.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling machine learning models significantly improves their performance. However, such gains come at the cost of inference being slow and resource-intensive. Early-exit neural networks (EENNs) offer a promising solution: they accelerate inference by allowing intermediate layers to exit and produce a prediction early. Yet a fundamental issue with EENNs is how to determine when to exit without severely degrading performance. In other words, when is it 'safe' for an EENN to go 'fast'? To address this issue, we investigate how to adapt frameworks of risk control to EENNs. Risk control offers a distribution-free, post-hoc solution that tunes the EENN's exiting mechanism so that exits only occur when the output is of sufficient quality. We empirically validate our insights on a range of vision and language tasks, demonstrating that risk control can produce substantial computational savings, all the while preserving user-specified performance goals.</description>

      <title>Finding Optimally Robust Data Mixtures via Concave Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models are often required to perform well across several pre-defined settings, such as a set of user groups. Worst-case performance is a common metric to capture this requirement, and is the objective of group distributionally robust optimization (group DRO). Unfortunately, these methods struggle when the loss is non-convex in the parameters, or the model class is non-parametric. Here, we make a classical move to address this: we reparameterize group DRO from parameter space to function space, which results in a number of advantages. First, we show that group DRO over the space of bounded functions admits a minimax theorem. Second, for cross-entropy and mean squared error, we show that the minimax optimal mixture distribution is the solution of a simple convex optimization problem. Thus, provided one is working with a model class of universal function approximators, group DRO can be solved by a convex optimization problem followed by a classical risk minimization problem. We call our method MixMax. In our experiments, we found that MixMax matched or outperformed the standard group DRO baselines, and in particular, MixMax improved the performance of XGBoost over the only baseline, data balancing, for variations of the ACSIncome and CelebA annotations datasets.</description>

      <title>An Equivalence Between Static and Dynamic Regret Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of dynamic regret minimization in online convex optimization, in which the objective is to minimize the difference between the cumulative loss of an algorithm and that of an arbitrary sequence of comparators. While the literature on this topic is very rich, a unifying framework for the analysis and design of these algorithms is still missing. In this paper we show that for linear losses, dynamic regret minimization is equivalent to static regret minimization in an extended decision space. Using this simple observation, we show that there is a frontier of lower bounds trading off penalties due to the variance of the losses and penalties due to variability of the comparator sequence, and provide a framework for achieving any of the guarantees along this frontier. As a result, we also prove for the first time that adapting to the squared path-length of an arbitrary sequence of comparators to achieve regret $R_{T}(u_{1},\dots,u_{T})\le O(\sqrt{T\sum_{t} \|u_{t}-u_{t+1}\|^{2}})$ is impossible. However, using our framework we introduce an alternative notion of variability based on a locally-smoothed comparator sequence $\bar u_{1}, \dots, \bar u_{T}$, and provide an algorithm guaranteeing dynamic regret of the form $R_{T}(u_{1},\dots,u_{T})\le \tilde O(\sqrt{T\sum_{i}\|\bar u_{i}-\bar u_{i+1}\|^{2}})$, while still matching in the worst case the usual path-length dependencies up to polylogarithmic terms.</description>

      <title>Learning to grok: Emergence of in-context learning and skill composition in modular arithmetic tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models can solve tasks that were not present in the training set. This capability is believed to be due to in-context learning and skill composition. In this work, we study the emergence of in-context learning and skill composition in a collection of modular arithmetic tasks. Specifically, we consider a finite collection of linear modular functions $z = a \, x + b \, y \;\mathrm{mod}\; p$ labeled by the vector $(a, b) \in \mathbb{Z}_p^2$. We use some of these tasks for pre-training and the rest for out-of-distribution testing. We empirically show that a GPT-style transformer exhibits a transition from in-distribution to out-of-distribution generalization as the number of pre-training tasks increases. We find that the smallest model capable of out-of-distribution generalization requires two transformer blocks, while for deeper models, the out-of-distribution generalization phase is \emph{transient}, necessitating early stopping. Finally, we perform an interpretability study of the pre-trained models, revealing highly structured representations in both attention heads and MLPs; and discuss the learned algorithms. Notably, we find an algorithmic shift in deeper models, as we go from few to many in-context examples.</description>

      <title>A survey and benchmark of high-dimensional Bayesian optimization of discrete sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimizing discrete black-box functions is key in several domains, e.g. protein engineering and drug design. Due to the lack of gradient information and the need for sample efficiency, Bayesian optimization is an ideal candidate for these tasks. Several methods for high-dimensional continuous and categorical Bayesian optimization have been proposed recently. However, our survey of the field reveals highly heterogeneous experimental set-ups across methods and technical barriers for the replicability and application of published algorithms to real-world tasks. To address these issues, we develop a unified framework to test a vast array of high-dimensional Bayesian optimization methods and a collection of standardized black-box functions representing real-world application domains in chemistry and biology. These two components of the benchmark are each supported by flexible, scalable, and easily extendable software libraries (poli and poli-baselines), allowing practitioners to readily incorporate new optimization objectives or discrete optimizers.

      <title>Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects by Combining Weak Instruments and Observational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) is crucial in personalized medicine and digital platform analytics. Since the treatments of interest often cannot be directly randomized, observational data is leveraged to learn CATEs, but this approach can incur significant bias from unobserved confounding. One strategy to overcome these limitations is to leverage instrumental variables (IVs) as latent quasi-experiments, such as randomized intent-to-treat assignments or randomized product recommendations. This approach, on the other hand, can suffer from low compliance, $\textit{i.e.}$, IV weakness. Some subgroups may even exhibit zero compliance, meaning we cannot instrument for their CATEs at all. In this paper, we develop a novel approach to combine IV and observational data to enable reliable CATE estimation in the presence of unobserved confounding in the observational data and low compliance in the IV data, including no compliance for some subgroups. We propose a two-stage framework that first learns $\textit{biased}$ CATEs from the observational data, and then applies a compliance-weighted correction using IV data, effectively leveraging IV strength variability across covariates. We characterize the convergence rates of our method and validate its effectiveness through a simulation study. Additionally, we demonstrate its utility with real data by analyzing the heterogeneous effects of 401(k) plan participation on wealth.</description>

      <title>How Far Can Transformers Reason? The Globality Barrier and Inductive Scratchpad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06467v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can Transformers predict new syllogisms by composing established ones? More generally, what type of targets can be learned by such models from scratch? Recent works show that Transformers can be Turing-complete in terms of expressivity, but this does not address the learnability objective. This paper puts forward the notion of 'globality degree' of a target distribution to capture when weak learning is efficiently achievable by regular Transformers. This measure shows a contrast with the expressivity results of Transformers captured by $TC^0/TC^1$ classes (further studied here), since the globality relates to correlations with the more limited $NC^0$ class. We show here experimentally and theoretically under additional assumptions that distributions with high globality cannot be learned efficiently. In particular, syllogisms cannot be composed on long chains. Further, we develop scratchpad techniques and show that: (i) agnostic scratchpads cannot break the globality barrier, (ii) educated scratchpads can break the globality with intermediate steps, although not all such scratchpads can generalize out-of-distribution (OOD), (iii) a notion of 'inductive scratchpad', that composes the prior information more efficiently, can both break the globality barrier and improve the OOD generalization. In particular, some of our inductive scratchpads can achieve length generalizations of up to $6\times$ for some arithmetic tasks depending on the input formatting.</description>

      <title>Why Warmup the Learning Rate? Underlying Mechanisms and Improvements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is common in deep learning to warm up the learning rate $\eta$, often by a linear schedule between $\eta_{\text{init}} = 0$ and a predetermined target $\eta_{\text{trgt}}$. In this paper, we show through systematic experiments using SGD and Adam that the overwhelming benefit of warmup arises from allowing the network to tolerate larger $\eta_{\text{trgt}}$ {by forcing the network to more well-conditioned areas of the loss landscape}. The ability to handle larger $\eta_{\text{trgt}}$ makes hyperparameter tuning more robust while improving the final performance. We uncover different regimes of operation during the warmup period, depending on whether training starts off in a progressive sharpening or sharpness reduction phase, which in turn depends on the initialization and parameterization. Using these insights, we show how $\eta_{\text{init}}$ can be properly chosen by utilizing the loss catapult mechanism, which saves on the number of warmup steps, in some cases completely eliminating the need for warmup. We also suggest an initialization for the variance in Adam which provides benefits similar to warmup.</description>

      <title>Inferring stochastic low-rank recurrent neural networks from neural data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central aim in computational neuroscience is to relate the activity of large populations of neurons to an underlying dynamical system. Models of these neural dynamics should ideally be both interpretable and fit the observed data well. Low-rank recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit such interpretability by having tractable dynamics. However, it is unclear how to best fit low-rank RNNs to data consisting of noisy observations of an underlying stochastic system. Here, we propose to fit stochastic low-rank RNNs with variational sequential Monte Carlo methods. We validate our method on several datasets consisting of both continuous and spiking neural data, where we obtain lower dimensional latent dynamics than current state of the art methods. Additionally, for low-rank models with piecewise linear nonlinearities, we show how to efficiently identify all fixed points in polynomial rather than exponential cost in the number of units, making analysis of the inferred dynamics tractable for large RNNs. Our method both elucidates the dynamical systems underlying experimental recordings and provides a generative model whose trajectories match observed variability.</description>

      <title>What type of inference is planning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17863v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiple types of inference are available for probabilistic graphical models, e.g., marginal, maximum-a-posteriori, and even marginal maximum-a-posteriori. Which one do researchers mean when they talk about ``planning as inference''? There is no consistency in the literature, different types are used, and their ability to do planning is further entangled with specific approximations or additional constraints. In this work we use the variational framework to show that, just like all commonly used types of inference correspond to different weightings of the entropy terms in the variational problem, planning corresponds exactly to a different set of weights. This means that all the tricks of variational inference are readily applicable to planning. We develop an analogue of loopy belief propagation that allows us to perform approximate planning in factored-state Markov decisions processes without incurring intractability due to the exponentially large state space. The variational perspective shows that the previous types of inference for planning are only adequate in environments with low stochasticity, and allows us to characterize each type by its own merits, disentangling the type of inference from the additional approximations that its practical use requires. We validate these results empirically on synthetic MDPs and tasks posed in the International Planning Competition.</description>

      <title>FairJob: A Real-World Dataset for Fairness in Online Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a fairness-aware dataset for job recommendations in advertising, designed to foster research in algorithmic fairness within real-world scenarios. It was collected and prepared to comply with privacy standards and business confidentiality. An additional challenge is the lack of access to protected user attributes such as gender, for which we propose a solution to obtain a proxy estimate. Despite being anonymized and including a proxy for a sensitive attribute, our dataset preserves predictive power and maintains a realistic and challenging benchmark. This dataset addresses a significant gap in the availability of fairness-focused resources for high-impact domains like advertising -- the actual impact being having access or not to precious employment opportunities, where balancing fairness and utility is a common industrial challenge. We also explore various stages in the advertising process where unfairness can occur and introduce a method to compute a fair utility metric for the job recommendations in online systems case from a biased dataset. Experimental evaluations of bias mitigation techniques on the released dataset demonstrate potential improvements in fairness and the associated trade-offs with utility.
  The dataset is hosted at https://huggingface.co/datasets/criteo/FairJob. Source code for the experiments is hosted at https://github.com/criteo-research/FairJob-dataset/.</description>

      <title>Global Optimisation of Black-Box Functions with Generative Models in the Wasserstein Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11917v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new uncertainty estimator for gradient-free optimisation of black-box simulators using deep generative surrogate models. Optimisation of these simulators is especially challenging for stochastic simulators and higher dimensions. To address these issues, we utilise a deep generative surrogate approach to model the black box response for the entire parameter space. We then leverage this knowledge to estimate the proposed uncertainty based on the Wasserstein distance - the Wasserstein uncertainty. This approach is employed in a posterior agnostic gradient-free optimisation algorithm that minimises regret over the entire parameter space. A series of tests were conducted to demonstrate that our method is more robust to the shape of both the black box function and the stochastic response of the black box than state-of-the-art methods, such as efficient global optimisation with a deep Gaussian process surrogate.</description>

      <title>An Agglomerative Clustering of Simulation Output Distributions Using Regularized Wasserstein Distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using statistical learning methods to analyze stochastic simulation outputs can significantly enhance decision-making by uncovering relationships between different simulated systems and between a system's inputs and outputs. We focus on clustering multivariate empirical distributions of simulation outputs to identify patterns and trade-offs among performance measures. We present a novel agglomerative clustering algorithm that utilizes the regularized Wasserstein distance to cluster these multivariate empirical distributions. This framework has several important use cases, including anomaly detection, pre-optimization, and online monitoring. In numerical experiments involving a call-center model, we demonstrate how this methodology can identify staffing plans that yield similar performance outcomes and inform policies for intervening when queue lengths signal potentially worsening system performance.</description>

      <title>Bypassing the Noisy Parity Barrier: Learning Higher-Order Markov Random Fields from Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning graphical models, also known as Markov random fields (MRFs) from temporally correlated samples. As in many traditional statistical settings, fundamental results in the area all assume independent samples from the distribution. However, these samples generally will not directly correspond to more realistic observations from nature, which instead evolve according to some stochastic process. From the computational lens, even generating a single sample from the true MRF distribution is intractable unless $\mathsf{NP}=\mathsf{RP}$, and moreover, any algorithm to learn from i.i.d. samples requires prohibitive runtime due to hardness reductions to the parity with noise problem. These computational barriers for sampling and learning from the i.i.d. setting severely lessen the utility of these breakthrough results for this important task; however, dropping this assumption typically only introduces further algorithmic and statistical complexities.
  In this work, we surprisingly demonstrate that the direct trajectory data from a natural evolution of the MRF overcomes the fundamental computational lower bounds to efficient learning. In particular, we show that given a trajectory with $\widetilde{O}_k(n)$ site updates of an order $k$ MRF from the Glauber dynamics, a well-studied, natural stochastic process on graphical models, there is an algorithm that recovers the graph and the parameters in $\widetilde{O}_k(n^2)$ time. By contrast, all prior algorithms for learning order $k$ MRFs inherently suffer from $n^{\Theta(k)}$ runtime even in sparse instances due to the reductions to sparse parity with noise. Our results thus surprisingly show that this more realistic, but intuitively less tractable, model for MRFs actually leads to efficiency far beyond what is known and believed to be true in the traditional i.i.d. case.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Transcriptomics Foundation Models for Perturbation Analysis : one PCA still rules them all</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the relationships among genes, compounds, and their interactions in living organisms remains limited due to technological constraints and the complexity of biological data. Deep learning has shown promise in exploring these relationships using various data types. However, transcriptomics, which provides detailed insights into cellular states, is still underused due to its high noise levels and limited data availability. Recent advancements in transcriptomics sequencing provide new opportunities to uncover valuable insights, especially with the rise of many new foundation models for transcriptomics, yet no benchmark has been made to robustly evaluate the effectiveness of these rising models for perturbation analysis. This article presents a novel biologically motivated evaluation framework and a hierarchy of perturbation analysis tasks for comparing the performance of pretrained foundation models to each other and to more classical techniques of learning from transcriptomics data. We compile diverse public datasets from different sequencing techniques and cell lines to assess models performance. Our approach identifies scVI and PCA to be far better suited models for understanding biological perturbations in comparison to existing foundation models, especially in their application in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Cross-Entropy Is All You Need To Invert the Data Generating Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supervised learning has become a cornerstone of modern machine learning, yet a comprehensive theory explaining its effectiveness remains elusive. Empirical phenomena, such as neural analogy-making and the linear representation hypothesis, suggest that supervised models can learn interpretable factors of variation in a linear fashion. Recent advances in self-supervised learning, particularly nonlinear Independent Component Analysis, have shown that these methods can recover latent structures by inverting the data generating process. We extend these identifiability results to parametric instance discrimination, then show how insights transfer to the ubiquitous setting of supervised learning with cross-entropy minimization. We prove that even in standard classification tasks, models learn representations of ground-truth factors of variation up to a linear transformation. We corroborate our theoretical contribution with a series of empirical studies. First, using simulated data matching our theoretical assumptions, we demonstrate successful disentanglement of latent factors. Second, we show that on DisLib, a widely-used disentanglement benchmark, simple classification tasks recover latent structures up to linear transformations. Finally, we reveal that models trained on ImageNet encode representations that permit linear decoding of proxy factors of variation. Together, our theoretical findings and experiments offer a compelling explanation for recent observations of linear representations, such as superposition in neural networks. This work takes a significant step toward a cohesive theory that accounts for the unreasonable effectiveness of supervised deep learning.</description>

      <title>Provable Acceleration for Diffusion Models under Minimal Assumptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While score-based diffusion models have achieved exceptional sampling quality, their sampling speeds are often limited by the high computational burden of score function evaluations. Despite the recent remarkable empirical advances in speeding up the score-based samplers, theoretical understanding of acceleration techniques remains largely limited. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel training-free acceleration scheme for stochastic samplers. Under minimal assumptions -- namely, $L^2$-accurate score estimates and a finite second-moment condition on the target distribution -- our accelerated sampler provably achieves $\varepsilon$-accuracy in total variation within $\widetilde{O}(d^{5/4}/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ iterations, thereby significantly improving upon the $\widetilde{O}(d/\varepsilon)$ iteration complexity of standard score-based samplers. Notably, our convergence theory does not rely on restrictive assumptions on the target distribution or higher-order score estimation guarantees.</description>

      <title>Identifying General Mechanism Shifts in Linear Causal Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the linear causal representation learning setting where we observe a linear mixing of $d$ unknown latent factors, which follow a linear structural causal model. Recent work has shown that it is possible to recover the latent factors as well as the underlying structural causal model over them, up to permutation and scaling, provided that we have at least $d$ environments, each of which corresponds to perfect interventions on a single latent node (factor). After this powerful result, a key open problem faced by the community has been to relax these conditions: allow for coarser than perfect single-node interventions, and allow for fewer than $d$ of them, since the number of latent factors $d$ could be very large. In this work, we consider precisely such a setting, where we allow a smaller than $d$ number of environments, and also allow for very coarse interventions that can very coarsely \textit{change the entire causal graph over the latent factors}. On the flip side, we relax what we wish to extract to simply the \textit{list of nodes that have shifted between one or more environments}. We provide a surprising identifiability result that it is indeed possible, under some very mild standard assumptions, to identify the set of shifted nodes. Our identifiability proof moreover is a constructive one: we explicitly provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a node to be a shifted node, and show that we can check these conditions given observed data. Our algorithm lends itself very naturally to the sample setting where instead of just interventional distributions, we are provided datasets of samples from each of these distributions. We corroborate our results on both synthetic experiments as well as an interesting psychometric dataset. The code can be found at https://github.com/TianyuCodings/iLCS.</description>
