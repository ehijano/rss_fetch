      <title>In beam performances of the MIMOSIS-2.1 CMOS Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MIMOSIS is a CMOS Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor developed to equip the Micro Vertex Detector of the Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment at FAIR/GSI. The sensor will combine an excellent spatial precision of $5~\mu m$ with a time resolution of $5~\mu s$ and provide a peak hit rate capability of $\mathrm{\sim 80~ MHz/cm^2}$. To fulfill its task, MIMOSIS will have to withstand ionising radiation doses of $\sim 5~ \mathrm{MRad}$ and fluences of $\sim 7 \times 10^{13}~\mathrm{n_{eq}/cm^2}$ per year of operation.
  This paper introduces the reticle size full feature sensor prototype MIMOSIS-2.1, which was improved with respect to earlier prototypes by adding on-chip grouping circuts and by improving the analog power grid. Moreover, it features for a first time a $50~\mu m$ epitaxial layer, which is found to improve the performances of the non-irradiated device significantly. We discuss the in beam sensor performances as measured during beam tests at the CERN-SPS.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the detector response and calibration function of metallic microcalorimeters for X-ray photons and external electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallic microcalorimeters (MMCs) are cryogenic single-particle detectors that rely on a calorimetric detection principle. Due to their excellent energy resolution, close-to-ideal linear detector response, fast signal rise time and the potential for \SI{100}{\%} quantum efficiency, MMCs outperform conventional detectors by several orders of magnitude in resolution. These attributes make them particularly interesting for a broad spectrum of applications, including a next-generation neutrino mass experiment based on the measurement of the tritium beta-decay spectrum, with an objective of achieving a sensitivity surpassing that of the pioneering KATRIN experiment. However, although MMCs have been used in measurements of photons and heavy ions with great success, no information is currently available on the interaction between MMCs and external light charged particles such as electrons. This work aims to provide such missing information and to demonstrate that MMC-based detectors are suitable for high-resolution spectroscopy of external electron sources. Particularly, we present the first-ever measurements of external electrons using a metallic microcalorimeter, comprehensively discuss the characteristics of the signal shape and the calibration function and give a direct comparison between well-defined conversion electron and X-ray photon signals from the same $^{83}$Rb/$^{83m}$Kr source.</description>

      <title>Quality control of PEN wavelength shifters for DarkSide-20k veto</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient Wavelength Shifters (WLS) are crucial for liquid Argon (LAr) dark matter detectors. As they grow larger in volume, the scalability of WLS becomes an important concern. Tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB), which is the most common WLS in use, requires to be deposited with vacuum evaporation and becomes impractical for detectors with very large surface area due to its high cost and energy requirements. The neutron veto of the DarkSide-20k detector will utilise nearly 200 m^2 of polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) wavelength shifter, available in form of large format polymeric foils, a convenient alternative to TPB. For quality assurance purposes, one needs to test multiple PEN samples from the DarkSide-20k production batch at cryogenic temperatures. For this purpose, a new Argon Gas Setup (ArGSet) has been recently commissioned. In this setup, we exploit the Argon scintillation (128 nm) as excitation for measuring the wavelength shifting efficiency of the samples. In this work, we will present the results of the first measurements performed with this setup.</description>

      <title>Event Vision Sensor: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By monitoring temporal contrast, event-based vision sensors can provide high temporal resolution and low latency while maintaining low power consumption and simplicity in circuit structure. These characteristics have garnered significant attention in both academia and industry. In recent years, the application of back-illuminated (BSI) technology, wafer stacking techniques, and industrial interfaces has brought new opportunities for enhancing the performance of event-based vision sensors. This is evident in the substantial advancements made in reducing noise, improving resolution, and increasing readout rates. Additionally, the integration of these technologies has enhanced the compatibility of event-based vision sensors with current and edge vision systems, providing greater possibilities for their practical applications. This paper will review the progression from neuromorphic engineering to state-of-the-art event-based vision sensor technologies, including their development trends, operating principles, and key features. Moreover, we will delve into the sensitivity of event-based vision sensors and the opportunities and challenges they face in the realm of infrared imaging, providing references for future research and applications.</description>

      <title>The H2M Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor - characterizing non-uniform in-pixel response in a 65 nm CMOS imaging technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high energy physics community recently gained access to the TPSCo 65 nm ISC (Image Sensor CMOS), which enables a higher in-pixel logic density in monolithic active pixel sensors (MAPS) compared to processes with larger feature sizes. To explore this novel technology, the Hybrid-to-Monolithic (H2M) test chip has been designed and manufactured. The design followed a digital-on-top design workflow and ports a hybrid pixel-detector architecture, with digital pulse processing in each pixel, into a monolithic chip. The chip matrix consists of 64$\times$16 square pixels with a size of 35$\times$35 um2, and a total active area of approximately 1.25 um2. The chip has been successfully integrated into the Caribou DAQ system. It is fully functional, and the measured threshold dispersion and noise agree with the expectation from front-end simulations. However, a non-uniform in-pixel response related to the size and location of the n-wells in the analog circuitry has been observed in test beam measurements and will be discussed in this contribution. This asymmetry in the pixel response, enhanced by the 35 um pixel pitch - larger than in other prototypes - and certain features of the readout circuit, has not been observed in prototypes with smaller pixel pitches in this technology.</description>

      <title>Transient studies using a TCAD and Allpix Squared combination approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of the TANGERINE project is to develop the next generation of monolithic silicon pixel detectors using a 65 nm CMOS imaging process, which offers a higher logic density and overall lower power consumption compared to previously used processes. A combination of Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations is used to understand the physical processes within the sensing element and thus the overall performance of the pixel detector. The response of the sensors can then be tested in laboratory and test beam facilities and compared to simulation results. Transient simulations allow for studying the response of the sensor as a function of time, such as the signal produced after a charged particle passes through the sensor. The study of these signals is important to understand the magnitude and timing of the response from the sensors and improve upon them. While TCAD simulations are accurate, the time required to produce a single pulse is large compared to a combination of MC and TCAD simulations. In this work, a validation of the transient simulation approach and studies on charge collection are presented.</description>

      <title>Higgs-mode-induced instability and kinetic inductance in strongly dc-biased dirty-limit superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A perturbative ac field superposed on a dc bias ($J_b$) is known to excite the Higgs mode in superconductors. The dirty limit, where disorder enhances the Higgs resonance, provides an ideal setting for this study and is also relevant to many superconducting devices operating under strong dc biases. In this paper, we derive a general formula for the complex conductivity of disordered superconductors under an arbitrary dc bias using the Keldysh-Usadel theory of nonequilibrium superconductivity. This formula is relatively simple, making it more accessible to a broader research community. Our analysis reveals that in a strongly dc-biased dirty-limit superconductor, the Higgs mode induces an instability in the homogeneous superflow within a specific frequency window, making the high-current-carrying state vulnerable to ac perturbations. This instability, which occurs exclusively in the ${\rm ac} \parallel {\rm dc}$ configuration, leads to a non-monotonic dependence of kinetic inductance on frequency and bias strength. By carefully tuning the dc bias and the frequency of the ac perturbation, the kinetic inductance can be enhanced by nearly two orders of magnitude. In the weak dc bias regime, our formula recovers the well-known quadratic dependence, $L_k \propto 1+ C(J_b/J_{\rm dp})^2$, with coefficients $C=0.409$ for ${\rm ac} \parallel {\rm dc}$ and $C=0.136$ for ${\rm ac} \perp {\rm dc}$, where $J_{\rm dp}$ is the equilibrium depairing current density. These findings establish a robust theoretical framework for dc-biased superconducting systems and suggest that Higgs mode physics could be exploited in the design and optimization of superconducting detectors. Moreover, they may lead to a yet-to-be-explored detector concept based on Higgs mode physics.</description>

      <title>Convolutional Neural Network-Based Neutron and Gamma Discrimination in EJ-276 for Low-Energy Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Organic scintillators are important in advancing nuclear detection and particle physics experiments. Achieving a high signal-to-noise ratio necessitates efficient pulse shape discrimination techniques to accurately distinguish between neutrons, gamma rays, and other particles within scintillator detectors. Although traditional charge comparison methods perform adequately for ~MeVee particles, their efficacy is significantly reduced in the lower energy region(&lt;200 keVee). This paper introduces a particle identification method that harnesses the power of a convolutional neural network. We focused on the convolutional neural network's exceptional ability to discriminate between neutrons and gamma rays in the low-energy spectrum, utilizing a setup comprising a plastic scintillator EJ-276 and Silicon photomultiplier readout. Our findings reveal remarkable accuracies of 97.3% and 98.6% in the 0~100 keVee and 100~200 keVee energy ranges, respectively. These results represent substantial improvements of 13.8% and 4.25% over conventional methods. The enhanced discrimination power of the convolutional neural network method opens new frontiers for the application of organic scintillation detectors in low-energy rare event searches, including dark matter and neutrino detection.</description>

      <title>Development of ion-beam sputtered silicon nitride thin films for low-noise mirror coatings of gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brownian thermal noise of thin-film coatings is a fundamental limit for high-precision experiments based on optical resonators such as gravitational-wave interferometers. Here we present the results of a research activity aiming to develop lower-noise ion-beam sputtered silicon nitride thin films compliant with the very stringent requirements on optical loss of gravitational-wave interferometers.
  In order to test the hypothesis of a correlation between the synthesis conditions of the films and their elemental composition and optical and mechanical properties, we varied the voltage, current intensity and composition of the sputtering ion beam, and we performed a broad campaign of characterizations. While the refractive index was found to monotonically depend on the beam voltage and linearly vary with the N/Si ratio, the optical absorption appeared to be strongly sensitive to other factors, as yet unidentified. However, by systematically varying the deposition parameters, an optimal working point was found. Thus we show that the loss angle and extinction coefficient of our thin films can be as low as $(1.0 \pm 0.1) \times 10^{-4}$ rad at $\sim$2.8 kHz and $(6.4 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{-6}$ at 1064 nm, respectively, after thermal treatment at 900 $^{\circ}$C. To the best of our knowledge, such loss angle value is the lowest ever measured on this class of thin films.
  We then used our silicon nitride thin films to design and produce a multi-material mirror coating showing a thermal noise amplitude of $(10.3 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{-18}$ m Hz$^{-1/2}$ at 100 Hz, which is 25\% lower than in current mirror coatings of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo interferometers, and an optical absorption as low as $(1.6 \pm 0.5)$ parts per million at 1064 nm.</description>

      <title>Self-compensating Light Calorimetry with Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber for GeV Neutrino Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) is a powerful dual calorimeter capable of estimating particle energy from both ionization charge and scintillation light. Our study shows that, due to the recombination luminescence, the LArTPC functions as a self-compensating light calorimeter: the missing energy in the hadronic component is compensated for by the increased luminescence relative to the electromagnetic component. Using 0.5--5 GeV electron neutrino charged current interactions as a case study, we show that good compensation of the electron-to-hadron response ratio (e/h) from 1--1.05 can be achieved across a broad range of drift electric fields (0.2--1.8 kV/cm), with better performance for neutrino energies above 2 GeV. This study highlights the potential of light calorimetry in LArTPCs for GeV neutrino energy reconstruction, complementing traditional charge calorimetry. Under ideal conditions of uniform light collection, we show that LArTPC light calorimetry can achieve an energy resolution comparable to the charge imaging calorimetry. Challenges arising from nonuniform light collection in large LArTPCs can be mitigated with a position-dependent light yield correction derived from 3D charge signal imaging.</description>

      <title>A High Precision Time Measurement Method Based on Frequency-domain Phase-Fitting for Nuclear Pulse Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a high-precision time measurement method based on digital frequency-domain phase-fitting (DFPF) by using the digitized nuclear pulses. The averaging effect inherent in the frequency-domain cross-correlation and phase-fitting processes effectively minimizes measurement errors, thereby ensuring high precision and resolution in time interval measurements. In this paper, the theory of this DFPF-based time measurement method is analyzed, and an electronics prototype is designed to validate the feasibility of the proposed method by utilizing ADCs for pulse digitization and an FPGA for phase fitting implementation. The test results indicate that, under ideal conditions with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 64 dB, this method achieves time measurement precisions of 50 ps, 18 ps, and 2.9 ps RMS, corresponding to different Gaussian pulse widths and sampling rates of 118 ns at 40 MSPS, 10 ns at 100 MSPS, and 3 ns at 500 MSPS, respectively. The precision improves with increasing pulse bandwidth. Furthermore, in practical cosmic ray tests, the method achieved favorable timing performance with a precision of 1.7 ns RMS. These results demonstrate that this proposed method has the potential to be a high-precision time measurement for particle detection and is equally applicable to other advanced time measurement scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Novel Low-Background Photomultiplier Tube Developed for Xenon Based Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are essential in xenon detectors like PandaX, LZ, and XENON experiments for dark matter searches and neutrino properties measurement. To minimize PMT-induced backgrounds, stringent requirements on PMT radioactivity are crucial. A novel 2-inch low-background R12699 PMT has been developed through a collaboration between the PandaX team and Hamamatsu Photonics K.K. corporation. Radioactivity measurements conducted with a high-purity germanium detector show levels of approximately 0.08 mBq/PMT for $\rm^{60}Co$ and 0.06~mBq/PMT for the $\rm^{238}U$ late chain, achieving a 15-fold reduction compared to R11410 PMT used in PandaX-4T. The radon emanation rate is below 3.2 $\rm \mu$Bq/PMT (@90\% confidence level), while the surface $\rm^{210}Po$ activity is less than 18.4 $\mu$Bq/cm$^2$. The electrical performance of these PMTs at cryogenic temperature was evaluated. With an optimized readout base, the gain was enhanced by 30\%, achieving an average gain of $4.23 \times 10^6$ at -1000~V and -100~$^{\circ}$C. The dark count rate averaged 2.5~Hz per channel. Compactness, low radioactivity, and robust electrical performance in the cryogenic temperature make the R12699 PMT ideal for next-generation liquid xenon detectors and other rare event searches.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Multiple Channels Room Temperature Readout Electronics for Large Transition-Edge Sensor Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07603</link>

Abstract: Transition-edge sensor (TES) is a highly sensitive device that is capable of detecting extremely low levels of energy. It is characterised by low noise performance and high energy resolution. A mature method for reading out TES signal is through time-division multiplexing (TDM) direct current superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). In a TDM system, the signal readout chain represents a significant source of noise other than the TES intrinsic noise. The noise generated by TES is in the range of several tens to several hundreds of $pA/\sqrt{Hz}$. In order to ensure the high energy resolution of TES, it is necessary to ensure that the noise contribution from the room temperature readout electronics is less than $10$ $pA/\sqrt{Hz}$ above 100 $Hz$. In this work, we have designed a low-noise, high-resolution room temperature readout circuit for TDM. The equivalent current noise contribution of ADC is about $0.05$ $pA/\sqrt{Hz}$ above 100 $Hz$ and $0.46$ $pA\sqrt{Hz}$ under 30:1 multiplexing. The resolution of the analog to digital converter (ADC) is larger than 11.5 bits, which can reconstruct the TES signal without distortion. The readout board, which has eight channels, has JESD204B serial ports, which has greatly simplified the space of room temperature electronics. The readout chain is based on multi-threaded CPU processing and can transfer data at 2 $Gbps$ for each channel in real time. This readout board can be used in a TDM system with smaller size for large TES arrays.</description>

      <title>Bounds on heavy axions with an X-ray free electron laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17333v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new exclusion bounds obtained at the European X-ray Free Electron Laser facility (EuXFEL) on axion-like particles (ALPs) in the mass range 10^{-3} eV &lt; m_a &lt; 10^4 eV. Our experiment exploits the Primakoff effect via which photons can, in the presence of a strong external electric field, decay into axions, which then convert back into photons after passing through an opaque wall. While similar searches have been performed previously at a 3^rd generation synchrotron, our work demonstrates improved sensitivity, exploiting the higher brightness of X-rays at EuXFEL.</description>

      <title>Self-aligned multilayered nitrogen vacancy diamond nanoparticles for high spatial resolution magnetometry of microelectronic currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen Vacancy diamond nanoparticles (NVNPs) are increasingly integrated with methods for optical detection of magnetic resonance (ODMR), providing new opportunities in magnetic characterization that span the visualization of magnetic fields in microelectronic circuits, environmental sensing and biology. However, only a small number of studies utilize aggregates of NVNPs for surface-wide magnetometry being that spin orientations in aggregate NVNPs are inherently misaligned, precluding their use for proper magnetic field detection compared with expensive monocrystalline diamonds. A postprocessing method for layering NVNPs with aligned NV center orientations can potentially facilitate superior NV magnetometry by allowing sensitive detection combined with simplified probe preparation. We present a novel technology for creating densely stacked monolayers of NVNP with inherent interlayer alignment for sensitive measurement of local magnetic field perturbations in microelectronic traces. We establish spatial characteristics of deposited aggregates and demonstrate their ability to capture magnetic dipoles from conducting microwires via ODMR. Our approach forms a novel accessible protocol that can be used for broad applications in micromagnetometry.</description>
