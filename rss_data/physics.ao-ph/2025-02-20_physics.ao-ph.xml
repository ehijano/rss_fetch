      <title>CondensNet: Enabling stable long-term climate simulations via hybrid deep learning models with adaptive physical constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient climate simulations are crucial for understanding Earth's evolving climate. However, current general circulation models (GCMs) face challenges in capturing unresolved physical processes, such as cloud and convection. A common solution is to adopt cloud resolving models, that provide more accurate results than the standard subgrid parametrisation schemes typically used in GCMs. However, cloud resolving models, also referred to as super paramtetrizations, remain computationally prohibitive. Hybrid modeling, which integrates deep learning with equation-based GCMs, offers a promising alternative but often struggles with long-term stability and accuracy issues. In this work, we find that water vapor oversaturation during condensation is a key factor compromising the stability of hybrid models. To address this, we introduce CondensNet, a novel neural network architecture that embeds a self-adaptive physical constraint to correct unphysical condensation processes. CondensNet effectively mitigates water vapor oversaturation, enhancing simulation stability while maintaining accuracy and improving computational efficiency compared to super parameterization schemes.
  We integrate CondensNet into a GCM to form PCNN-GCM (Physics-Constrained Neural Network GCM), a hybrid deep learning framework designed for long-term stable climate simulations in real-world conditions, including ocean and land. PCNN-GCM represents a significant milestone in hybrid climate modeling, as it shows a novel way to incorporate physical constraints adaptively, paving the way for accurate, lightweight, and stable long-term climate simulations.</description>

      <title>Increasing NWP Thunderstorm Predictability Using Ensemble Data and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are essential for forecasting thunderstorms hours in advance, NWP uncertainty, which increases with lead time, limits the predictability of thunderstorm occurrence. This study investigates how ensemble NWP data and machine learning (ML) can enhance the skill of thunderstorm forecasts. Using our recently introduced neural network model, SALAMA 1D, which identifies thunderstorm occurrence in operational forecasts of the convection-permitting ICON-D2-EPS model for Central Europe, we demonstrate that ensemble-averaging significantly improves forecast skill. Notably, an 11-hour ensemble forecast matches the skill level of a 5-hour deterministic forecast. To explain this improvement, we derive an analytic expression linking skill differences to correlations between ensemble members, which aligns with observed performance gains. This expression generalizes to any binary classification model that processes ensemble members individually. Additionally, we show that ML models like SALAMA 1D can identify patterns of thunderstorm occurrence which remain predictable for longer lead times compared to raw NWP output. Our findings quantitatively explain the benefits of ensemble-averaging and encourage the development of ML methods for thunderstorm forecasting and beyond.</description>

      <title>A Study on Monthly Marine Heatwave Forecasts in New Zealand: An Investigation of Imbalanced Regression Loss Functions with Neural Network Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are extreme ocean-temperature events with significant impacts on marine ecosystems and related industries. Accurate forecasts (one to six months ahead) of MHWs would aid in mitigating these impacts. However, forecasting MHWs presents a challenging imbalanced regression task due to the rarity of extreme temperature anomalies in comparison to more frequent moderate conditions. In this study, we examine monthly MHW forecasts for 12 locations around New Zealand. We use a fully-connected neural network and compare standard and specialized regression loss functions, including the mean squared error (MSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), the Huber, the weighted MSE, the focal-R, the balanced MSE, and a proposed scaling-weighted MSE. Results show that (i) short lead times (one month) are considerably more predictable than three- and six-month leads, (ii) models trained with the standard MSE or MAE losses excel at forecasting average conditions but struggle to capture extremes, and (iii) specialized loss functions such as the balanced MSE and our scaling-weighted MSE substantially improve forecasting of MHW and suspected MHW events. These findings underscore the importance of tailored loss functions for imbalanced regression, particularly in forecasting rare but impactful events such as MHWs.</description>

      <title>A Lagrangian Perspective on the Growth of Midlatitude Storms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extratropical storms dominate midlatitude climate and weather and are known to grow baroclinicaly and decay barotropicaly. Traditionally, quantitative climatic measures of storm growth have been mostly based on Eulerian measures, taking into account the mean state of the atmosphere and how those affect eddy growth, but they do not consider the Lagrangian growth of the storms themselves. Here, using ERA-5 reanalysis data and tracking all extratropical storms (cyclones and anticyclones) from 83 years of data, we examine the actual growth of the storms and compare it to the Eulerian characteristics of the mean state as the storms develop. In the limit of weak baroclinicity, we find that baroclinicity provides a good measure for storm maximum intensity. However, this monotonic relationship breaks for high baroclinicity levels. We show that although the actual growth rate of individual storms monotonically increases with baroclinicity, the reduction in maximum intensity at high baroclinicity is caused by a decrease in storm growth time. Based on the Lagrangian analysis, we suggest a nonlinear correction to the traditional linear connection between baroclinicity and storms' activity. Then, we show that a simplified model of storm growth, incorporating the baroclinicity effect on the vertical tilt of anomalies, reproduces the observed nonlinear relationship. Expanding the analysis to include the mean flow's barotropic properties highlights their marginal effect on storm growth rate, but the crucial impact on growth time. Our results emphasize the potential of Lagrangianly studying storm dynamics to advance understanding of the midlatitude climate.</description>

      <title>Near-inertial echoes of ageostrophic instability in submesoscale filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ocean submesoscales, flows with characteristic size around 10m--10km, are transitional between the larger, rotationally-constrained mesoscale and three-dimensional turbulence. In this paper we present simulations of a submesoscale ocean filament. The strong vertical transport associated with submesoscale fronts and filaments ventilates the deeper water and provides a route for the observed forward cascade of energy in the ocean. In our case, the filament is strongly sheared in both vertical and cross-filament directions and is unstable. Instability indeed dominates the early behaviour with a fast extraction of kinetic energy from the vertically sheared thermal wind. The filament is expected to be subject to instabilities, including symmetric and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. An instability emerges with a circulation that does not match either, though symmetric modes become apparent later. The action of the instability is sufficiently rapid that the filament does not respond in a geostrophically balanced sense. Instead, it later exhibits vertically sheared near-inertial oscillations with higher amplitude as the initial minimum Richardson number decreases. Horizontal gradients strengthen only briefly as the fronts restratify. These unstable filaments can be generated by strong mixing events at pre-existing stable structures. The oscillations must also be considered when designing initial conditions for numerical experiments of submesoscale flows, where the initial state is intended to be balanced.</description>
