      <title>Rigidity of compact rank one symmetric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider rigidity properties of compact symmetric spaces $X$ with metric $g_0$ of rank one. Suppose $g$ is another Riemannian metric on $X$ with sectional curvature $\kappa$ bounded by $0 \leq \kappa \leq 1$. If $g$ equals $g_0$ outside a convex proper subset of $X$, then $g$ is isometric with $g_0$. We also exhibit examples of surfaces showing that the nonnegativity of the curvature is needed. Our main result complements earlier results on other symmetric spaces by Gromov and Schroeder-Ziller.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Seiberg-Witten theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study equivariant Seiberg-Witten invariants for $4$-manifolds equipped with a smooth action of a finite group $G$. Our invariants come in two types: cohomological, valued in the group cohomology of $G$ and $K$-theoretic, valued in the representation ring of $G$. We establish basic properties of the invariants such as wall-crossing and vanishing of the invariants for $G$-invariant positive scalar curvature metrics. We establish a relation between the equivariant Seiberg-Witten invariants and families Seiberg-Witten invariants. Sufficient conditions are found under which equivariant transversality can be achieved leading to smooth moduli spaces on which $G$ acts. In the zero-dimensional case this yields a further invariant of the $G$-action valued in a refinement of the Burnside ring of $G$. We prove localisation formulas in cohomology and $K$-theory, relating the equivariant Seiberg-Witten invariants to moduli spaces of $G$-invariant solutions. We give an explicit formula for the invariants for holomorphic group actions on K\"ahler surfaces. We also prove a gluing formula for the invariants of equivariant connected sums. Various applications and consequences of the theory are considered.</description>

      <title>Limits of manifolds with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, as a continuation of \cite{YZ:inrdius},we develop the geometry of the limit spaces of compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary, where we assume a lower sectional curvature bound,two sides bounds on the second fundamental forms of boundaries and an upper diameter bound. We mainly focus on the general case of non inradius collapse/convergence, where inradii of manifolds are uniformly bounded away from zero. In this case, many limit spaces have wild geometry, which arise from the boundary behavior of manifolds.Therefore the study of boundary singular points is a key to understand such limit spaces. We also present some global convergence/collapsing results.</description>

      <title>Volume forms on balanced manifolds and the Calabi-Yau equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the space of mixed-volume forms on a balanced manifold endowed with an $L^2$ metric. A geodesic equation can be derived in this space that has an interesting structure and extends the equation of Donaldson and Chen-He in the space of volume forms on a Riemannian manifold. This nonlinear PDE is studied in detail and the existence of weak solution is shown for the Dirichlet problem, under a positivity assumption. Later we study the Calabi-Yau equation for balanced metrics and introduce a geometric criteria for prescribing volume forms that is closely related to the positivity assumption above. By deriving $C^0$ a priori estimates, we show that the existence of solutions can be established under this assumption</description>

      <title>Volumes of Bott-Chern classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the volumes of transcendental and possibly non-closed Bott-Chern $(1,1)$-classes on an arbitrary compact complex manifold $X$. We show that the latter belongs to the class $\mathcal{C}$ of Fujiki if and only if it has the $\textit{bounded mass property}$ -- i.e., its Monge-Amp\`ere volumes have a uniform upper-bound -- and there exists a closed Bott-Chern class with positive volume. This yields a positive answer to a conjecture of Demailly-P\u{a}un-Boucksom. To this end we extend to the hermitian context the notion of non-pluripolar products of currents, allowing for the latter to be merely ${\it quasi}$-${\it closed}$ and ${\it quasi}$-${\it positive}$. We establish a quasi-monotonicity property of Monge-Amp\`ere masses, and moreover show the existence of solutions to degenerate complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations in big classes, together with uniform a priori estimates. This extends to the hermitian context fundamental results of Boucksom-Eyssidieux-Guedj-Zeriahi.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a curvature map $S\colon U\longrightarrow K(\mathfrak{g})$ to arise from the curvature tensor of a torsion-free connection on a sufficiently small $U'\subset U$ by using a suitable power series approach. This torsion-free connection is uniquely given. The curvature map $S$ is used to effectively compute the holonomy of this connection.</description>

      <title>Can you hear the Planck mass?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the Laplacian of an $n$-Riemannian manifold $X$, the Weyl law states that the $k$-th eigenvalue is asymptotically proportional to $(k/V)^{2/n}$, where $V$ is the volume of $X$. We show that this result can be derived via physical considerations by demanding that the gravitational potential for a compactification on $X$ behaves in the expected $(4+n)$-dimensional way at short distances. In simple product compactifications, when particle motion on $X$ is ergodic, for large $k$ the eigenfunctions oscillate around a constant, and the argument is relatively straightforward. The Weyl law thus allows to reconstruct the four-dimensional Planck mass from the asymptotics of the masses of the spin 2 Kaluza--Klein modes. For warped compactifications, a puzzle appears: the Weyl law still depends on the ordinary volume $V$, while the Planck mass famously depends on a weighted volume obtained as an integral of the warping function. We resolve this tension by arguing that in the ergodic case the eigenfunctions oscillate now around a power of the warping function rather than around a constant, a property that we call weighted quantum ergodicity. This has implications for the problem of gravity localization, which we discuss. We show that for spaces with D$p$-brane singularities the spectrum is discrete only for $p =6,7,8$, and for these cases we rigorously prove the Weyl law by applying modern techniques from RCD theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we completely settle the Almgren problem in $\mathbb R^3$ under some generic conditions on the potential and tension functions. The problem, among other things, appears in classical thermodynamics when one is to understand if minimizing the free energy with convex potential and under a mass constraint generates a convex crystal. Our new idea in proving a three-dimensional convexity theorem is to utilize a stability theorem when $m$ is small, convexity when $m$ is small, and the first variation PDE with a new maximum principle approach.</description>

      <title>Conformal Transformation of Kernels: A Geometric Perspective on Text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we investigate the effects of conformal transformations on kernel functions used in Support Vector Machines. Our focus lies in the task of text document categorization, which involves assigning each document to a particular category. We introduce a new Gaussian Cosine kernel alongside two conformal transformations. Building upon previous studies that demonstrated the efficacy of conformal transformations in increasing class separability on synthetic and low-dimensional datasets, we extend this analysis to the high-dimensional domain of text data. Our experiments, conducted on the Reuters dataset on two types of binary classification tasks, compare the performance of Linear, Gaussian, and Gaussian Cosine kernels against their conformally transformed counterparts. The findings indicate that conformal transformations can significantly improve kernel performance, particularly for sub-optimal kernels. Specifically, improvements were observed in 60% of the tested scenarios for the Linear kernel, 84% for the Gaussian kernel, and 80% for the Gaussian Cosine kernel. In light of these findings, it becomes clear that conformal transformations play a pivotal role in enhancing kernel performance, offering substantial benefits.</description>

      <title>Smooth orbit equivalence rigidity for dissipative geodesic flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a smooth closed orientable surface. A Gaussian thermostat on $M$ can be seen as the geodesic flow of a certain metric connection with torsion. These flows may not preserve any smooth volume form. We prove that if two Gaussian thermostats on $M$ with negative thermostat curvature are related by a smooth orbit equivalence isotopic to the identity, then the two background metrics are conformally equivalent via a smooth diffeomorphism of $M$ isotopic to the identity. We also give a relationship between the thermostat forms themselves. Finally, we prove the same result for Anosov magnetic flows.</description>

Abstract: We prove the existence of viscosity solutions to complex Hessian equations on a compact Hermitian manifold that satisfy a determinant domination condition. This viscosity solution is shown to be unique when the right hand is strictly monotone increasing in terms of the solution. When the right hand side does not depend on the solution, we reduces it to the strict monotonicity of the solvability constant.</description>

Abstract: We study the global topology of the space $\mathcal L$ of loops of contactomorphisms of a non-orderable closed contact manifold $(M^{2n+1}, \alpha)$. We filter $\mathcal L$ by a quantitative measure of the ``positivity'' of the loops and describe the topology of $\mathcal L$ in terms of the subspaces of the filtration. In particular, we show that the homotopy groups of $\mathcal L$ are subgroups of the homotopy groups of the subspace of positive loops $\mathcal L^+$. We obtain analogous results for the space of loops of Legendrian submanifolds in $(M^{2n+1}, \alpha)$.</description>

      <title>Hardness of Learning Neural Networks under the Manifold Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The manifold hypothesis presumes that high-dimensional data lies on or near a low-dimensional manifold. While the utility of encoding geometric structure has been demonstrated empirically, rigorous analysis of its impact on the learnability of neural networks is largely missing. Several recent results have established hardness results for learning feedforward and equivariant neural networks under i.i.d. Gaussian or uniform Boolean data distributions. In this paper, we investigate the hardness of learning under the manifold hypothesis. We ask which minimal assumptions on the curvature and regularity of the manifold, if any, render the learning problem efficiently learnable. We prove that learning is hard under input manifolds of bounded curvature by extending proofs of hardness in the SQ and cryptographic settings for Boolean data inputs to the geometric setting. On the other hand, we show that additional assumptions on the volume of the data manifold alleviate these fundamental limitations and guarantee learnability via a simple interpolation argument. Notable instances of this regime are manifolds which can be reliably reconstructed via manifold learning. Looking forward, we comment on and empirically explore intermediate regimes of manifolds, which have heterogeneous features commonly found in real world data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.07560v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let the circle group act on a 6-dimensional compact oriented manifold $M$ with isolated fixed points. The fixed point data of $M$ is the collection of signs and weights at the fixed points. To classify such a manifold $M$, the fixed point data is an essential information. Under an assumption that each isotropy submanifold is orientable, we classify the fixed point data of $M$, by showing that we can convert it to the empty collection by performing a combination of a number of types of operations. We do so by proving that we can successively take equivariant connected sums of $M$ at fixed points with $S^6$, $\mathbb{CP}^3$, and 6-dimensional analogue $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ of the Hirzebruch surfaces (and these with opposite orientations), to a fixed point free action on a compact oriented 6-manifold.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we introduce Morse Lie groupoid morphisms and study their main properties. We show that this notion is Morita invariant which gives rise to a well defined notion of Morse function on differentiable stacks. We show a groupoid version of the Morse lemma which is used to describe the topological behavior of the critical subgroupoid levels of a Morse Lie groupoid morphism around its nondegenerate critical orbits. We also prove Morse type inequalities for certain separated differentiable stacks and construct a Morse double complex whose total cohomology is isomorphic to the Bott-Shulman-Stasheff cohomology of the underlying Lie groupoid. We provide several examples and applications.</description>

Abstract: We give a construction of the spinor bundle of the loop space of a string manifold together with its fusion product, inspired by ideas from Stolz and Teichner. The spinor bundle is a super bimodule bundle for a bundle of Clifford von Neumann algebras over the free path space, and the fusion product is defined using Connes fusion of such bimodules. As the main result, we prove that a spinor bundle with fusion product on a manifold X exists if and only X admits a string structure.</description>

Abstract: We consider $G_2$ manifolds with a cohomogeneity two $\mathbb{T}^2\times \mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry group. We give a local characterization of these manifolds and we describe the geometry, including regularity and singularity analysis, of cohomogeneity one calibrated submanifolds in them. We apply these results to the manifolds recently constructed by Foscolo--Haskins--Nordstr\"om and to the Bryant--Salamon manifold of topology $S^3\times \mathbb{R}^4$. In particular, we describe new large families of complete $\mathbb{T}^2$-invariant associative submanifolds in them.</description>

Abstract: We apply the direct method of the calculus of variations to show that any nonplanar Frenet curve in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ can be extended to an infinitely narrow flat ribbon having minimal bending energy. We also show that, in general, minimizers are not free of planar points, yet such points must be isolated under the mild condition that the torsion does not vanish.</description>

      <title>Pseudolocality and completeness for nonnegative Ricci curvature limits of 3D singular Ricci flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lai (2021) used singular Ricci flows, introduced by Kleiner and Lott (2017), to construct a nonnegative Ricci curvature Ricci flow $g(t)$ emerging from an arbitrary 3D complete noncompact Riemannian manifold $(M^3, g_0)$ which has nonnegative Ricci curvature. We show $g(t)$ is complete for positive times provided $g_0$ satisfies a volume ratio lower bound that approaches zero at spatial infinity. Our proof combines a pseudolocality result of Lai (2021) for singular flows, together with a pseudolocality result of Hochard (2016) and Simon and Topping (2022) for nonsingular flows. We also show that the construction of complete nonnegative complex sectional curvature flows by Cabezas-Rivas and Wilking (2015) can be adapted here to show $g(t)$ is complete for positive times provided $g_0$ is a compactly supported perturbation of a nonnegative sectional curvature metric on $\mathbb{R}^3$.</description>

      <title>Monge-Amp\`ere type equation on compact Hermitian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a cohomology $(1,1)$-class $\{\beta\}$ of compact Hermitian manifold $(X,\omega)$ possessing a bounded potential and fixed a model potential $\phi$, motivated by Darvas-Di Nezza-Lu and Li-Wang-Zhou's work, we show that degenerate complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation $(\beta+dd^c \varphi)^n=e^{\lambda \varphi}\mu$ has a unique solution in the relative full mass class $\mathcal{E}(X,\beta,\phi)$, where $\mu$ is a non-pluripolar measure on $X$ and $\lambda\geq0$ is a fixed constant.
  As an application, we give an explicit description of Lelong numbers of elements in $\mathcal{E}(X,\beta,\phi)$ which generalized a theorem of Darvas-Di Nezza-Lu in the Hermitian context.</description>

      <title>Half Space Property in RCD(0,N) spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this note is to prove the Half Space Property for $RCD(0,N)$ spaces, namely that if $(X,d,m)$ is a parabolic $RCD(0,N)$ space and $ C \subset X \times \mathbb{R}$ is locally the boundary of a locally perimeter minimizing set and it is contained in a half space, then $C$ is a locally finite union of horizontal slices. If the assumption of local perimeter minimizing is strengthened into global perimeter minimizing, then the conclusion can be strengthened into uniqueness of the horizontal slice. As a consequence, we obtain oscillation estimates and a Half Space Theorem for minimal hypersurfaces in products $M \times \mathbb{R}$, where $M$ is a parabolic smooth manifold (possibly weighted and with boundary) with non-negative Ricci curvature. On the way of proving the main results, we also obtain some properties of Green's functions on $RCD(K,N)$ spaces that are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Continuous family of surfaces translating by powers of Gauss curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper shows the existence of convex translating surfaces under the flow by the $\alpha$-th power of Gauss curvature for the sub-affine-critical regime $ 0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1/4$. The key aspect of our study is that our ansatz at infinity is the graph of homogeneous functions whose level sets are closed curves shrinking under the flow by the $\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}$-th power of curvature. For each ansatz, we construct a family of translating surfaces generated by the Jacobi fields with effective growth rates. Moreover, the construction shows quantitative estimate on the rate of convergence between different translators to each other, which is required to show the continuity of the family. As a result, the family is regarded as a topological manifold. The construction in this paper will become the ground of forthcoming research, where we aim to prove that every translating surface must correspond to one of the solutions obtained herein, classifying translating surfaces and identifying the topology of the moduli space.</description>

Abstract: We prove a Minkowski type inequality for weakly mean convex and star-shaped hypersurfaces in warped cylinders which are asymptotically flat or hyperbolic. In particular, we show that this sharp inequality holds for outward minimizing hypersurfaces in the Schwarzschild manifold using the weak solution of the inverse mean curvature flow.</description>

      <title>Graphs for torus actions on oriented manifolds with isolated fixed points and classification in dimension 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.10190v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let a torus act on a compact oriented manifold $M$ with isolated fixed points, with an additional mild assumption that its isotropy submanifolds are orientable. We associate a signed labeled multigraph encoding the fixed point data (weights and signs at fixed points and isotropy submanifolds) of the manifold. We study operations on $M$ and its multigraph, (self) connected sum and blow up, etc. When the circle group acts on a 6-dimensional $M$, we classify such a multigraph by proving that we can convert it into the empty graph by successively applying two types of operations. In particular, this classifies the fixed point data of any such manifold. We prove this by showing that for any such manifold, we can successively take equivariant connected sums at fixed points with itself, $\mathbb{CP}^3$, and 6-dimensional analogue $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ of the Hirzebruch surfaces (and these with opposite orientations) to a fixed point free action on a compact oriented 6-manifold. We also classify a multigraph for a torus action on a 4-dimensional $M$.</description>

      <title>The prescribed mean curvature equation for $t$-graphs in the sub-Finsler Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^n$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.13414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the sub-Finsler prescribed mean curvature equation, associated to a strictly convex body $K_0 \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{2n}$, for $t$-graphs on a bounded domain $\Omega$ in the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^n$. When the prescribed datum $H$ is constant and strictly smaller that the Finsler mean curvature of $\partial \Omega$, we prove the existence of a Lipschitz solution to the Dirichlet problem for the sub-Finsler CMC equation by means of a Finsler approximation scheme.</description>

      <title>Fano varieties with large pseudoindex and non-free rational curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03438v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $n\geq 4$, let $X$ be a complex smooth Fano $n$-fold whose minimal anticanonical degree of non-free rational curves on $X$ is at least $n-2$. We classify extremal contractions of such varieties. As an application, we obtain a classification of Fano fourfolds with pseudoindex and Picard number greater than one. Combining this result with previous results, we complete the classification of smooth Fano $n$-folds with pseudoindex at least $n-2$ and Picard number greater than one. This can be seen as a generalization of various previous results. We also discuss the relations between pseudoindex and other invariants of Fano varieties.</description>

      <title>K-stability and large complex structure limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05291v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss how, under suitable assumptions, a K\"ahler test configuration admits a mirror Landau-Ginzburg model, giving a corresponding expression for the Donaldson-Futaki invariant as a residue pairing. We study the general behaviour of such mirror formulae under large scaling of the K\"ahler form. We exploit the observation that this scaling trivially preserves $K$-stability, but takes the mirror Landau-Ginzburg model to a large complex structure limit. In certain cases the mirror formulae for the Donaldson-Futaki invariant simplify in this limit. We focus on a special type of limiting behaviour, when the Donaldson-Futaki invariant concentrates at a single critical point of the Landau-Ginzburg potential, and show that this leads to new formulae for the Donaldson-Futaki invariant in terms of theta functions on the mirror. We provide a main application, which shows that such limiting behaviour actually occurs for test configurations in several nontrivial examples, both toric and non-toric, in the case of slope (in)stability for polarised surfaces.</description>

      <title>Calder\'on problem for systems via complex parallel transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Calder\'on problem for systems with unknown zeroth and first order terms, and improve on previously known results. More precisely, let $(M, g)$ be a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary, let $A$ be a connection matrix on $E = M \times \mathbb{C}^r$ and let $Q$ be a matrix potential. Let $\Lambda_{A, Q}$ be the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map of the associated connection Laplacian with a potential. Under the assumption that $(M, g)$ is isometrically contained in the interior of $(\mathbb{R}^2 \times M_0, c(e \oplus g_0))$, where $(M_0, g_0)$ is an arbitrary compact Riemannian manifold with boundary, $e$ is the Euclidean metric on $\mathbb{R}^2$, and $c &gt; 0$, we show that $\Lambda_{A, Q}$ uniquely determines $(A, Q)$ up to natural gauge invariances. This generalises earlier work of Eskin to anisotropic geometries. Moreover, we introduce new concepts of complex ray transform and complex parallel transport problem, and study their fundamental properties and relations to the Calder\'on problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the regularity and the growth rates of solutions to two-dimensional Monge-Amp\`ere equations with the right-hand side exhibiting polynomial growth. Utilizing this analysis, we demonstrate that the translators for the flow by sub-affine-critical powers of the Gauss curvature are smooth, strictly convex entire graphs. These graphs exhibit specific growth rates that depend solely on the power of the flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a remarkable series of works, Guo, Phong, Song, and Sturm have obtained key uniform estimates for the Green's functions associated with certain K\"ahler metrics. In this note, we broaden the scope of their techniques by removing one of their assumptions and allowing the complex structure to vary. We apply our results to various families of canonical K\"ahler metrics.</description>
