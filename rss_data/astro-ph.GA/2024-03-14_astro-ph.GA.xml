      <title>The Present-Day Mass Function of Star Clusters in the Solar Neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work analyses the present-day mass function (PDMF) of 93~star clusters utilizing Gaia DR3 data, with membership determined by the StarGo machine learning algorithm. The impact of unresolved binary systems on mass estimation is rigorously assessed, adopting three mass ratio profiles for correction. The PDMF is characterized by the power-law index, $\alpha$, derived through a robust maximum likelihood method that avoids biases associated with data binning. The value of $\alpha$ for stars between the completeness limited mass of Gaia with a mean 0.3 $M_\odot$ for our cluster samples and 2 $M_\odot$, exhibits stability for clusters younger than 200 Myr, decreasing for older clusters, particularly when considering stars within the half-mass radius. The PDMF of these star clusters is consistent with a dynamically evolved Kroupa IMF via the loss of low-mass stars. Cluster morphology shows a correlation with $\alpha$, as $\alpha$ values exhibit a decreasing trend from filamentary to tidal-tail clusters, mirroring the sequence of increasing cluster age. The dependence of $\alpha$ on total cluster mass is weak, with a subtle increase for higher-mass clusters, especially outside the half-mass radius. We do not observe a correlation between $\alpha$ and the mean metallicity of the clusters. Younger clusters have lower metallicity compared to their older counterparts, which indicates that the older clusters might have migrated to the solar neighbourhood from the inner disk. A comparison with numerical models incorporating a black hole population suggests the need for observations of distant, older, massive open clusters to determine whether or not they contain black holes.</description>

      <title>The High-Redshift Gas-Phase Mass-Metallicity Relation in FIRE-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unprecedented infrared spectroscopic capabilities of JWST have provided high-quality interstellar medium (ISM) metallicity measurements and enabled characterization of the gas-phase mass-metallicity relation (MZR) for galaxies at $z \gtrsim 5$ for the first time. We analyze the gas-phase MZR and its evolution in a high-redshift suite of FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations at $z=5-12$ and for stellar masses $M_* \sim 10^6-10^{10} \rm{M}_\odot$. These simulations implement a multi-channel stellar feedback model and produce broadly realistic galaxy properties, including when evolved to $z=0$. The simulations predict very weak redshift evolution of the MZR over the redshift range studied, with the normalization of the MZR increasing by less than $0.01$ dex as redshift decreases from $z = 12$ to $z=5$. The median MZR in the simulations is well-approximated as a constant power-law relation across this redshift range given by $\log(Z/Z_\odot) = 0.37\log(M_*/\rm{M}_\odot) - 4.3$. We find good agreement between our best-fit model and recent observations made by JWST at high redshift. The weak evolution of the MZR at $z &gt; 5$ contrasts with the evolution at $z \lesssim 3$, where increasing normalization of the MZR with decreasing redshift is observed and predicted by most models. The FIRE-2 simulations predict increasing scatter in the gas-phase MZR with decreasing stellar mass, in qualitative agreement with some observations.</description>

      <title>Does the Fundamental Metallicity Relation Evolve with Redshift? I: The Correlation Between Offsets from the Mass-Metallicity Relation and Star Formation Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scatter about the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) has a correlation with the star formation rate (SFR) of galaxies. The lack of evidence of evolution in correlated scatter at $z\lesssim2.5$ leads many to refer to the relationship between mass, metallicity, and SFR as the Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR). Yet, recent high-redshift ($z&gt;3$) JWST{} observations have challenged the fundamental (i.e., redshift-invariant) nature of the FMR. In this work, we show that the cosmological simulations Illustris, IllustrisTNG, and EAGLE all predict MZRs that exhibit scatter with a secondary dependence on SFR up to $z=8$. We introduce the concept of a ``strong'' FMR, where the strength of correlated scatter does not evolve with time, and a ``weak'' FMR, where there is some time evolution. We find that each simulation analysed has a weak FMR -- there is non-negligible evolution in the strength of the correlation with SFR. Furthermore, we show that the scatter is reduced an additional $\sim$10-40\% at $z\gtrsim3$ when using a weak FMR, compared to assuming a strong FMR. These results highlight the importance of avoiding coarse redshift binning when assessing the FMR.</description>

      <title>ALMA reveals a compact and massive molecular outflow driven by the young AGN in a nearby ULIRG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultra luminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) F13451+1232 is an excellent example of a galaxy merger in the early stages of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, a phase in which AGN-driven outflows are expected to be particularly important. However, previous observations have determined that the mass outflow rates of the warm ionised and neutral gas phases in F13451+1232 are relatively modest, and there has been no robust detection of molecular outflows. Using high spatial resolution ALMA CO(1-0) observations, we detect a kiloparsec-scale circumnuclear disk, as well as extended ($r\sim440$ pc), intermediate-velocity (300&lt;|$v$|&lt;400 km s$^{-1}$) cold molecular gas emission that cannot be explained by rotational disk motions. If interpreted as AGN-driven outflows, the mass outflow rates associated with this intermediate-velocity gas are relatively modest ($\dot{M}_\mathrm{out}=22$-$27$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$); however, we also detect a compact ($r_\mathrm{out}$&lt;120 pc), high velocity (400&lt;$v$&lt;680 km s$^{-1}$) cold molecular outflow near the primary nucleus of F13451+1232, which carries an order of magnitude more mass ($\dot{M}_\mathrm{out}\sim230$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) than (and several times the kinetic power of) the previously-detected warmer phases. Moreover, the similar spatial scales of this compact outflow and the radio structure indicate that it is likely accelerated by the small-scale ($r\sim130$ pc) AGN jet in the primary nucleus of F13451+1232. Considering the compactness of the nuclear outflow and intermediate-velocity non-rotating gas that we detect, we argue that high spatial-resolution observations are necessary to properly quantify the properties of AGN-driven outflows and their impacts on host galaxies.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Build-up in the first 1.5 Gyr of Cosmic History: Insights from the Stellar Mass Function at $z\sim4-9$ from JWST NIRCam Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining the public JWST/NIRCam imaging programs CEERS, PRIMER and JADES, spanning a total area of $\sim$500 arcmin$^2$, we obtain a sample of $&gt;$30,000 galaxies at $z\sim4-9$ that allows us to perform a complete, rest-optical selected census of the galaxy population at $z&gt;3$. Comparing the stellar mass $M_*$ and the UV-slope $\beta$ distributions between JWST- and HST-selected samples, we generally find very good agreement and no significant biases. Nevertheless, JWST enables us to probe a small population of UV-red galaxies that was missing from previous HST-based LBG samples. We measure galaxy stellar mass functions (SMFs) at $z\sim4-9$ and show that they are broadly consistent with existing literature results. However, UV-red galaxies dominate the high-mass end of the SMF at least out to $z\sim6$. In particular the most massive galaxies typically show very red colors between $\lambda_{obs}\sim1.5\mu$m and $\sim4.5\mu$m, and thus JWST's unprecedented resolution and sensitivity at these wavelengths yields more accurate constraints on their abundance and masses. The implied redshift evolution of the high-mass end of the SMF suggests a rapid build-up of massive dust-obscured as well as quiescent galaxies from $z\sim6$ to $z\sim4$ as well as an enhanced efficiency of star formation towards earlier times ($z\gtrsim6$). We find the SMFs to be steep over the entire redshift range, and slightly steepening with redshift from $z\sim 4-6$, reaching values of $\approx-2$ at $z\gtrsim6$. Finally, we show that the galaxy mass density grows by a factor $\sim20\times$ in the $\sim1$ Gyr of cosmic time from $z\sim9$ to $z\sim4$. Our results emphasize the importance of rest-frame optically-selected samples in inferring accurate distributions of physical properties and studying the mass build-up of galaxies in the first 1.5 Gyr of cosmic history.</description>

      <title>Timing the Milky Way bar formation and the accompanying radial migration episode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the metallicity profile of the Milky Way low-$\alpha$ disc population from 2 to 20 kpc from the Galactic centre in 1 Gyr age bins using the astroNN catalogue, and show that it is highly structured, with a plateau between 4 and 7 kpc and a break at 10-12 kpc. We argue that these features result from the two main bar resonances, the corotation and the Outer Lindblad Resonance (OLR), respectively. We show that the break in the metallicity profile is most visible in stars having 7-8 Gyr, reaching an amplitude of about 0.4 dex, and is the signpost of the position of the bar OLR. The bar formation was accompanied by an episode of radial migration triggered by its slowing down and is responsible for spreading old metal-rich stars up to the OLR. The data show that the slowdown of the bar ended 6-7 Gyr ago. Based on numerical simulations that reproduce well the break observed in the metallicity profile, we argue that this implies that the bar formed in our Galaxy 8-10 Gyr ago. Analysis of the metallicity distribution as a function of radius shows no evidence of significant systematic outward radial migration after this first episode. We argue that the variation of the metallicity dispersion as a function of the guiding radius is dominated by the migration triggered by the bar, but also that the libration of orbits around the bar resonances induces a mixing that may have a significant impact on the observed metallicity dispersion. In contrast, the absence of a break in the metallicity profile of populations younger than about $\sim$6 Gyr and the flattening of the gradient at younger ages is interpreted as evidence that the strength of the bar has decreased, loosening its barrier effect and allowing the gas and metals on both sides of the OLR to mix, erasing the break. Beyond the OLR, stars younger than 7 Gyr show very small metallicity dispersion, suggesting no or limited mixing.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Invisible: A Study of Gaia18ajz, a Candidate Black Hole Revealed by Microlensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying black holes is essential for comprehending the development of stars and uncovering novel principles of physics. Gravitational microlensing provides an exceptional opportunity to examine an undetectable population of black holes in the Milky Way. In particular, long-lasting events are likely to be associated with massive lenses, including black holes. We present an analysis of the Gaia18ajz microlensing event, reported by the Gaia Science Alerts system, which has exhibited a long timescale and features indicative of the annual microlensing parallax effect. Our objective is to estimate the parameters of the lens based on the best-fitting model. We utilized photometric data obtained from the Gaia satellite and terrestrial observatories to investigate a variety of microlensing models and calculate the most probable mass and distance to the lens, taking into consideration a Galactic model as a prior. Subsequently, we applied a mass-brightness relation to evaluate the likelihood that the lens is a main sequence star. We also describe DarkLensCode, an open-source routine which computes the distribution of probable lens mass, distance and luminosity employing the Galaxy priors on stellar density and velocity for microlensing events with detected microlensing parallax. We modelled Gaia18ajz event and found its two possible models with most likely Einstein timescale of $t_\mathrm{E}=316^{+36}_{-30}$ days and $t_\mathrm{E}=299^{+25}_{-22}$ days. Applying Galaxy priors for stellar density and motion, we calculated the most probable lens mass of $M_L = 5.6^{+7.5}_{-2.5} M_\odot$ located at $D_S = 1.05^{+0.78}_{-0.60}\,\text{kpc}$ or $M_L = 12.0^{+14.9}_{-5.4} M_\odot$ located at $D_S = 1.18^{+0.82}_{-0.63}\,\text{kpc}$. Our analysis of the blended light suggests that the lens is likely a dark remnant of stellar evolution, rather than a main sequence star.</description>

      <title>On the Evidence for Molecular Outflows in High-redshift Dusty Star-forming Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic-scale outflows of molecular gas from star-forming galaxies constitute the most direct evidence for regulation of star formation. In the early universe ($ z &gt; 4 $), such outflows have recently been inferred from gravitationally-lensed dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) based on ubiquitous detections of OH absorption extending to more blueshifted velocities than [CII] or CO emission in spatially-integrated spectra. Because these lines are redshifted to sub-mm wavelengths, such measurements require careful corrections for atmospheric absorption lines, and a proper accounting of sometimes large variations in measurement uncertainties over these lines. Taking these factors into consideration, we re-analyze OH and [CII] data taken with ALMA for the five sources where such data is available, of which four were categorised as exhibiting outflows. Based on their spatially-integrated spectra alone, we find statistically significant ($ \geq 3 \sigma $) OH absorption more blueshifted than [CII] emission in only one source. By contrast, searching channel maps for signals diluted below the detection threshold in spatially-integrated spectra, we find evidence for a separate kinematic component in OH absorption in all five sources in the form of: (i) more blueshifted OH absorption than [CII] emission and/or (ii) a component in OH absorption exhibiting a different spatio-kinematic pattern than [CII] emission, the latter presumably tracing gas in a rotating disc. Providing a more complete and accurate assessment of molecular outflows in gravitationally-lensed DSFGs, we suggest methods to better assess the precision of corrections for atmospheric absorption and to more accurately measure the source continuum in future observations.</description>

      <title>Properties of a Fading AGN from SDSS-IV MaNGA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a fading AGN SDSS J220141.64+115124.3 from the internal Product Launch-11 (MPL-11) in Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey. The central region with a projected radius of $\sim$2.4 kpc is characterized as LINER-like line ratios while the outskirts extended to $\sim$15 kpc show Seyfert-like line ratios. The [OIII]$\lambda$5007 luminosity of the Seyfert regions is a factor of 37 (2) higher than the LINER regions without (with) dust attenuation correction, suggesting that the AGN activity decreases at least $\sim$8 $\times$ 10$^3$ yrs ($\sim$2.4 kpc/light-speed) ago. We model the emission line spectra in the central region with double Gaussian components (a narrow core and a broad wing) and analyze the properties of each component. The narrow core component mostly co-rotates with the stellar disc, whereas the broad wing component with a median of the velocity dispersion $\sim$300 km s$^{-1}$ is related to a wind outflow. The kinematic position angle (PA) of the ionized gas shows a $\sim$20{\deg} twist from the galaxy center to 1.5 effective radius. The median of the PA difference between the gas and stellar components is as large as $\sim$50{\deg} within 0.4 effective radius. The tidal feature in DESI image and star-gas misalignment suggest this galaxy is a merger remnant. Combining all these observational results as well as public available X-ray and MIR luminosities, we confirm this is a fading AGN, the merger process kick-started the central engine to quasar phase which ionized gas composed of tidal debris, and now the activity of the central black hole decreases. The discontinuity in [OIII]$\lambda$5007 flux and EQW maps is due to multiple AGN outbursts triggered by merger remnant gas inflows.</description>

      <title>On the Metallicity Gradients in the Galactic Disk using Open Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the metallicity distribution and evolution in the Galactic disk based on the largest sample of open star clusters in the Galaxy. From the catalogue of 1879 open clusters in the range of Galactocentric distance (R_GC) from 4 to 20 kpc, we investigate the variation of metallicity in the Galactic disk as functions of R_GC, vertical distance (Z), and ages of the clusters. In the direction perpendicular to the Galactic plane, variation in metallicity is found to follow a stepped linear relation. We estimate a vertical metallicity gradient d[Fe/H]/dZ of -0.545+/-0.046 dex/kpc for |Z| &lt; 0.487 kpc, and -0.075+/-0.093 dex/kpc for 0.487 &lt; |Z| &lt; 1.8 kpc. On average, metallicity variations above and below the Galactic plane are found to change at similar rates. The change in metallicity in the radial direction is also found to follow a two-function linear relation. We obtain a radial metallicity gradient d[Fe/H]/d[R_GC] of -0.070+/-0.002 dex/kpc for 4.0&lt;R_GC&lt;12.8 kpc, and -0.005+/-0.018 dex/kpc for 12.8&lt; R_GC &lt; 20.5 kpc which clearly shows a strong variation in the metallicity gradient when moving from the inner to the outer Galactic disk. Age-metallicity relation (AMR) is found to follow a steeper negative slope of -0.031+/-0.006 dex/Gyr for clusters older than 240 Myr, however, there is some hint of positive metallicity age gradient for younger clusters.</description>

      <title>Identifying Galaxy Cluster Mergers with Deep Neural Networks using Idealized Compton-y and X-ray maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to identify galaxy clusters that are undergoing a merger using a deep learning approach. This paper uses massive galaxy clusters spanning $0 \leq z \leq 2$ from \textsc{The Three Hundred} project, a suite of hydrodynamic re-simulations of 324 large galaxy clusters. Mock, idealised Compton-{\it y} and X-ray maps were constructed for the sample, capturing them out to a radius of $2R_{200}$. The idealised nature of these maps mean they do not consider observational effects such as foreground or background astrophysical objects, any spatial resolution limits or restriction on X-ray energy bands. Half of the maps belong to a merging population as defined by a mass increase $\Delta${\it M/M} $\geq$ 0.75, and the other half serve as a control, relaxed population. We employ a convolutional neural network architecture and train the model to classify clusters into one of the groups. A best-performing model was able to correctly distinguish between the two populations with a balanced accuracy (BA) and recall of 0.77, ROC-AUC of 0.85, PR-AUC of 0.55 and $F_{1}$ score of 0.53. Using a multichannel model relative to a single channel model, we obtain a 3\% improvement in BA score, and a 6\% improvement in $F_{1}$ score. We use a saliency interpretation approach to discern the regions most important to each classification decision. By analysing radially binned saliency values we find a preference to utilise regions out to larger distances for mergers with respect to non-mergers, greater than $\sim1.2 R_{200}$ and $\sim0.7 R_{200}$ for SZ and X-ray respectively.</description>

      <title>A consistent explanation for the unusual initial mass function and star formation rate in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine various physical processes that may explain the shallow high-mass slope of the IMF as well as the low SFR in star-forming molecular clouds (MCs) in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). We show that the strong tidal field and the tidal shear experienced by the CMZ have opposite effects on the collapse of density fluctuations and nearly compensate, but in any case have a negligible impact and can not explain these unusual properties. Similarly, we show that the intense magnetic field in the CMZ provides a negligible pressure support and, for the high densities at play should not modify the probability density function (PDF) of the turbulent gas flow in the clouds, thus affecting negligibly the slope of the IMF. However, we show that, in contrast to MCs in the Galactic disk, the ones in the CMZ experience only one single episode of turbulence injection at large scale, most likely due dominantly to bar gas inflow. Indeed, their rather short lifetime, due to their high mean densities, is similar to one typical turbulence crossing time. Consequently, according to the Hennebelle-Chabrier theory of star formation, within this 'single turbulence episode' scenario, the cloud experiences one single field of turbulence induced density fluctuations, leading eventually to gravitationally unstable prestellar cores. As shown in Hennebelle &amp; Chabrier (2013}, this yields a flatter IMF than usual and leads to the correct observed slope for the CMZ star-forming clouds. Similarly, this single large scale turbulence event within the cloud lifetime yields a 5 to 6 lower SFR than under usual MW cloud conditions, again in agreement with the observed values. Therefore, we suggest that this 'single large scale turbulence injection' episode can explain both the shallow IMF high-mass slope and low SFR of clouds in the CMZ.</description>

      <title>Sunyaev-Zeldovich Signals from $L^*$ Galaxies: Observations, Analytics, and Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze measurements of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect arising in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of $L^*$ galaxies, reported by Bregman et al. 2022 and Das et al. 2023. In our analysis we use the Faerman et al. 2017 and Faerman et al. 2020 CGM models, a new power-law model (PLM), and the TNG100 simulation. For a given $M_{\rm vir}$, our PLM has four parameters; the fraction, $f_{\rm hCGM}$, of the halo baryon mass in hot CGM gas, the ratio, $\phi_T$, of the actual gas temperature at the virial radius to the virial temperature, and the power-law indicies, $a_{P,{\rm th}}$ and $a_n$ for the thermal electron pressure and the hydrogen nucleon density. The B+22 Compton-$y$ profile implies steep electron pressure slopes ($a_{P,{\rm th}}\simeq 2$). For isothermal conditions the temperature is at least $1.1\times 10^6$ K, with a hot CGM gas mass of up to $3.5\times 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ for a virial mass of $2.75\times 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$. However, if isothermal the gas must be expanding out of the halos. An isentropic equation of state is favored for which hydrostatic equilibrium is possible. The B+22 and D+23 results are consistent with each other and with recent (0.5-2 keV) CGM X-ray observations by Zhang et al. 2024 of Milky Way mass systems. For $M_{\rm vir}\simeq 3\times 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$, the scaled Compton pressure integrals, $E(z)^{-2/3}Y_{500}/M_{\rm vir,12}^{5/3}$, lie in the narrow range, $2.5\times 10^{-4}$ to $5.0\times 10^{-4}$ kpc$^2$, for all three sets of observations. TNG100 underpredicts the tSZ parameters by factors $\sim 0.5$ dex for the $L^*$ galaxies, suggesting that the feedback strengths and CGM gas losses are overestimated in the simulated halos at these mass scales.</description>

      <title>Supermassive Black Hole Winds in X-rays -- SUBWAYS. III. A population study on Ultra-Fast Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of blue-shifted absorption lines likely associated with ionized Iron K-shell transitions in the X-ray spectra of many Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) suggests the presence of a highly ionized gas outflowing with mildly relativistic velocities (0.03c-0.6c), named Ultra-Fast Outflow (UFO). Within the SUBWAYS project we characterized these winds starting from a sample of 22 radio-quiet quasars at 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.4, and compared the results with similar studies in the literature on samples of 42 local radio-quiet Seyfert galaxies and 14 high redshift radio-quiet quasars. The scope of our work is a statistical study of UFO parameters and incidence, considering key physical properties of the sources, e.g. supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, bolometric luminosity, accretion rates and Spectral Energy Distribution, with the aim of gaining new insights into the UFO launching mechanisms. We find indications that highly luminous AGN with steeper X-ray/UV ratio, are more likely to host UFO. The presence of UFO is not significantly related to any other AGN property in our sample. These findings suggest that the UFO phenomenon may be transient. Focusing on AGN with UFO, other important results are: (1) faster UFO have larger ionization parameters and column densities; (2) X-ray radiation plays a more crucial role in driving highly ionized winds compared to UV; (3) the correlation between outflow velocity and luminosity is significantly flatter than what expected for radiatively driven winds; (4) more massive BH experience higher wind mass-losses, suppressing accretion of matter onto the BH; (5) the UFO launching radius is positively correlated with the Eddington ratio. Furthermore, our analysis suggest the involvement of multiple launching mechanisms, including radiation pressure and magneto-hydrodynamic processes, rather than pointing to a single, universally applicable mechanism.</description>

      <title>The Size-Linewidth Relation and Signatures of Feedback from Quiescent to Active Star Forming Regions in the LMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To investigate the effects of stellar feedback on the gravitational state of giant molecular clouds (GMCs), we study $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO ALMA maps of nine GMCs distributed throughout the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the nearest star-forming galaxy to our own. We perform noise and resolution matching on the sample, working at a common resolution of 3.5 arcseconds (0.85 pc at the LMC distance of 50 kpc), and use the \textit{SCIMES} clustering algorithm to identify discrete substructure, or "clumps." We supplement these data with three tracers of recent star formation: $8\mu$m surface brightness, continuum-subtracted H$\alpha$ flux, and interstellar radiation field energy density inferred from dust emission. The $^{12}$CO clumps identified cover a range of 3.6 dex in luminosity-based mass and 2.4 dex in average $8\mu$m surface brightness, representative of the wide range of conditions of the interstellar medium in the LMC. Our observations suggest evidence for increased turbulence in these clouds. While the turbulent linewidths are correlated with clump surface density, in agreement with previous observations, we find even better correlation with the three star formation activity tracers considered, suggesting stellar energy injection plays a significant role in the dynamical state of the clumps. The excess linewidths we measure do not appear to result from opacity broadening. $^{12}$CO clumps are found to be typically less gravitationally bound than $^{13}$CO clumps, with some evidence of the kinetic-to-gravitational potential energy ratio increasing with star-formation tracers. Further multi-line analysis may better constrain the assumptions made in these calculations.</description>

      <title>Tidal evolution of cored and cuspy dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The internal structure and abundance of dark matter halos and subhalos are powerful probes of the nature of dark matter. In order to compare observations with dark matter models, accurate theoretical predictions of these quantities are needed. We present a fast and accurate method to describe the tidal evolution of subhalos within their parent halo, based on a semi-analytic approach. We first consider idealized N-body simulations of subhalos within their host halo, using a generalized mass density profile that describes their properties in a variety of dark matter models at infall, including popular warm, cold, and self-interacting ones. Using these simulations we construct tidal "tracks" for the evolution of subhalos based on their conditions at infall. Second, we use the results of these simulations to build semi-analytic models (SAMs) for tidal effects, including stripping and heating and implement them within the code GALACTICUS. Our SAMs can accurately predict the tidal evolution of both cored and cuspy subhalos, including the bound mass and density profiles, providing a powerful and efficient tool for studying the post-infall properties of subhalos in different dark matter models.</description>

      <title>Moving Towards Automated Interstellar Boundary Explorer Data Selection with LOTUS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) satellite collects data on energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) that provide insight into the heliosphere, the region surrounding our solar system and separating it from interstellar space. IBEX collects information on these particles and on extraneous ``background'' particles. While IBEX records how and when the different particles are observed, it does not distinguish between heliospheric ENA particles and incidental background particles. To address this issue, all IBEX data has historically been manually labeled as ``good'' ENA data, or ``bad'' background data. This manual culling process is incredibly time-intensive and contingent on subjective, manually-induced decision thresholds. In this paper, we develop a three-stage automated culling process, called LOTUS, that uses random forests to expedite and standardize the labelling process. In Stage 1, LOTUS uses random forests to obtain probabilities of observing true ENA particles on a per-observation basis. In Stage 2, LOTUS aggregates these probabilities to obtain predictions within small windows of time. In Stage 3, LOTUS refines these predictions. We compare the labels generated by LOTUS to those manually generated by the subject matter expert. We use various metrics to demonstrate that LOTUS is a useful automated process for supplementing and standardizing the manual culling process.</description>

      <title>ALMA Observations of Molecular Line Emission from High-excitation Bipolar Planetary Nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present early results from our program of ALMA Band 6 (1.3mm) molecular line mapping of a sample of nearby, well-studied examples of high-excitation, bipolar/pinched-waist and molecule-rich planetary nebulae (Hubble 5 and NGC 2440, 2818, 2899, 6302, and 6445). We have mapped these planetary nebulae (PNe) in isotopologues of CO as well as various molecular line tracers of high-energy irradiation, such as HCN, CN, HNC, and HCO+, with the complementary goals of establishing nebular kinematics as well as the zones of UV-heated and X-ray-ionized molecular gas within each nebula. The resulting high-resolution ALMA molecular emission-line maps reveal the regions of high-excitation bipolar PNe in which molecular gas, presumably ejected during asymptotic giant branch stages of the PN progenitor stars, survives and evolves chemically. We present a summary of molecular species detected to date in the sample nebulae, and we use example results for one PN (NGC 6455) to demonstrate the power of the ALMA data in revealing the structures, kinematics, and compositions of the equatorial molecular tori that are a common feature of the sample objects.</description>

      <title>Constraining Self-interacting Scalar Field Dark Matter From the Black Hole Shadow of the Event Horizon Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An exciting possibility to constrain dark matter (DM) scenarios is to search for their gravitational imprints on Black Hole (BH) observations. In this paper, we investigate the impact of self-interacting scalar field DM on the shadow radius of a Schwarzschild BH. We implement a self-consistent formulation, paying attention to the enhancement of the DM density due to the BH gravitational influence and the accretion flow onto the BH. First, we calculate the first-order correction to the shadow radius caused by a general DM environment. Then, we apply this perturbative method to the case of self-interacting scalar field DM and derive analytical expressions for the critical impact parameter. We find that self-consistency requirements, involving the lifetime and the mass of the central DM soliton, or the mass and the size of the extended virialized DM halo, ensure that the impact of the DM environment on the shadow radius is below the observational upper bound. This emphasizes the importance of taking into account the self-consistency constraints of the underlying DM scenario, which can strongly limit the range of possible DM density profiles and their impact on the shadow radius.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Friction and Black Holes in Ultralight Dark Matter Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically simulate the motion of a black hole as it plunges radially through an ultralight dark matter soliton. We investigate the timescale in which dynamical friction reduces the kinetic energy of the black hole to a minimum, and consider the sensitivity of this timescale to changes in the ULDM particle mass, the total soliton mass, and the mass of the black hole. We contrast our numerical results with a semi-analytic treatment of dynamical friction, and find that the latter is poorly suited to this scenario. In particular, we find that the back-reaction of the soliton to the presence of the black hole is significant, resulting in oscillations in the coefficient of dynamical friction which cannot be described in the simple semi-analytical framework. Furthermore, we observe a late-time reheating effect, in which a significant amount of kinetic energy is transferred back to the black hole after an initial damping phase. This complicates the discussion of ULDM dynamical friction on the scales relevant to the final parsec problem.</description>

      <title>The fundamental plane of blazars based on the black hole spin-mass energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the fundamental plane of 91 Blazars which include FSRQs and BL Lacs with known X-ray luminosity ($L_{R}$), radio luminosity ($L_X$), and black hole mass measurements ($M$) to reflect the relationship between jet and accretion for blazars. The fundamental plane of Blazars are log$L_{R}$=${0.273}_{+0.059}^{-0.059}$log$L_X$+${0.695}_{+0.191}^{-0.191}$log$M$+${25.457}_{+2.728}^{-2.728}$ and log$L_{R}$=${0.190}_{+0.049}^{-0.049}$log$L_X$+${0.475}_{+0.157}^{-0.157}$log$M$+${28.568}_{+2.245}^{-2.245}$ after considering the effect of beam factor. Our results suggest that the jet of blazars has connection with accretion. We set the black hole spin energy as a new variable to correct the black hole mass and explore the effect of black hole spin on the fundamental relationship. We find that the fundamental plane of Blazars is effected by the black hole spin, which is similar to the previous work for AGNs. We additionally examine a new fundamental plane which is based on the black hole spin-mass energy ($M_{spin}$). The new fundamental plane (log$L_{R}$=${0.332}_{+0.081}^{-0.081}$log$L_X$+${0.502}_{+0.091}^{-0.091}$log$M_{spin}$+${22.606}_{+3.346}^{-3.346}$ with R-Square=0.575) shows that $M_{spin}$ has a better correlation coefficient comparing to the $M$ for fundamental plane of Blazars. These results support that the black hole spin should be considered as a important factor for the study of fundamental plane for Blazars. And these may further our understanding of the Blandford-Znajek process in blazars.</description>

      <title>Digitization of Astronomical Photographic Plate of China and Astrometric Measurement of Single-exposure Plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From the mid-19th century to the end of the 20th century, photographic plates served as the primary detectors for astronomical observations. Astronomical photographic observations in China began in 1901, and over a century, a total of approximately 30,000 astronomical photographic plates have been captured. These historical plates play an irreplaceable role in conducting long-term, time-domain astronomical research. To preserve and explore these valuable original astronomical observational data, Shanghai Astronomical Observatory has organized the transportation of plates taken at night from various stations across the country to the Sheshan Plate Archive for centralized preservation. For the first time, plate information statistics was performed. On this basis, the plates were cleaned and digitally scanned, and finally digitized images were acquired for 29,314 plates. In this study, using Gaia DR2 as the reference star catalog, astrometric processing has been carried out successfully on 15,696 single-exposure plates, including object extraction, stellar identification, and plate model computation. As a result, for long focal length telescopes, such as the 40cm double-tube refractor telescope and the 1.56m reflector telescope at the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory and the 1m reflector telescope at the Yunnan Astronomical Observatory, the astrometric accuracy obtained for their plates is approximately 0.1" to 0.3". The distribution of astrometric accuracy for medium and short focal length telescopes ranges from 0.3" to 1.0". The relevant data of this batch of plates, including digitized images and stellar catalog of the plates are archived and released by the National Astronomical Data Center. Users can access and download plate data based on keywords such as station, telescope, observation year, and observed celestial coordinates.</description>

      <title>TangoSIDM Project: Is the Stellar Mass Tully-Fisher relation consistent with SIDM?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) has the potential to significantly influence galaxy formation in comparison to the cold, collisionless dark matter paradigm (CDM), resulting in observable effects. This study aims to elucidate this influence and to demonstrate that the stellar mass Tully-Fisher relation imposes robust constraints on the parameter space of velocity-dependent SIDM models. We present a new set of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that include the SIDM scheme from the TangoSIDM project and the SWIFT-EAGLE galaxy formation model. Two cosmological simulations suites were generated: one (Reference model) which yields good agreement with the observed $z=0$ galaxy stellar mass function, galaxy mass-size relation, and stellar-to-halo mass relation; and another (WeakStellarFB model) in which the stellar feedback is less efficient, particularly for Milky Way-like systems. Both galaxy formation models were simulated under four dark matter cosmologies: CDM, SIDM with two different velocity-dependent cross sections, and SIDM with a constant cross section. While SIDM does not modify global galaxy properties such as stellar masses and star formation rates, it does make the galaxies more extended. In Milky Way-like galaxies, where baryons dominate the central gravitational potential, SIDM thermalises, causing dark matter to accumulate in the central regions. This accumulation results in density profiles that are steeper than those produced in CDM from adiabatic contraction. The enhanced dark matter density in the central regions of galaxies causes a deviation in the slope of the Tully-Fisher relation, which significantly diverges from the observational data. In contrast, the Tully-Fisher relation derived from CDM models aligns well with observations.</description>

      <title>Testing MOND on small bodies in the remote solar system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND), which postulates a breakdown of Newton's laws of gravity/dynamics below some critical acceleration threshold, can explain many otherwise puzzling observational phenomena on galactic scales. MOND competes with the hypothesis of dark matter, which successfully explains the cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure. Here we provide the first solar-system test of MOND that probes the sub-critical acceleration regime. Using the Bekenstein-Milgrom AQUAL formulation, we simulate the evolution of myriads of test particles (planetesimals or comets) born in the trans-Neptunian region and scattered by the giant planets over the lifetime of the Sun to heliocentric distances of $10^2$-$10^5$ au. We include the effects of the Galactic tidal field and passing stars. While Newtonian simulations reproduce the distribution of binding energies of long-period and Oort-cloud comets detectable from Earth, MOND-based simulations do not. This conclusion is robust to plausible changes in the migration history of the planets, the migration history of the Sun, the MOND transition function, effects of the Sun's birth cluster, and the fading properties of long-period comets. For the most popular version of AQUAL, characterized by a gradual transition between the Newtonian and MOND regimes, our MOND-based simulations also fail to reproduce the orbital distribution of trans-Neptunian objects in the detached disk (perihelion &gt; 38 au). Our results do not rule out some MOND theories more elaborate than AQUAL, in which non-Newtonian effects are screened on small spatial scales, at small masses, or in external gravitational fields comparable in strength to the critical acceleration.</description>

      <title>Determining stellar accretion rates from $Pa_{\alpha}$ and $Br_{\beta}$ emission lines with JWST NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter we present the first systematic spectroscopic measurements of the Near-InfraRed (NIR) hydrogen recombination lines $Pa_{\alpha}$ ($\lambda = 1.875 \mu m$) and $Br_{\beta}$ ($\lambda = 2.626 \mu m$), produced by pre-main sequence (PMS) stars. These stars, consisting of T Tauri and Herbig AeBe stars are located in the massive Galactic star-formation region NGC 3603. The measurements were obtained from JWST NIRSpec, using multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) mode. Utilising existing empirical relations between $L_{acc}$ and $L_{Br_{\gamma}}$, we have used our new measurements to formulate, for the first time, an empirical relationship between the accretion luminosity $L_{acc}$ of the stars, and the line luminosities $L_{line}$ of both $Pa_{\alpha}$ and $Br_{\beta}$. These relationships are: $\log_{10}( \frac{L_{acc}}{L_{\odot}}) = 1.42 (\pm 0.18) \times \log_{10}( \frac{L_{Pa_{\alpha}}}{L_{\odot}}) + 3.33 (\pm 0.42)$ and $\log_{10}( \frac{L_{acc}}{L_{\odot}}) = 1.47 (\pm 0.18) \times \log_{10}( \frac{L_{Br_{\beta}}}{L_{\odot}}) + 4.60 (\pm 0.57)$. These new relationships are key for roughly estimating the accretion rates for large samples of PMS stars with JWST.</description>

      <title>Confronting fuzzy dark matter with the rotation curves of nearby dwarf irregular galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05793v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate phenomenologically the viability of fuzzy dark matter (FDM). We do this by confronting the predictions of the model, in particular, the formation of a solitonic core at the center of dark matter halos, with a homogeneous and robust sample of high-resolution rotation curves from the "LITTLE THINGS in 3D" catalog. This comprises a collection of isolated, dark matter dominated dwarf-irregular galaxies that provides an optimal benchmark for cosmological studies. We use a statistical framework based on Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques that allows us to extract relevant parameters such as the axion mass, the mass of the solitonic core, the mass of the dark matter halo and its concentration parameter with a rather loose set of priors except for the implementation of a core-halo relation that is predicted by simulations. The results of the fits are used to perform various diagnostics on the predictions of the model. FDM provides an excellent fit to the rotation curves of the "LITTLE THINGS in 3D" catalog, with axion masses determined from different galaxies clustering around $m_a\approx2\times10^{-23}$ eV. However, we find two major problems in our analysis. First, the data follow scaling relations of the properties of the core which are not consistent with the predictions of the soliton. This problem is particularly acute in the core radius - mass relation with a tension that, at face value, has a significance $\gtrsim5\sigma$. The second problem is related to the strong suppression of the linear power spectrum that is predicted by FDM for the axion mass preferred by the data. This can be constrained very conservatively by the galaxy counts in our sample, which leads to a tension exceeding again $5\sigma$. We estimate the effects of baryons in our analysis and discuss whether they could alleviate the tensions of the model with observations.</description>

      <title>JADES: The incidence rate and properties of galactic outflows in low-mass galaxies across 3 &lt; z &lt; 9</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the incidence and properties of ionized gas outflows in a sample of 52 galaxies with stellar mass between $10^7$ M$_{\odot}$ and $10^9$ M$_{\odot}$ observed with ultra-deep JWST/NIRSpec MSA spectroscopy as part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). The high-spectral resolution (R2700) NIRSpec observations allowed us to identify for the first time the signature of outflows in the rest-frame optical nebular lines in low-mass galaxies at $z&gt;3$. The incidence fraction of ionized outflows, traced by broad components, is about 25-40$\%$ depending on the intensity of the emission lines. The low incidence fraction might be due to both the sensitivity limit and the fact that outflows are not isotropic but have a limited opening angle which results in a detection only when this is directed toward our line of sight. Evidence for outflows increases slightly with stellar mass and star-formation rate. The median velocity and mass loading factor (i.e., the ratio between mass outflow rate and star formation rate) of the outflowing ionized gas are 350 km s$^{-1}$ and $\eta=2.0^{+1.6}_{-1.5}$, respectively. These are 1.5 and 100 times higher, respectively than the typical values observed in local dwarf galaxies. These outflows are able to escape the gravitational potential of the galaxy and enrich the circum-galactic medium and, potentially, the inter-galactic medium. Our results indicate that outflows can significantly impact the star formation activity in low-mass galaxies within the first 2 Gyr of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Morphology of Galaxies in JWST Fields: Initial Distribution and Evolution of Galaxy Morphology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04899v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent study from the Horizon Run (HR5) cosmological simulation has predicted that galaxies with ${\rm log}~M_{\ast}/M_{\odot}\lesssim 10$ in the cosmic morning ($10\gtrsim z\gtrsim 4$) dominantly have disk-like morphology in the $\Lambda$CDM universe, which is driven by the tidal torque in the initial matter fluctuations. For a direct comparison with observation, we identify a total of about $19,000$ James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) galaxies with ${\rm log}~M_{\ast}/M_{\odot}&gt;9$ at $z=0.6-8.0$ utilizing deep JWST/NIRCam images of publicly released fields, including NEP-TDF, NGDEEP, CEERS, COSMOS, UDS, and SMACS J0723$-$7327. We estimate their stellar masses and photometric redshifts with the redshift dispersion of $\sigma_{\rm NMAD}=0.009$ and outlier fraction of only about $6\%$. We classify galaxies into three morphological types, `disks', `spheroids', and `irregulars', applying the same criteria used in the HR5 study. The morphological distribution of the JWST galaxies shows that disk galaxies account for $60-70\%$ at all redshift ranges. However, in the high-mass regime (${\rm log}~M_{\ast}/M_{\odot}\gtrsim11$), spheroidal morphology becomes the dominant type. This implies that mass growth of galaxies is accompanied with morphological transition from disks to spheroids. The fraction of irregulars is about 20\% or less at all mass and redshifts. All the trends in the morphology distribution are consistently found in the six JWST fields. These results are in close agreement with the results from the HR5 simulation, particularly confirming the prevalence of disk galaxies at small masses in the cosmic morning and noon.</description>

      <title>Cosmic variance suppression in radiation-hydrodynamic modeling of the reionization-era 21-cm signal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 21-cm line emitted by neutral hydrogen is the most promising probe of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Multiple radio interferometric instruments are on the cusp of detecting its power spectrum. It is therefore essential to deliver robust theoretical predictions, enabling sound inference of the coeval Universe properties. The nature of this signal traditionally required the modelling of $\mathcal{O}(10^{7-8} \, {\rm Mpc}^3)$ volumes to suppress the impact of cosmic variance. However, the recently-proposed Fixed &amp; Paired (F&amp;P) approach uses carefully-crafted simulation pairs to achieve equal results in smaller volumes. In this work, we thoroughly test the applicability of and improvement granted by this technique to different observables of the 21-cm signal from the EoR. We employ radiation-magneto-hydrodynamics simulations to ensure the most realistic physical description of this epoch, greatly improving over previous studies using a semi-numerical approach without accurate galaxy formation physics and radiative transfer. We estimate the statistical improvement granted by the F&amp;P technique on predictions of the skewness, power spectrum, bispectrum and ionized regions size distribution of the 21-cm signal at redshift $7 \leq z \leq 10$ (corresponding to $\geq80\%$ of the gas being neutral). We find that the effective volume of F&amp;P simulations is at least 3.5 times larger than traditional simulations. This directly translates into an equal improvement in the computational cost (in terms of time and memory). Finally, we confirm that a combination of different observables like skewness, power spectrum and bispectrum across different redshifts can be utilised to maximise the improvement.</description>

Abstract: Asteroseismic modelling of isolated star presents significant challenges due to the difficulty in accurately determining stellar parameters, particularly the stellar age. These challenges can be overcomed by observing stars in open clusters, whose coeval members share an initial chemical composition. The light curves by TESS allow us to investigate and analyse stellar variations in clusters with an unprecedented level. We aim to detect gravity-mode oscillations in the early-type main-sequence members of the young open cluster NGC 2516. We selected the 301 member stars as our sample and analysed the TESS FFI light curves. We also collected high-resolution spectra using the FEROS for the g-mode pulsators. By fitting the theoretical isochrones to the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) of a cluster, we determined an age of 102 $\pm$ 15 Myr and inferred the extinction at 550 nm ($A_0$) is 0.53 $\pm$ 0.04 mag. We identified 147 stars with surface brightness modulations, 24 with g-mode pulsations ($\gamma$ Doradus or Slowly Pulsating B stars), and 35 with p-mode pulsations ($\delta$ Sct stars). When sorted by colour index, the amplitude spectra of the $\delta$ Sct stars show a distinct ordering and reveal a discernible frequency-temperature relationship. The near-core rotation rates, measured from period spacing patterns in two SPB and nine $\gamma$ Dor stars, reach up to 3/d . This is at the high end of the values found from Kepler data of field stars of similar variability type. The $\gamma$ Dor stars have internal rotation rates as high as 50% of their critical value, whereas the SPB stars exhibit rotation rates close to their critical rate. We did not find long-term brightness and colour variations in the mid-infrared, which suggests that there are no disk or shell formation events in our sample. We also discussed the results of our spectroscopic observations for the g-mode pulsators.</description>

      <title>Theoretically motivated dark electromagnetism as the origin of relativistic MOND</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08811v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present paper is a modest attempt to initiate the research program outlined in this abstract. We propose that general relativity and relativistic MOND (RelMOND) are analogues of the broken electroweak symmetry. That is, $SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{YDEM} \rightarrow U(1)_{DEM}$ (DEM stands for dark electromagnetism), and GR is assumed to arise from the broken $SU(2)_R$ symmetry, and is analogous to the weak force. RelMOND is identified with dark electromagnetism $U(1)_{DEM}$, which is the remaining unbroken symmetry after spontaneous symmetry breaking of the darkelectro-grav sector $SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{YDEM}$. This sector, as well as the electroweak sector, arise from the breaking of an $E_8 \times E_8$ symmetry, in a recently proposed model of unification of the standard model with pre-gravitation, this latter being an $SU(2)_R$ gauge theory. The source charge for the dark electromagnetic force is square-root of mass, motivated by the experimental fact that the square-roots of the masses of the electron, up quark, and down quark, are in the ratio 1:2:3, which is a flip of their electric charge ratios 3:2:1 The introduction of the dark electromagnetic force helps understand the weird mass ratios of the second and third generation of charged fermions. We also note that in the deep MOND regime, acceleration is proportional to square-root of mass, which motivates us to propose the relativistic $U(1)_{DEM}$ gauge symmetry as the origin of MOND. We explain why the dark electromagnetic force falls inversely with distance, as in MOND, and not as the inverse square of distance. We conclude that dark electromagnetism is a good mimicker of cold dark matter, and the two are essentially indistinguishable in those cosmological situations where CDM is successful in explaining observations, such as CMB anisotropies, and gravitational lensing.</description>

      <title>An improved Halo Occupation Distribution prescription from UNITsim H_alpha Emission Line Galaxies: conformity and modified radial profile</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emission line galaxies (ELGs) are targeted by the new generation of spectroscopic surveys to make unprecedented measurements in cosmology from their distribution. Accurately interpreting this data requires understanding the imprints imposed by the physics of galaxy formation and evolution on galaxy clustering. In this work we utilize a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation (SAGE) to explore the necessary components for accurately reproducing the clustering of ELGs. We focus on developing a Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) prescription able to reproduce the clustering of SAGE galaxies. Typically, HOD models assume that satellite and central galaxies of a given type are independent events. We investigate the need for conformity, i.e. whether the average satellite occupation depends on the existence of a central galaxy of a given type. Incorporating conformity into HOD models is crucial for reproducing the clustering in the reference galaxy sample. Another aspect we investigate is the radial distribution of satellite galaxies within haloes. The traditional density profile models, NFW and Einasto profiles, fail to accurately replicate the small-scale clustering measured for SAGE satellite galaxies. To overcome this limitation, we propose a generalization of the NFW profile, thereby enhancing our understanding of galaxy clustering.</description>

      <title>eROSITA Detection of a Cloud Obscuration Event in the Seyfert AGN EC 04570-5206</title>

Abstract: Recent years have seen broad observational support for the presence of a clumpy component within the circumnuclear gas around SMBHs. In the X-ray band, individual clouds can manifest themselves when they transit the line of sight to the X-ray corona, temporarily obscuring the X-ray continuum and thereby indicating the characteristics and location of these clouds. X-ray flux monitoring with SRG/eROSITA has revealed that in the Seyfert 1 AGN EC 04570-5206, the soft X-ray flux dipped abruptly for about 10-18 months over 2020-2021, only to recover and then drop a second time by early 2022. Here, we investigate whether these flux dips and recoveries could be associated with cloud occultation events. We complemented the eROSITA scans with multiwavelength follow-up observations, including X-ray/UV observations with Swift, XMM-Newton, and NICER, along with ground-based optical photometric and spectroscopic observations to investigate the spectral and flux variability. XMM-Newton spectra confirm that the soft X-ray flux dips were caused by partial-covering obscuration by two separate clouds. The 2020-2021 event was caused by a cloud with column density near 1e22 /cm2 and a covering fraction near 0.6. The cloud in the 2022 event had a column density near 3e23 /cm2 and a covering fraction near 0.8. The optical/UV continuum flux varied minimally and the optical emission line spectra showed no variability in Balmer profiles or intensity. The transiting gas clouds are neutral or lowly-ionized, while the lower limits on their radial distances are commensurate with the dust sublimation zone (cloud 1) or the optical broad line region (cloud 2). One possible explanation is a dust-free, outflowing wind with embedded X-ray clumps. These events are the first cloud obscuration events detected in a Seyfert galaxy using eROSITA's X-ray monitoring capabilities.</description>

Abstract: We have performed a comprehensive study of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) combining the photometric data obtained by the two \textit{HST} Treasury programs that targeted this region. To consistently analyze the rich dataset obtained in a wide variety of filters, we adopted a Bayesian approach to fit the Spectral Energy Distribution of the sources, deriving mass, age, extinction, distance, and accretion for each source in the region. The three dimensional study of mass distribution for bona-fide cluster members shows that mass segregation in the ONC extends to sub-solar masses, while the age distribution strongly supports the idea that star formation in the ONC is best described by a major episode of star formation that happened $\sim 1$ Myr ago. For masses $\gtrsim 0.1$ \Msun, our derived empirical initial mass function (IMF) is in good agreement with a Chabrier system IMF. Both the accretion luminosity (\Lacc) and mass accretion rates (\dMacc) are best described by broken power-law relations. This suggests that for the majority of young circumstellar disks in this cluster the excess emission may be dominated by X-ray-driven photoevaporation by the central star rather than external photoevaporation. If this is the case, the slopes of the power-law relations may be largely determined by the initial conditions set at the onset of the star formation process, which may be quite similar between regions that eventually form clusters of different sizes.</description>
