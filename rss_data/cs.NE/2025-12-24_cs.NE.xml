      <title>Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search with Dual Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search (ENAS) has gained attention for automatically designing neural network architectures. Recent studies use a neural predictor to guide the process, but the high computational costs of gathering training data -- since each label requires fully training an architecture -- make achieving a high-precision predictor with { limited compute budget (i.e., a capped number of fully trained architecture-label pairs)} crucial for ENAS success. This paper introduces ENAS with Dual Contrastive Learning (DCL-ENAS), a novel method that employs two stages of contrastive learning to train the neural predictor. In the first stage, contrastive self-supervised learning is used to learn meaningful representations from neural architectures without requiring labels. In the second stage, fine-tuning with contrastive learning is performed to accurately predict the relative performance of different architectures rather than their absolute performance, which is sufficient to guide the evolutionary search. Across NASBench-101 and NASBench-201, DCL-ENAS achieves the highest validation accuracy, surpassing the strongest published baselines by 0.05\% (ImageNet16-120) to 0.39\% (NASBench-101). On a real-world ECG arrhythmia classification task, DCL-ENAS improves performance by approximately 2.5 percentage points over a manually designed, non-NAS model obtained via random search, while requiring only 7.7 GPU-days.</description>

      <title>Memory as Resonance: A Biomimetic Architecture for Infinite Context Memory on Ergodic Phonetic Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The memory of contemporary Large Language Models is bound by a physical paradox: as they learn, they fill up. The linear accumulation (O(N)) of Key-Value states treats context as a warehouse of static artifacts, eventually forcing a destructive choice between amnesia and latency. We challenge this discrete orthodoxy, proposing that long-term memory is not the storage of items, but the persistence of a trajectory. We introduce Phonetic Trajectory Memory (PTM), a neuro-symbolic architecture that encodes language not as a sequence of tensors, but as a continuous path on an ergodic manifold governed by irrational rotation matrices. By decoupling the navigation (an invariant O(1) geometric signal) from the reconstruction (a probabilistic generative act), PTM achieves a compression magnitude of greater than 3,000x relative to dense caches. We demonstrate that retrieval becomes a process of resonance: the phonetic trace stabilizes the model against hallucination via "Signal Consensus" mechanism, securing up to approximately 92% factual accuracy. While this aggressive abstraction alters generative texture, it unlocks immediate access latency (approximately 34ms) independent of depth. Our results suggest that infinite context does not require infinite silicon; it requires treating memory not as data to be stored, but as a reconstructive process acting on a conserved, undying physical signal.</description>

      <title>Cross-Population White Matter Atlas Creation for Concurrent Mapping of Brain Connections in Neonates and Adults with Diffusion MRI Tractography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comparing white matter (WM) connections between adults and neonates using diffusion MRI (dMRI) can advance our understanding of typical brain development and potential biomarkers for neurological disorders. However, existing WM atlases are population-specific (adult or neonatal) and reside in separate spaces, preventing direct cross-population comparisons. A unified WM atlas spanning both neonates and adults is still lacking. In this study, we propose a neonatal/adult brain atlas (NABA), a WM tractography atlas built from dMRI data of both neonates and adults. NABA is constructed using a robust, data-driven fiber clustering pipeline, enabling group-wise WM atlasing across populations despite substantial anatomical variability. The atlas provides a standardized template for WM parcellation, allowing direct comparison of WM tracts between neonates and adults. Using NABA, we conduct four analyses: (1) evaluating the feasibility of joint WM mapping across populations, (2) characterizing WM development across neonatal ages relative to adults, (3) assessing sex-related differences in neonatal WM development, and (4) examining the effects of preterm birth. Our results show that NABA robustly identifies WM tracts in both populations. We observe rapid fractional anisotropy (FA) development in long-range association tracts, including the arcuate fasciculus and superior longitudinal fasciculus II, whereas intra-cerebellar tracts develop more slowly. Neonatal females exhibit faster overall FA development than males. Although preterm neonates show lower overall FA development rates, they demonstrate relatively higher FA growth in specific tracts, including the corticospinal tract, corona radiata-pontine pathway, and intracerebellar tracts. These findings demonstrate that NABA is a useful tool for investigating WM development across neonates and adults.</description>

      <title>Covariance-Aware Simplex Projection for Cardinality-Constrained Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metaheuristic algorithms for cardinality-constrained portfolio optimization require repair operators to map infeasible candidates onto the feasible region. Standard Euclidean projection treats assets as independent and can ignore the covariance structure that governs portfolio risk, potentially producing less diversified portfolios. This paper introduces Covariance-Aware Simplex Projection (CASP), a two-stage repair operator that (i) selects a target number of assets using volatility-normalized scores and (ii) projects the candidate weights using a covariance-aware geometry aligned with tracking-error risk. This provides a portfolio-theoretic foundation for using a covariance-induced distance in repair operators. On S&amp;P 500 data (2020-2024), CASP-Basic delivers materially lower portfolio variance than standard Euclidean repair without relying on return estimates, with improvements that are robust across assets and statistically significant. Ablation results indicate that volatility-normalized selection drives most of the variance reduction, while the covariance-aware projection provides an additional, consistent improvement. We further show that optional return-aware extensions can improve Sharpe ratios, and out-of-sample tests confirm that gains transfer to realized performance. CASP integrates as a drop-in replacement for Euclidean projection in metaheuristic portfolio optimizers.</description>

      <title>Self-motion as a structural prior for coherent and robust formation of cognitive maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most computational accounts of cognitive maps assume that stability is achieved primarily through sensory anchoring, with self-motion contributing to incremental positional updates only. However, biological spatial representations often remain coherent even when sensory cues degrade or conflict, suggesting that self-motion may play a deeper organizational role. Here, we show that self-motion can act as a structural prior that actively organizes the geometry of learned cognitive maps. We embed a path-integration-based motion prior in a predictive-coding framework, implemented using a capacity-efficient, brain-inspired recurrent mechanism combining spiking dynamics, analog modulation and adaptive thresholds. Across highly aliased, dynamically changing and naturalistic environments, this structural prior consistently stabilizes map formation, improving local topological fidelity, global positional accuracy and next-step prediction under sensory ambiguity. Mechanistic analyses reveal that the motion prior itself encodes geometrically precise trajectories under tight constraints of internal states and generalizes zero-shot to unseen environments, outperforming simpler motion-based constraints. Finally, deployment on a quadrupedal robot demonstrates that motion-derived structural priors enhance online landmark-based navigation under real-world sensory variability. Together, these results reframe self-motion as an organizing scaffold for coherent spatial representations, showing how brain-inspired principles can systematically strengthen spatial intelligence in embodied artificial agents.</description>

      <title>Snapshot 3D image projection using a diffractive decoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D image display is essential for next-generation volumetric imaging; however, dense depth multiplexing for 3D image projection remains challenging because diffraction-induced cross-talk rapidly increases as the axial image planes get closer. Here, we introduce a 3D display system comprising a digital encoder and a diffractive optical decoder, which simultaneously projects different images onto multiple target axial planes with high axial resolution. By leveraging multi-layer diffractive wavefront decoding and deep learning-based end-to-end optimization, the system achieves high-fidelity depth-resolved 3D image projection in a snapshot, enabling axial plane separations on the order of a wavelength. The digital encoder leverages a Fourier encoder network to capture multi-scale spatial and frequency-domain features from input images, integrates axial position encoding, and generates a unified phase representation that simultaneously encodes all images to be axially projected in a single snapshot through a jointly-optimized diffractive decoder. We characterized the impact of diffractive decoder depth, output diffraction efficiency, spatial light modulator resolution, and axial encoding density, revealing trade-offs that govern axial separation and 3D image projection quality. We further demonstrated the capability to display volumetric images containing 28 axial slices, as well as the ability to dynamically reconfigure the axial locations of the image planes, performed on demand. Finally, we experimentally validated the presented approach, demonstrating close agreement between the measured results and the target images. These results establish the diffractive 3D display system as a compact and scalable framework for depth-resolved snapshot 3D image projection, with potential applications in holographic displays, AR/VR interfaces, and volumetric optical computing.</description>

      <title>STEP: A Unified Spiking Transformer Evaluation Platform for Fair and Reproducible Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Transformers have recently emerged as promising architectures for combining the efficiency of spiking neural networks with the representational power of self-attention. However, the lack of standardized implementations, evaluation pipelines, and consistent design choices has hindered fair comparison and principled analysis. In this paper, we introduce STEP a unified benchmark framework for Spiking Transformers that supports a wide range of tasks, including classification, segmentation, and detection across static, event-based, and sequential datasets. STEP provides modular support for diverse components such as spiking neurons, input encodings, surrogate gradients, and multiple backends (e.g., SpikingJelly, BrainCog). Using STEP, we reproduce and evaluate several representative models, and conduct systematic ablation studies on attention design, neuron types, encoding schemes, and temporal modeling capabilities. We also propose a unified analytical model for energy estimation, accounting for spike sparsity, bitwidth, and memory access, and show that quantized ANNs may offer comparable or better energy efficiency. Our results suggest that current Spiking Transformers rely heavily on convolutional frontends and lack strong temporal modeling, underscoring the need for spike-native architectural innovations.

      <title>Position as Probability: Self-Supervised Transformers that Think Past Their Training for Length Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep sequence models typically degrade in accuracy when test sequences significantly exceed their training lengths, yet many critical tasks--such as algorithmic reasoning, multi-step arithmetic, and compositional generalization--require robust length extrapolation. We introduce PRISM, a Probabilistic Relative-position Implicit Superposition Model, a novel positional encoding mechanism that enables Transformers to extrapolate accurately up to 10x beyond their training length. PRISM learns continuous relative positions through a differentiable histogram-filter update, preserving position uncertainty via a probabilistic superposition rather than conventional deterministic embeddings. Empirically, PRISM achieves state-of-the-art length extrapolation, successfully generalizing to previously intractable sequence lengths across algorithmic benchmarks--including arithmetic (addition, multiplication), SCAN compositionality tasks, and complex copy variants derived from DeepMind's recent datasets. Our analysis demonstrates that PRISM's stochastic positional encoding maintains sharp and interpretable internal states, providing a theoretical basis for reliable length generalization. These results advance the goal of neural sequence models that remain algorithmically robust at lengths far exceeding their training horizon.</description>
