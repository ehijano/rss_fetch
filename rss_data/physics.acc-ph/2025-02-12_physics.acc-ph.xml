      <title>Spectrotemporal shaping of attosecond x-ray pulses with a fresh-slice free-electron laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02189v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a scheme allowing coherent shaping, i.e., controlling both the amplitude and phase, of attosecond x-ray pulses at free-electron lasers. We show that by seeding an FEL with a short coherent seed that overfills the amplification bandwidth, one can shape the Wigner function of the pulse by controlling the undulator taper profile. The examples of controllable pulse pairs and trains, as well as isolated spectrotemporally shaped pulses with very broad bandwidths are examined in detail. Existing attosecond XFELs can achieve these experimental conditions in a two-stage cascade, in which the seed is generated by a short current spike in an electron bunch and shaped in an unspoiled region within the same bunch. We experimentally demonstrate the production and control of phase-stable pulse trains using this method at the Linac Coherent Light Source II.</description>

      <title>Development of a bunching ionizer for TOF mass spectrometers with reduced resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In some types of mass spectrometers, such as Time of Flight mass spectrometers (TOF-MSs), it is necessary to control pulsed beams of ions. This can be easily accomplished by applying a pulsed voltage to the pusher electrode while the ionizer is continuously flowing ions. This method is preferred for its simplicity, although the ion utilization efficiency is not optimized. Here we employed another pulse-control method with a higher ion utilization rate, which is to bunch ions and kick them out instead of letting them stream. The benefit of this method is that higher sensitivity can be achieved; since the start of new ions cannot be allowed during TOF separation, it is highly advantageous to bunch ions that would otherwise be unusable. In this study, we used analytical and numerical methods to design a new bunching ionizer with reduced resources, adopting the principle of electrostatic ion beam trap. The test model experimentally demonstrated the bunching performance with respect to sample gas density and ion bunching time using gas samples and electron impact ionization. We also conducted an experiment in connection with a miniature TOF-MS, and showed that the sensitivity was improved by more than one order of magnitude using the newly developed ionizer. Since the device is capable of bunching ions with lower voltage and lower power consumption (~100 V, ~0.8 W) compared with conventional RF ion trap bunchers (several kilovolts, ~10 W), it will be possible to find applications in portable mass spectrometer with reduced resources.</description>

      <title>Near-Infrared noise in intense electron bunches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article investigates electron bunch density fluctuations in the 1 - 10 $\mu m$ wavelength range, focusing on their impact on coherent electron cooling (CEC) in hadron storage rings. In this study, we thoroughly compare the shot-noise model with experimental observations of optical transition radiation (OTR) generated by a relativistic electron bunch ($\gamma \approx$ 50), transiting an Aluminium metal surface. The bunch parameters are close to those proposed for a stage in an Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), where the bunch size is much larger than the OTR wavelength being measured. Here we present measurements and particle tracking results of both the low-level noise for the EIC bunch parameters and longitudinal space-charge-induced microbunching for the chicane-compressed bunch with coherent OTR enhancements up to 100 times in the various bandwidth-filtered near-infrared (NIR) OTR photodiode signals. We also discuss the corresponding limitations of the OTR method.</description>

      <title>Resonant Photon Scattering in the Presence of External Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This theoretical study explores resonant elastic photon scattering in the presence of external electric and magnetic fields, motivated by potential applications in storage ring experiments, such as the Gamma Factory project at CERN. In this framework, resonant scattering involves head-on collisions of relativistic ion beams and counter-propagating laser photons, leading to a strong enhancement of the external field strength due to the Lorentz transformation between ion rest and laboratory frame. Calculations for He-like Ca ions reveal a notable impact of the external fields on the scattering rate as well as the angular distribution and polarization of emitted photons. This opens interesting avenues for diverse applications for the Gamma Factory project, such as as resonance condition tuning, beam cooling, and polarization control.</description>

      <title>Electron Acceleration in Carbon Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wakefield wavelengths associated with solid-state plasmas greatly limit the accelerating length. An alternative approach employs 2D carbon-based nanomaterials, like graphene or carbon nanotubes (CNTs), configured into structured targets. These nanostructures are designed with voids or low-density regions to effectively reduce the overall plasma density. This reduction enables the use of longer-wavelength lasers and also extends the plasma wavelength and the acceleration length. In this study, we present, to our knowledge, the first numerical demonstration of electron acceleration via self-injection into a wakefield bubble driven by an infrared laser pulse in structured CNT targets, similar to the behavior observed in gaseous plasmas for LWFA in the nonlinear (or bubble) regime. Using the PIConGPU code, bundles of CNTs are modeled in a 3D geometry as 25 nm-thick carbon tubes with an initial density of $10^{22}$ cm$^{-3}$. The carbon plasma is ionized by a three-cycle, 800 nm wavelength laser pulse with a peak intensity of $10^{21}$ W cm$^{-2}$, achieving an effective plasma density of $10^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$. The same laser also drives the wakefield bubble, responsible for the electron self-injection and acceleration. Simulation results indicate that fs-long electron bunches with hundreds of pC charge can be self-injected and accelerated at gradients exceeding 1~TeV$/$m. Both charge and accelerating gradient figures are unprecedented when compared with LWFA in gaseous plasma.</description>
