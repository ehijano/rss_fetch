      <title>Negative Weights and Weight Cancellation to Treat Anisotropic Scattering in Multigroup Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Monte Carlo method is typically considered the gold standard for simulating reactor physics problems, as it does not require discretization of the phase space. This is not necessarily true though when simulating multigroup problems, as it has traditionally been a challenge to model anisotropic scattering in such simulations. Multigroup data used in reactor simulations generally uses low order Legendre expansion for scattering distributions, often stopping at the third Legendre moment. With so few terms, the angular distribution can easily have negative regions for highly anisotropic energy transfers, which makes it impossible to use standard Monte Carlo methods to sample a scattering angle. Multigroup Monte Carlo codes therefore often resort to only using isotropic scattering with the transport correction (which is not always possible), or approximating the angular distribution with discrete angles. Neither case is ideal, and makes it impossible to accurately model such problems or verify deterministic codes that can and do make use of the low order Legendre expansions without issue. This is addressed in the present study by using importance sampling in conjunction with negative particle weights to sample scattering angles from negative scattering distributions. It is demonstrated that such an approach necessitates the use of weight cancellation methods in order to be stable and converge to a solution. The technique is tested on two simple analytic benchmark problems, and then further demonstrated by modeling a small zero power research reactor, comparing results against a deterministic solver which can treat anisotropic scattering. Comparison of the simulation results indicates that importance sampling for anisotropic scattering with weight cancellation can be used to obtain reference Monte Carlo results for multigroup problems despite negative scattering distributions.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Physics-informed Neural Network: Towards Efficient Learning of High-speed Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study assesses the potential use of hybrid quantum physics-informed neural network (HQPINN) to model high-speed flows as an alternative to classical PINN and quantum neural network options. The model integrates parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) with classical neural network in parallel as input to a physics-based optimization. For problems with harmonic solutions, the HQPINN exhibits superior accuracy and trainability compared to both classical and quantum models at low parameter costs. For transonic flows, the hybrid approach yields modest results and additionally suffers from poor trainability if the quantum layer were under-parameterized. Our results highlight inherent limitations in deploying quantum neural networks in PINN applications, and potential use of hybrid architectures as a general tool in problems where the nature of the solution is not known a-priori.</description>

      <title>FGM Modeling of Thermo-Diffusive Unstable Lean Premixed Hydrogen-Air Flames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-lean premixed hydrogen combustion is a possible solution to decarbonize industry, while limiting flame temperatures and thus nitrous oxide emissions. These lean hydrogen/air flames experience strong preferential diffusion effects, which result in thermo-diffusive (TD) instabilities. To efficiently and accurately model lean premixed hydrogen flames, it is crucial to incorporate these preferential diffusion effects into flamelet tabulated chemistry frameworks, such as the Flamelet-Generated Manifold (FGM) method. This is challenging because the preferential diffusion terms in the control variable transport equations contain diffusion fluxes of all species in the mechanism. In this work, a new implementation is presented; the full term is reduced by only considering the most contributing species. When carefully selecting this set of major species, preferential diffusion fluxes along the flame front, i.e., cross-diffusion, can be captured. This is particularly important for manifolds that include heat loss effects, where enthalpy is one of the control variables. The diffusion of the H-radical has a significant contribution to the enthalpy transport equation, and cross-diffusion of the H-radical is non-negligible. Two manifolds, without and with heat loss effects, and the set of major species are analyzed in an a-priori and a-posteriori manner. Simulations of TD unstable hydrogen-air flames with detailed chemistry and several FGM models show that accurately capturing cross-diffusion of enthalpy is important for correctly predicting the flame shape and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of proton relative stopping power with a granular calorimeter detector model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton computed tomography (pCT) aims to facilitate precise dose planning for hadron therapy, a promising and effective method for cancer treatment. Hadron therapy utilizes protons and heavy ions to deliver well focused doses of radiation, leveraging the Bragg peak phenomenon to target tumors while sparing healthy tissues. The Bergen pCT Collaboration aims to develop a novel pCT scanner, and accompanying reconstruction algorithms to overcome current limitations. This paper focuses on advancing the track- and image reconstruction algorithms, thereby enhancing the precision of the dose planning and reducing side effects of hadron therapy. A neural network aided track reconstruction method is presented.</description>

      <title>CrystalFramer: Rethinking the Role of Frames for SE(3)-Invariant Crystal Structure Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystal structure modeling with graph neural networks is essential for various applications in materials informatics, and capturing SE(3)-invariant geometric features is a fundamental requirement for these networks. A straightforward approach is to model with orientation-standardized structures through structure-aligned coordinate systems, or"frames." However, unlike molecules, determining frames for crystal structures is challenging due to their infinite and highly symmetric nature. In particular, existing methods rely on a statically fixed frame for each structure, determined solely by its structural information, regardless of the task under consideration. Here, we rethink the role of frames, questioning whether such simplistic alignment with the structure is sufficient, and propose the concept of dynamic frames. While accommodating the infinite and symmetric nature of crystals, these frames provide each atom with a dynamic view of its local environment, focusing on actively interacting atoms. We demonstrate this concept by utilizing the attention mechanism in a recent transformer-based crystal encoder, resulting in a new architecture called CrystalFramer. Extensive experiments show that CrystalFramer outperforms conventional frames and existing crystal encoders in various crystal property prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>Wyckoff Transformer: Generation of Symmetric Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry rules that atoms obey when they bond together to form an ordered crystal play a fundamental role in determining their physical, chemical, and electronic properties such as electrical and thermal conductivity, optical and polarization behavior, and mechanical strength. Almost all known crystalline materials have internal symmetry. Consistently generating stable crystal structures is still an open challenge, specifically because such symmetry rules are not accounted for. To address this issue, we propose WyFormer, a generative model for materials conditioned on space group symmetry. We use Wyckoff positions as the basis for an elegant, compressed, and discrete structure representation. To model the distribution, we develop a permutation-invariant autoregressive model based on the Transformer and an absence of positional encoding. WyFormer has a unique and powerful synergy of attributes, proven by extensive experimentation: best-in-class symmetry-conditioned generation, physics-motivated inductive bias, competitive stability of the generated structures, competitive material property prediction quality, and unparalleled inference speed.</description>

      <title>Inferring Galactic Parameters from Chemical Abundances with Simulation-Based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galactic chemical abundances provide crucial insights into fundamental galactic parameters, such as the high-mass slope of the initial mass function (IMF) and the normalization of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) rates. Constraining these parameters is essential for advancing our understanding of stellar feedback, metal enrichment, and galaxy formation processes. However, traditional Bayesian inference techniques, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), are computationally prohibitive when applied to large datasets of modern stellar surveys. We leverage simulation-based-inference (SBI) as a scalable, robust, and efficient method for constraining galactic parameters from stellar chemical abundances and demonstrate its the advantages over HMC in terms of speed, scalability, and robustness against model misspecifications. We combine a Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) model, CHEMPY, with a neural network emulator and a Neural Posterior Estimator (NPE) to train our SBI pipeline. Mock datasets are generated using CHEMPY, including scenarios with mismatched nucleosynthetic yields, with additional tests conducted on data from a simulated Milky Way-like galaxy. SBI results are benchmarked against HMC-based inference, focusing on computational performance, accuracy, and resilience to systematic discrepancies. SBI achieves a $\sim75,600\times$ speed-up compared to HMC, reducing inference runtime from $\gtrsim42$ hours to mere seconds for thousands of stars. Inference on $1,000$ stars yields precise estimates for the IMF slope ($\alpha_{\rm IMF} = -2.298 \pm 0.002$) and SN Ia normalization ($\log_{10}(N_{\rm Ia}) = -2.885 \pm 0.003$), deviating less than 0.05% from the ground truth. SBI also demonstrates similar robustness to model misspecification than HMC, recovering accurate parameters even with alternate yield tables or data from a cosmological simulation.

      <title>2D hydrodynamic simulation of TeraFETs beyond the gradual-channel approximation for transient, large-signal or ultrahigh-frequency simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18764v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past decade, detection of THz radiation by plasma-wave-assisted frequency mixing in antenna-coupled field-effect transistors (TeraFETs) -- implemented in various semiconductor material systems (Si CMOS, GaN/AlGaN, GaAs/AlGaAs, graphene, etc.) -- has matured and led to a practically applied detector technology. This has been supported by the development of powerful device simulation tools which take into account relevant collective carrier dynamics and mixing processes in various approximations. These tools mostly model carrier transport in 1D and they are usually geared towards continuous-wave illumination of the device and small-signal response. Depending on their implementation, it may not be possible readily to simulate large-signal and pulsed operation. Another approximation which may lead to unsatisfactory results is the 1D restriction to calculate only the longitudinal electric field components. Especially at the edges of the gate electrode, solving of the 2D Poisson equation promises better results. This contribution introduces a stable way to solve the 2D Poisson equation self-consistently with the hydrodynamic transport equations including the numerically challenging convection term. We employ a well-balanced approximate Harten-Lax-van-Leer-Contact Riemann solver. The approach is well suited for a future treatment of transient and large-signal cases. The 2D treatment also generically extends the model beyond the gradual-channel approximation and allows to calculate the FET's response at high THz frequencies where the gate-to-channel potential acquires a non-local character. Model calculations are performed for the exemplary case of a 65-nm Si CMOS TeraFET in the isothermal approximation.</description>

      <title>Accurate and efficient machine learning interatomic potentials for finite temperature modeling of molecular crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As with many parts of the natural sciences, machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are revolutionizing the modeling of molecular crystals. However, challenges remain for the accurate and efficient calculation of sublimation enthalpies - a key thermodynamic quantity measuring the stability of a molecular crystal. Specifically, two key stumbling blocks are: (i) the need for thousands of ab initio quality reference structures to generate training data; and (ii) the sometimes unreliable nature of density functional theory, the main technique for generating such data. Exploiting recent developments in foundational models for chemistry and materials science alongside accurate quantum diffusion Monte Carlo benchmarks, offers a promising path forward. Herein, we demonstrate the generation of MLIPs capable of describing molecular crystals at finite temperature and pressure with sub-chemical accuracy, using as few as $\sim 200$ data structures; an order of magnitude improvement over the current state-of-the-art. We apply this framework to compute the sublimation enthalpies of the X23 dataset, accounting for anharmonicity and nuclear quantum effects, achieving sub-chemical accuracy with respect to experiment. Importantly, we show that our framework can be generalized to crystals of pharmaceutical relevance, including paracetamol and aspirin. Nuclear quantum effects are also accurately captured as shown for the case of squaric acid. By enabling accurate modeling at ambient conditions, this work paves the way for deeper insights into pharmaceutical and biological systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07278v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel approach to reservoir computation measurements using random matrices. We do so to motivate how atomic-scale devices could be used for real-world computational applications. Our approach uses random matrices to construct reservoir measurements, introducing a simple, scalable means of generating state representations. In our studies, two reservoirs, a five-atom Heisenberg spin chain and a five-qubit quantum circuit, perform time series prediction and data interpolation. The performance of the measurement technique and current limitations are discussed in detail, along with an exploration of the diversity of measurements provided by the random matrices. In addition, we explore the role of reservoir parameters such as coupling strength and measurement dimension, providing insight into how these learning machines could be automatically tuned for different problems. This research highlights the use of random matrices to measure simple quantum reservoirs for natural learning devices, and outlines a path forward for improving their performance and experimental realization.</description>

      <title>Fast multilabel classification of HEP constraints with deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The shortcomings of the Standard Model (SM) motivate its extension to accommodate new expected phenomena, such as dark matter and neutrino masses. However, such extensions are generally more complex due to the presence of a large number of free parameters and additional phenomenology. Understanding how theoretical and experimental limits affect the parameter spaces of new models, individually and collectively, is of utmost importance for conducting model status analysis, motivating precise computations, or model-building aimed at solving certain issues. However, checking the constraints usually require a large amount of time using a chain of physics tools. We demonstrate, for the first time, the application of deep learning (DL) for the multilabel classification (MLC) of a group of theoretical and experimental constraints in the dark doublet phase of the next-to-two-Higgs-doublet model (DDP-N2HDM), as a representative 9-dimensional parameter space. We analyze the issue of class imbalance and the ability of the classifier to learn joint class distributions. We demonstrate the time advantage compared to physics tools, with the classifier achieving orders of magnitude faster checks on groups of constraints and strong performance. The classifier performed strongly in terms of identifying regions where all constraints are valid or invalid, as well as regions where one or more of the constraints are valid or invalid simultaneously. This approach can be applied to any extension beyond the SM with the potential to aid HEP tools or act as a surrogate for fast model status checks. To that end, we provide a python tool \texttt{HEPMLC} for generating and investigating multilabel classifiers for SM extensions.</description>

      <title>Energy-momentum-conserving stochastic differential equations and algorithms for nonlinear Landau-Fokker-Planck equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12079v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coulomb collision is a fundamental diffusion process in plasmas that can be described by the Landau-Fokker-Planck (LFP) equation or the stochastic differential equation (SDE). While energy and momentum are conserved exactly in the LFP equation, they are conserved only on average by the conventional corresponding SDEs, suggesting that the underlying stochastic process may not be well-defined by such SDEs. In this study, we derive new SDEs with exact energy-momentum conservation for the Coulomb collision by factorizing the collective effect of field particles into individual particles and enforcing Newton's third law. These SDEs, when interpreted in the Stratonovich sense, have a particularly simple form that represents pure diffusion between particles without drag. Numerical algorithms that preserve discrete conservation laws are developed and benchmarked in various relaxation processes. Techniques to reduce computational complexity are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Structural and Magnetic Properties of Co-rich bct CoMn Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02812v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thin-films of bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ grown by molecular beam epitaxy on MgO(001) were measured to have an enhanced atomic magnetic moment of $2.52 \pm 0.07$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ beyond the pinnacle of the Slater-Pauling curve for Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$ with a moment of $2.42$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$. The compositional variation of the average total moment for thin-film bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ alloys is in stark contrast to the historical measurements of bulk fcc Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$. These GGA calculations reveal that significant improvements of this ferromagnetic forced bct phase on MgO(001) are possible via substrate selection. For example, bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ films on MgO(001) are calculated to have lower atomic moments than those on substrates with smaller lattice constants such as GaAs(001), BaTiO$_3$(110), and SrTiO$_3$(110) which is predicted to increase the average atomic moment up to $2.61$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ and lead to increased structural stability and therefore thicker film growths.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning Accelerated Descriptor Design for Catalyst Discovery: A CO$_2$ to Methanol Conversion Case Study</title>

Abstract: Transforming CO$_2$ into methanol represents a crucial step towards closing the carbon cycle, with thermoreduction technology nearing industrial application. However, obtaining high methanol yields and ensuring the stability of heterocatalysts remain significant challenges. Herein, we present a sophisticated computational framework to accelerate the discovery of novel thermal heterogeneous catalysts, using machine-learned force fields. We propose a new catalytic descriptor, termed adsorption energy distribution, that aggregates the binding energies for different catalyst facets, binding sites, and adsorbates. The descriptor is versatile and can easily be adjusted to a specific reaction through careful choice of the key-step reactants and reaction intermediates. By applying unsupervised machine learning and statistical analysis to a dataset comprising nearly 160 metallic alloys, we offer a powerful tool for catalyst discovery. Finally, we propose new promising candidate materials such as ZnRh and ZnPt$_3$, which to our knowledge, have not yet been tested, and discuss their possible advantage in terms of stability.</description>

      <title>Coupled-cluster pairing models for radicals with strong correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pairing hierarchy of perfect pairing (PP), perfect quadruples (PQ) and perfect hextuples (PH) are sparsified coupled cluster models that are exact in a pairing active space for 2, 4, and 6 electron clusters, respectively. We describe and implement three extensions for radicals. First is the trivial generalization that does not correlate radical orbitals. The second model (PQr, PHr) includes terms that entangle pair indices and radical indices such that their maximum total number is 2 for PQ and 3 for PH (like their closed-shell versions). The third family of extended radical models (PPxr, PQxr, and PHxr) include cluster amplitudes that entangle up to 1, 2, and 3 pair indices with up to 1, 2, and 3 radical indices. Notably, PPxr and PQxr are exact for (3e,3o) and (5e,5o), respectively, while still having only $O(N)$ and $O(N^{2}$) amplitudes like their parent models (for $N$ paired electrons). Orbital optimization is considered for PPxr. A series of large-scale numerical tests of these models are presented for spin gaps, and ionization energies of polyenes and polyenyl radicals, ranging in size from ethene and allyl radical up to C$_{22}$H$_{24}$ in full-valence active spaces up to (122e,122o). The xR models perform best.</description>
