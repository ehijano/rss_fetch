      <title>A comprehensive liver CT landmark pair dataset for evaluating deformable image registration algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Evaluating deformable image registration (DIR) algorithms is vital for enhancing algorithm performance and gaining clinical acceptance. However, there's a notable lack of dependable DIR benchmark datasets for assessing DIR performance except for lung images. To address this gap, we aim to introduce our comprehensive liver computed tomography (CT) DIR landmark dataset library.
  Acquisition and Validation Methods: Thirty CT liver image pairs were acquired from several publicly available image archives as well as authors' institutions under institutional review board approval. The images were processed with a semi-automatic procedure to generate landmark pairs: 1) for each case, liver vessels were automatically segmented on one image; 2) landmarks were automatically detected at vessel bifurcations; 3) corresponding landmarks in the second image were placed using the deformable image registration method; 4) manual validation was applied to reject outliers and confirm the landmarks' positional accuracy. This workflow resulted in an average of ~68 landmark pairs per image pair, in a total of 2028 landmarks for all 30 cases. The general landmarking accuracy of this procedure was evaluated using digital phantoms. Estimates of the mean and standard deviation of landmark pair target registration errors (TRE) on digital phantoms were 0.64 and 0.40 mm. 99% of landmark pairs had TREs below 2 mm.
  Data Format and Usage Notes: All data are publicly available at Zenodo. Instructions for using our data and MATLAB code can be found on our GitHub page.
  Potential Applications: The landmark dataset generated in this work is the first collection of large-scale liver CT DIR landmarks prepared on real patient images. This dataset can provide researchers with a dense set of ground truth benchmarks for the quantitative evaluation of DIR algorithms within the liver.</description>

      <title>Selecting active matter according to motility in an acoustofluidic setup: Self-propelled particles and sperm cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active systems -- including sperm cells, living organisms like bacteria, fish, birds, or active soft matter systems like synthetic ''microswimmers'' -- are characterized by motility, i.e., the ability to propel using their own ''engine''. Motility is the key feature that distinguishes active systems from passive or externally driven systems. In a large ensemble, motility of individual species can vary in a wide range. Selecting active species according to their motility represents an exciting and challenging problem. We propose a new method for selecting active species based on their motility using an acoustofluidic setup where highly motile species escape from the acoustic trap. This is demonstrated in simulations and in experiments with self-propelled Janus particles and human sperm. The immediate application of this method is selecting highly motile sperm for medically assisted reproduction (MAR). Due to the tunable acoustic trap, the proposed method is more flexible than the existing passive microfluidic methods. The proposed selection method based on motility can also be applied to other active systems that require selecting highly motile species or removing immotile species.</description>

      <title>Super Phantoms: advanced models for testing medical imaging technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phantoms are test objects used for initial testing and optimization of medical imaging techniques, but these rarely capture the complex properties of the tissue. Here we introduce super phantoms, that surpass standard phantoms being able to replicate complex anatomic and functional imaging properties of tissues and organs. These super phantoms can be computer models, inanimate physical objects, or ex-vivo organs. Testing on these super phantoms, will enable iterative improvements well before in-vivo studies, fostering innovation. We illustrate super phantom examples, address development challenges, and envision centralized facilities supporting multiple institutions in applying these models for medical advancements.</description>

      <title>Reduced-order models of wall shear stress patterns in the left atrial appendage from a data-augmented atrial database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, affecting over 1% of the population. It is usually triggered by irregular electrical impulses that cause the atria to contract irregularly and ineffectively. It increases blood stasis and the risk of thrombus formation within the left atrial appendage (LAA) and aggravates adverse atrial remodeling. Despite recent efforts, LAA flow patterns representative of AF conditions and their association with LAA stasis remain poorly characterized.
  Aim: To develop reduced-order data-driven models of LAA flow patterns during atrial remodeling in order to uncover flow disturbances concurrent with LAA stasis that could add granularity to clinical decision criteria.
  Methods: We combined a geometric data augmentation process with projection of results from 180 CFD atrial simulations on a universal LAA coordinate (ULAAC) system. The projection approach enhances data visualization and facilitates direct comparison between different anatomical and functional states. ULAAC projections were used as input for a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) algorithm to build reduced-order models of hemodynamic metrics, extracting flow characteristics associated with AF and non-AF anatomies.
  Results: We verified that the ULAAC system provides an adequate representation to visualize data distributions on the LAA surface and to build POD-based reduced-order models. These models revealed significant differences in LAA flow patterns for atrial geometries that underwent adverse atrial remodeling and experienced elevated blood stasis. Together with anatomical morphing-based patient-specific data augmentation, this approach could facilitate data-driven analyses to identify flow features associated with thrombosis risk due to atrial remodeling.</description>

      <title>Proton-CAT: a Novel Proposal for Enhanced Proton Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02760v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a nitrogen-targeting-Proton-Carbon-Alpha-Therapy method, abbreviated as Proton-CAT, which partially converts protons into carbon-12 and $\alpha$ particles through nuclear reactions between protons and nitrogen-15. Monte Carlo simulations validated the effectiveness of the Proton-CAT, and the study specifically focused on the distribution of relative energy deposition. The results indicated that the presence of nitrogen-15 enhanced the maximum dose level of protons, resulting in more effective damage confined to tumor cells. Statistical analysis of secondary ions has shown that the Proton-CAT significantly increases the production efficiencies of carbon-12 and $\alpha$ particles. Furthermore, it has been revealed that elevating the nitrogen-15 concentration significantly boosts the dose of carbon and $\alpha$ particles within the tumor region. The present work would contribute to the future development of proton therapy.</description>

      <title>An Optimization Framework to Personalize Passive Cardiac Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02807v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Personalized cardiac mechanics modeling is a powerful tool for understanding the biomechanics of cardiac function in health and disease and assisting in treatment planning. However, current models are limited to using medical images acquired at a single cardiac phase, often limiting their applicability for processing dynamic image acquisitions. This study introduces an inverse finite element analysis (iFEA) framework to estimate the passive mechanical properties of cardiac tissue using time-dependent medical image data. The iFEA framework relies on a novel nested optimization scheme, in which the outer iterations utilize a traditional optimization method to best approximate material parameters that fit image data, while the inner iterations employ an augmented Sellier's algorithm to estimate the stress-free reference configuration. With a focus on characterizing the passive mechanical behavior, the framework employs structurally based anisotropic hyperelastic constitutive models and physiologically relevant boundary conditions to simulate myocardial mechanics. We use a stabilized variational multiscale formulation for solving the governing nonlinear elastodynamics equations, verified for cardiac mechanics applications. The framework is tested in myocardium models of biventricle and left atrium derived from cardiac phase-resolved computed tomographic (CT) images of a healthy subject and three patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). The impact of the choice of optimization methods and other numerical settings, including fiber direction parameters, mesh size, initial parameters for optimization, and perturbations to optimal material parameters, is assessed using a rigorous sensitivity analysis. The performance of the current iFEA is compared against an assumed power-law-based pressure-volume relation, typically used for single-phase image acquisition.</description>

      <title>K-band: Self-supervised MRI Reconstruction via Stochastic Gradient Descent over K-space Subsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although deep learning (DL) methods are powerful for solving inverse problems, their reliance on high-quality training data is a major hurdle. This is significant in high-dimensional (dynamic/volumetric) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where acquisition of high-resolution fully sampled k-space data is impractical. We introduce a novel mathematical framework, dubbed k-band, that enables training DL models using only partial, limited-resolution k-space data. Specifically, we introduce training with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) over k-space subsets. In each training iteration, rather than using the fully sampled k-space for computing gradients, we use only a small k-space portion. This concept is compatible with different sampling strategies; here we demonstrate the method for k-space "bands", which have limited resolution in one dimension and can hence be acquired rapidly. We prove analytically that our method stochastically approximates the gradients computed in a fully-supervised setup, when two simple conditions are met: (i) the limited-resolution axis is chosen randomly-uniformly for every new scan, hence k-space is fully covered across the entire training set, and (ii) the loss function is weighed with a mask, derived here analytically, which facilitates accurate reconstruction of high-resolution details. Numerical experiments with raw MRI data indicate that k-band outperforms two other methods trained on limited-resolution data and performs comparably to state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods trained on high-resolution data. k-band hence obtains SoTA performance, with the advantage of training using only limited-resolution data. This work hence introduces a practical, easy-to-implement, self-supervised training framework, which involves fast acquisition and self-supervised reconstruction and offers theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>RF-ULM: Ultrasound Localization Microscopy Learned from Radio-Frequency Wavefronts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01545v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM), achieving high-resolution images relies on the precise localization of contrast agent particles across a series of beamformed frames. However, our study uncovers an enormous potential: The process of delay-and-sum beamforming leads to an irreversible reduction of Radio-Frequency (RF) channel data, while its implications for localization remain largely unexplored. The rich contextual information embedded within RF wavefronts, including their hyperbolic shape and phase, offers great promise for guiding Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in challenging localization scenarios. To fully exploit this data, we propose to directly localize scatterers in RF channel data. Our approach involves a custom super-resolution DNN using learned feature channel shuffling, non-maximum suppression, and a semi-global convolutional block for reliable and accurate wavefront localization. Additionally, we introduce a geometric point transformation that facilitates seamless mapping to the B-mode coordinate space. To understand the impact of beamforming on ULM, we validate the effectiveness of our method by conducting an extensive comparison with State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) techniques. We present the inaugural in vivo results from a wavefront-localizing DNN, highlighting its real-world practicality. Our findings show that RF-ULM bridges the domain shift between synthetic and real datasets, offering a considerable advantage in terms of precision and complexity. To enable the broader research community to benefit from our findings, our code and the associated SOTA methods are made available at https://github.com/hahnec/rf-ulm.</description>

      <title>Optical-coherence-tomography-based deep-learning scatterer-density estimator using physically accurate noise model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a deep-learning-based scatterer density estimator (SDE) that processes local speckle patterns of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images and estimates the scatterer density behind each speckle pattern. The SDE is trained using large quantities of numerically simulated OCT images and their associated scatterer densities. The numerical simulation uses a noise model that incorporates the spatial properties of three types of noise, i.e., shot noise, relative-intensity noise, and non-optical noise. The SDE's performance was evaluated numerically and experimentally using two types of scattering phantom and in vitro tumor spheroids. The results confirmed that the SDE estimates scatterer densities accurately. The estimation accuracy improved significantly when compared with our previous deep-learning-based SDE, which was trained using numerical speckle patterns generated from a noise model that did not account for the spatial properties of noise.</description>
