      <title>Bayesian inference on Calabi--Yau moduli spaces and the axiverse: experimental data meets string theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop tools of Bayesian inference on the moduli space of Calabi--Yau (CY) manifolds. We sample from the invariant Weil--Petersson (WP) measure using Markov Chain Monte Carlo and normalising flows on \Kahler moduli space with dimension up to $h^{1,1}=30$, and present results on the spectrum of the CY volume and properties of divisors when the measure is restricted in physically meaningful ways. We furthermore present a theory-informed prior on axion masses and decay constants $(m_a,f_a)$ marginalised over the WP measure for all inequivalent CYs constructable from the Kreuzer--Skarke database with $h^{1,1}\leq 5$. We then impose likelihoods based on axion physics. We demonstrate how detection of a relatively heavy QCD axion at small $h^{1,1}$, e.g. by ADMX, provides detailed information about CY geometry and topology. Finally, we compute a full forward model incorporating likelihoods from the cosmic microwave background and Lyman-alpha forest and find the maximum posterior probability region on the moduli space of a given CY favoured by a resolution of the tension in these data by an ultralight axion composing $\mathcal{O}(1\%)$ of the dark matter. This demonstration serves as a blueprint for future statistical analyses within string phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Baby Universes from Thermal Pure States in SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a simple two-dimensional holographic model of a closed "baby" universe. The baby universe spacetime originates from the black hole interior in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity. The holographic description is a low-temperature thermal pure state of two Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. The construction of the state relies on the insertion of a heavy matter operator, which supports the baby universe, together with a first-order thermal phase transition between a black hole phase and an empty Anti de Sitter (AdS) phase. For the transition, we employ a version of the Maldacena-Qi phase transition of two coupled SYK systems. The bulk entanglement between the AdS region and the baby universe remains O(N) below the transition, owing to the large number of light bulk fields. This entanglement admits a definition through coarse-graining over SYK couplings.</description>

      <title>A Bootstrap Study of Confinement in AdS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Yang-Mills theory in AdS$_{4}$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions is expected to undergo a transition as the AdS radius varies, since the boundary data is incompatible with confinement in flat space. Various mechanisms have been proposed for the disappearance of the Dirichlet boundary condition. From the boundary viewpoint, the associated $3d$ CFT is a deformation of a generalised free theory of non-Abelian conserved currents, with the deformation governed by the bulk gauge coupling. We test these scenarios by deriving non-perturbative constraints from the numerical conformal bootstrap of the four-point function of non-Abelian conserved currents. We rule out the scenario in which the boundary current decouples. Bounds on the lightest scalar operators disfavour a bulk Higgs mechanism and instead point to a transition driven by a scalar singlet becoming marginal. We also obtain bounds on other scalar operators and on the current central charge, and we refine character-based techniques incorporating parity and charge-conjugation symmetry to determine the operator spectrum of the $3d$ Generalised Free Vector theory. These results may be of independent interest beyond Yang-Mills theory in AdS.</description>

      <title>Semi-universality of CFT$_d$ entropy at large spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal partition function, $Z$, of a $CFT_d$ on $S^{d-1}$ is parameterized by the inverse temperature $\beta$ along with $\lfloor d/2\rfloor$ angular velocities $\omega_i$. In this paper, we investigate the behaviour of this partition function when $n$ of the $\omega_i$ are scaled to unity (the largest allowed value) at fixed values of the other $(\lfloor d/2\rfloor-n)$ angular velocities. We argue that $\ln Z$ develops a simple pole in $(1-\omega_i)$ for each $\omega_i$ that is scaled to unity. The residue of this product of poles is a theory dependent (so non-universal) function of $\beta$ and the fixed angular velocities. The inverse Laplace transformation of this partition function constrains the functional form of the field theory entropy as a function of charges in a limit in which angular momenta and the twist are scaled as follows. While $n$ special angular momenta $J_1\ldots J_n$ are scaled to infinity, the twist and the other angular momenta - collectively denoted $x_i$ - are also taken to infinity but at the slower rate that ensures that the scaled charges $x_i/(J_1 J_2 \ldots J_n)^{\frac{1}{n+1}}$ are held fixed. In this limit, we demonstrate that the scaled entropy $S/(J_1 J_2 \ldots J_n)^{\frac{1}{n+1}}$ depends only on the $\lfloor d/2\rfloor-n+1$ scaled charges defined above (the precise form of this dependence is non-universal). We verify our predictions (and compute all non-universal functions) in the case of free scalar theories (which show surprisingly rich behaviour) as well as large $N$, strongly coupled ${\cal N}=4$ Yang Mills theory. The last theory is analyzed in the bulk via the AdS/CFT correspondence. In the scaling limit described above, its phase diagram displays sharp phase transitions between black hole, grey galaxy, and thermal gas phases.</description>

      <title>Finite Gauss-Sum Modular Kernels: Scalar Gap and a Pure AdS$_3$ Gravity No-Go Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain closed-form expressions for the $ST^nS$ modular kernels of non-rational Virasoro CFTs and use them to construct fully analytic modular-bootstrap functionals. At rational width $\tau$, the Mordell integrals in these kernels reduce to finite quadratic Gauss sums of $\operatorname{sech}/\sec$ profiles with explicit Weil phases, furnishing a canonical finite-dimensional real basis for spectral kernels. From this basis we build finite-support "window" functionals with $\Phi(0)=1$ and $\Phi(p)&gt;0$ on a prescribed low-momentum interval. Applied to the scalar channel of the $ST^1S$ kernel, these functionals yield a rigorous analytic bound on the spinless gap. As a second application we prove an analytic no-go theorem for pure AdS$_3$ gravity: no compact, unitary, Virasoro-only CFT$_2$ can have a primary gap above $\Delta_{\rm BTZ}=(c-1)/12$, because a strictly positive "Mordell surplus" in the odd-spin $ST$ kernel forces an odd-spin primary below $\Delta_{\rm BTZ}$.</description>

      <title>Instability thresholds for de Sitter and Minkowski spacetimes in holographic semiclassical gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of $d$-dimensional ($d=3,4,5$) de Sitter and Minkowski spacetimes within the framework of semiclassical gravity sourced by a strongly coupled quantum field with a gravity dual. Our stability results are derived from a careful analysis of the $d$-dimensional Lichnerowicz equation with mass-squared $m^2$ and of semiclassical equations involving the dimensionless parameter $\gamma_d$. For $d=3$, we find that Minkowski spacetime is always unstable against perturbations, whereas de Sitter spacetime becomes stable when a dimensionless parameter $\gamma_3$ exceeds a critical value. In $d=4$, both de Sitter and Minkowski spacetimes become unstable when the parameter $\gamma_4$ exceeds its critical value. In contrast, in $d=5$, de Sitter and Minkowski spacetimes remain stable for almost all values of the parameter $\gamma_5$, except for a regime in which higher-curvature corrections become comparable to the Einstein tensor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harmonic ${\cal N}=2$ superspace was discovered in 1984 as the powerful tool of the geometric superfield off-shell description of ${\cal N}=2, 4D$ supersymmetric field theories with the maximal spins 1, 2, and 1/2 (${\cal N}=2$ Yang-Mills theories, supergravity and matter hypermultiplets). My talk is a brief account of the basic achievements of the harmonic methods, including the newest applications in ${\cal N}=2$ theories of higher spins.</description>

      <title>The $Z_N$ equivariant Virasoro algebra via alternative Sugawara constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the $U(1)^2$ Kac--Moody algebra and generalize the standard Sugawara construction of the Virasoro algebra to an infinite family of new realizations. In this case, in addition to the standard invariant tensor $\delta^{ij}$, there exists another invariant tensor $\epsilon^{ij}$, which enables the construction of genuinely new realizations beyond the conventional one. We show that these new realizations arise from a $\mathbb{Z}_N$--grading of the mode index $n$ of the Virasoro generators $L_n$ and the space of such realizations corresponds to points of a possibly singular algebraic variety. For the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_3$ cases, the space of all such constructions is topologically equivalent to a cylinder, while for $\mathbb{Z}_4$ it forms a non-compact real four-dimensional manifold. We show that the spaces of constructions for $Z_{2N}$ and $Z_{2N+1}$ are closely similar. Furthermore, we reformulate the problem within an action-principle framework by introducing $\mathbb{Z}_N$-equivariant maps, which provide a systematic method for constructing conformal field theories endowed with these generalized Virasoro symmetries. This formulation reproduces the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ case and supports the idea that $\mathbb{Z}_N$-equivariance offers a consistent and unified approach to generating extended conformal algebras. Finally, we analyze the corresponding Virasoro--Kac--Moody-like algebras associated with these constructions and show that they represent nontrivial deformations of the well-known Virasoro-Kac-Moody algebra.</description>

      <title>Strings at the Tip of the Cone and Black Hole Entropy From the Worldsheet: Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear sigma model (NLSM) worldsheet action describing the motion of closed bosonic strings in the target space of a two-dimensional (2D) flat cone in polar coordinates. We calculate the cylinder partition function. We first place the cylindrical worldsheet on a rectangular lattice before taking the continuum limit. We find an integer number of string configurations on the worldsheet, which we call line defects, that run from one boundary of the cylinder to the other. We insert two sources (conical defects) at each boundary and fix the two ends of the line defect by Dirichlet boundary conditions to a point $r_c$ in target space. In target space, a line defect appears as an Susskind\&amp;Uglum-type open string ending on $r_c$. We compute the semiclassical contribution to the off-shell cylinder amplitude by saddle point approximation. The amplitude has an interesting infrared (IR) divergence structure that depends on the given range of the cone angle. We then compute the entropy by varying the cone angle. In a particular renormalization scheme that relates the ultraviolet (UV) and to the infrared (IR) limits of the modulus integral, we find the entropy to be free of IR divergences but linearly dependent on the radial cutoff. We argue that our calculation provides a well-defined state on a constant Euclidean-time slice directly from the string worldsheet. We also study the 2D flat cone NLSM without discretization. We compute the entropy from the off-shell stationary action and show it is finite in each winding sector $W$ with a maximum at $r_c=\sqrt{\alpha'}/|W|$. After summing over all winding sectors, it still has a finite maximum in the UV limit but for $r_c &gt;0$.</description>

      <title>No boundary density matrix in elliptic de Sitter dS/$\mathbb{Z}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elliptic de Sitter (dS) spacetime dS$/\mathbb{Z}_2$ is a non-time-orientable spacetime obtained by imposing an antipodal identification to global dS. Unlike QFT on global dS, whose vacuum state can be prepared by a no-boundary Euclidean path integral, the Euclidean elliptic dS does not define a wavefunction in the usual sense. We propose instead that the path integral on the Euclidean elliptic dS defines a no-boundary density matrix. As an explicit example, we study the free Dirac fermion CFT in two-dimensional elliptic dS and analytically compute the von Neumann and the R\'enyi entropies of this density matrix. The calculation reduces to correlation functions of vertex operators on non-orientable surfaces. As a by-product, we compute the time evolution of entanglement entropy following a crosscap quench in free Dirac fermion CFT. We also comment on a striking feature of free QFT in elliptic dS: its global Hilbert space is one-dimensional, wheres the Hilbert space associated to each observer is a nontrivial Fock space.</description>

      <title>Chiral Composite Linear Dilaton as String Dual to Two-Dimensional Yang-Mills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory (2d YM) is arguably the simplest confining gauge theory and its large $N_c$ expansion has a structure of the genus expansion in string theory. Nevertheless various aspects of its worldsheet description have not been fully understood. In this paper, we elaborate on a bosonic string dual to large $N_c$ chiral 2d YM at finite 't Hooft coupling, proposed in our earlier work. The worldsheet theory consists of $\beta$-$\gamma$ system deformed by linear dilaton action built from a composite of $\gamma$. It can be seen as a noncritical version of nonrelativistic string theory introduced by Gomis and Ooguri. We provide a detailed analysis of the worldsheet operator product expansion and the computation of three- and four-point scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The matter operator in the double-scaled SYK model exhibits special properties when its dimension is analytically continued to -1/2. The operator is then in a degenerate representation of the q-deformed oscillator algebra, and it satisfies a null vector equation. Its peculiar fusion property gives rise to recursion relations among correlation functions of matters. We find that those relations are strong enough to determine the two-point function without any knowledge from chord diagrammatics.</description>

      <title>Perturbative corrections to soft photon theorems for massless scalar QED in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The perturbative corrections to soft photon theorems with massive scalars in de Sitter spacetime were computed in [JHEP10(2023)055]. However, the massless limit of the scalar modes is ill-defined in their work. It therefore is ambiguous to take the massless limit of the soft factors. In this paper, we derive the massless scalar modes in $d$-dimensional de Sitter spacetime and use it to compute the perturbative corrections to the leading and sub-leading soft photon theorems. Our framework corresponds to tree level scattering of massless scalars followed by an emission of a soft photon in a compact region of the static patch of de Sitter. We show that our results are consistent with [JHEP10(2023)055] in the massless limit and we comment on the universality of our results.</description>

      <title>AdS gravastar and its signatures from dual conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum gravity effects are expected to resolve the black hole singularity and the effects may deform the region near but outside the horizon. Applying AdS/CFT correspondence, we see their signatures from the viewpoint of dual conformal field theory. As a regularized geometry, we consider AdS gravastar constructed by gluing AdS-Schwarzschild and de Sitter spacetime. The retarded Green functions of dual conformal field theory have bulk-cone singularities associated with null trajectories in the bulk and we obtain the singularities specific to a horizon-less geometry. We also observe echoes coming from waves reflected behind the photon sphere. The existence of echoes implies the modification of geometry inside the photon sphere.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Weyl Symmetry and Its Anomaly in a Curved Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore an unusual symmetry in a field theory on a specific (1+1)-dimensional curved spacetime, which has an interesting interpretation as an approximate asymptotic Weyl symmetry. Unlike the conventional Weyl symmetry, the boundary term under the variation plays a crucial role in understanding for its anomaly. After converting a two-dimensional field theory on curved spacetime to an inhomogeneous field theory, we obtain the vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor. Then, we show the existence of an Unruh-like effect in the bubble wall expansion at the zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Rational $Q$-systems for integrable spin chains without $U(1)$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $Q$-system is an efficient method for finding complete physical solutions of Bethe ansatz equations, but so far its application has been confined to systems possessing $U(1)$ symmetry. We extend the rational $Q$-system framework to integrable spin chains without $U(1)$ symmetry, exemplified by the closed XXZ model with anti-diagonal twists and the open XXZ model with non-diagonal boundary fields. We demonstrate that the $Q$-system can be derived by combining $TQ$-relation with fusion relations of higher-spin transfer matrices. This yields $QQ$-relations analogous to the $U(1)$ symmetric case but incorporating additional inhomogeneous terms. We present numerical solutions that are validated against exact diagonalization, confirming that it generates all and exclusively physical solutions.</description>

      <title>The emergence of inherently 9-dimensional one-loop couplings from T-duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that applying the Buscher rules to the dimensional reduction of ten-dimensional, one-loop effective actions may generate "purely stringy" couplings in nine dimensions that cannot be lifted to a local, covariant form in ten dimensions. We investigate this phenomenon at order $\alpha'^3$ in type IIA string theory. By computing the circular reduction of the one-loop Chern-Simons term and pure-gravity couplings in type IIA theory and applying the T-duality transformation to the resulting couplings, we derive their counterparts in the type IIB effective action. We demonstrate that the resulting nine-dimensional type IIB couplings are invariant under S-duality without requiring contributions from the tree-level effective action or non-perturbative effects. This result is non-trivial: while S-duality forbids one-loop Chern-Simons couplings in ten-dimensional type IIB theory, we show that the one-loop Chern-Simons couplings in nine dimensions, derived from the T-duality of type IIA, are S-duality invariant. As a consistency check, we show that the nine-dimensional type IIB couplings, when reduced on a K3 surface, reproduce the known heterotic string couplings on \( T^5 \) at order \( \alpha' \), via the duality between the two theories.</description>

      <title>Towards a complete description of multiple D$p$-brane systems: Multiple D$0$ Story</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we address the problem of constructing the complete supersymmetric description of systems of $N$ nearly coincident Dirichlet $p$-branes (multiple D$p$-brane or mD$p$). A particularly important result is a completely nonlinear action for the 10-dimensional dynamical system of nearly coincident multiple D$0$-branes (mD$0$) which is doubly supersymmetric, i.e. it is invariant under both spacetime (target superspace) supersymmetry and the worldline supersymmetry; the latter is a counterpart of the local fermionic $\kappa$-symmetry characteristic of a single D$0$-brane (Dirichlet superparticle). This problem is approached in flat superspace using the (spinor) moving frame formalism, which provides us with a geometric framework to the treatment of supersymmetric particles and extended objects ($p$-branes) in higher dimensions. Furthermore, we have initiated the quantization program aimed at development of a field theory of multiple D$0$-branes. This quantization in its complete form is expected to lead to a novel supersymmetric field theory formulated on a superspace extended by additional bosonic and fermionic matrix coordinates, whose development may offer significant insights into the deeper structure of String/M-theory.</description>

Abstract: We provide a string theory realisation of a two-parameter family of Type IIB supergravity solutions of the form ${\rm WAdS}_3 \times {\rm WS}^3 \times M_4$, as near-horizon geometries of supersymmetric backgrounds involving D1-D5 branes, D3-branes and NS5-branes. We show that the full solutions, as well as their near-horizon limits, preserve four supercharges. We end by presenting a new doubly-deformed warped black hole solution and study its thermodynamical properties.</description>

      <title>Letelier black hole immersed in an electromagnetic universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a static, spherically symmetric black hole solution surrounded by a cloud of strings and immersed in an electromagnetic universe. By deriving the event horizon from the lapse function, we demonstrate that both the string cloud parameter and the electromagnetic background parameter significantly modify the horizon radius compared to the Schwarzschild case. Consequently, thermodynamic quantities-including the Hawking temperature, Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and heat capacity-become explicit functions of these additional parameters, with the heat capacity exhibiting divergences that signal phase transitions. We analyze the motion of massive test particles in this spacetime, deriving the effective potential and calculating the innermost stable circular orbit radius, which governs the inner edge of accretion disks and influences orbital stability. Scalar perturbations are examined through the associated effective potential, and quasinormal mode frequencies are computed using the sixth-order WKB approximation; the negative imaginary parts confirm the stability of the black hole under such perturbations. We also study the photon sphere structure, black hole shadow radius, and photon trajectories, showing how the interplay between string clouds and the electromagnetic background shapes the optical properties of this spacetime. Finally, we investigate weak gravitational lensing phenomena by deriving the deflection angle for both massive particles and photons using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem applied to the optical geometry. The results exhibit notable deviations from the Schwarzschild geometry, with the string cloud enhancing the deflection through a $(1-\alpha)^{-1}$ factor while the electromagnetic parameter introduces competing corrections at second order.</description>

      <title>Enhanced energy extraction via magnetic reconnection in Kerr-AdS spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the energy extraction from Kerr-AdS black holes following the magnetic reconnection process. The parameter space regions that satisfy the energy extraction condition, as well as the efficiency and power of the extracted energy, are analyzed. The study shows that the presence of a negative cosmological constant extends the range of dominant reconnection radial locations where the energy extraction condition is met, and enables energy extraction even from black holes with relatively low spin. Furthermore, the influence of the negative cosmological constant on energy extraction is modulated by the extent of the dominant reconnection radial region: a more negative cosmological constant enhances the extracted energy, efficiency, and power, particularly for smaller dominant reconnection radii. These results demonstrate that the energy extraction from Kerr-AdS black holes is more favorable than that from their asymptotically flat counterparts. Our results highlight the crucial role of the cosmological constant in energy extraction via magnetic reconnection.</description>

      <title>Cosmology of Gravi-Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how a mass term for gravitational axions (''gravi-axions'') with a Chern-Simons coupling to gravity can naturally arise due to non-perturbative contributions from Euclidean wormholes, breaking the continuous shift symmetry of the standard theory. The induced mass can be generated in a cosmologically relevant range to be the dark matter or dark energy of the universe for a reasonable and well-motivated range of the symmetry breaking scale. Upon generating the gravi-axion mass term, we discuss the cosmology of the theory. We find that the gravi-axion can be produced to be the dominant dark matter component via misalignment or gravitational particle production, and that in a different regime, the gravi-axion can act as dynamical dark energy. We discuss gravi-axion decay into gravitons as a potential observational window for this theory. Finally, we find that, for late-time, astrophysical compact objects, cosmologically relevant gravi-axions behave as minimally-coupled, massive scalar fields.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the sensitivity to neutrino oscillation parameters using synergy between T2K, NO$\nu$A and JUNO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of combining the present NO$\nu$A and T2K data with simulated data from the JUNO experiment on the determination of the leptonic CP phase and the neutrino mass hierarchy. The current NO$\nu$A data exhibit a hierarchy--$\delta_{\rm CP}$ degeneracy, admitting both normal hierarchy (NH) with $\delta_{\rm CP} \in [0,180^\circ]$, and inverted hierarchy (IH) with $\delta_{\rm CP} \in [180^\circ,360^\circ]$ solutions at comparable significance, while T2K prefers $\delta_{\rm CP}\simeq 270^\circ$ for both hierarchies, leading to a $2\sigma$ tension between the two experiments for normal hierarchy. Using detailed GLoBES simulations, we show that future JUNO data with excellent hierarchy sensitivity, can lift the hierarchy--$\delta_{\rm CP}$ degeneracy in NO$\nu$A and strengthen the hierarchy reach of T2K in spite of having no $\delta_{\rm CP}$ sensitivity. Allowing the hierarchy to be a free parameter in the fit, if the true ordering is IH, JUNO aligns the NO$\nu$A and T2K allowed regions and resolves their present tension; if NH is true, the tension continues to persist. We also show that JUNO's precise measurement of $|\Delta_{31}|$ leads to improved constraints on $\sin^2\theta_{23}$ and $\delta_{\rm CP}$ for normal mass hierarchy in NO$\nu$A even though JUNO itself is insensitive to these parameters. Finally, updated solar parameter measurements from JUNO's first data release further enhance the combined precision. Our results demonstrate that JUNO plays a crucial synergistic role in the global neutrino oscillation programme, enabling a more robust determination of the mass ordering and improving the sensitivity to the CP phase when combined with long-baseline data.</description>

      <title>Measuring the effect of spatial dimension on hydrodynamic turbulence using direct numerical simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform direct numerical simulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation with forcing at different spatial dimensions and measure turbulent and chaotic properties. Lyapunov exponents, $\lambda$, decrease with dimension, and $\lambda &lt; 0$ for all simulations in six-dimensions up to $Re = 40$. These six-dimensional simulations display non-Gaussian statistics and other behavior similar to well developed turbulence despite their lack of chaos. Further, we find that small scale perturbations do not extend to the largest scales and that this terminal scale between correlation and decorrelation shrinks with dimension. We theorize that this change is related to the increased rate of vortex stretching. We find the interplay between turbulent and chaotic properties changes with increasing dimension.</description>

      <title>Braided QM and Majorana qubits at third root of unity: a color Heisenberg-Lie (super)algebra framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce color Heisenberg-Lie (super)algebras graded by the abelian groups $Z_3^2$, $Z_2^p\times Z_3^2$ for $p=1,2,3$, and investigate the properties of their associated multi-particle quantum paraoscillators. In the Rittenberg-Wyler's color Lie (super)algebras framework the above abelian groups are the simplest ones which induce mixed brackets interpolating commutators and anticommutators. These mixed brackets allow to accommodate two types of parastatistics: one based on the permutation group (beyond bosons and fermions in any space dimension) and an anyonic parastatistics based on the braid group. In both such cases the two broad classes of paraparticles are given by parabosons and parafermions. Mixed-bracket parafermions are created by nilpotent operators; they satisfy a generalized Pauli exclusion principle leading to roots-of-unity truncations in their multi-particle energy spectrum (braided Majorana qubits and their Gentile-type parastatistics are recovered in this color Lie superalgebra setting). Mixed-bracket parabosons do not admit truncations of the spectrum; the minimal detectable signature of their parastatistics is encoded in the measurable probability density of two indistinguishable parabosonic oscillators in a given energy eigenstate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral vectorlike fermion as inspired by unified theories might become quasi-Dirac states at TeV due to a violation in lepton-like symmetry. It is shown that such quasi-Dirac fermions can properly achieve radiative neutrino mass generation and dark matter stability. Indeed, the small splitting of quasi-Dirac masses, i.e. $\Delta M/M\ll 1$, suitably suppresses neutrino mass to be small in order to allow dark matter annihilation and detection to be appropriate to experiment as well as charged lepton flavor violation limit.</description>

Abstract: We study the scattering of boson-star binaries, taking into account three effects: point-mass gravitational, tidal, and short-range scalar-field interactions. We compare analytic results to the scattering angle extracted from four sequences of numerical-relativity simulations at fixed energy and varying impact parameter. The very good agreement exhibits the attractive (repulsive) effect of in-phase (out-of-phase) binaries, wich dominates at small impact parameters. We thus obtain the first effective-one-body potential, central for the construction of analytic gravitational-wave templates.</description>

      <title>Quantum ramp secret sharing from Haar scrambling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum information scrambling has emerged as a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of chaotic quantum many-body systems, assessing benchmarking protocols, and even investigating exotic black hole models. During quantum information scrambling, localized quantum information disperses across the entire system, hiding from the observers who can only access part of it. On the other side, we have a fundamental cryptographic primitive called secret-sharing schemes, where a dealer shares a quantum secret with a group of parties, such that any subset of parties above a specific threshold size can reconstruct it. In this paper, we demonstrate that two protocols, Haar scrambling, which serves as a baseline for other scrambling techniques, and quantum secret sharing, are indeed equivalent. The scheme one gets out of this is of a ramp secret-sharing nature rather than a threshold scheme. We expect this because of the inherent randomness present in Haar unitaries. Moreover, by varying the purity of the initial states, we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain all possible types of ramp secret-sharing schemes. Furthermore, utilizing complexity theoretic arguments, we argue that the protocol can be implemented efficiently, i.e., in polynomial time. Finally, we explore potential applications, ranging from security implications for distributed quantum networks to cryptography in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, and draw insights for fundamental physics, such as many-body physics and quantum black holes.</description>

      <title>A Classification of Invertible Stabilizer Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for the classification of invertible translation-invariant stabilizer codes modulo condensation and stabilization with simple codes. We introduce generalizations of the Pauli groups of local unitaries for quantum systems of qudits on cubic lattices and analyze stabilizer Hamiltonians whose terms are chosen from these groups. We define invertible stabilizer codes to be ground states of stabilizer Hamiltonians with trivial topological charges and completely classify them in any spatial dimension in terms of relative L-theory groups. In particular, we show that the group of equivalence classes of such codes in three spatial dimensions is isomorphic to the Witt group of abelian topological orders in two spatial dimensions. Additionally, we propose the spectrum of the relative L-theory as a representative of the generalized cohomology theory corresponding to the invertible stabilizer states.</description>

      <title>Linear realization of SU(3) parity doublet model for octet baryons with bad diquark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a linear $SU(3)_L \times SU(3)_R$ parity doublet model for octet baryons. Our model employs the $(3,\bar{3}) + (\bar{3},3)$ and $(3,6) + (6,3)$ chiral representations while excluding the $(8,1) + (1,8)$ representation. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate that the $(3,6) + (6,3)$ representation containing symmetric ``bad'' diquarks, despite being energetically disfavored, is essential for reproducing the correct baryon mass hierarchy, particularly the $\Sigma$$\Xi$ mass ordering. The model incorporates both spontaneous and explicit chiral symmetry breaking, with the latter implemented through bare quark mass terms that properly account for $SU(3)$ flavor breaking effects. Our numerical analysis successfully reproduces the ground-state octet baryon masses and predicts the spectrum of excited states up to 2.5 GeV. For the experimentally challenging $\Xi$ sector, we provide specific predictions for spin-parity assignments: identifying $\Xi(1950)$ as the first positive-parity excitation. The analysis reveals that ground states are dominated by the $(3,\bar{3}) + (\bar{3},3)$ representation, consistent with the preference for ``good'' diquark configurations, while the $(3,6) + (6,3)$ contribution remains crucial for the mass spectrum.</description>

      <title>Kiselev Black Holes in Anti-de Sitter Spacetime Are Not Viable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the Kiselev black hole solution does not describe a perfect fluid quintessence, it is possible that dark energy fluid is not isotropic, and so one may hope that the solution may still describe at least locally a black hole embedded in such a dark energy fluid environment. Taking into account that the accelerated expansion of the Universe is caused by a dynamical dark energy fluid, and the actual underlying cosmological constant is negative as has been sometimes suggested, we show that the Kiselev solution is untenable as it is unstable against brane nucleation instability.</description>

      <title>Consistent Regularization of Signature-Changing BTZ Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spacetime singularities pose a fundamental challenge to classical and quantum gravity. We develop a mathematically consistent framework for signature-changing black holes by revisiting the $(2+1)$-dimensional BTZ metric, which undergoes a Lorentzian-to-Euclidean transition at the horizon. We identify and resolve a critical inconsistency in previous regularization schemes concerning second-order distributional terms $\varepsilon''(r)$, introducing a \emph{modified Hadamard regularization} that is rigorously defined within distribution theory. This yields a vacuum solution without surface layers or impulsive waves. Geodesic analysis shows that infalling observers require infinite proper time to reach the horizon, and curvature remains finite everywhere. Furthermore, we establish the physical viability of the solution by proving its linear stability, demonstrating consistent quantum scalar field propagation across the horizon, and reinterpreting the $r=0$ singularity as a removable topological boundary. Our work places signature change and the associated \emph{atemporality} on a solid foundation as a robust mechanism for singularity resolution.</description>

      <title>Fermi-liquid view of viscosity in cold and dense nucleon matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework to calculate transport properties in cold, dense relativistic quasiparticle system within the Fermi-liquid theory at the mean-field level. Building on our previous study [Phys. Rev. C 111, 044904 (2025)], we start from the linearized relativistic Boltzmann equation tailored to quasiparticles with medium-dependent dispersion relation and implement Landau matching conditions, proving that the bulk viscosity is manifestly nonnegative. A low-temperature expansion then yields leading-order ($T/\mu^*$) expressions for the shear ($\eta$) and bulk ($\zeta$) viscosities, where the behavior $\zeta/\eta \propto (T/\mu^*)^4$ in the degenerate regime is found to be robust against quasiparticle mass correction. We couple the kinetic framework to a Walecka-type mean-field equation of state and compute $\eta$ and $\zeta$ for cold, dense nucleon matter. The transport properties of nucleonic matter in the degenerate regime can be relevant for intermediate beam-energy nuclear experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wigner function is a well-known phase space distribution function with many applications in quantum mechanics. In this article, we consider an open quantum system consisting of a non-relativistic single particle interacting with a general, possibly relativistic environment. For this system, we derive an expression for directly computing the time-dependent Wigner function from its initial values. This result renders time-dependent Wigner functions more applicable without having to make additional approximations that would otherwise be required in order to solve the corresponding equation of motion. As an illustration of our findings, we discuss the example of a non-relativistic single scalar particle interacting via a Yukawa interaction with an environment comprising another type of scalar field that is treated relativistically.</description>

      <title>Analytical Emulator for the Baryon EoM inside the Fuzzy Dark Matter Soliton from Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An empirical baryon density profile can be included in the Schr\"odinger-Poisson (SP) equations to influence the fuzzy dark matter (FDM) soliton formation. However, to probe the effects of baryon on the other dynamical evolutions of the FDM soliton, its equation of motion (EoM) inside the corresponding FDM soliton is needed. In this paper, given an empirical baryon density profile, we first provide the cylinderical symmetric FDM soliton solution about the FDM density and the total potential of FDM and baryon. Then, we build an analytical baryon EoM from the obtained FDM density and total potential by machine learning. Finally, we check that this baryon EoM works as well as an empirical baryon density profile for the FDM soliton formation, with the fractional errors $\lesssim0.04$. It should also work well for some other simple FDM soliton evolutions.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Stability Criteria for Multi-Fluid Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous proof establishing the mathematical equivalence between two independent criteria for the marginal stability of multi-fluid relativistic stars: the dynamical criterion based on the vanishing of the fundamental radial pulsation mode's eigenfrequency, and the static criterion derived from the geometric alignment of mass and particle number gradients in the parameter space. Leveraging this equivalence, we introduce a powerful and computationally efficient framework as an upgraded version of the critical curve method, to systematically map the stability boundaries for multi-fluid mixed stars across the entire parameter space of central pressures. Our analysis, applied to a variety of nuclear and dark matter equations of state, reveals the existence of stable region in the observable mass-radius diagram. By resolving degeneracies with 3-dimensional Mass-Radius-Pressure diagrams, we provide a complete topological view of the ensemble. This work supplies a robust theoretical foundation for interpreting multi-messenger astronomical observations and constraining the properties of dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concerning the stability of two-fluid star models, we prove the rigorous equivalence of two independent determining methods for mixed stars, after a brief review of the hybrid star case. Our derivations apply to general multi-fluid cases, and here we take dark matter admixed neutron star models for example, demonstrating a stability boundary distinct from the single-fluid case. Stable configurations form a surface in the three-dimensional parameter space of (either) central pressure, mass, and radius, which yields a group containing stable mixed stars. This group includes twin stars with identical masses and radii but different interior structures. These results can help interpret compact star observations and constrain dark matter properties through astrophysics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We take a fresh look at the viability of physically realistic extremal black holes within our (non-supersymmetric) low energy physics. By incorporating prefactors and volume effects, we show that Schwinger discharge in charge neutral environments is far more efficient than commonly assumed. Using ionization estimates for neutral hydrogen, we obtain a new and robust lower bound on the mass of an extremal electrically charged black hole, exceeding $10^{14} M_\odot$. For magnetic black holes, we compute the Lee-Nair-Weinberg instability and revisit early universe pair creation rates, including singular instantons that substantially enhance production, to demonstrate that the extreme charges required for stability are cosmologically implausible. Finally, we suggest that an extremal Kerr black hole could shed angular momentum via superradiant scattering from the stochastic gravitational wave background. Taken together, our results provide a unified picture that extremal black holes of any type are unlikely to persist in our universe.</description>

      <title>Explicit and universal formula for thermodynamic volume in extended black hole thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In extended black hole thermodynamics, the cosmological constant and other couplings are treated as thermodynamic variables, yielding a first law $\tilde{\delta}M=T\tilde{\delta}S+\Omega\tilde{\delta}J+\mathcal{V}\tilde{\delta}P+\cdots$, where $P\equiv -\frac{\Lambda}{8\pi}$. A long-standing conceptual gap in this framework is that, unlike $M$, $T$, $S$, $\Omega$, and $J$, the thermodynamic volume $\mathcal{V}$ lacks a first-principles definition and can only be deduced from other thermodynamic quantities. This deficiency indicates that the underlying origin of $\mathcal{V}$ has remained poorly understood. In this work, we resolve this issue and provide an explicit universal formula for $\mathcal{V}$. We demonstrate that it universally decomposes into two contributions, one arising from the explicit dependence of the action on the couplings and the other from the response of the fundamental dynamical fields. This clarifies the physical meaning of thermodynamic volume and places it on the same footing as other intrinsic thermodynamic quantities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate gluon densities at small $x$ are essential for reducing theoretical uncertainties in collider predictions, yet remain one of the least constrained ingredients in global analyses. We report recent advances in the resummation of small-$x$ logarithms in the gluon sector, focusing on collinear distributions and their interplay with transverse-momentum-dependent formulations. Particular attention is paid to the impact of gluon-proton spin correlations and to the emergence of unintegrated gluon densities derived from resummed dynamics. These developments aim to fill the current precision gap in the small-$x$ region and enable robust applications to LHC and future-collider observables.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new factorization pattern for tree-level Yang-Mills (YM) amplitudes, where they decompose into a sum of gluings of two lower-point amplitudes by setting specific two-point non-planar Mandelstam variables within a rectangular configuration to zero. This approach manifests the hidden zeros of YM amplitudes recently identified. Furthermore, by setting specific Lorentz products involving polarization vectors to zero, the amplitudes further reduce to a sum of products of three currents. These novel factorizations provide a fresh perspective on the structure of YM amplitudes, potentially enhancing our understanding and calculation of these fundamental quantities.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a free scalar field in a specific (1+1)-dimensional curved spacetime. By introducing an algebraic state that is locally Hadamard, we derive the renormalized Wightman function and explicitly calculate the covariantly conserved quantum energy-momentum tensor up to a relevant order. From this result, we show that the Hadamard renormalization scheme, which has been effective in traditional quantum field theory in curved spacetime, is also applicable in the quantum inhomogeneous field theory. As applications of this framework, we show the existence of an Unruh-like effect for an observer slightly out of the right asymptotic region, as well as the vanishing of quantum frictional effect in the leading order ($e^{- bx}$) on the bubble wall expansion during the electroweak phase transition in the early universe.</description>

Abstract: We show that chiral higher-spin gravity with a vanishing cosmological constant admits a class of exact self-dual pp-wave solutions derived from harmonic scalar functions and two principal spinors. These solutions satisfy both the linear and non-linear equations of motion, as they annihilate all higher-order vertices, leading to the equations of motion for free fields on a self-dual background sourced by a positive-helicity spin-2 field. Our method employs a simple light-cone ansatz for positive-helicity chiral higher-spin fields, along with a modified Kerr-Schild ansatz adapted for the self-dual gravity framework.</description>

      <title>Bosonic string massive scalar amplitudes and absence of "chaos''</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute directly in covariant formalism various four point massive scalar amplitudes in bosonic string with scalars up to level 11.
  The most ``difficult'' amplitude we consider is four identical scalars at level 4, i.e. the first non trivial amplitude with four identical massive scalars.
  All other amplitudes have at least one tachyon.
  All computed amplitudes are perfectly regular and show no sign of erratic behavior. While this could be naively expected it is not completely trivial because of higher spins exchanged.
  We give a naive argument based on a very simple model of why this can reasonably be expected and we check on the explicit examples that the intuition derived from the model is sensible.
  Furthermore we discuss the complications due to null states (BRST exact states) in actually computing the covariant bosonic string spectrum and how these can be overcome by using a ``$\Pi$ gauge'' which makes manifest that the degeneration of any spin at any mass level is independent on the spacetime dimension as predicted by Curtright et al at the end of 90s.</description>

      <title>Strongly Coupled Sectors in Inflation: Gapless Theories and Unparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17840v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute correlation functions of the primordial density perturbations when they couple to a gapless, strongly coupled sector of spectator fields -- ``unparticles" -- during inflation. We first derive a four-point function of conformally coupled scalars for all kinematic configurations in de Sitter, which exchanges an unparticle at tree-level, by performing direct integration using the Mellin-Barnes method. To obtain inflationary bispectra and trispectra, we apply weight-shifting operators to the conformally coupled scalar correlator. We show that the correlators solve differential equations determined by the additional symmetries enjoyed by the unparticle propagator. Based on these differential equations, we are able to discuss the spinning-unparticle exchanges, focusing on two possible cases where the currents or the stress tensor of unparticles are coupled to inflatons, with the help of spin-raising operators. Finally, we study the phenomenology of the resulting shape functions. Depending on the value of the unparticle scaling dimension, we classify three characteristic shapes for the inflationary bispectra, including near-equilateral, near-orthogonal, and a novel shape which appears when the scaling dimensions are close to half-integers. More generally, we find that the leading order squeezed limits are insufficient to conclusively determine the detection of a light particle or unparticle. Only the full shapes of bispectra and trispectra can break this degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Time as a test-field: the no-boundary universe in motion and a smooth radiation bounce</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08703v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proper time of an observer can be introduced as a degree of freedom in quantum cosmology, additional to the existing fields. We review two arguments for using the Schr\"odinger equation to evolve the corresponding wavefunction. We restrict to solutions in which time acts as a component with negligible backreaction on the metric -- that is, it plays the role of a test field. We apply this idea to various minisuperspace models. In the semiclassical regime we recover expected results: the wavefunction peaks on the classical solution and, in models with a scalar field, the variance of $\zeta$ (a mini-superspace analogue of the comoving curvature perturbation) is conserved. Applied to the no-boundary wavefunction, our model recovers the bouncing behavior of classical global de Sitter space, with small corrections associated to the evolving variance of the wavefunction. Other bouncing solutions do not have any classical analogue. This is the case of a radiation dominated universe, which classically leads to a big-bang singularity but corresponds quantum mechanically to an $s$-wave scattering off a central potential of the form $-r^{-2/3}$. As much as the hydrogen atom, this potential is famously made stable by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. We study the unitary evolution of the wavepacket numerically. During the bounce, the uncertainty and the expectation value of the scale factor become comparable. By selecting a large initial variance, the bounce can be made arbitrarily smooth, the mean value of the Hubble parameter correspondingly soft.</description>

Abstract: Cosmological correlation functions are central observables in modern cosmology, as they encode properties of the early universe. In this paper, we derive novel canonical differential equations for wavefunction coefficients in power-law FRW cosmologies by combining positive geometries and the combinatorics of tubings of Feynman graphs. First, we establish a general method to derive differential equations for any function given as a twisted integral of a logarithmic differential form. By using this method on a natural set of functions labelled by tubings of a given Feynman diagram, we derive a closed set of differential equations in the canonical form. The coefficients in these equations are related to region variables with the same notion of tubings, providing a uniform combinatorial description of the system of equations. We provide explicit results for specific examples and conjecture that this approach works for any graph.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the quantum tunneling process through a topology transition near a conifold singularity, in the setup of IIB CY3 orientifold compactification. We propose a novel method to do moduli stabilization in an extended moduli space, parametrized by both the geometric moduli and the light D3-brane wrapping modes arisen from the brane quantization. Assuming the absence of flux through the vanishing exceptional 3-cycle, we find two types of vacuum solutions, one corresponds to the resolved conifold and the other one is interpreted as a novel non-geometric phase. We compute the quantum tunneling rate between these two solutions and find that it is difficult to achieve a significantly large tunneling rate in the controllable regime.</description>

Abstract: Superconformal extensions of the perfect fluid equations, which realize $N=1,2$ Schrodinger superalgebra, are constructed within the Hamiltonian formalism. They are built by introducing real (for $N=1$) or complex (for $N=2$) anticommuting field variables as superpartners for the density and velocity of a fluid. The full set of conserved charges associated with the $N=1,2$ Schrodinger superalgebra is constructed. Within the Lagrangian formalism, when the Clebsch decomposition for the velocity vector field is used, the anticommuting variables can be interpreted as potentials parameterizing fluid's vorticity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The traditional formulation of string amplitudes via worldsheet integrals provides a parametrization of the moduli space that fails to expose the complete singularity structure of the amplitudes. This problem is solved by the positive parametrization of string amplitudes given by surfaceology. In this work, we use this formalism to study a number of properties of string amplitudes at tree-level and one-loop. We introduce several global prescriptions for an integration contour for which the integrals are finite everywhere in kinematic space. At tree-level, this is done in two ways: one directly implements the Feynman $i\varepsilon$ to analytically continue from Euclidean to Lorentzian worldsheets; the other is a generalization of the closed Pochhammer contour to arbitrary number of points. At loop-level, we present a systematic way of extracting cuts directly from the worldsheet integrand. This provides a powerful set of unitarity constraints, which we use to test the consistency of different "stringy" UV regularizations of field theory amplitudes. In addition, we identify the massive threshold expansion of the integrand, which allows us to reduce the problem to a finite set of Feynman integrals in Schwinger parametrization and provide a straightforward contour prescription reminiscent of its field-theory version.</description>

      <title>Near-extremal dynamics away from the horizon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near-extremal black holes are usually studied by zooming into the throat that describes their near-horizon geometry. Within this throat, one can argue that two-dimensional JT gravity is the appropriate effective theory that dominates at low temperature. Here, we discuss how to capture this effective description by standing far away from the horizon. Our strategy is to construct a phase space within gravitational theories in AdS$_{d+1}$ that fixes the radial dependence while keeping the transverse dependence arbitrary. This allows us to implement a decoupling limit directly on the phase space while keeping the coordinates fixed. With this, we can relate the effective description in JT gravity to the CFT$_d$ description at the boundary of AdS$_{d+1}$, which we do explicitly in AdS$_3$ and non-rotating configurations in AdS$_4$. From the perspective of the dual CFT, our decoupling limit should be understood as a flow between a CFT$_{d}$ and a near-CFT$_1$. Our analysis shows that local counterterms can be constructed in the near-CFT$_1$, which arise from the anomalies (or absence of them) in the CFT$_{d}$. We show that one of these counterterms is the Schwarzian effective action, making this sector a scheme-dependent choice. This illustrates the delicate interplay between a far and a near analysis of near-extremal black holes.</description>

      <title>Irrational CFTs from coupled anyon chains with non-invertible symmetries?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Irrational CFTs in 1+1d with a discrete spectrum and no conserved currents other than the stress-tensor are expected to be generic, unsolvable by standard methods, and hard to construct explicitly. We introduce a lattice model that realizes a candidate for such a CFT as a conformal phase of matter without fine-tuning. The model is constructed by coupling $N\geq3$ golden anyon chains together, preserving $N$ copies of the Fibonacci non-invertible symmetry. We use the MPS/DMRG approach to study this model numerically, which allows us to calculate the corresponding conformal data, obtaining hints of its irrationality. Along the way, we characterize the phase diagram for $N=2$ coupled chains where we identify a weakly first-order phase transition as well as critical points that we are able to identify with known rational CFTs, except for one case. We also provide an extensive list of rational CFTs with $1&lt;c&lt;2.1$.</description>

      <title>Low-energy multi-photon scattering at tree-level and one-loop order in a homogeneous electromagnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study low energy photons coupled to scalar and spinor matter in the presence of an arbitrary homogeneous electromagnetic field in a first-quantised (worldline) approach. Utilising a Fock-Schwinger gauge for both the scattering photons and homogeneous background, simple compact expressions are found for both the photon- and background-dressed effective action and propagator in scalar and spinor quantum electrodynamics. The low-energy limit allows identification of the coupling of the scattering photons as one of an effective homogeneous superposition of their field strengths, with amplitudes following from application of a suitable linearisation operator.
  To treat the linearisation, several techniques are employed, including a functional expansion based on the proper time formalism and worldline Green functions, linearised vertex operators under a worldline path integral, and a matrix expansion in the field strengths. We find, in particular, that a replacement rule converting scalar amplitudes to spinor amplitudes at one-loop order can, surprisingly, be extended to tree level amplitudes in the low energy limit. Finally, we discuss a novel worldline representation of the momentum space matter propagators, obtaining a suitable worldline Green function for this path integral satisfying homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions and momentum space vertex operators representing the scattering photons already in momentum space.</description>

Abstract: We construct the $Z_{N}$ symmetry extended fusion ring of bulk and chiral theories and the corresponding modular partition functions with nonanomalous subgroup $Z_{n}(\subset Z_{N})$. The chiral fusion ring provides fundamental data for the $Z_{N}$ graded symmetry topological field theories and also provides algebraic data of smeared boundary conformal field theories describing zero modes of the extended models. For more general multicomponent or coupled systems, we also obtain a new series of extended theories. By applying the folding trick, their partition functions correspond to charged or gapped domain walls or massless renormalization group flows preserving quotient group structures.</description>

Abstract: The concept of energy lies at the foundation of physical science. In general relativity and quantum field theory, the positivity and conservation of energy are encapsulated by the so-called energy-momentum tensor and the energy conditions. In recent efforts to unify fundamental physics with quantum information, the energy conditions have come to play a crucial role in establishing numerous theorems. In this article, we review the basics of energy conditions in general relativity and their applications in gravitational physics, quantum field theory, and the holographic principle. Through these applications, we explore the profound connection between the energy conditions and quantum information</description>

Abstract: Four- and six-dimensional Drinfeld doubles were classified in the past in terms of Manin triples. We provide an important step towards the classification of eight-dimensional Drinfeld doubles by presenting an extensive list of Manin triples formed by pairs of four-dimensional Lie algebras. Due to the high complexity of the classification we focus on Manin triples formed by algebras in a certain standard form. The list contains 188 non-isomorphic Manin triples plus their duals.
  To apply the results, we construct several four-dimensional WZW models on non-semisimple Lie groups. Some of the WZW models are known from the literature, but new cases are presented as well. As a consequence of the construction method, the WZW models are Poisson--Lie dualizable.</description>

Abstract: We quantize D$0$-brane, the simplest representative of the family of supersymmetric Dirichlet p-branes, in its spinor moving frame formulation and analyze its quantum state spectrum. Besides being a preparatory stage for quantization of the complete supersymmetric multiple D$0$-brane (mD$0$) model, which is presently known only in the frame of spinor moving frame formalism, this is interesting as its own: despite the covariant quantization of D=10 D$0$-brane was discussed before, its quantum state spectrum was not analyzed and its field theory, describing that, was not studied.
  We show that the quantum state vector of the D$0$-brane is described by an on-shell superfield that collects the fields of the massive counterpart of the linearized type IIA supergravity supermultiplet which can be obtained as massive Kaluza-Klein mode of the dimensional reduction of the eleven dimensional supergravity down to ten dimensions. In conclusion, we briefly discuss a spinor helicity formalism for D$0$-brane which can be used as one of the basic elements for developing type IIA string theory amplitude calculus based on multiparticle generalizations of the on-shell superfields.</description>

Abstract: In this work, based on an analogy of holographic confining geometries and using complexified fields, we build the holographic toy model of third order photonic exceptional points (EPs) of ternary coupled microrings with gain and loss, which makes an open, non-Hermitian quantum system. In our model, we discuss the Ferrell-Glover-Tinkham sum rule for various combinations of gain and loss systems, and numerically find the behavior of spectra which matches with the experiments. We also discuss the inhomogeneous case of a holographic lattice for three-site photonic EPs. Additionally, in our holographic model, we numerically find the behavior of phase rigidity and the Petermann factor around EPs versus various parameters of the model. We also discuss the connections between recent developments in complexified, time-dependent entanglement entropy and EPs, and finally, we connect EPs and the $\theta$-vacuum of QCD through topological structures, partition functions, and winding numbers, and find a second-order EP in a perturbed $\theta$-vacuum model.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric extensions of Kac-Moody boundary conditions in AdS$_3$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the Kac-Moody (KM) boundary conditions of AdS$_3$ gravity by incorporating fermionic fields. For $\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$ AdS$_3$ supergravity, we show that there are two possible ways to implement the fermionic extension. In the first, the extended KM boundary conditions are related to the standard super-Virasoro (VS) boundary conditions through a large gauge transformation realized by the super-Miura map between fields and chemical potentials, establishing a supersymmetric generalization of the KM-VS correspondence. In the second, a more general boundary configuration leads to strong constraints on the fermionic chemical potentials, yet offers a much richer asymptotic structure. It provides us a novel realization of the extended Kac-Moody algebra, and a geometric interpretation in terms of folds in the relativistic free-fermion droplet. Finally, we quantize the latter theory by promoting the classical Poisson brackets to (anti-)commutators, construct the corresponding Hilbert space, and show that the resulting spectrum contains only bosonic soft excitations, with no additional fermionic soft modes.</description>

      <title>Geometric Solution of the Loop Equation and Quark Confinement in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13688v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exact analytic confining area law for pure $\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ Yang--Mills theory, satisfying the hierarchy of multiloop equations for arbitrary regular loops and any number of colors $N_c$. The solution is constructed using a quaternionic Hodge-dual minimal surface in a 16-dimensional auxiliary space. Unlike random surfaces, this construction defines an effectively topological string theory where the bulk dynamics reduces to the area of a conformal map of the 2D disk, with all nontrivial dynamics encoded in the boundary loop.
  The Wilson loop factorizes into a confining dressing factor and a perturbative term: $W[C] = W_{\text{pert}}[C]\, e^{-\kappa S[C]}$. We show that the geometric factor $e^{-\kappa S[C]}$ is an exact multiplicative zero mode of the loop-space diffusion operator and of the full MM multiloop hierarchy for any finite $N_c$, extending the planar area law to the physical case $N_c=3$. The functional $S[C]$ obeys the inequality $S[C] \ge \sqrt{2}\,A[C]$ (where $A[C]$ is the Euclidean minimal area), providing a sufficient condition for confinement.
  The area law is given explicitly by the spectral formula $S[C] = 2\sqrt{2}\,(\lambda_3 + \lambda_4)$, using the two largest eigenvalues of the Douglas--Gram matrix. We demonstrate that this functional is an exact additive zero mode of the loop diffusion operator, protected algebraically by the Bianchi identity, and globally defined for regular loops $C \in H^{1/2}(\mathbb{S}^1,\mathbb{R}^4)$. Matching this factor with the gluon condensate via the OPE determines the physical string tension $\kappa \sim \Lambda_{\text{QCD}}^2$. This framework yields a first-principles derivation of confinement in QCD and new tools for the high-lying meson spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quantum aspects of the conformal gravity in four dimensions, specifically addressing a known discrepancy in beta functions between general quadratic curvature theories and conformal gravity, which corresponds to two scalar degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that this mismatch is resolved by carefully introducing gauge-fixing and ghost terms via the BRST symmetry, which effectively adds the two scalar modes. Drawing lessons from two-dimensional quantum gravity and Liouville theory, we proceed to integrate the four-dimensional trace anomaly to derive a consistent Liouville action, which is given by a free-field action for the conformal mode with a consistent conformal anomaly. Finally we give the condition that the BRST transformation is anomaly free.</description>

      <title>Fibre Inflation Meets Quintessence: Implications of Perturbative Stabilisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we have discovered a new avenue of fibre inflation in perturbative large volume scenario (pLVS) due to the redefinition of the base modulus. pLVS offers a novel regime where large volume of the internal space is guaranteed without the need of non-perturbative effects. In this setup, we study the possibility where a base redefinition allows to assess different versions of fibre inflation whose spectral index aligns with Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data and produces tensor-to-scalar ratio in the range $0.008\lesssim r\lesssim 0.01$ in different setups we have considered. The leading order flat direction - which in our case is the fibre modulus - is lifted with the combinations of string loop corrections, leading order $\alpha^{\prime 3}$$R^4$-correction, higher derivative $F^{4}$ corrections as well as our new ingredient redefinition of the modulus. Since recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) results appear to favour a dynamical explanation for late-time acceleration over a simple cosmological constant, exploring quintessence offers a more suitable approach. In this lore, we also examine the quintessence sector to complete our model and account for both early- and late-time cosmic acceleration. In this framework, the poly-instanton correction generates a potential along the axionic directions, and we find that the resulting quintessence behaviour and the subsequent cosmological predictions about dark matter closely resemble the predictions of the original fibre inflation scenario studied earlier.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric $\mathbb{WCP}^n$, AdS near horizons and orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct and study the supersymmetry properties of the weighted projective spaces $\mathbb{WCP}^2$ and $\mathbb{WCP}^3$. These are topologically $\mathbb{CP}^n$ with $n+1$ orbifold singularities and as such are higher dimensional analogues of the ``spindle'' or $\mathbb{WCP}^1$. We use these to construct interesting supersymmetric orbifolds of canonical near horizon geometries of relevance to the AdS/CFT correspondence. Interestingly, for certain tunings of their integer weights, and unlike the spindle, round $\mathbb{WCP}^{2}$ and $\mathbb{WCP}^{3}$ are compatible with supersymmetry beyond the realm of gauged supergravity. This allows one to construct interesting supersymmetric solutions in type II supergravity such as AdS$_5\times\mathbb{WCP}^{2}\times\text{S}^1$ and AdS$_4\times \mathbb{WCP}^3$ via duality. We also leverage our results to construct a supersymmetric AdS$_3$ solution containing a topological $\mathbb{T}^{(1,1)}$ space with 4 orbifold singularities.</description>

      <title>Generalisations of the Russo-Townsend formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a generalisation of the recent construction by Russo and Townsend, we propose a new approach to generate $\mathsf{U}(1)$ duality-invariant models for nonlinear electrodynamics. It is based on the use of two building blocks: (i) a fixed (but otherwise arbitrary) model for self-dual nonlinear electrodynamics with Lagrangian $L(F_{\mu\nu};g)$ depending on a duality-invariant parameter $g$; and (ii) an arbitrary potential $W(\psi)$, with $\psi$ an auxiliary scalar field. It turns out that the model $\mathfrak{L}(F_{\mu\nu};\psi) = L(F_{\mu\nu};\psi) + W(\psi)$ leads to a self-dual theory for nonlinear electrodynamics upon elimination of $\psi$. As an illustration, we work out an example in which the seed Lagrangian $L(F_{\mu\nu};g)$ corresponds to the Born-Infeld model and a particular potential $W(\psi)$ is chosen such that integrating $\psi$ out gives the ModMaxBorn theory. We also briefly discuss supersymmetric generalisations of the proposed formulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method for relating the transition rate of an accelerated Unruh-deWitt detector to the rate of the same detector when stationary in Minkowski space. Furthermore, we show that when using the detector as a model for decay, its transition rate can be related directly to the decay rate obtained from QFT. Combined this provides a straightforward method for calculating the decay rate of accelerated particles to first order in the coupling constants.</description>

      <title>Bumblebee gravity: spherically-symmetric solutions away from the potential minimum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10998v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study a vector model of spontaneous spacetime-symmetry breaking coupled to gravity: the bumblebee model. The primary focus is on static spherically symmetric solutions. Complementing previous work on black hole solutions, we study the effects on the solutions when the vector field does not lie at the minimum of its potential. We first investigate the flat spacetime limit, which can be viewed as a modified electrostatic model with a nonlinear interaction term. We study the stability of classical solutions generally and in the spherically-symmetric case. We also find that certain potentials, based on hypergeometric functions, yield a Hamiltonian bounded from below for the case of fixed spatial vector magnitude. With gravity, we solve for the spherically-symmetric metric and vector field, for a variety of choices of the potential energy functions, including ones beyond the quadratic potential like the hypergeometric potentials. Special case exact solutions are obtained showing Schwarszchild-Anti de Sitter and Reissner-Nordstrom spacetimes. We employ horizon and asymptotic analytical expansions along with numerical solutions to explore the general case with the vector field away from the potential minimum. We discover interesting features of these solutions including naked singularities, repulsive gravity, and rapidly varying gravitational field near the source. Finally, we discuss observational constraints on these spacetimes using the resulting orbital behavior.</description>

      <title>Quantum Galilei group as quantum reference frame transformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum groups have been widely explored as a tool to encode possible nontrivial generalisations of reference frame transformations, relevant in quantum gravity. In quantum information, it was found that the reference frames can be associated to quantum particles, leading to quantum reference frames transformations. The connection between these two frameworks is still unexplored, but if clarified it will lead to a more profound understanding of symmetries in quantum mechanics and quantum gravity. Here, we establish a correspondence between quantum reference frame transformations and transformations generated by a quantum deformation of the Galilei group with commutative time, taken at first order in the quantum deformation parameter. This is found once the quantum group noncommutative transformation parameters are represented on the phase space of a quantum particle, and upon setting the quantum deformation parameter to be proportional to the inverse of the mass of the particle serving as the quantum reference frame. These results allow us to show that quantum reference frame transformations are physically relevant when the state of the quantum reference frame is in a quantum superposition of semiclassical states. We conjecture that the all-order quantum Galilei group describes quantum reference frame transformations between more general quantum states of the quantum reference frame.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum corrections to a recently obtained perturbative form of Starobinsky model to extract information about the initial conditions of the universe leading to cosmological inflation. Integrating out graviton modes, we find higher-derivative instabilities that are shown to decay into scalarons, causing an effective kinetic-domination stage which is shown to lead naturally to inflation without the need for fine-tuning of initial inflaton amplitude. We find a perturbative upper bound on scalaron magnitude that matches Planck constraints on inflaton energy density near the pivot scale. This modified history also affects observables and resolves other anomalies such as the low-$\ell$ power deficit in the TT spectrum as well as the disfavorment of Starobinsky model based on updated predictions of scalar spectral index accounting for data from Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT).</description>

      <title>Nonconserved critical dynamics of the two-dimensional Ising model as a surface kinetic roughening process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have revisited the non-conserved (or model A) critical dynamics of the two-dimensional Ising model through numerical simulations of its lattice and continuum formulations --Glauber dynamics and the timedependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equation, respectively--, to analyze them with current tools from surface kinetic roughening. Our study examines two critical quenches, one from an ordered and a different one from a disordered initial state, for both of which we assess the dynamic scaling ansatz, the critical exponent values, and the fluctuation field statistics that occur. Notably, the dynamic scaling ansatz followed by the system strongly depends on the initial condition: a critical quench from the ordered phase follows Family-Vicsek (FV) scaling, while a critical quench from the disordered phase shows an initial overgrowth regime with intrinsic anomalous roughening, followed by relaxation to equilibrium. This behavior is explained in terms of the dynamical instability of the stochastic Ginzburg-Landau equation at the critical temperature, whereby the linearly unstable term is eventually stabilized by nonlinear interactions. For both quenches we have determined the occurrence of probability distribution functions for the field fluctuations, which are time-independent along the non-equilibrium dynamics when suitably normalized by the time-dependent fluctuation amplitude. Additionally, we have developed a related interface model for a field which scales as the space integral of the TDGL field (integral GL model). Numerical simulations of this model reveal either FV or faceted anomalous roughening, depending on the critical quenched performed, as well as an emergent symmetry in the fluctuation statistics for a critical quench from the ordered phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a pedagogical review of projective representations of finite groups and their physical applications in quantum many-body systems. Some of our physical results are new. We begin with a self-contained introduction to projective representations, highlighting the role of group cohomology, representation theory, and classification of irreducible projective representations. We then focus on a special subset of cohomology classes, known as the Bogomolov multiplier, which consists of cocycles that are symmetric on commuting pairs but remain nontrivial in group cohomology. Such cocycles have important physical implications: they characterize (1+1)D SPT phases that cannot be detected by string order parameters and give rise, upon gauging, to distinct gapped phases with completely broken non-invertible $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry. We construct explicit lattice models for these phases and demonstrate how they are distinguished by the fusion rules of local order parameters. We show that a pair of completely broken $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ SSB phases host nontrivial interface modes at their domain walls. As an example, we construct a lattice model where the ground state degeneracy on a ring increases from 32 without interfaces to 56 with interfaces.</description>

      <title>Axionlike particle-assisted supercooling chiral phase transition in QCD: Identifying Coleman-Weinberg type-chiral phase transition in QCD-like scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18016v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new scenario to realize the Coleman-Weinberg (CW) type chiral phase transition in the QCD thermal history. This scenario predicts a heavy axionlike particle (ALP) with mass $\sim$ 5 MeV, consistently with the current experimental and cosmological bounds. The chiral phase transition is evaluated by monitoring ordinary QCD setup in a view of a two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model including a simplified meson fluctuation contribution. The present work thus can open a new window to search for the ALP associated with the QCD phase transition epoch of the thermal history. The new QCD cosmological scenario potentially predicts rich epochs around the QCD scale: a mini-inflation; a nonperturbative preheating and/or reheating, which can provide characteristic gravitational wave and primordial black hole productions. This proposal is based on a generic classification of the order of the chiral phase transition at the level of the mean field approximation in view of the scale violation classes: the soft-scale breaking term and the CW-type scale anomaly term, in or off the medium with or without chemical potentials. On this theoretical ground, we also revisit existing scenarios which undergo the supercooling chiral phase transition, such as nearly scale-invariant QCD and QCD with a large baryon chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions of Electromagnetically Charged Black Holes in Lovelock Gravity with Nonconstant Curvature Horizons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the most general class of charged black hole solutions in third-order Lovelock gravity within even-dimensional spacetimes in the presence of an electromagnetic field. These solutions feature nonconstant-curvature horizons that affect geometry when n&gt;=8. The near-origin behavior of the metric reveals a timelike singularity for electrically charged cases, in contrast to the spacelike singularity found in the uncharged case. We investigate thermodynamic stability in both the grand canonical and canonical ensembles. In the grand canonical ensemble, stability is determined by the positivity of both the Hessian determinant and the temperature. In the canonical ensemble, the sign of the heat capacity governs stability. We identify both first- and second-order phase transitions, including a van der Waals-like behavior characterized by instability at intermediate black hole sizes. Our results reveal a rich phase structure influenced by Lovelock corrections and electromagnetic fields, and demonstrate how conserved charges affect black hole evaporation and stabilization.</description>

      <title>Callan-Symanzik-like equation in information theory</title>

Abstract: Within the "complexity=anything" proposal of holography, the complexity growth rate (CGR) can exhibit jumps, interpreted as phase transitions. We demonstrate that the location and amplitude of these jumps are governed by the dynamics of bulk fields, which, via the fluid-gravity correspondence, map to the boundary energy-momentum tensor. The behavior of the CGR near these critical points exhibits scaling and universality. We show that the CGR satisfies a Callan-Symanzik-like equation near the transitions. We suggest that this enables enhanced computational efficiency by tuning the energy scale.</description>

      <title>Transport Model Investigation of NCQ Scaling and the Hadronic-Partonic Transition in Au+Au Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the elliptic flow ($v_2$) in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}} = 3.0$ and 4.5 GeV using both hadronic and partonic transport models, including JAM, SMASH, AMPT-Hadronic Cascade, and AMPT-String Melting. At 3.0 GeV, the JAM model reproduces the number-of-constituent-quark (NCQ) scaling violation observed by STAR, as well as the particle ordering ($K^0_S &gt; p &gt; \pi^+$). Model calculations of the centrality dependence indicate that the scaling violation mainly originates from hadronic interactions rather than spectator effects, while the rapidity dependence further constrains the mechanism of the scaling breaking and the underlying longitudinal dynamics. At 4.5 GeV, partonic interactions in the AMPT-String Melting mode significantly enhance NCQ scaling, and turning off final-state hadronic rescattering further clarifies the scaling pattern, highlighting the increasing role of partonic degrees of freedom. The energy dependence of the $p_T$-integrated $v_2$ is also examined within these models.</description>

      <title>Heavy Field Effects on Inflationary Models in Light of ACT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), when combined with Planck and DESI datasets, indicate a scalar spectral index $n_s$ larger than that reported in the Planck 2018 baseline, thereby challenging conventional Starobinsky-type ($\alpha$-attractor) inflationary scenarios at the $2\sigma$ level. In addition, the positive running of the spectral index $\alpha_s$ implied by the data provides strong constraints on these models. In this paper, we explore the possibility that the presence of an additional heavy field during inflation, with a mass of order the Hubble scale and a sizable mixing coupling to the inflaton, can reconcile such inflationary models with the ACT results by increasing both $n_s$ and $\alpha_s$, particularly in the strong-mixing regime. Furthermore, we extend this framework to traditional inflation models such as chaotic inflation and natural inflation, which have already been excluded by Planck alone, and show that they can be revived in certain regions of parameter space. Inflationary observables, including the spectral index $n_s$, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and the running $\alpha_s$, are computed within the single-field EFT approach, which is applicable even in the presence of a heavy field with large mixing. We also discuss the non-Gaussianity signatures arising from the heavy field, noting that parts of the parameter space are already excluded or can be tested in future observations. Finally, we present concrete model realizations that allow for such a large mixing.</description>

      <title>From Quantum Tsallis Entropy to Strange Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework connecting quantum Tsallis statistics to electronic transport in strongly interacting systems. Starting from R\'enyi and Tsallis entropies, we construct a quantum Tsallis distribution that reduces to the conventional Fermi--Dirac distribution when $q=1$. For $q$ slightly deviating from unity, the correction term in the occupation function can be mapped to a $q$-deformed Schwarzian action, corresponding to soft reparametrization modes. Coupling these soft modes to electrons via the Fermi Golden Rule yields a modified scattering rate, which reproduces conventional Fermi-liquid behavior at low temperatures and linear-in-temperature resistivity at high temperatures. Using the memory matrix formalism, we analyze magnetotransport, finding a linear-in-field magnetoresistance and a Hall angle consistent with Anderson's two-lifetime scenario. At sufficiently low temperatures, both magnetoresistance and Hall response smoothly recover Fermi-liquid quadratic behaviors. This approach provides a controlled interpolation between Fermi-liquid and non-Fermi-liquid regimes, quantitatively linking $q$-deformation, soft-mode dynamics, and experimentally measurable transport coefficients in strange metals.</description>

      <title>Krylov Polynomials and Quantum Query Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the minimal query complexity for preparing $f(H)\ket{\psi_0}$ is exactly the optimal polynomial approximation degree of $f$ in $L^2(\mu)$, where $\mu$ is the spectral measure of $(H,\ket{\psi_0})$. This state-aware perspective refines the worst-case bounds, unifies Krylov/Favard approximation with quantum queries, and explains how state-dependent spectral structure can yield substantial savings over uniform designs.</description>

      <title>Graviton propagator in de Sitter space in a simple one-parameter gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the graviton propagator in de Sitter space in a one-parameter family of noncovariant gauges. This family generalizes the simple gauge in which most graviton loop computations in de Sitter space have been performed. The resulting propagator has a relatively simple form and will facilitate checks of the gauge dependence of one-loop computations and proposed observables.</description>

      <title>Matrix approximations of operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The approximate representation of operators by finite matrices is analysed in terms of accuracy and convergence. The identity operator, for example, can be reconstructed using a basis of harmonic oscillator states leading to a narrow peak approximation of the $\delta$ function, but this peak may be perturbed by small, residual, oscillations. The peak does not shrink nor grows quickly, and the oscillations only diminish slowly as the size of the matrix increases. For the kinetic energy operator, a triple peak (one positive, two negative) representation of $-\delta''$ is obtained, but that is affected also by residual oscillations. Again, convergence is slow as the matrix dimension increases. We find compact formulas to explain such oscillations. Similar observations are found for representations of local interactions, while separable potentials are better represented. As a comparison, in the context of a toy model, the effects of choosing an alternative single particle basis are studied. A formal approach for the approximation of operators is considered for comparison. We conclude with a word of caution for (finite) matrix approximations of operators.</description>
