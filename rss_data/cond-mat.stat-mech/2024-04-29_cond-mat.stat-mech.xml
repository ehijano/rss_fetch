      <title>Thermodynamic &amp; algorithmic efficiency in heterogeneous networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Why complex structures emerge in a real world environment is a fascinating question which has not found any fully satisfactory answer at the point of today. At the border between statistical physics, machine learning and network theory, we provide some computational empirical evidence indicating that the emergence of complex structures in a real world environment is the macroscopic thermodynamic result of the optimal trade-off between the ability to encode information about the environment in the very features of the network and the ability to transmit information across it. While the former is quantified by the von Neumann network entropy and the latter by the Helmholtz free energy, the two are gathered into a single quantity tantamount to the thermodynamic efficiency. We take as a case study an algorithm originally proposed for creating and searching trees of patterns under the assumption that, akin to living system, the algorithm seeks the best internal representation of the outer world, namely a real world dataset of patterns. Remarkably, optimal thermodynamic efficiency overlaps with the optimal algorithmic efficiency, defined in terms of accuracy and computational cost, whether the former is measured at the resolution scale in where the network transits from exhibiting a specific heat with a single peak to a scale-invariant region. Moreover the critical hypothesis is investigated and empirical evidence suggests that the system benefits from the critical-state when it confronts with higher-complexity environments, while it does not when the environment is simpler.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolicity of the ballistic-conductive model of heat conduction: the reverse side of the coin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heat equation, based on Fourier's law, is commonly used for description of heat conduction. However, Fourier's law is valid under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium, which is violated in very small dimensions and short timescales, and at low temperatures. In the paper R. Kovacs and P. Van, Generalized heat conduction in heat pulse experiments, Int. J. Heat Mass Transf., 83:613-620, 2015, a ballistic-conductive (BC) model of heat conduction was developed. In this paper, we study the behavior of solutions to an initial value problem (IVP) in 1D in the framework of the linearized ballistic-conductive (BC) model. As a result of the study, an unphysical effect has been found when part of the initial thermal energy does not spread anywhere.</description>

      <title>Power-Efficiency Constraint for Biological rotary Motor Driven by Chemical Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological motors, as counterpart of heat engines, are driven by a chemical gradient to output mechanical work and play critical roles in biological functions, such as the ATP synthesis. Its thermodynamic efficiency, along with power, are two vital criteria for evaluating the performance of these motors. In this letter, we investigate a model of a microscopic chemical engine and assess the constraint relation between power and efficiency for the cycle with finite operation time. Our model demonstrates a general constraint relation between power and efficiency, and predicts that the efficiency at maximum power in the large friction regime is half of the maximum quasi-static efficiency, i.e., 1/2. These findings shall provide new direction to optimize the operation of microscopic biological motors.</description>

      <title>Casimir force within Ising chain with competing interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive exact results for the critical Casimir force (CCF) within the one-dimensional Ising model with periodic boundary conditions (PBC's) and long-range equivalent-neighbor ferromagnetic interactions of strength $J_{l}/N&gt;0$ superimposed on the nearest-neighbor interactions of strength $J_{s}$ which could be either ferromagnetic ($J_{s}&gt;0$) or antiferromagnetic ($J_{s}&lt;0$). In the infinite system limit the model, also known as the Nagle-Kardar model, exhibits in the plane $(K_s=\beta J_s,K_l=\beta J_l)$ a critical line $2 K_l=\exp{\left(-2 K_s\right)}, K_s&gt;-\ln3/4$, which ends at a tricritical point $(K_l=-\sqrt{3}/2, K_s=-\ln3/4)$. The critical Casimir amplitudes are: $\Delta_{\rm Cas}^{\rm (cr)}=1/4$ at the critical line, and $\Delta_{\rm Cas}^{\rm (tr)}=1/3$ at the tricritical point. Quite unexpectedly, with the imposed PBC's the CCF exhibits very unusual behavior as a function of temperature and magnetic field. It is repulsive near the critical line and tricritical point, decaying rapidly with separation from those two singular regimes fast away from them and becoming attractive, displaying in which the maximum amplitude of the attraction exceeds the maximum amplitude of repulsion. This represents a violation of the widely-accepted "boundary condition rule", which holds that the CCF is attractive for equivalent BC's and repulsive for conflicting BC's independently of the actual bulk universality class of the phase transition under investigation.</description>

      <title>Deep generative modelling of canonical ensemble with differentiable thermal properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a variational modelling method with differentiable temperature for canonical ensembles. Using a deep generative model, the free energy is estimated and minimized simultaneously in a continuous temperature range. At optimal, this generative model is a Boltzmann distribution with temperature dependence. The training process requires no dataset, and works with arbitrary explicit density generative models. We applied our method to study the phase transitions (PT) in the Ising and XY models, and showed that the direct-sampling simulation of our model is as accurate as the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation, but more efficient. Moreover, our method can give thermodynamic quantities as differentiable functions of temperature akin to an analytical solution. The free energy aligns closely with the exact one to the second-order derivative, so this inclusion of temperature dependence enables the otherwise biased variational model to capture the subtle thermal effects at the PTs. These findings shed light on the direct simulation of physical systems using deep generative models</description>

      <title>Semi-infinite simple exclusion process: from current fluctuations to target survival</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetric simple exclusion process (SEP), where diffusive particles cannot overtake each other, is a paradigmatic model of transport in the single-file geometry. In this model, the study of currents has attracted a lot of attention, but so far most results are restricted to two geometries: (i) a finite system between two reservoirs, which does not conserve the number of particles but reaches a nonequilibrium steady state, and (ii) an infinite system which conserves the number of particles but never reaches a steady state. Here, we determine the full cumulant generating function of the integrated current in the important intermediate situation of a semi-infinite system connected to a reservoir, which does not conserve the number of particles and never reaches a steady state. This result is obtained thanks to the determination of the full spatial structure of the correlations which remarkably obey the very same closed equation recently obtained in the infinite geometry. Besides their intrinsic interest, these results allow us to solve two open problems: the survival probability of a fixed target in the SEP, and the statistics of the number of particles injected by a localized source.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation of a bilayer composed by surfactants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the properties of lipid bilayer fluctuations using molecular dynamics. We modeled the surfactant as a diatomic molecule, constructed a bilayer in the solvent, and observed the Fourier spectrum of its fluctuations. The results showed that $q^4$ behavior was dominant at the high temperature, whereas a crossover from $q^4$ to $q^2$ was observed at the low temperature. This behavior is complementary to the results for monolayer membranes, where $q^2$ behavior was dominant when the interfacial tension was high, whereas a crossover from $q^2$ to $q^4$ was observed when the interfacial tension was lowered~[S. Kikuchi and H. Watanabe, J. Chem. Phys., $\bm{158}$ 12 (2023)]. These results suggest that the restoring force is dominated by elasticity at high temperatures and by interfacial tension at low temperatures. We also observed radial distribution functions to investigate the structure of surfactants in lipid bilayers. The structure of the surfactant depends on temperature in the direction horizontal to the interface, while it does not depend on temperature in the direction perpendicular to the interface. This result suggests that lipid bilayers increase fluctuations while maintaining the membrane structure in high temperature.</description>

      <title>Self-Propelled Collective Motion with Multiplicative Scalar Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of order from initial disordered movement in self-propelled collective motion is an instance of nonequilibrium phase transition, which is known to be first order in the thermodynamic limit. Here, we introduce a multiplicative scalar noise model of collective motion as a modification of the original Vicsek model, which more closely mimics the particles' behavior. We allow for more individual movement in sparsely populated neighborhoods, the mechanism of which is not incorporated in the original Vicsek model. This is especially important in the low velocity and density regime where the probability of a clear neighborhood is relatively high. The modification, thus, removes the shortcoming of the Vicsek model in predicting continuous phase transition in this regime. The onset of collective motion in the proposed model is numerically studied in detail, indicating a first order phase transition in both high and low velocity/density regimes for systems with comparatively smaller size which is computationally desirable.</description>

      <title>Numerical Accuracy of the Derivative-Expansion-Based Functional Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the precision of the numerical implementation of the functional renormalization group based on extracting the eigenvalues from the linearized RG transformation. For this purpose, we implement the LPA and $O(\partial^2)$ orders of the derivative expansion for the three-dimensional $O(N)$ models with $N~\in~\{1,2,3\}$. We identify several categories of numerical error and devise simple tests to track their magnitude as functions of numerical parameters. Our numerical schemes converge properly and are characterized by errors of several orders of magnitude smaller than the error bars of the derivative expansion for these models. We highlight situations in which our methods cease to converge, most often due to rounding errors. In particular, we observe an impaired convergence of the discretization scheme when the $\tilde \rho$ grid is cut off at the value $\tilde \rho_{\text{Max}}$ smaller than $3.5$ times the local potential minimum. The program performing the numerical calculations for this study is shared as an open-source library accessible for review and reuse.</description>

      <title>Three-state Opinion Dynamics for Financial Markets on Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the effects of complex networks on the collective behavior of a three-state opinion formation model in economic systems. Our model considers two distinct types of investors in financial markets: noise traders and fundamentalists. Financial states evolve via probabilistic dynamics that include economic strategies with local and global influences. The local majoritarian opinion drives noise traders' market behavior, while the market index influences the financial decisions of fundamentalist agents. We introduce a level of market anxiety $q$ present in the decision-making process that influences financial action. In our investigation, nodes of a complex network represent market agents, whereas the links represent their financial interactions. We investigate the stochastic dynamics of the model on three distinct network topologies, including scale-free networks, small-world networks and Erd{\"o}s-R\'enyi random graphs. Our model mirrors various traits observed in real-world financial return series, such as heavy-tailed return distributions, volatility clustering, and short-term memory correlation of returns. The histograms of returns are fitted by coupled Gaussian distributions, quantitatively revealing transitions from a leptokurtic to a mesokurtic regime under specific economic heterogeneity. We show that the market dynamics depend mainly on the average agent connectivity, anxiety level, and market composition rather than on specific features of network topology.</description>

      <title>Avalanche Dynamics and the Effect of Straining in Dislocation Systems with Quenched Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The plastic deformation of crystalline and other heterogeneous materials often manifests in stochastic intermittent events indicating the criticality of plastic behavior. Previous studies demonstrated that the presence of short-ranged quenched disorder modifies this behavior disrupting long-range static and dynamic correlations consequently localizing dislocation avalanches. However, these observations were mostly confined to relaxed materials devoid of deformation history. In this work our focus is on how straining affects static and dynamic correlations, avalanche dynamics and local yield stresses. We demonstrate that the interplay between severe straining and confining quenched disorder induces critical behavior characterized by dislocation avalanches distinct from those at lower stresses. Namely, near the flow stress many avalanches, even if triggered locally, evolve into events affecting a larger region by exciting small clusters of dislocations all around the sample. This type of avalanches differ from the ones at low strains where plastic events typically consist of one compact cluster of dislocations which is either local or it is already quite extended at the onset of the avalanche. Furthermore, we examine the impact of avalanches on local yield stresses. It is shown in detail in this work that while some statistical features of the local yield thresholds are robust to straining, others are significantly affected by the deformation history.</description>

      <title>Patterns of active dipolar particles in external magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active particles with a (magnetic) dipole moment are of interest for steering self-propelled motion, but also result in novel collective effects due to their dipole-dipole interaction. Here systems of active dipolar particles are studied with Brownian dynamics simulations to systematically characterize the different patterns they form, specifically in the presence of an external (magnetic) field. The combination of three types of order - clustering, orientational alignment and chain formation - is used to classify the patterns observed in these systems. In the presence of an external field, oriented chains and bands are found to be dominant. These structures show some similarities with columnar cluster seen in (passive) ferrofluids and display columnar spacing and number of lanes per cluster that both decrease with increasing field strength.</description>

      <title>A quantum annealing approach to minimum distance problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) is at the heart of fault-tolerant quantum computing. As the size of quantum platforms is expected to grow, one of the open questions is to design new optimal codes of ever-increasing size. A related challenge is to ``certify'' the quality of a given code by evaluating its minimum distance, a quantity characterizing code's capacity to preserve quantum information. This problem is known to be NP-hard. Here we propose to harness the power of contemporary quantum platforms to address this question, and in this way help design quantum platforms of the future. Namely, we introduce an approach to compute the minimum distance of quantum stabilizer codes by reformulating the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem and leveraging established QUBO algorithms and heuristics as well as quantum annealing (QA) to address the latter. The reformulation as a QUBO introduces only a logarithmic multiplicative overhead in the required number of variables. We demonstrate practical viability of our method by comparing the performance of purely classical algorithms with the D-Wave Advantage 4.1 quantum annealer as well as hybrid quantum-classical algorithm Qbsolv. We found that the hybrid approach demonstrates competitive performance, on par with the best available classical algorithms to solve QUBO. In a practical sense, the QUBO-based approach is currently lagging behind the best deterministic minimal distance algorithms, however this advantage may disappear as the size of the platforms grows.</description>

      <title>Suppressed self-diffusion of nanoscale constituents of a complex liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to understand and ultimately control the transformations and properties of various nanoscale systems, from proteins to synthetic nanomaterial assemblies, hinges on the ability to directly elucidate their dynamics on their characteristic length and time scales. Here, we use MHz X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) to directly elucidate the characteristic microsecond-dynamics of density fluctuations of semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs), not only in a colloidal dispersion but also in a liquid phase consisting of densely packed, yet mobile, NCs with no long-range order. By carefully disentangling X-ray induced effects, we find the wavevector-dependent fluctuation rates in the liquid phase are suppressed relative to those in the colloidal phase and to those in experiments and hydrodynamic theories of densely packed repulsive particles. We show that the suppressed rates are due to a substantial decrease in the self-diffusion of NCs in the liquid phase, which we attribute to explicit attractive interactions. Via comparison with simulations, we find that the extracted strength of the attractions explains the stability of the liquid phase, in contrast to the gelation observed via XPCS in many other charged colloidal systems. This work opens the door to elucidating fast, condensed phase dynamics in a variety of complex fluids and other nanoscale soft matter systems, such as densely packed proteins and non-equilibrium self-assembly processes.</description>

      <title>Topological Origin of Floquet Thermalization in Periodically Driven Many-body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floquet engineering is a powerful manipulation method in modern quantum technology. However, unwanted heating is the main challenge of Floquet engineering, therefore the Floquet thermalization has attracting considerable attentions recently. In this work, we investigate thermalization of periodically driven many-body systems through the lens of Krylov complexity, and find a topological origin of different thermalization behaviors. We demonstrate that If the topology of the Krylov chain is nontrivial, a periodically driven system will reach a state with finite temperature. When the Krylov chain is topologically trivial, the system will be heated to infinite temperature. We further show that the prethermalization can be understood as the tunnelling process of a quasi-edge mode through the local gap on Krylov chain. This picture provides a systematically method to obtain the effective prethermal Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Experimental and Theoretical Bulk Phase Diagram and Interfacial Tension of Ouzo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ouzo is a well-known drink in Mediterranean countries, with ingredients water, alcohol and trans-anethole oil. The oil is insoluble in water, but completely soluble in alcohol, so when water is added to the spirit, the available alcohol is depleted and the mixture exhibits spontaneous emulsification. This process is commonly known as the louche or Ouzo effect. Although the phase boundaries of this archetypal ternary mixture are well known, the properties of coexisting phases have not previously been studied. Here, we present a detailed experimental investigation into the phase behaviour, including tie-lines connecting coexisting phases, determination of the critical point (also called the plait point in ternary systems) and measurements of the surface tension and density for varying alcohol concentrations. Additionally, we present a theory for the thermodynamics and phase diagram of the system. With suitable selection of the interaction parameters, the theory captures nearly all features of the experimental work. This simple model can be used to determine both bulk and non-uniform (e.g. interfacial) properties, paving the way for a wide range of future applications of the model to ternary mixtures in general. We show how our accurate equilibrium phase diagram can be used to provide improved understanding of non-equilibrium phenomena.</description>

      <title>Pre-relaxation in quantum, classical, and quantum-classical two-impurity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically study the relaxation dynamics of impurity-host systems, focusing on the presence of long-lived metastable states in the non-equilibrium dynamics after an initial excitation of the impurities. In generic systems, an excited impurity coupled to a large bath at zero temperature is expected to relax and approach its ground state over time. However, certain exceptional cases exhibit metastability, where the system remains in an excited state on timescales largely exceeding the typical relaxation time. We study this phenomenon for three prototypical impurity models: a tight-binding quantum model of independent spinless fermions on a lattice with two stub impurities, a classical-spin Heisenberg model with two weakly coupled classical impurity spins, and a tight-binding quantum model of independent electrons with two classical impurity spins. Through numerical integration of the fundamental equations of motion, we find that all three models exhibit similar qualitative behavior: complete relaxation for nearest-neighbor impurities and incomplete or strongly delayed relaxation for next-nearest-neighbor impurities. The underlying mechanisms leading to this behavior differ between models and include impurity-induced bound states, emergent approximately conserved local observables, and exact cancellation of local and nonlocal dissipation effects.</description>

      <title>A statistical analysis of the first stages of freezing and melting of Lennard-Jones particles: Number and size distributions of transient nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The freezing/melting transition is at the heart of many natural and industrial processes. In the classical picture, the transition proceeds via the nucleation of the new phase, which has to overcome a barrier associated to the free energy cost of the growing nucleus. The total nucleation rate is also influenced by a kinetic factor which somehow depends on the number of attempts to create a nucleus, that translates into a significant density of proto-nuclei in the system. These transient tiny nuclei are not accessible to experiments, but they can be observed in molecular simulations, and their number and size distributions can be acquired and analysed. The number distributions are carefully characterized as a function of the system size, showing limited finite size effects. It is also shown that the proto-nuclei do exist even in the stable phase, in agreement with the fact that the volume contribution to their free energy is negligible in the first stages of nucleation. Moreover, the number and size distributions vary continuously between the stable and the metastable phases, in particular when crossing the coexistence temperature. The size distributions associated to \emph{any} nucleus and to the \emph{largest} one have also been calculated, and their relation recently established for bubbles in a liquid [J. Puibasset, J. Chem. Phys. 157, 191102 (2022)] has been shown to apply here. This is an important relation for free energy barrier calculations with biased molecular simulations.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional correlation propagation dynamics with a cluster discrete phase-space method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium dynamics of highly-controlled quantum systems is a challenging issue in statistical physics and quantum many-body physics, relevant to recent experimental developments of analog and digital quantum simulations. In this work, we develop a discrete phase-space approach for general SU($N$) spin systems that utilizes cluster mean field equations, which capture non-trivial quantum correlations inside each cluster, beyond the capability of the standard discrete truncated Wigner approximation for individual classical spins. Our formalism, based on a cluster phase-point operator, makes it possible to realize scalable numerical samplings of cluster phase-space variables, where the total number of noise variables for a direct product state is independent of the choice of the separation into finite regions of clusters. We numerically demonstrate that the cluster discrete truncated Wigner approximation (C-dTWA) method can reproduce key results in a recent experiment on the correlation propagation dynamics in a two dimensional Bose-Hubbard system. We also compare the results of C-dTWA for clusters of $2\times 2$ sites with those of a two-dimensional tensor network method and discuss that both approaches agree very well in a short time region, where the energy is well conserved in the tensor network simulations. Since we formulate the C-dTWA method in a general form, it can be potentially applied to various dynamical problems in isolated and open quantum systems even in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Non-stabilizerness versus entanglement in matrix product states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the relationship between entanglement and non-stabilizerness (also known as magic) in matrix product states (MPSs). We study the relation between magic and the bond dimension used to approximate the ground state of a many-body system in two different contexts: full state of magic and mutual magic (the non-stabilizer analogue of mutual information, thus free of boundary effects) of spin-1 anisotropic Heisenberg chains. Our results indicate that obtaining converged results for non-stabilizerness is typically considerably easier than entanglement. For full state magic at critical points and at sufficiently large volumes, we observe convergence with $1/\chi^2$, with $\chi$ being the MPS bond dimension. At small volumes, magic saturation is so quick that, within error bars, we cannot appreciate any finite-$\chi$ correction. Mutual magic also shows a fast convergence with bond dimension, whose specific functional form is however hindered by sampling errors. As a by-product of our study, we show how Pauli-Markov chains (originally formulated to evaluate magic) resets the state of the art in terms of computing mutual information for MPS. We illustrate this last fact by verifying the logarithmic increase of mutual information between connected partitions at critical points. By comparing mutual information and mutual magic, we observe that, for connected partitions, the latter is typically scaling much slower - if at all - with the partition size, while for disconnected partitions, both are constant in size.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Class Fluctuation Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.03612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Trajectory Class Fluctuation Theorem (TCFT) substantially strengthens the Second Law of Thermodynamics -- that, in point of fact, can be a rather weak bound on resource fluxes. Practically, it improves empirical estimates of free energies, a task known to be statistically challenging, and has diagnosed successful and failed information processing in experimentally-implemented Josephson-junction information engines. The development here justifies that empirical analysis, explicating its mathematical foundations.
  The TCFT reveals the thermodynamics induced by macroscopic system transformations for each measurable subset of system trajectories. In this, it directly combats the statistical challenge of extremely rare events that dominate thermodynamic calculations. And, it reveals new forms of free energy -- forms that can be solved for analytically and practically estimated. Conceptually, the TCFT unifies a host of previously-established fluctuation theorems, interpolating from Crooks' Detailed Fluctuation Theorem (single trajectories) to Jarzynski's Equality (trajectory ensembles).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05454v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the pattern formation in systems of active particles with chiral forces in the context of pedestrian dynamics. To describe the interparticle interactions, we use the standard social force model and supplement it with a new type of force that reflects chirality. We perform numerical simulations of two pedestrian flows moving in opposite directions along a corridor. We observe two dynamic phase transitions that occur for varying number densities of particles and strengths of the chirality force: one from disordered motion to multi-lane motion and another from multi-lane to two-lane motion. We develop a qualitative theory that describes the demarcation lines for these phase transitions in the phase diagram chirality-density. The results of our analysis agree fairly well with the simulation data. A comparison with previously reported experimental data has been provided. Our findings may find applications in urban and transportation-planning problems.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic crossovers in supercritical fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can liquid-like and gas-like states be distinguished beyond the critical point, where the liquid-gas phase transition no longer exists and conventionally only a single supercritical fluid phase is defined? Recent experiments and simulations report strong evidence of dynamical crossovers above the critical temperature and pressure. Despite using different criteria, many existing theoretical explanations consider a single crossover line separating liquid-like and gas-like states in the supercritical fluid phase. We argue that such a single-line scenario is inconsistent with the supercritical behavior of the Ising model, which has two crossover lines due to its symmetry, violating the universality principle of critical phenomena. To reconcile the inconsistency, we define two thermodynamic crossover lines in supercritical fluids as boundaries of liquid-like, indistinguishable, and gas-like states. Near the critical point, the two crossover lines follow critical scalings with exponents of the Ising universality class, supported by calculations of theoretical models and analyses of experimental data from the standard database. The upper line agrees with crossovers independently estimated from the inelastic X-ray scattering data of supercritical argon, and from the small-angle neutron scattering data of supercritical carbon dioxide. The lower line is verified by the equation of states for the compressibility factor. This work provides a fundamental framework for understanding supercritical physics in general phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Work statistics for Quantum Spin Chains: characterizing quantum phase transitions, benchmarking time evolution, and examining passivity of quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13366v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study three aspects of work statistics in the context of the fluctuation theorem for the quantum spin chains up to $1024$ sites by numerical methods based on matrix-product states (MPS). First, we use our numerical method to evaluate the moments/cumulants of work done by sudden quench process on the Ising or Haldane spin chains and study their behaviors across the quantum phase transitions. Our results show that, up to the fourth cumulant, the work statistics can indicate the quantum phase transition characterized by the local order parameters but barely for purely topological phase transitions. Second, we propose to use the fluctuation theorem, such as Jarzynski's equality, which relates the real-time correlator to the ratio of the thermal partition functions, as a benchmark indicator for the numerical real-time evolving methods. Third, we study the passivity of ground and thermal states of quantum spin chains under some cyclic impulse processes. We show that the passivity of thermal states and ground states under the hermitian actions are ensured by the second laws and variational principles, respectively, and also verify it by numerical calculations. Besides, we also consider the passivity of ground states under non-hermitian actions, for which the variational principle cannot be applied. Despite that, we find no violation of passivity from our numerical results for all the cases considered in the Ising and Haldane chains. {Overall, we demonstrate that the work statistics for the sudden quench and impulse processes can be evaluated precisely by the numerical MPS method to characterize quantum phase transitions and examine the passivity of quantum states. We also propose to exploit the universality of the fluctuation theorem to benchmark the numerical real-time evolutions in an algorithm and model independent way.</description>

      <title>Infinite temperature spin dc conductivity of the spin-1/2 XXZ chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the Bethe ansatz method and the TBA equations for the higher spin integrable XXZ chain, the regular zero frequency contribution to the spin current correlation (spin dc conductivity) is analyzed for the spin-1/2 XXZ chain with an anisotropy $0 \le \Delta &lt;1$. In the high temperature limit, we write down the dressed scattering kernels by one quasi-particle bare energies, which allows the exact evaluation of the infinite temperature spin dc conductivity $\mathcal{L}$. We find that $\mathcal{L}$ is discontinuous at all rational numbers of the anisotropy parameter $p_0=\pi/\cos^{-1}\Delta$ in the region $p_0 \ge 2$ with the gap increasing larger than the second power of growing magnetization on one quasi-particle. The isotropic $\Delta=1$ point is exceptional. Close to this point, $\mathcal{L}$ slowly increases in proportion to the first power of the magnetization. On the other hand $\mathcal{L}$ is proportional to the second power of the magnetization when $p_0$ approaches irrational numbers.</description>

      <title>Direction of spontaneous processes in non-equilibrium systems with movable/permeable internal walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The second law of equilibrium thermodynamics explains the direction of spontaneous processes in a system after removing internal constraints. When the system only exchanges energy with the environment as heat, the second law states that spontaneous processes at constant temperature satisfy: $\textrm{d} U - \delta Q \leq 0$. Here, $\textrm{d} U$ is the infinitesimal change of the internal energy, and $\delta Q$ is the infinitesimal heat exchanged in the process. We will consider three different systems in a heat flow: ideal gas, van der Waals gas, and a binary mixture of ideal gases. We will also study ideal gas and van der Waals gas in the heat flow and gravitational field. We will divide each system internally into two subsystems by a movable wall. We will show that the direction of the motion of the wall, after release, at constant boundary conditions is determined by the same inequality as in equilibrium thermodynamics. The only difference between equilibrium and non-equilibrium law is the dependence of the net heat change, $\delta Q$, on the state parameters of the system. We will also consider a wall thick and permeable to gas particles and derive Archimedes' principle in the heat flow. Finally, we will study the ideal gas's Couette flow, where the direction of the motion of the internal wall follows from the inequality $\textrm{d} E - \delta Q - \delta W_s \leq 0$, with $\textrm{d} E$ being the infinitesimal change of the total energy (internal and kinetic) and $\delta W_s$ the infinitesimal work exchanged with the environment due to shear force. Ultimately, we will synthesize all these cases in a framework of the second law of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous work [Phys. Rev. X 5, 021020 (2015)], it was shown that stealthy hyperuniform systems can be regarded as hard spheres in Fourier-space in the sense that the the structure factor is exactly zero in a spherical region around the origin in analogy with the pair-correlation function of real-space hard spheres. In this work, we exploit this correspondence to confirm that the densest Fourier-space hard-sphere system is that of a Bravais lattice. This is in contrast to real-space hard-spheres, whose densest configuration is conjectured to be disordered. We also extend the virial series previously suggested for disordered stealthy hyperuniform systems to higher dimensions in order to predict spatial decorrelation as function of dimension. This prediction is then borne out by numerical simulations of disordered stealthy hyperuniform ground states in dimensions $d=2$-$8$.</description>

      <title>The monopole-dimer model on Cartesian products of plane graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.11791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The monopole-dimer model is a signed variant of the monomer-dimer model which has determinantal structure. We extend the monopole-dimer model for planar graphs (Math. Phys. Anal. Geom., 2015) to Cartesian products thereof and show that the partition function of this model can be expressed as a determinant of a generalised signed adjacency matrix. We then show that the partition function is independent of the orientations of the planar graphs so long as the orientations are Pfaffian. When these planar graphs are bipartite, we show that the computation of the partition function becomes especially simple. We then give an explicit product formula for the partition function of three-dimensional grid graphs a la Kasteleyn and Temperley--Fischer, which turns out to be fourth power of a polynomial when all grid lengths are even. Finally, we generalise this product formula to $d$ dimensions, again obtaining an explicit product formula. We conclude with a discussion on asymptotic formulas for the free energy and monopole densities.</description>

Abstract: The importance of the quantum Fisher information metric is testified by the number of applications that this has in very different fields, ranging from hypothesis testing to metrology, passing through thermodynamics. Still, from the rich range of possible quantum Fisher information, only a handful are typically used and studied. This review aims at collecting a number of results scattered in the literature that can be useful to people who begin the study of Fisher information and to those who are already working on it to have a more organic understanding of the topic. Moreover, we complement the review with new results about the relation between Fisher information and physical evolutions. Extending the study done in [1], we prove that all the physically realisable dynamics can be defined solely in terms of their relation with respect to the Fisher information metric. Moreover, other properties as Markovianity, retrodiction or detailed balance can be expressed in the same formalism. These results show a fact that was partially overseen in the literature, namely the inherently dynamical nature of Fisher information.</description>

Abstract: Lagrangian turbulence lies at the core of numerous applied and fundamental problems related to the physics of dispersion and mixing in engineering, bio-fluids, atmosphere, oceans, and astrophysics. Despite exceptional theoretical, numerical, and experimental efforts conducted over the past thirty years, no existing models are capable of faithfully reproducing statistical and topological properties exhibited by particle trajectories in turbulence. We propose a machine learning approach, based on a state-of-the-art diffusion model, to generate single-particle trajectories in three-dimensional turbulence at high Reynolds numbers, thereby bypassing the need for direct numerical simulations or experiments to obtain reliable Lagrangian data. Our model demonstrates the ability to reproduce most statistical benchmarks across time scales, including the fat-tail distribution for velocity increments, the anomalous power law, and the increased intermittency around the dissipative scale. Slight deviations are observed below the dissipative scale, particularly in the acceleration and flatness statistics. Surprisingly, the model exhibits strong generalizability for extreme events, producing events of higher intensity and rarity that still match the realistic statistics. This paves the way for producing synthetic high-quality datasets for pre-training various downstream applications of Lagrangian turbulence.</description>

      <title>Tensor network decompositions for absolutely maximally entangled states</title>

Abstract: Absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states of $k$ qudits (also known as perfect tensors) are quantum states that have maximal entanglement for all possible bipartitions of the sites/parties. We consider the problem of whether such states can be decomposed into a tensor network with a small number of tensors, such that all physical and all auxiliary spaces have the same dimension $D$. We find that certain AME states with $k=6$ can be decomposed into a network with only three 4-leg tensors; we provide concrete solutions for local dimension $D=5$ and higher. Our result implies that certain AME states with six parties can be created with only three two-site unitaries from a product state of three Bell pairs, or equivalently, with six two-site unitaries acting on a product state on six qudits. We also consider the problem for $k=8$, where we find similar tensor network decompositions with six 4-leg tensors.</description>

      <title>Transition to anomalous dynamics in a simple random map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The famous Bernoulli shift (or dyadic transformation) is perhaps the simplest deterministic dynamical system exhibiting chaotic dynamics. It is a piecewise linear time-discrete map on the unit interval with a uniform slope larger than one, hence expanding, with a positive Lyapunov exponent and a uniform invariant density. If the slope is less than one the map becomes contracting, the Lyapunov exponent is negative, and the density trivially collapses onto a fixed point. Sampling from these two different types of maps at each time step by randomly selecting the expanding one with probability $p$, and the contracting one with probability $1-p$, gives a prototype of a random dynamical system. Here we calculate the invariant density of this simple random map, as well as its position autocorrelation function, analytically and numerically under variation of $p$. We find that the map exhibits a non-trivial transition from fully chaotic to completely regular dynamics by generating a long-time anomalous dynamics at a critical sampling probability $p_c$, defined by a zero Lyapunov exponent. This anomalous dynamics is characterised by an infinite invariant density, weak ergodicity breaking and power law correlation decay.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Enriched Criticality in a Coupled Spin-Ladder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04205v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional ladder of two coupled XXZ spin chains and identify several distinct gapless symmetry-enriched critical phases. These have the same unbroken symmetries and long-wavelength description, but cannot be connected without encountering either a phase transition or other intermediate phases. Using bosonizaion, we analyze the nature of their distinction by determining how microscopic symmetries are manifested in the long-wavelength fields, the behavior of charged local and nonlocal operators, and identify the universality class of all direct continuous phase transitions between them. One of these phases is a gapless topological phase with protected edge modes. We characterize its precise nature and place it within the broader classification. We also find the occurrence of `multiversality' in the phase diagram, wherein two fixed phases are separated by continuous transitions with different universality classes in different parameter regimes. We determine the phase diagram and all its aspects, as well as verify our predictions numerically using density matrix renormalization group and a mapping onto an effective spin-1 model.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of tunable assembly forces in chiral active environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fluctuations of a nonequilibrium bath enable dynamics inaccessible to any equilibrium system. Exploiting the driven dynamics of active matter in order to do useful work has become a topic of significant experimental and theoretical interest. Due to the unique modalities controlling self-assembly, the interplay between passive solutes and the particles in an active bath has been studied as a potential driving force to guide assembly of otherwise non-interacting objects. Here, we investigate and characterize the microscopic origins of the attractive and repulsive interactions between passive solutes in an active bath. We show that, while assembly does not occur dynamically for achiral active baths, chiral active particles can produce stable and robust assembly forces. We both explain the observed oscillatory force profile for active Brownian particles and demonstrate that chiral active motion leads to fluxes consistent with an odd diffusion tensor that, when appropriately tuned, produces long-ranged assembly forces.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz and Generalised Hydrodynamics in the sine-Gordon model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03909v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We set up a hydrodynamic description of the non-equilibrium dynamics of sine-Gordon quantum field theory for generic coupling. It is built upon an explicit form of the Bethe Ansatz description of general thermodynamic states, with the structure of the resulting coupled integral equations encoded in terms of graphical diagrams. The resulting framework is applied to derive results for the Drude weights of charge and energy. Quantities associated with the charge universally have fractal dependence on the coupling, which is notably absent from those associated with energy, a feature explained by the different roles played by reflective scattering in transporting these quantities. We then present far-from-equilibrium results, including explicit time evolution starting from bipartite initial states and dynamical correlation functions. Our framework can be applied to explore numerous other aspects of non-equilibrium dynamics, which opens the way to a wide array of theoretical studies and potential novel experimental predictions.</description>

      <title>Vortical currents and reciprocal relations for transport coefficients in the electron hydrodynamic regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the hydrodynamic regime in metals with momentum-conserving electron-electron scattering. The conservation of momentum results in well-defined dynamics whose effects we investigate via the relevant continuity equations. We find anomalous contributions to the charge and heat transport currents arising from gradients of the velocity field in a semiclassical treatment with a Berry curvature. These contributions are non-vanishing for systems lacking inversion symmetry, and the corresponding transport coefficients do not obey the standard Onsager reciprocity relations. Instead, we show that the response coefficients relating the currents to the stress tensor obey independent reciprocity relations with the stress tensor and thus exhibit cross-tensor effects of charge and heat transport with the momentum transport. The Berry curvature contribution to the stress magnetization tensor is also derived.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Penrose method of instability analysis, we consider the synchronization transition in the Kuramoto model with inertia and noise with all-to-all couplings. Analyzing the Penrose curves, we identify the appearance of cluster and chimera states in the presence of noise. We observe that noise can destroy chimera and biclusters states. The critical coupling describing bifurcation from incoherent to coherent state is found analytically. To confirm our propositions based on the Penrose method, we perform numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recently-established connection between Jarzynski's equality and the theoretical framework of Stochastic Normalizing Flows, we investigate a protocol relying on out-of-equilibrium lattice Monte Carlo simulations to mitigate the infamous computational problem of topological freezing. We test our proposal on $2d$ $\mathrm{CP}^{N-1}$ models and compare our results with those obtained adopting the Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions proposed by M. Hasenbusch, obtaining comparable performances. Our work thus sets the stage for future applications combining our Monte Carlo setup with machine learning techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study electron localization in disordered quantum systems, focusing on both individual eigenstates and thermal states. We employ complex polarization as a numerical indicator to characterize the system's localization length. Furthermore, we assess the efficacy of mean-field approximation in providing a quantitative analysis of such systems. Through this study, we seek to provide insight into the following aspects: the behavior of electron localization as a function of interaction, disorder, and temperature, whether thermal states and highly excited states exhibit similar properties in many-body localized systems, and the reliability of the mean-field approximation in weak-interaction scenarios.</description>

      <title>Disentangling transitions in topological order induced by boundary decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement structure of topological orders subject to decoherence on the bipartition boundary. Focusing on the toric codes in $d$ space dimensions for $d=2,3,4$, we explore whether the boundary decoherence may be able to induce a disentangling transition, characterized by the destruction of mixed-state long-range entanglement across the bipartition, measured by topological entanglement negativity. A key insight of our approach is the connection between the negativity spectrum of the decohered mixed states and emergent symmetry-protected topological orders under certain symmetry-preserving perturbation localized on the bipartition boundary. This insight allows us to analytically derive the exact results of entanglement negativity without using a replica trick.</description>
