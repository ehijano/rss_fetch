      <title>Symmetries of weighted networks: weight approximation method and its application to food webs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowing which parts of a complex system have identical roles simplifies computations and reveals patterns in its network structure. Group theory has been applied to study symmetries in unweighted networks. However, in real-world weighted networks, edge weights are rarely equal, making exact symmetry uncommon. To study symmetries in weighted networks, we aggregate edge weights into a small number of discrete categories. The symmetries of these aggregated networks identify vertices with similar roles in the original weighted network.
  In food webs, this approach helps to quantify ecological co-existence and competition by assessing the functional substitutability of species. We apply our method to 250 empirical food webs, finding that symmetric vertices emerge even under weak approximations, typically forming small orbits of size two or three. These symmetric vertices can appear at any trophic level or network position. We also apply three symmetry measures to compare structural patterns at the network level.</description>

      <title>The spatially variable effects of mangroves on flood depths and losses from storm surges in Florida</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mangroves modify storm surges with impacts to property damages from tropical cyclones (TC), but the magnitude of these effects and their spatial variability are not well understood especially at sub-county scales. We use high-resolution storm surge flood and loss models to examine variation in the effects of mangroves on these losses spatially and by storm intensity in Florida. We estimate that mangroves reduce storm surge losses to properties by $67.5 million annually in Collier County in western Florida with over half the cumulative benefits from storm surges with return periods under 30 years. We estimate the benefits of mangroves during hurricanes Irma (2017) and Ian (2022) as US$ 725 Million and $4.1 Billion. We show that flood depths and losses are always lower for properties landward of mangroves but can increase for properties seaward or between mangroves, underlining the importance of nuanced descriptions of variability in mangrove effects during storms.</description>

      <title>A General Theory of Abiogenesis: Thermodynamic Selection and the Emergence of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17975v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of life is often approached through the lens of replication, heredity, or molecular specificity. This paper proposes a thermodynamic framework in which the emergence of life is driven by the persistence of reaction pathways that align energetically with fluctuating environmental inputs. We define a reaction viability inequality based on energy input, return, resilience, and expenditure, which selects for persistent chemical configurations without invoking heredity or genetic encoding.
  We further incorporate entropic dynamics and spatial constraints into an augmented persistence function, showing that systems far from equilibrium can simultaneously increase global entropy while supporting localized chemical order. These refinements lead to the development of the Thermodynamic Abiogenesis Likelihood Model (TALM), a probabilistic extension that estimates the likelihood of persistence-driven selection under various prebiotic and planetary scenarios.
  This framework redefines the conditions under which life-like organization may emerge and provides a testable, general theory for abiogenesis grounded in physical law.</description>
