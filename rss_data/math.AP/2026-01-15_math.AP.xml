      <title>Single exponential $H^1$-upper bounds for the primitive equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The three dimensional primitive equations with full viscosity are considered in a horizontally periodic box $\Omega$, which are subject to either the homogeneous Neumann or Dirichlet conditions on the upper and bottom parts of the boundary. For a strong solution $v$ with initial data $a$, we establish \emph{a priori} bounds in $L^\infty(0, \infty; H^1(\Omega)) \cap L^2(0, \infty; \dot H^2(\Omega))$, the exponential part of which is $\exp(C \|a\|_{L^2(\Omega)}^2)$. This is in contrast to the upper bounds reported in the existing literature that are double exponential. Furthermore, the uniform-in-time estimate for the Neumann condition case, in which the Poincar\'e inequality is unavailable for $v$, seems to be new.</description>

      <title>Local-in-time strong solvability of Navier--Stokes type variational inequalities by Rothe's method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider parabolic variational inequalities in a Hilbert space $V$, which have a non-monotone nonlinearity of Navier--Stokes type represented by a bilinear operator $B: V \times V \to V'$ and a monotone type nonlinearity described by a convex, proper, and lower-semicontinuous functional $\varphi : V \to (-\infty, +\infty]$. Existence and uniqueness of a local-in-time strong solution in a maximal-$L^2$-regularity class and in a Kiselev--Ladyzhenskaya class are proved by discretization in time (also known as Rothe's method), provided that a corresponding stationary Stokes problem admits a regularity structure better than $V$ (which is typically $H^2$-regularity in case of the Navier--Stokes equations). Since we do not assume the cancelation property $\left&lt; B(u, v), v \right&gt; = 0$, in applications we may allow for broader boundary conditions than those treated by the existing literature.</description>

      <title>A new asymptotic model of multilayer tumor growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the growth of a tumor colony of multilayer type and focus on how the tumor grows from a near flat (when compared to the length of the tumor as, for instance, in the case of a bone tumor in a femur) initial colony. In particular we derive and study a new weakly nonlinear asymptotic model of multilayer tumor growth. The model takes the form of a nonlinear and nonlocal high order system of PDEs. Finally, motivated by the possibility of a finite time collision of the interfaces, we study the well-posedness of this system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript we deal with a class of nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations with the following structure \[ \partial_t u - \div\big(M\nabla u+ E h(u)\big)=0, \] with $M$ a bounded elliptic matrix, $E$ a vector field in a suitable Lebesgue space, and $h(u)$ featuring a superlinear growth for $u$ large. We provide existence results of $C([0,T),L^1)$ distributional solutions to initial-boundary value problems related to the equation above together with some qualitative properties of solutions.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of minimizers for axisymmetric nematic films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nematic surfaces are thin liquid films endowed with in-plane orientational order. We study a variational model in which the nematic director is constrained to lie in the tangent space of an axisymmetric surface, and the associated surface energy accounts for both surface tension and elastic nematic contributions. Here we adopt the surface gradient as the differential operator on the surface, we restrict our analysis to revolution surfaces spanning two coaxial rings, and we assume that the nematic director is aligned along parallels. In this setting, the energy functional reduces to a one-dimensional variational problem. We rigorously prove the existence and uniqueness of minimizers and we provide their complete geometric characterization. Finally, we run some numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Thin-film limit of the parabolic $p$-Laplace equation in a moving thin domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the parabolic $p$-Laplace equation with $p&gt;2$ in a moving thin domain under a Neumann type boundary condition corresponding to the total mass conservation. When the moving thin domain shrinks to a given closed moving hypersurface as its thickness tends to zero, we rigorously derive a limit problem by showing the weak convergence of the weighted average of a weak solution to the thin-domain problem and characterizing the limit function as a unique weak solution to the limit problem. The limit problem obtained in this paper is a system of a nonlinear partial differential equation and an algebraic equation on the moving hypersurface. This seems to be somewhat strange, but we also find that the limit problem can be seen as a new kind of local mass conservation law on the moving hypersurface with a normal flux.</description>

      <title>Gradient estimates for the $p$-Laplacian perfect conductivity problem with partially flat and $C^{1,\gamma}$ inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the gradient estimates for solutions to the perfect conductivity problem with two closely spaced perfect conductors embedded in a homogeneous matrix, modeled by $p$-Laplacian elliptic equations. We first prove that the gradient of the solution remains bounded when the conductors possess partially ``flat" boundaries. This contrasts with the case involving strictly convex inclusions, where the gradient can blow up. Second, for conductors with $C^{1,\gamma}$ boundaries ($\gamma\in(0,1)$), we establish both upper and lower bounds on the gradient, with optimal blow-up rates. Furthermore, we provide precise asymptotic expansions in some special cases.</description>

      <title>Note on Boundary Stabilization of Degenerate Schr\"{o}dinger Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A degenerate Schr\"{o}dinger equation under fractional integral damping is considered. Here the damping term is singular and not integrable and we consider the two cases when damping acting on the degenerate boundary and nondegenerate boundary. In this paper, we establish polynomial energy decay rates for the degenerate Schr\"{o}dinger equation by using resolvent estimates.</description>

      <title>A note on critical problems involving the $p$-Grushin Operator: existence of infinitely many solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a critical problem in a bounded domain involving the $p$-Grushin operator $\Delta_\alpha^p$. After a truncation argument, we obtain infinitely many solutions to our problem via Krasnoselskii's genus, extending a previous result of Garc\'ia Azorero and Peral Alonso to the $p$-Grushin operator. A central part of our analysis is the verification of the Palais-Smale condition of the associated functional under a certain level.</description>

      <title>Normal trace inequalities and decay of solutions to the nonlinear Maxwell system with absorbing boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quasilinear Maxwell system with a strictly positive, state dependent boundary conductivity. For small data we show that the solution exists for all times and decays exponentially to $0$. As in related literature we assume a nontrapping condition. Our approach relies on a new trace estimate for the corresponding non-autonomous linear problem, an observability-type estimate, and a detailed regularity analysis. The results are improved in the linear autonomous case, using properties of the Helmholtz decomposition in Sobolev spaces of (small) negative order.</description>

      <title>Exponential decay of the linear Maxwell system due to conductivity near the boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the anisotropic linear Maxwell system on a bounded domain $\Omega$ with perfectly conducting boundary conditions. It is damped via a conductivity $\sigma$ which is strictly positive on a collar at the boundary. We prove that solutions decay exponentially to 0, if the fields have no magnetic charges on $\Omega$ and no electric charges off the support of $\sigma$. Our approach relies on a splitting of the solution via a Helmholtz decomposition and an observability-type estimate for a related second-order system without charges, shown using Morawetz multipliers. Corresponding exact observability and controllability results are also established.</description>

      <title>On the classification of Serrin planar domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that all smooth ring domains $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ that admit a solution to Serrin's classical problem $\Delta u+2=0$ with locally constant overdetermined boundary conditions along $\partial \Omega$ can be described as algebro-geometric potentials of the mKdV hierarchy. The same result holds for periodic unbounded domains with two boundary components. In particular, any such domain is determined by suitable holomorphic data in some algebraic curve. As a consequence, the space of all Serrin ring domains, or periodic Serrin bands, can be ordered into a sequence of finite-dimensional complexity levels. By studying the first non-trivial level, given by elliptic functions, we construct: $(i)$ a global $1$-parameter family of periodic solutions to Serrin's problem that interpolates between a flat band and a chain of disks along an axis, following an unduloid pattern, and $(ii)$ for any $n&gt;1$, a two-dimensional moduli space ${\bf T}_n$ of non-radial Serrin ring domains with a dihedral symmetry group of order $2n$. This moduli space ${\bf T}_n$ is geometrically a triangle, and has radial bands on one side of ${\bf T}_n$, and a necklace of $n$ pairwise tangent disks distributed along the unit circle at its opposite vertex in ${\bf T}_n$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of variational eigenvalues for a general nonlocal $p$-Laplacian with varying horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the recent developing of nonlocal gradients with finite horizon $\delta&gt;0$ based on general kernels, we introduce a new nonlocal $p$-Laplacian and study the eigenvalue problem associated with it. Furthermore, by virtue of $\Gamma$-convergence arguments, we establish stability results of the solutions for varying horizon in the extreme cases $\delta\to 0^+$ and $\delta\to\infty$, recovering the solutions for the local eigenvalue problem associated with the $p$-Laplacian, and the ones associated with the $H^{s,p}$-Laplacian, respectively.</description>

      <title>A Sharp Localized Weighted Inequality Related to Gagliardo and Sobolev Seminorms and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we establish a nearly sharp localized weighted inequality related to Gagliardo and Sobolev seminorms, respectively, with the sharp $A_1$-weight constant or with the specific $A_p$-weight constant when $p\in (1,\infty)$. As applications, we further obtain a new characterization of Muckenhoupt weights and, in the framework of ball Banach function spaces, an inequality related to Gagliardo and Sobolev seminorms on cubes, a Gagliardo--Nirenberg interpolation inequality, and a Bourgain--Brezis--Mironescu formula. All these obtained results have wide generality and are proved to be (nearly) sharp.
  The original version of this article was published in [Adv. Math. 481 (2025), Paper No. 110537]. In this revised version, we correct an error appeared in Theorem 1.1 in the case where $p=1$, which was pointed out to us by Emiel Lorist.</description>

      <title>Classification of ancient ovals in higher dimensional mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study compact non-selfsimilar ancient noncollapsed solutions to the mean curvature flow in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, called ancient ovals. Our main result is the classification of $k$-ovals: any $k$-oval (characterized by having cylindrical blow down $\mathbb{R}^k\times S^{n-k}$ and the quadratic bending asymptotics) belongs, up to space-time rigid motions and parabolic dilations, to the family of ancient ovals constructed by Haslhofer and the second author. Assuming the nonexistence of exotic ovals (recently proved by Bamler-Lai), this yields a classification of all ancient ovals and identifies the moduli space, modulo symmetries, with an open $(k-1)$-simplex modulo the symmetry of simplex. Although these conclusions are contained in the recent breakthrough of Bamler-Lai classifying all ancient asymptotically cylindrical flows and resolving the mean convex neighborhood conjecture, we give an alternative argument for the independently obtained classification of $k$-ovals in arbitrary dimensions based on a different spectral parametrization.</description>

      <title>Sharp estimates for the Laplacian torsional rigidity with negative Robin boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by pioneering works of Bandle and Wagner, given a bounded Lipschitz domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb R^d$ with $d\ge3$, we consider the Robin-Laplacian torsional rigidity $\tau_\alpha(\Omega)$ with negative boundary parameter $\alpha$ and we show that sharp inequalities for $\tau_\alpha(\Omega)$ hold if $|\alpha|$ is small enough. In particular, we prove that, if $|\alpha|$ is smaller than the first non-trivial Steklov-Laplacian eigenvalue, then the ball maximises $\tau_\alpha(\Omega)$ among all convex domains under perimeter or volume constraints.This solves an open problem raised by Bandle and Wagner. We also prove the result in the planar case among simply connected sets and under perimeter constraint.</description>

      <title>On some functionals involving torsional rigidity, principal eigenvalue and perimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study some relationships between the first Dirichlet eigenvalue $\Lambda(\Omega)$ and the torsional rigidity $T(\Omega)$ of a domain $\Omega$. We consider the problem of optimizing the product $\Lambda(\Omega)T(\Omega)$ among sets with prescribed perimeter, both in the class of open sets with finite perimeter and within the class of convex domains.
  We also present local results for the quantity $\Lambda(\Omega)T(\Omega)^q$, with $q&gt;0$, under either a volume or a perimeter constraint.</description>

Abstract: In these notes, we emphasize Theorems rather than Theories concerning turbulent fluid motion. Such theorems can be viewed as constraints on the theoretical predictions and expectations of some of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century: Lars Onsager, Andrey Kolmogorov, Lev Landau, Lewis Fry Richardson among others.</description>

      <title>Free boundary regularity for a spectral optimal partition problem with volume and inclusion constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to a complete characterization of the free boundary of all solutions to the following spectral $k$-partition problem with measure and inclusion constraints: \[ \inf \left\{\sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_1(\omega_i)\; : \; \omega_i \subset \Omega \mbox{ are nonempty open sets for all } i=1,\ldots, k,\;
  \omega_i \cap \omega_j = \emptyset \: \text{for all}\: i \not=j \mbox{ and } \sum_{i=1}^{k}|\omega_i| = a \right\}, \] where $\Omega$ is a bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^N$, $a\in (0,|\Omega|)$. In particular, we prove free boundary conditions, classify contact points, characterize the regular and singular part of the free boundary (including branching points), and describe the interaction of the partition with the fixed boundary $\partial \Omega$.
  The proof is based on a perturbed version of the problem, combined with monotonicity formulas, blowup analysis and classification of blowups, suitable deformations of optimal sets and eigenfunctions, as well as the improvement of flatness of [Russ-Trey-Velichkov, CVPDE 58, 2019] for the one-phase points, and of [De Philippis-Spolaor-Velichkov, Invent. Math. 225, 2021] at two-phase points.</description>

      <title>Improved regularity estimates for degenerate or singular fully nonlinear dead-core systems and H\'{e}non-type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the degenerate or singular fully nonlinear dead-core systems coupled with strong absorption terms. We establish several properties, including improved regularity of viscosity solutions along the free boundary, non-degeneracy, a measure estimate of the free boundary, Liouville-type results, and the behavior of blow-up solution. We also derive sharp regularity estimates for viscosity solutions to H\'{e}non-type equations with a degenerate weight and strong absorption, governed by a degenerate fully nonlinear operator. Our results are new even for the model equations involving degenerate Laplacian operators.</description>

      <title>Attractors for Singular-Degenerate Porous Medium Type Equations Arising in Models for Biofilm Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the long-time behaviour of solutions of a class of singular-degenerate porous medium type equations in bounded domains with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. The existence of global attractors is shown under very general assumptions. Assuming, in addition, that solutions are globally H\"older continuous and the reaction terms satisfy a suitable sign condition in the vicinity of the degeneracy, we also prove the existence of an exponential attractor, which, in turn, yields the finite fractal dimension of the global attractor. Moreover, we extend the results for scalar equations to systems where the degenerate equation is coupled to a semilinear reaction-diffusion equation. The study of such systems is motivated by models for biofilm growth.</description>

      <title>Global Existence for General Systems of Isentropic Gas Dynamics via a Weighted Pressure Perturbation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes the global existence of bounded entropy solutions to the one-dimensional system of isentropic gas dynamics with general pressure laws, allowing for the presence of vacuum states. We introduce a novel regularization scheme based on a \textbf{weighted pressure perturbation} designed to enforce acoustic degeneracy at a cut-off density $\rho=\delta$. A distinguishing feature of our approach is the \textbf{strict preservation of the mass conservation law}, in contrast to previous regularization methods that require modifying the continuity equation. We prove that the perturbed pressure $\tilde{P}$ exactly inherits the convexity structure of the original equation of state (satisfying $2\tilde{P}'+\rho\tilde{P}'' = 2P'+\rho P''$), thereby ensuring the strict convexity of the mechanical entropy without auxiliary transformations. This structural preservation allows for the direct application of the Chueh-Conley-Smoller theory to establish uniform $L^\infty$ bounds via invariant regions. The convergence to a global weak solution in the vanishing regularization limit is finally proved using the method of compensated compactness and a singular analysis of the entropy equation near the vacuum.</description>

      <title>On quasi-isospectrality of potentials and Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.06110v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study quasi-isospectral operators as a generalization of isospectral operators. The paper contains both expository material and original results. We begin by reviewing known results on isospectral potentials on compact manifolds and finite intervals, and then introduce the notion of quasi-isospectrality. We next investigate the BMT method as a systematic approach to constructing quasi-isospectral Sturm-Liouville operators on a finite interval, and apply it to several boundary value problems. Our main result shows that any two quasi-isospectral closed manifolds of odd dimension are, in fact, isospectral. In addition, we extend classical compactness results for isospectral potentials on low-dimensional manifolds to the quasi-isospectral setting via heat trace asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Quantitative homogenization and hydrodynamic limit of non-gradient exclusion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12234v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the non-gradient exclusion process, we prove the quantitative homogenization of the diffusion matrix and the conductivity by local functions. The proof relies on the renormalization approach developed by Armstrong, Kuusi, Mourrat, and Smart, while the new challenge here is the hard core constraint of particle number on every site. Therefore, a coarse-grained method is proposed to lift the configuration to a larger space without exclusion, and a gradient coupling between two systems is applied to capture the spatial cancellation. We then strengthen the convergence rate to be uniform concerning the density, and integrate it into the work by Funaki, Uchiyama, and Yau [IMA Vol. Math. Appl., 77 (1996), pp. 1-40.] to yield a quantitative hydrodynamic limit. Our new approach avoids showing the characterization of closed forms and provides stronger results. The extension is discussed for the model in the presence of disorder on the bonds.</description>

      <title>Moments, Time-Inversion and Source Identification for the Heat Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the initial source identification problem for the heat equation, a notably ill-posed inverse problem characterized by exponential instability. Departing from classical Tikhonov regularization, we propose a novel approach based on moment analysis of the heat flow, transforming the problem into a more stable inverse moment formulation. By evolving the measured terminal time moments backward through their governing ODE system, we recover the moments of the initial distribution. We then reconstruct the source by solving a convex optimization problem that minimizes the total variation of a measure subject to these moment constraints. This formulation naturally promotes sparsity, yielding atomic solutions that are sums of Dirac measures. Compared to existing methods, our moment-based approach reduces exponential error growth to polynomial growth with respect to the terminal time. We provide explicit error estimates on the recovered initial distributions in terms of moment order, terminal time, and measurement errors. In addition, we develop efficient numerical discretization schemes and demonstrate significant stability improvements of our approach through comprehensive numerical experiments.</description>
