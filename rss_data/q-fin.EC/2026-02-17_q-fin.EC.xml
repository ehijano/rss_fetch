      <title>Endogenous Epistemic Weighting under Heterogeneous Information: Beyond Majority Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective decision-making can be viewed as the problem of aggregating multiple noisy information channels about an unknown state of the world. Classical epistemic justifications of majority rule rely on restrictive assumptions about the homogeneity and symmetry of these channels, which are often violated in realistic environments. This paper introduces the Epistemic Shared-Choice Mechanism (ESCM), a lightweight and auditable procedure that endogenously estimates issue-specific signal reliability and assigns bounded, decision-specific voting weights. Using central limit approximations, the paper provides an analytical comparison between ESCM and unweighted majority rule, showing how their relative epistemic performance depends on the distributional structure of information in the population, including unimodal competence distributions and segmented environments with informed minorities. The results indicate that endogenous and bounded epistemic weighting can improve collective accuracy by merging procedural and epistemic requirements.</description>

      <title>Buyer Commitment in Bilateral Bargaining: The Case of Online Japanese C2C Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies bargaining when buyers can continue searching for alternative sellers while negotiating, which limits their commitment to complete a transaction. Using transaction level data from a Japanese online marketplace, I document frequent post-agreement nonpurchase and show that buyers who explicitly pledge immediate payment are more likely to have their offers accepted, renege less often, and complete transactions faster. I develop and estimate a dynamic bargaining model with buyer search and limited commitment. Counterfactuals that restrict search during bargaining show that increased buyer commitment can reduce total welfare. Sellers especially those with higher valuations benefit from the elimination of delays and walkaways and respond by raising list prices. This reduces buyer welfare by lowering the option value of search and increasing expected list prices. Platform revenue also declines because buyer behavior shifts away from counteroffers and negotiated prices fall.</description>

      <title>How Well Are State-Dependent Local Projections Capturing Nonlinearities?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate how well state-dependent local projections recover true impulse responses in nonlinear environments. Using quadratic vector autoregressions as a laboratory, we show that linear local projections fail to capture any nonlinearities when shocks are symmetrically distributed. Popular state-dependent local projections specifications capture distinct aspects of nonlinearity: those interacting shocks with their signs capture higher-order effects, while those interacting shocks with lagged states capture state dependence. However, their gains over linear specifications are concentrated in tail shocks or tail states; and, for lag-based specifications, hinge on how well the chosen observable proxies the latent state. Our proposed specification-which augments the linear specification with a squared shock term and an interaction between the shock and lagged observables-best approximates the true responses across the entire joint distribution of shocks and states. An application to monetary policy reveals economically meaningful state dependence, whereas higher-order effects, though statistically significant, prove economically modest.</description>

      <title>The unintended effects of universalizing social pensions: Evidence from Mexico</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the effects of the 2019 universalization of Mexico's Social Pension Program (PAM), one of the country's most expansive and politically salient social programs. The reform simultaneously increased the cash transfer and extended eligibility to all individuals aged 65 and over, regardless of income or contributory pension status. Using nationally representative data from the ENIGH and a triple-differences (DDD) identification strategy, we estimate the causal effect of the universalization on poverty and labor market outcomes. Our empirical approach exploits variation across time (pre- and post-reform), age (eligible vs. ineligible), and pension scheme status (non-contributory vs. contributory), allowing us to separate the effects of expanded eligibility from those of increased benefit levels. We find strong increases in take-up rates and no significant change in overall poverty rates, suggesting that many new beneficiaries were not economically vulnerable. However, we document a surprising increase in extreme poverty, concentrated among low-income elderly who responded to the reform by exiting the labor force. This reduction in labor supply, driven by a significant drop in employment among individuals in the bottom income quartile, suggests that the pension acted as a substitute for labor income rather than a supplement. Taken together, the results highlight the trade-offs inherent in universal pension programs: while broader access reduces administrative exclusion, extending transfers to economically secure individuals may dilute redistributive impacts and generate behavioral responses that offset potential welfare gains.</description>

      <title>Market-Based Probability of Stock Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07935v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper describes the dependence of market-based statistical moments of returns on statistical moments and correlations of the current and past trade values. We use Markowitz's definition of value weighted return of a portfolio as the definition of market-based average return of trades during the averaging period. Then we derive the dependence of market-based volatility and higher statistical moments of returns on statistical moments, volatilities, and correlations of the current and past trade values. We derive the approximations of the characteristic function and the probability of returns by a finite number q of market-based statistical moments. To forecast market-based average and volatility of returns at horizon T, one should predict the first two statistical moments and correlation of current and past trade values at the same horizon. We discuss the economic reasons that limit the number of predicted statistical moments of returns by the first two. That limits the accuracy of the forecasts of probability of returns by the accuracy of the Gaussian approximations. To improve the reliability of large macroeconomic and market models like BlackRock's Aladdin, JP Morgan, and the U.S. Fed., the developers should use market-based statistical moments of returns.</description>

      <title>AI and Worker Well-Being: Differential Impacts Across Generational Cohorts and Genders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between AI use and worker well-being outcomes such as mental health, job enjoyment, and physical health and safety, using microdata from the OECD AI Surveys across seven countries. The results reveal that AI users are significantly more likely to report improvements across all three outcomes, with effects ranging from 8.9% to 21.3%. However, these benefits vary by generation and gender. Generation Y (1981-1996) shows the strongest gains across all dimensions, while Generation X (1965-1980) reports moderate improvements in mental health and job enjoyment. In contrast, Generation Z (1997-2012) benefits only in job enjoyment. As digital natives already familiar with technology, Gen Z workers may not receive additional gains in mental or physical health from AI, though they still experience increased enjoyment from using it. Baby Boomers (born before 1965) experience limited benefits, as they may not find these tools as engaging or useful. Women report stronger mental health gains, whereas men report greater improvements in physical health. These findings suggest that AI's workplace impact is uneven and shaped by demographic factors, career stage, and the nature of workers' roles.</description>

      <title>Predicting Company Growth using Scaling Theory informed Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting company growth is a critical yet challenging task because observed dynamics blend an underlying structural growth trend with volatile fluctuations. Here, we propose a Scaling-Theory-Informed Machine Learning (STIML) framework that integrates a scaling-based growth model to capture the mechanism-driven average trend, together with a data-driven forecasting model to learn the residual fluctuations. Using Compustat annual financial statement data (1950--2019) for 31,553 North American companies, we extend the growth model beyond assets to multiple financial indicators, and evaluate STIML against growth model-only and purely data-driven baselines. Across 16 target variables, we show that company growth exhibits a clear separation between trend-driven predictability and fluctuation-driven predictability, with their relative importance depending strongly on company size and volatility. Interpretability analyses further show that STIML captures multivariate dependencies beyond simple autocorrelation, and that macroeconomic variables contribute significantly less to predictive performance on average. Moreover, we find the scaling-based growth model overlooks asymmetric deviations, which instead contain the structured and learnable signals, suggesting a path to refine mechanistic models.</description>

      <title>Learning to Adopt Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in generative AI, such as ChatGPT, have dramatically transformed how people access information. Despite its powerful capabilities, the benefits it provides may not be equally distributed among individuals, a phenomenon referred to as the digital divide. Building upon prior literature, we propose two forms of digital divide in the generative AI adoption process: (i) the learning divide, capturing individuals' heterogeneous abilities to update their perceived utility of ChatGPT; and (ii) the utility divide, representing differences in individuals' actual utility derived from per use of ChatGPT. To evaluate these two divides, we develop a Bayesian learning model that incorporates heterogeneities in both the utility and signal functions. Leveraging a large-scale clickstream dataset, we estimate the model and find significant learning and utility divides across various social characteristics. Interestingly, individuals without any college education, non-white individuals, and those with lower English literacy derive larger utility gains from ChatGPT, yet update their beliefs about its utility at a slower rate. Furthermore, males, younger individuals, and those in occupations with greater exposure to generative AI not only obtain higher utility per use from ChatGPT but also learn about its utility more rapidly. Besides, we document a phenomenon termed the belief trap, wherein users underestimate ChatGPT's utility, opt not to use the tool, and thereby lack new experiences to update their perceptions, leading to continued underutilization. Our simulation further demonstrates that the learning divide can significantly affect the probability of falling into the belief trap, another form of the digital divide in adoption outcomes (i.e., outcome divide); however, offering training programs can alleviate the belief trap and mitigate the divide.</description>

      <title>Policy Design in Long-Run Welfare Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improving social welfare is a complex challenge requiring policymakers to optimize objectives across multiple time horizons. Evaluating the impact of such policies presents a fundamental challenge, as those that appear suboptimal in the short run may yield significant long-term benefits. We tackle this challenge by analyzing the long-term dynamics of two prominent policy frameworks: Rawlsian policies, which prioritize those with the greatest need, and utilitarian policies, which maximize immediate welfare gains. Conventional wisdom suggests these policies are at odds, as Rawlsian policies are assumed to come at the cost of reducing the average social welfare, which their utilitarian counterparts directly optimize. We challenge this assumption by analyzing these policies in a sequential decision-making framework where individuals' welfare levels stochastically decay over time, and policymakers can intervene to prevent this decay. Under reasonable assumptions, we prove that interventions following Rawlsian policies can outperform utilitarian policies in the long run, even when the latter dominate in the short run. We characterize the exact conditions under which Rawlsian policies can outperform utilitarian policies. We further illustrate our theoretical findings using simulations, which highlight the risks of evaluating policies based solely on their short-term effects. Our results underscore the necessity of considering long-term horizons in designing and evaluating welfare policies; the true efficacy of even well-established policies may only emerge over time.</description>

      <title>A Financial Brain Scan of the LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emerging techniques in computer science make it possible to "brain scan" large language models (LLMs), identify the plain-English concepts that guide their reasoning, and steer them while holding other factors constant. We show that this approach can map LLM-generated economic forecasts to concepts such as sentiment, technical analysis, and timing, and compute their relative importance without reducing performance. We also show that models can be steered to be more or less risk-averse, optimistic, or pessimistic, which allows researchers to correct or simulate biases. The method is transparent, lightweight, and replicable for empirical research in the social sciences.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Agents in Spatial Double-Auction Markets: Modeling the Emergence of Industrial Symbiosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Industrial symbiosis fosters circularity by enabling firms to repurpose residual resources, yet its emergence is constrained by socio-spatial frictions that shape costs, matching opportunities, and market efficiency. Existing models often overlook the interaction between spatial structure, market design, and adaptive firm behavior, limiting our understanding of where and how symbiosis arises. We develop an agent-based model where heterogeneous firms trade byproducts through a spatially embedded double-auction market, with prices and quantities emerging endogenously from local interactions. Leveraging reinforcement learning, firms adapt their bidding strategies to maximize profit while accounting for transport costs, disposal penalties, and resource scarcity. Simulation experiments reveal the economic and spatial conditions under which decentralized exchanges converge toward stable and efficient outcomes. Counterfactual regret analysis shows that sellers' strategies approach a near Nash equilibrium, while sensitivity analysis highlights how spatial structures and market parameters jointly govern circularity. Our model provides a basis for exploring policy interventions that seek to align firm incentives with sustainability goals, and more broadly demonstrates how decentralized coordination can emerge from adaptive agents in spatially constrained markets.</description>
