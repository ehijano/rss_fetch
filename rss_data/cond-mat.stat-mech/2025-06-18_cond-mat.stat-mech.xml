      <title>The Hamiltonian mechanics of exotic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop Hamiltonian mechanics on Aristotelian manifolds, which lack local boost symmetry and admit absolute time and space structures. We construct invariant phase space dynamics, define free Hamiltonians, and establish a generalized Liouville theorem. Conserved quantities are identified via lifted Killing vectors. Extending to kinetic theory, we show that the charge current and stress tensor reproduce ideal hydrodynamics at leading order, with the ideal gas law emerging universally. Our framework provides a geometric and dynamical foundation for systems where boost invariance is absent, with applications including but not limited to: condensed matter, active matter and optimization dynamics.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary chemical learning in dimerization networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for chemical learning based on Competitive Dimerization Networks (CDNs) - systems in which multiple molecular species, e.g. proteins or DNA/RNA oligomers, reversibly bind to form dimers. We show that these networks can be trained in vitro through directed evolution, enabling the implementation of complex learning tasks such as multiclass classification without digital hardware or explicit parameter tuning. Each molecular species functions analogously to a neuron, with binding affinities acting as tunable synaptic weights. A training protocol involving mutation, selection, and amplification of DNA-based components allows CDNs to robustly discriminate among noisy input patterns. The resulting classifiers exhibit strong output contrast and high mutual information between input and output, especially when guided by a contrast-enhancing loss function. Comparative analysis with in silico gradient descent training reveals closely correlated performance. These results establish CDNs as a promising platform for analog physical computation, bridging synthetic biology and machine learning, and advancing the development of adaptive, energy-efficient molecular computing systems.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem in Kinetic Ising Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-equilibrium dynamics, even in the simplest spin models, is still not well understood. The celebrated {\it fluctuation dissipation theorem} (FDT) does not hold for non-equilibrium systems. In this context, Cugliandolo and Kurchan introduced a generalized FDT which elucidates the non-equilibrium evolution as a composition of {\it time sectors} corresponding to different {\it effective temperatures}. We address these evaluations in the $d=2$ long-range Ising model (LRIM), which surprisingly still has many lessons to teach. In particular, we investigate how interactions and conservation laws affect the non-equilibrium dynamics that is initiated by coarsening experiments. Quantifying the deviations from FDT in terms of $T_{eff}$, we find different aging scenarios for short- and long-range IM with non-conserved (Glauber) dynamics and conserved (Kawasaki) dynamics.</description>

      <title>Scaling and Universality at Noisy Quench Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) have been studied in the extended XY model under both noiseless and noisy linear driven staggered field cases. In the time-independent staggered field case, the model exhibits a single critical point where the transition occurs from the spin-liquid phase to the antiferromagnetic phase. In the noiseless ramp case, unlike the transverse field XY model where DQPT always occurs for a quench crossing the single critical point, there is a critical sweep velocity above which the kinks corresponding to a DQPT are completely removed. Furthermore, in this case there are only two critical modes whose excitation probability is one-half. In the presence of a Gaussian white noise, we find that this critical sweep velocity decreases by increasing the noise strength, and scales linearly with the square of the noise intensity. A surprising result occurs when the noise intensity and sweep velocity are about the same order of magnitude, the number of critical modes is significantly increased, signalling a region with multiple critical modes. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the scaling of the dynamical free energy near the DQPTs time is the same for both noiseless and noisy ramp quenches.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Phase diagram of the Quantum Ising model with Cluster Interaction Under Noisy and Noiseless Driven field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In most lattice models, gap closing typically occurs at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone. In the transverse field Ising model with cluster interaction, besides the gap closing at high-symmetry points, the gap closing at the quantum phase transition between paramagnetic and cluster phases of the model can be moved by tuning the strength of the cluster interaction. We take advantage of this property to examine the nonequilibrium dynamics of the model in the framework of dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) after a noiseless and noisy ramp of the transverse magnetic field. The numerical results show that DQPTs always happen if the starting or ending point of the quench field is restricted between two critical points. In other ways, there is always critical sweep velocity above which DQPTs disappear. Our finding reveals that noise modifies drastically the dynamical phase diagram of the model. We find that the critical sweep velocity decreases by enhancing the noise intensity and scales linearly with the square of noise intensity for weak and strong noise. Moreover, the region with multi-critical modes induced in the dynamical phase diagram by noise. The sweep velocity under which the system enters the multi-critical modes (MCMs) region increases by enhancing the noise and scales linearly with the square of noise intensity</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic cost associated with driving systems between different non-equilibrium steady states. In particular, we combine a linear-response framework for non-equilibrium Markov systems with Lagrangian techniques to minimize the dissipation associated with driving processes. We then apply our framework to a simple toy model. Our results show several remarkable properties for the optimal protocol, such as diverging parameters and finite entropy production in the slow-driving limit.</description>

      <title>From Attraction to Repulsion: Emergent Interactions in Harmonically Coupled Active Binary System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergent interactions between two active Brownian particles coupled by an attractive harmonic potential and in contact with a thermal reservoir. By analyzing the stationary distribution of their separation, we demonstrate that the effective interaction can be either attractive or repulsive, depending on the interplay between activity, coupling strength, and temperature. Notably, we find that an effective short-range repulsion emerges in the strong and moderate-coupling regimes, when the temperature is below some threshold value, which we characterize analytically. In the strong-coupling regime, the repulsion emerges due to the difference in the self-propulsion speeds of the particles. We also compute the short-time position distribution of the centroid of the coupled particles, which shows strongly non-Gaussian fluctuations at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Translation symmetry restoration in integrable systems: the noninteracting case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of symmetry restoration has recently emerged as a fruitful means to extract high-level information on the relaxation of quantum many-body systems. This revealed, for instance, the surprising 'quantum Mpemba effect' that occurs when a symmetry is restored more rapidly when the initial configuration is less symmetric. While the restoration of internal symmetries has been investigated intensively, however, the one of spatial symmetries has only been considered recently in the context of random unitary circuits. Here we present a complementary study of translation symmetry restoration in integrable systems. Specifically, we consider non-interacting spinless fermions on the lattice prepared in non-equilibrium states invariant only under $\nu&gt;1$ lattice shifts and follow the restoration of one-site shift invariance. We do so by measuring the Frobenius distance between the state on a subsystem, and its symmetrised counterpart. We compute the latter exactly, using standard Gaussian methods, and formulate a quasiparticle picture -- involving multiplets of $\nu$ correlated quasiparticles -- to describe analytically its asymptotic behaviour. We show that, differently from random unitary circuits where symmetry restoration occurs abruptly for times proportional to the subsystem size, here symmetry is restored smoothly and over timescales of the order of the subsystem size squared. Interestingly, we also show that, in contrast to the case of continuous internal symmetries, the quasiparticle picture does not provide a quantitative description of discrete translation symmetry restoration and that the latter process goes beyond the hydrodynamic description. Our results can directly be extended to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic theory of wetting by active particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accumulation of self-propelled particles on repulsive barriers is a widely observed feature in active matter. Despite being implicated in a broad range of biological processes, from biofilm formation to cytoskeletal movement, wetting of surfaces by active particles remains poorly understood. In this work, we study this active wetting by considering a model comprising an active lattice gas, interacting with a permeable barrier under periodic boundary conditions, for which an exact hydrodynamic description is possible. Our model eliminates dynamical noise while retaining microscopic fidelity, enabling a precise characterisation of steady-states and their transitions. We demonstrate that the accumulation of active particles is remarkably similar to equilibrium wetting, and that active wetting transitions retain all the salient characteristics of equilibrium critical wetting - despite fundamental differences in underlying microscopic dynamics. Additionally, we uncover a ratchet mechanism on permeable barriers in active systems, and demonstrate that this gives rise to steady-state currents and a novel transition pathway in active wetting. Our results provide an intrinsically nonequilibrium framework in which to study active wetting, and precisely demonstrate the connection to equilibrium wetting - while clarifying how differences in microscopic dynamics give rise to novel macroscopic behaviour.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Living systems relay information across membrane interfaces to coordinate compartment functions. We identify a physical mechanism for selective information transmission that arises from the sigmoidal response of surface-bound particle densities to spatial features of adjacent external structures. This mechanism implements a form of spatial thresholding, enabling the binary classification of external cues. Expansion microscopy measurements of nuclear pore complex distributions in S. arctica show signatures of such physical thresholding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bose-Einstein Condensation is a phenomenon at the heart of many of the past century's most intriguing and fundamental manifestations, such as superfluidity and superconductivity. It was discovered theoretically some 100 years ago, and unequivocally experimentally demonstrated in the context of weakly interacting gases 30 years ago. Since then, it has spawned a revolution in our understanding of fundamental phases of matter and collective quantum dynamics extending across all physical scales and energies, with unforeseen implications and the potential for envisaged quantum technological applications.</description>

      <title>Probing Hilbert space fragmentation using controlled dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical constraints in many-body quantum systems can lead to Hilbert space fragmentation, wherein the system's evolution is restricted to small subspaces of Hilbert space called Krylov sectors. However, unitary dynamics within individual sectors may also be slow or non-ergodic, which limits experiments' ability to measure the properties of the entire sector. We show that additional controlled dephasing reliably mixes the system within a single Krylov sector, and that simple observables can differentiate these sectors. For example, in the strongly interacting XXZ chain with dephasing, the spin imbalance between even and odd sublattices distinguishes sectors. For appropriate choices of initial states, the imbalance begins positive, decays to a negative minimum value at intermediate times, and eventually returns to zero. The minimum reflects the average imbalance of the Krylov sector associated to the initial state. We compute the size of the minimum analytically in the limit of strong interactions, and validate our results with simulations at experimentally relevant interaction strengths.</description>

      <title>The phenomenological renormalization group in neuronal models near criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phenomenological renormalization group (PRG) has been applied to the study of scaleinvariant phenomena in neuronal data, providing evidence for critical phenomena in the brain. However, it remains unclear how reliably these observed signatures indicate genuine critical behavior, as it is not well established how close to criticality a system must be for them to emerge. Here, we rely on neuronal models with known critical points to investigate under which conditions the PRG procedure yields consistent results. We discuss how the time-binning step of data preprocessing can crucially affect the final results, and propose a data-driven method to adapt the time bin in order to circumvent this issue. Under these conditions, the PRG method only detects scaling behavior in neuronal models within a very narrow range of the critical point, lending credence to the conclusions drawn from PRG results in experimental data.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Diffusion of Chiral Skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brownian dynamics of chiral matter in chiral environment may give rise to emergent phenomena that could not be observed in achiral environment. Here, we report the asymmetric diffusion of chiral skyrmions in two chambers separated by a chiral gate. The topology-determined Brownian gyromotion of skyrmions could lead to effective interactions between skyrmions and chamber walls with a sense of clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation. By fabricating a chiral gate separating two chambers, skyrmions could demonstrate asymmetric diffusion through the gate to approach a nonequilibrium state before reaching the thermal equilibrium. We focus on the asymmetric diffusion of skyrmions that depends on the gate chirality and opening width. Although the simulated diffusion of skyrmions is affected by the skyrmion density, which varies with time due to the diffusion and annihilation, the simulated outcomes are generally in line with simple theories assuming time-independent diffusion rates. Our results uncover asymmetric diffusive behaviors of chiral skyrmions interacting with chiral nanostructures, which will appeal to the wide audience interested in hard condensed matter systems, magnetism, active matter, and statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Turbulent stretching of dumbbells with hydrodynamic interactions: an analytical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stretching of an elastic dumbbell in a turbulent flow, with the aim of understanding and quantifying the effect of hydrodynamic interactions (HI) between the beads of the dumbbell. Adopting the Batchelor-Kraichnan model for the flow, we derive a Fokker-Planck equation and solve it analytically to obtain the probability distribution of the dumbbell's extension. Using different formulations of the HI tensor, we find that HI preferentially enhances the stretching of stiff dumbbells, i.e., those with a small Weissenberg number. We also evaluate the averaging approximations commonly used to simplify the description of HI effects; the consistently-averaged approximation shows that HI result in a less-pronounced coil-stretch transition in chaotic flows. Finally, we confirm the relevance of our analytical results by a comparison with Brownian dynamics simulations of dumbbells transported in a direct numerical simulation of homogeneous isotropic turbulence.</description>

Abstract: Driven soft athermal systems may display a reversible-irreversible transition between an absorbing, arrested state and an active phase where a steady-state dynamics sets in. A paradigmatic example consists in cyclically sheared suspensions under stroboscopic observation, for which in absence of contacts during a shear cycle particle trajectories are reversible and the stroboscopic dynamics is frozen, while contacts lead to diffusive stroboscopic motion. The Random Organization Model (ROM), which is a minimal model of the transition, shows a transition which falls into the Conserved Directed Percolation (CDP) universality class. However, the ROM ignores hydrodynamic interactions between suspended particles, which make contacts a source of long-range mechanical noise that in turn can create new contacts. Here, we generalize the ROM to include long-range interactions decaying like inverse power laws of the distance. Critical properties continuously depend on the decay exponent when it is smaller than the space dimension. Upon increasing the interaction range, the transition turns convex (that is, with an order parameter exponent $\beta &gt; 1$), fluctuations turn from diverging to vanishing, and hyperuniformity at the transition disappears. We rationalize this critical behavior using a local mean-field model describing how particle contacts are created via mechanical noise, showing that diffusive motion induced by long-range interactions becomes dominant for slowly-decaying interactions.</description>

      <title>A novel approach for converting spatio-temporal series into complex networks</title>

Abstract: This study aims to offer a new perspective on complex network representation of real-world systems. Currently, the most well-known transformation algorithms in the literature treat each data point in a time series as a node and transform the time series into a network. In this study, we present a new approach converting spatio-temporal series into a complex network. We focus on studying this transformation by grounding it in the context of physics , with the aim of adapting it to real-world problems, which often manifest as complex systems across various domains. We introduce the Gravitational Graph (GG) algorithm, which is grounded in the concept of gravitational force from fundamental physics. We consider air pollution concentrations, which represent a global environmental health risk, as an example of a complex environmental system, and apply the GG algorithm to particulate matter of 10 microns (PM10) recorded by 21 air quality monitoring stations located in various regions of Istanbul, Turkiye. While the GG algorithm allows for the conversion of spatio-temporal series -- rather than time series -- into networks, it also enables the analysis of the statistical properties and characteristics of the converted networks, thereby uncovering hidden relationships and dependencies that may not be apparent in the original time series.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty in AI-driven Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the study of complex systems, evaluating physical observables often requires sampling representative configurations via Monte Carlo techniques. These methods rely on repeated evaluations of the system's energy and force fields, which can become computationally expensive, particularly in the presence of long-range interactions. To accelerate these simulations, deep learning models are increasingly employed as surrogate functions to approximate the energy landscape or force fields. However, such models introduce epistemic uncertainty in their predictions, which may propagate through the sampling process and affect the system's macroscopic behavior. In this work, we present the Penalty Ensemble Method (PEM) to quantify epistemic uncertainty and mitigate its impact on Monte Carlo sampling. Our approach introduces an uncertainty-aware modification of the Metropolis acceptance rule, which increases the rejection probability in regions of high uncertainty, thereby enhancing the reliability of the simulation outcomes.</description>

      <title>Promoting Fluctuation Theorems into Covariant Forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17621v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The principle of covariance, a cornerstone of modern physics, asserts the equivalence of all inertial frames of reference. Fluctuation theorems, as extensions of the second law of thermodynamics, establish universal connections between irreversibility and fluctuation in terms of stochastic thermodynamic quantities. However, these relations typically assume that both the thermodynamic system and the heat bath are at rest with respect to the observer, thereby failing to satisfy the principle of covariance. In this study, by introducing covariant work and heat that incorporate both energy-related and momentum-related components, we promote fluctuation theorems into covariant forms applicable to moving thermodynamic systems and moving heat baths. We illustrate this framework with two examples: the work statistics of a relativistic stochastic field and the heat statistics of a relativistic Brownian motion. Although our study is carried out in the context of special relativity, the results can be extended to the nonrelativistic limit. Our work combines the principle of covariance and fluctuation theorems into a coherent framework and may have applications in the study of thermodynamics relevant to cosmic microwave background as well as the radiative heat transfer and noncontact friction between relatively moving bodies.</description>

Abstract: The two-fluid theory for superfluid hydrodynamics is derived from the fountain pressure result that condensed bosons move at constant entropy and are driven by the chemical potential gradient. Explicit results for $^4$He show that the superfluid has vorticity, which is consistent with measured data but inconsistent with Landau's principle that superfluid flow is irrotational.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Thermalization and its breakdown in Quantum Spin Chains with Inhomogeneous Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) is a successful theory that establishes the criteria for ergodicity and thermalization in isolated quantum many-body systems. In this work, we investigate the thermalization properties of spin-$ 1/2 $ XXZ chain with linearly-inhomogeneous interactions. We demonstrate that introduction of the inhomogeneous interactions leads to an onset of quantum chaos and thermalization, which, however, becomes inhibited for sufficiently strong inhomogeneity. To exhibit ETH, and to display its breakdown upon varying the strength of interactions, we probe statistics of energy levels and properties of matrix elements of local observables in eigenstates of the inhomogeneous XXZ spin chain. Moreover, we investigate the dynamics of the entanglement entropy and the survival probability which further evidence the thermalization and its breakdown in the considered model. We outline a way to experimentally realize the XXZ chain with linearly-inhomogeneous interactions in systems of ultracold atoms. Our results highlight a mechanism of emergence of ETH due to insertion of inhomogeneities in an otherwise integrable system and illustrate the arrest of quantum dynamics in presence of strong interactions.</description>

      <title>Precision bounds for multiple currents in open quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamic (TUR) and kinetic (KUR) uncertainty relations are fundamental bounds constraining the fluctuations of current observables in classical, non-equilibrium systems. Several works have verified, however, violations of these classical bounds in open quantum systems, motivating the derivation of new quantum TURs and KURs that account for the role of quantum coherence. Here, we go one step further by deriving multidimensional KUR and TUR for multiple observables in open quantum systems undergoing Markovian dynamics. Our derivation exploits a multi-parameter metrology approach, in which the Fisher information matrix plays a central role. Crucially, our bounds are tighter than previously derived quantum TURs and KURs for single observables, precisely because they incorporate correlations between multiple observables. We also find an intriguing quantum signature of correlations that is captured by the off-diagonal element of the Fisher information matrix, which vanishes for classical stochastic dynamics. By considering two examples, namely a coherently driven qubit system and the three-level maser, we demonstrate that the multidimensional quantum KUR bound can even be saturated when the observables are perfectly correlated.</description>

      <title>Classical Annealing of Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Spin Glass Using Suzuki-Kubo Mean-field Ising Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18358v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate numerically a fast classical annealing scheme for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin glass model, employing the Suzuki-Kubo meanfield Ising dynamics (supplemented by a modified Thouless-Anderson-Palmer reaction field). The resultant dynamics, starting from any arbitrary paramagnetic phase (with local magnetizations $m_i=\pm 1$ for the $i^{th}$ spin, and the global magnetization $m=0$), takes the system quickly to an appropriate state with small local values of magnetization ($m_i$) commensurate with the (frustrated) interactions. As the temperature decreases with the annealing, the configuration practically remains (in an effective adiabatic way) close to a low energy configuration as the magnitudes of $m_i$'s and the spin glass order parameter $q$ grow to unity. While the configuration reached by the procedure is not the ground state, for an $N$-spin SK model (with $N$ up to 10000) the deviation in the energy per spin $E^0_N - E^0$ found by the annealing procedure scales as $N^{-2/3}$, with $E^0 = -0.7629\pm 0.0002$, suggesting that in the thermodynamic limit the energy per spin of the low energy configurations converges to the ground state of the SK model (analytical estimate being $E^0 =-0.7631667265 \dots$), fluctuation $\sigma_N $ in $E^0_N$ decreases as $\sim N^{-3/4}$ and the annealing time $\tau_N \sim N$, making this protocol highly efficient in estimating the ground state of the SK model.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovianity of subsystem dynamics in isolated quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is believed that an isolated and far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body system should try to attain equilibrium via a mechanism whereby any given subsystem acts as an open quantum system that is coupled to an environment, which is the complementary part of the full system, and undergoes a complicated equilibration process such that all the subsystems in the long-time limit attain equilibrium states compatible with the global equilibrium state. This picture begs the question whether the dynamics of any given subsystem is Markovian (monotonic loss of information and memory) or non-Markovian. In this work, by numerically probing the dynamical behaviour of the quantum distances between $\textit{temporally-separated}$ states of small subsystems, we reveal the telltale signatures of (non-)Markovianity of the dynamics of subsystems of an isolated quantum spin system brought in the far-from-equilibrium regime, exemplified with the mixed-field Ising spin chain quenched between parameter regimes deep inside its magnetically ordered and disordered regimes. Additionally, remarkably systematic behaviour is seen in a measure of classical distances between the quantum states of the considered subsystems. These features strongly depend on the direction of quenching in the parameter space, with paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic quenches offering considerably stronger signatures of subsystem non-Markovianity, for which we offer heuristic arguments.</description>

      <title>Beyond Robertson-Schr\"odinger: A General Uncertainty Relation Unveiling Hidden Noncommutative Trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20404v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a universal strengthening of the Robertson-Schr\''odinger uncertainty relation, revealing a previously overlooked trade-off of genuinely quantum origin, particularly as the state becomes more mixed. Remarkably, this generalized bound supplements the standard commutator term and the covariance term with an additional positive contribution that depends on the commutator of observables. The relation also rigorously proves and extends a conjectured uncertainty relation previously proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 062215 (2024)]. For two-level quantum systems, the inequality becomes an exact equality for any state and any pair of observables, establishing that the bound is tight in the strongest possible sense.</description>
