      <title>An Ultra-high-speed Reproducing Kernel Particle Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the fast-convolving reproducing kernel particle method (FC-RKPM) is introduced. This method is hundreds to millions of times faster than the traditional RKPM for 3D meshfree simulations. In this approach, the meshfree discretizations with RK approximation are expressed in terms of convolution sums. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) is then used to efficiently compute the convolutions. Certain modifications to the domain and shape functions are considered to maintain generality for complex geometries and arbitrary boundary conditions. The new method does not need to identify, store, and loop over the neighbors which is one of the bottleneck of the traditional meshfree methods. As a result, the run-times and memory allocations are independent of the number of neighbors and the shape function support size. As a model problem, the method is laid out for a Galerkin weak form of the Poisson problem with the RK approximation, and is verified in 1D, 2D, and 3D. Tables with run-times and allocated memory are presented to compare the performance of FC-RKPM with the traditional method in 3D. The performance is studied for various node numbers, support size, and approximation degree. All the implementation details and the roadmap for software development are also provided. Application of the new method to nonlinear and explicit problems are briefly discussed as well.</description>

      <title>On Quantile Randomized Kaczmarz for Linear Systems with Time-Varying Noise and Corruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale systems of linear equations arise in machine learning, medical imaging, sensor networks, and in many areas of data science. When the scale of the systems are extreme, it is common for a fraction of the data or measurements to be corrupted. The Quantile Randomized Kaczmarz (QRK) method is known to converge on large-scale systems of linear equations Ax=b that are inconsistent due to static corruptions in the measurement vector b. We prove that QRK converges even for systems corrupted by time-varying perturbations. Additionally, we prove that QRK converges up to a convergence horizon on systems affected by time-varying noise and demonstrate that the noise affects only the convergence horizon of the method, and not the rate of convergence. Finally, we utilize Markov's inequality to prove a lower bound on the probability that the largest entries of the QRK residual reveal the time-varying corruption in each iteration. We present numerical experiments which illustrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Parameter choice strategies for regularized least squares approximation of noisy continuous functions on the unit circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a trigonometric polynomial reconstruction of continuous periodic functions from their noisy values at equidistant nodes of the unit circle by a regularized least squares method. We indicate that the constructed trigonometric polynomial can be determined in explicit due to the exactness of trapezoidal rule. Then a concrete error bound is derived based on the estimation of the Lebesgue constant. In particular, we analyze three regularization parameter choice strategies: Morozov's discrepancy principal, L-curve and generalized cross-validation. Finally, numerical examples are given to perform that well chosen parameters by above strategy can improve approximation quality.</description>

      <title>A Moving Mesh Method for Porous Medium Equation by the Onsager Variational Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new approach to solving the porous medium equation using a moving mesh finite element method that leverages the Onsager variational principle as an approximation tool. Both the continuous and discrete problems are formulated based on the Onsager principle. The energy dissipation structure is maintained in the semi-discrete and fully implicit discrete schemes. We also develop a fully decoupled explicit scheme by which only a few linear equations are solved sequentially in each time step. The numerical schemes exhibit an optimal convergence rate when the initial mesh is appropriately selected to ensure accurate approximation of the initial data. Furthermore, the method naturally captures the waiting time phenomena without requiring any manual intervention.</description>

      <title>Dual Simplex Volume Maximization for Simplex-Structured Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simplex-structured matrix factorization (SSMF) is a generalization of nonnegative matrix factorization, a fundamental interpretable data analysis model, and has applications in hyperspectral unmixing and topic modeling. To obtain identifiable solutions, a standard approach is to find minimum-volume solutions. By taking advantage of the duality/polarity concept for polytopes, we convert minimum-volume SSMF in the primal space to a maximum-volume problem in the dual space. We first prove the identifiability of this maximum-volume dual problem. Then, we use this dual formulation to provide a novel optimization approach which bridges the gap between two existing families of algorithms for SSMF, namely volume minimization and facet identification. Numerical experiments show that the proposed approach performs favorably compared to the state-of-the-art SSMF algorithms.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Quantum Algorithm for Linear System Problem in Tensor Format</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving linear systems is at the foundation of many algorithms. Recently, quantum linear system algorithms (QLSAs) have attracted great attention since they converge to a solution exponentially faster than classical algorithms in terms of the problem dimension. However, low-complexity circuit implementations of the oracles assumed in these QLSAs constitute the major bottleneck for practical quantum speed-up in solving linear systems. In this work, we focus on the application of QLSAs for linear systems that are expressed as a low rank tensor sums, which arise in solving discretized PDEs. Previous works uses modified Krylov subspace methods to solve such linear systems with a per-iteration complexity being polylogarithmic of the dimension but with no guarantees on the total convergence cost. We propose a quantum algorithm based on the recent advances on adiabatic-inspired QLSA and perform a detailed analysis of the circuit depth of its implementation. We rigorously show that the total complexity of our implementation is polylogarithmic in the dimension, which is comparable to the per-iteration complexity of the classical heuristic methods.</description>

      <title>Parallel performance of shared memory parallel spectral deferred corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate parallel performance of parallel spectral deferred corrections, a numerical approach that provides small-scale parallelism for the numerical solution of initial value problems. The scheme is applied to the shallow water equation and uses an IMEX splitting that integrates fast modes implicitly and slow modes explicitly in order to be efficient. We describe parallel $\texttt{OpenMP}$-based implementations of parallel SDC in two well established simulation codes: the finite volume based operational ocean model $\texttt{ICON-O}$ and the spherical harmonics based research code $\texttt{SWEET}$. The implementations are benchmarked on a single node of the JUSUF ($\texttt{SWEET}$) and JUWELS ($\texttt{ICON-O}$) system at J\"ulich Supercomputing Centre. We demonstrate a reduction of time-to-solution across a range of accuracies. For $\texttt{ICON-O}$, we show speedup over the currently used Adams--Bashforth-2 integrator with $\texttt{OpenMP}$ loop parallelization. For $\texttt{SWEET}$, we show speedup over serial spectral deferred corrections and a second order implicit-explicit integrator.</description>

      <title>Accurate Block Quantization in LLMs with Outliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The demand for inference on extremely large scale LLMs has seen enormous growth in the recent months. It made evident the colossal shortage of dedicated hardware capable of efficient and fast processing of the involved compute and memory movement. The problem is aggravated by the exploding raise in the lengths of the sequences being processed, since those require efficient on-chip storage of the KV-cache of size proportional to the sequence length. To make the required compute feasible and fit the involved data into available memory, numerous quantization techniques have been proposed that allow accurate quantization for both weights and activations. One of the main recent breakthroughs in this direction was introduction of the family of Block Floating Point (BFP) formats characterized by a block of mantissas with a shared scale factor. These enable memory- power-, and compute- efficient hardware support of the tensor operations and provide extremely good quantization accuracy. The main issues preventing widespread application of block formats is caused by the presence of outliers in weights and activations since those affect the accuracy of the other values in the same block. In this paper, we focus on the most critical problem of limited KV-cache storage. We propose a novel approach enabling usage of low precision BFP formats without compromising the resulting model accuracy. We exploit the common channel-wise patterns exhibited by the outliers to rearrange them in such a way, that their quantization quality is significantly improved. The methodology yields 2x savings in the memory footprint without significant degradation of the model's accuracy. Importantly, the rearrangement of channels happens at the compile time and thus has no impact on the inference latency.</description>

      <title>Designing Poisson Integrators Through Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a general method to construct Poisson integrators, i.e., integrators that preserve the underlying Poisson geometry. We assume the Poisson manifold is integrable, meaning there is a known local symplectic groupoid for which the Poisson manifold serves as the set of units. Our constructions build upon the correspondence between Poisson diffeomorphisms and Lagrangian bisections, which allows us to reformulate the design of Poisson integrators as solutions to a certain PDE (Hamilton-Jacobi). The main novelty of this work is to understand the Hamilton-Jacobi PDE as an optimization problem, whose solution can be easily approximated using machine learning related techniques. This research direction aligns with the current trend in the PDE and machine learning communities, as initiated by Physics- Informed Neural Networks, advocating for designs that combine both physical modeling (the Hamilton-Jacobi PDE) and data.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Combinatorial Potential and Applicability of Random Equation Systems with Mixture Models in a Bayesian Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigating solutions of nonlinear equation systems is challenging in a general framework, especially if the equations contain uncertainties about parameters modeled by probability densities. Such random equations, understood as stationary (non-dynamical) equations with parameters as random variables, have a long history and a broad range of applications. In this work, we study nonlinear random equations by combining them with mixture model parameter random variables in order to investigate the combinatorial complexity of such equations and how this can be utilized practically. We derive a general likelihood function and posterior density of approximate best fit solutions while avoiding significant restrictions about the type of nonlinearity or mixture models, and demonstrate their numerically efficient application for the applied researcher. In the results section we are specifically focusing on example simulations of approximate likelihood/posterior solutions for random linear equation systems, nonlinear systems of random conic section equations, as well as applications to portfolio optimization, stochastic control and random matrix theory in order to show the wide applicability of the presented methodology.</description>

      <title>An ordinary differential equation for entropic optimal transport and its linearly constrained variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the solution to the entropically regularized optimal transport problem by a well-posed ordinary differential equation (ODE). Our approach works for discrete marginals and general cost functions, and in addition to two marginal problems, applies to multi-marginal problems and those with additional linear constraints. Solving the ODE gives a new numerical method to solve the optimal transport problem, which has the advantage of yielding the solution for all intermediate values of the ODE parameter (which is equivalent to the usual regularization parameter). We illustrate this method with several numerical simulations. The formulation of the ODE also allows one to compute derivatives of the optimal cost when the ODE parameter is $0$, corresponding to the fully regularized limit problem in which only the entropy is minimized.</description>

Abstract: We propose a monotone splitting algorithm for solving a class of second-order non-potential mean-field games. Following [Achdou, Capuzzo-Dolcetta, "Mean Field Games: Numerical Methods," SINUM (2010)], we introduce a finite-difference scheme and observe that the scheme represents first-order optimality conditions for a primal-dual pair of monotone inclusions. Based on this observation, we prove that the finite-difference system obtains a solution that can be provably recovered by an extension of the celebrated primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) algorithm.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework for solving high-dimensional partial integro-differential equations (PIDEs) based on the temporal difference learning. We introduce a set of Levy processes and construct a corresponding reinforcement learning model. To simulate the entire process, we use deep neural networks to represent the solutions and non-local terms of the equations. Subsequently, we train the networks using the temporal difference error, termination condition, and properties of the non-local terms as the loss function. The relative error of the method reaches O(10^{-3}) in 100-dimensional experiments and O(10^{-4}) in one-dimensional pure jump problems. Additionally, our method demonstrates the advantages of low computational cost and robustness, making it well-suited for addressing problems with different forms and intensities of jumps.</description>

Abstract: This work is concerned with the recovery of piecewise constant images from noisy linear measurements. We study the noise robustness of a variational reconstruction method, which is based on total (gradient) variation regularization. We show that, if the unknown image is the superposition of a few simple shapes, and if a non-degenerate source condition holds, then, in the low noise regime, the reconstructed images have the same structure: they are the superposition of the same number of shapes, each a smooth deformation of one of the unknown shapes. Moreover, the reconstructed shapes and the associated intensities converge to the unknown ones as the noise goes to zero.</description>

      <title>A simple and efficient convex optimization based bound-preserving high order accurate limiter for Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For time-dependent PDEs, the numerical schemes can be rendered bound-preserving without losing conservation and accuracy, by a post processing procedure of solving a constrained minimization in each time step. Such a constrained optimization can be formulated as a nonsmooth convex minimization, which can be efficiently solved by first order optimization methods, if using the optimal algorithm parameters. By analyzing the asymptotic linear convergence rate of the generalized Douglas-Rachford splitting method, optimal algorithm parameters can be approximately expressed as a simple function of the number of out-of-bounds cells. We demonstrate the efficiency of this simple choice of algorithm parameters by applying such a limiter to cell averages of a discontinuous Galerkin scheme solving phase field equations for 3D demanding problems. Numerical tests on a sophisticated 3D Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes system indicate that the limiter is high order accurate, very efficient, and well-suited for large-scale simulations. For each time step, it takes at most $20$ iterations for the Douglas-Rachford splitting to enforce bounds and conservation up to the round-off error, for which the computational cost is at most $80N$ with $N$ being the total number of cells.</description>

      <title>Locating the roots of a quadratic equation in one variable through a Line-Circumference (LC) geometric construction in the plane of complex numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper describes a geometrical method for finding the roots $r_1$, $r_2$ of a quadratic equation in one complex variable of the form $x^2+c_1 x+c_2=0$, by means of a Line $L$ and a Circumference $C$ in the complex plane, constructed from known coefficients $c_1$, $c_2$. This Line-Circumference (LC) geometric structure contains the sought roots $r_1$, $r_2$ at the intersections of its component elements $L$ and $C$. Line $L$ is mapped onto Circumference $C$ by a Mobius transformation. The location and inclination angle of $L$ can be computed directly from coefficients $c_1$, $c_2$, while $C$ is constructed by dividing the constant term $c_2$ by each point from $L$. This paper describes the technical details for the quadratic LC method, and then shows how the quadratic LC method works through a numerical example. The quadratic LC method described here, although more elaborate than the traditional quadratic formula, can be extended to find initial approximations to the roots of polynomials in one variable of degree $n \geq 3$. As an additional feature, this paper also studies an interesting property of the rectilinear segments connecting key points in a quadratic LC structure.</description>

      <title>Analysis and numerical simulation of a generalized compressible Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes model with friction effects</title>

Abstract: We propose a new generalized compressible diphasic Navier-Stokes Cahn-Hilliard model that we name G-NSCH. This new G-NSCH model takes into account important properties of diphasic compressible fluids such as possible non-matching densities and contrast in mechanical properties (viscosity, friction) between the two phases of the fluid. the model also comprises a term to account for possible exchange of mass between the two phases. Our G-NSCH system is derived rigorously and satisfies basic mechanics of fluids and thermodynamics of particles. Under some simplifying assumptions, we prove the existence of global weak solutions. We also propose a structure preserving numerical scheme based on the scalar auxiliary variable method to simulate our system and present some numerical simulations validating the properties of the numerical scheme and illustrating the solutions of the G-NSCH model.</description>

      <title>Energy-consistent integration of mechanical systems based on Livens principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we make use of Livens principle (sometimes also referred to as Hamilton-Pontryagin principle) in order to obtain a novel structure-preserving integrator for mechanical systems. In contrast to the canonical Hamiltonian equations of motion, the Euler-Lagrange equations pertaining to Livens principle circumvent the need to invert the mass matrix. This is an essential advantage with respect to singular mass matrices, which can yield severe difficulties for the modelling and simulation of multibody systems. Moreover, Livens principle unifies both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian viewpoints on mechanics. Additionally, the present framework avoids the need to set up the system's Hamiltonian. The novel scheme algorithmically conserves a general energy function and aims at the preservation of momentum maps corresponding to symmetries of the system. We present an extension to mechanical systems subject to holonomic constraints. The performance of the newly devised method is studied in representative examples.</description>
