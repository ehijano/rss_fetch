      <title>Seesaw relation between the cosmological constant and the Higgs mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the relation $M^*_{Higgs} = ({M_{\Lambda} \ M_{I}})^{\frac{1}{2}}$ where $ M^*_{Higgs}, M_{\Lambda}$ and $M_{I}$ denote the mass scale associated with the Higgs boson, the cosmological constant and the inflaton respectively. We demonstrate how this seesaw-like (geometric mean) relation perfectly matches observations and the unified scenario of holographic constant roll inflation</description>

      <title>Wormhole solutions in generalized Rastall gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we seek for static spherically symmetric solutions representing wormhole configurations in generalized Rastall gravity (GRG). In this theory, a varying coupling parameter could act as dark energy (DE) and thus, it can be considered as responsible for the current accelerated expansion of the universe. We consider an anisotropic energy momentum tensor (EMT) as the supporting source for wormhole structure and further assume that there exists a linear relation between radial and tangential pressures and energy density. We therefore obtain two classes of solutions to the field equations of GRG, including the solutions with zero and nonzero redshift functions. For these solutions we find that the matter distribution obeys the physical reasonability conditions, i.e., the flare-out and the weak (WEC) and null (NEC) energy conditions either at the throat and throughout the spacetime. The conditions on physical reasonability of the wormhole solutions put restrictions on model parameters. Hence, in the framework of GRG, asymptotically flat wormhole configurations can be built without the need of exotic matter. Gravitational lensing effects of the obtained solutions are also discussed and it is found that the throat of wormhole can effectively act as a photon sphere near which the light deflection angle takes arbitrarily large values.</description>

      <title>Observing of background electromagnetic radiation of the real sky through the throat of a wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical investigation conducted in this paper addresses the problem of CMB radiation imaging as seen through the throat of the Ellis-Bronnikov-Morris-Thorne wormhole. It is assumed that both throats of the wormhole are relatively close to our stellar neighborhood, so close that the view of the ambient background radiation by an observer at the other throat of the wormhole is virtually identical to that seen from the Solar System neighborhood. A map of the temperature distribution of the cosmic microwave background radiation observed through the mouth of the wormhole has been constructed as well as a view of the Milky Way through the mouth of the wormhole. The resultant image contains characteristic details that enable it to be distinguished from an image produced by a black hole.</description>

      <title>Effects of the quantum vacuum at a cosmic scale and of dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Einstein equation in a semi-classical approximation is applied to a spherical region of the universe, with the stress-energy tensor consisting of the mass density and pressure of the LambdaCDM cosmological model plus an additional contribution of the quantum vacuum. Expanding the equation in powers of Newton constant G, the vacuum contributes to second order. The result is that at least a part of the acceleration in the expansion of the universe may be due to the quantum vacuum fluctuations</description>

      <title>Late-time tails in nonlinear evolutions of merging black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover late-time gravitational-wave tails in fully nonlinear 3+1 dimensional numerical relativity simulations of merging black holes, using the highly accurate SpEC code. We achieve this result by exploiting the strong magnification of late-time tails due to binary eccentricity, recently observed in perturbative evolutions, and showcase here the tail presence in head-on configurations for several mass ratios close to unity. We validate the result through a large battery of numerical tests and detailed comparison with perturbative evolutions, which display striking agreement with full nonlinear ones. Our results offer yet another confirmation of the highly predictive power of black hole perturbation theory in the presence of a source, even when applied to nonlinear solutions. The late-time tail signal is much more prominent than anticipated until recently, and possibly within reach of gravitational-wave detectors measurements, unlocking observational investigations of an additional set of general relativistic predictions on the long-range gravitational dynamics.</description>

      <title>Nonrelativistic Proca stars: Spherical stationary and multi-frequency states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we follow an effective theory approach to study the nonrelativistic limit of a selfgravitating and selfinteracting massive vector field. Our effective theory is characterized by three parameters: the field's mass $m_0$ and the selfinteraction constants $\lambda_n$ and $\lambda_s$. For definiteness, we focus on a systematic study of the equilibrium configurations, commonly referred to as Proca stars when they have finite energy. We identify two different types of Proca stars, depending on the specific sector of the effective theory that we are exploring. In the generic sector, defined by $\lambda_s\neq 0$, all equilibrium configurations are stationary states described by wave functions that evolve harmonically in time. However, in the symmetry-enhanced sector, for which $\lambda_s=0$, there exist multi-frequency states whose wave functions oscillate with two or three distinct frequencies in addition to the stationary states. We determine the conditions under which a ground state configuration with fixed particle number exists. When these conditions are met, we prove that the lowest energy is reached by a stationary spherically symmetric configuration of constant polarization that is linear or circular depending on the sign of $\lambda_s$. We numerically construct some illustrative examples of spherical stationary and multi-frequency solutions, analyze their properties, and compare them with our analytical predictions. Unlike stationary states and other soliton configurations, which form a discrete set in the solution space associated with fixed particle number, the symmetry-enhanced sector exhibits a continuum of solutions with multi-frequency states connecting stationary states of constant polarization.</description>

      <title>Merging black holes with Cauchy-characteristic matching: Computation of late-time tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present successful evolutions of binary black hole mergers using a novel numerical-relativity technique known as Cauchy-characteristic matching (CCM). This approach eliminates systematic errors associated with boundary conditions, effectively extending the computational domain to infinity. As an important application, we use CCM to resolve a late-time power-law tail in the gravitational wave from a head-on collision, and show that the tail is highly suppressed in a quasi-circular binary. Our results for the two extreme cases (orbital eccentricity $=0,1$) support the fact that tails increase with orbital eccentricity. Therefore, CCM paves the way for a detailed understanding of tails in eccentric systems. For the head-on case, we find that the tail behavior is consistent with predictions in the intermediate regime from black hole linear perturbation theory. However, we also raise the possibility that the power-law tail could be generated nonlinearly by quasinormal modes. The nonlinear contribution is expected to decay slower than predicted by Price's law, potentially dominating the signal at late times. If confirmed as nonlinear, this would be an example where nonlinearity prevails over linearity in the late-time regime of black hole dynamics.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the relationship of black-hole kicks and multipole asymmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precession in black-hole binaries is caused by a misalignment between the total spin and the orbital angular momentum. The gravitational-wave emission of such systems is anisotropic, which leads to an asymmetry in the $\pm m$ multipoles when decomposed into a spherical harmonic basis. This asymmetric emission can impart a kick to the merger remnant black hole as a consequence of linear momentum conservation. Despite the astrophysical importance of kicks, multipole asymmetries contribute very little to the overall signal strength and, therefore, the majority of current gravitational-wave models do not include them. Recent efforts have been made to include asymmetries in waveform models. However, those efforts focus on capturing finer features of precessing waveforms without making explicit considerations of remnant kick velocities. Here we close that gap and present a comprehensive analysis of the linear momentum flux expressed in terms of multipole asymmetries. As expected, large asymmetries are needed to achieve the largest kick velocities. Interestingly, the same large asymmetries may lead to negligible kick velocities if the antisymmetric and symmetric waveform parts are perpendicular to each other around merger. We also present a phenomenological tool for testing the performance of waveform models with multipole asymmetries. This tool helped us to fix an inconsistency in the phase definition of the IMRPhenomXO4a waveform model.</description>

      <title>NRSurNN3dq4: A Deep Learning Powered Numerical Relativity Surrogate for Binary Black Hole Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave approximants are widely used tools in gravitational-wave astronomy. They allow for dense coverage of the parameter space of binary black hole (BBH) mergers for purposes of parameter inference, or, more generally, match filtering tasks, while avoiding the computationally expensive full evolution of numerical relativity simulations. However, this comes at a slight cost in terms of accuracy when compared to numerical relativity waveforms, depending on the approach. One way to minimize this is by constructing so-called~\textit{surrogate models} which, instead of using approximate physics or phenomenological formulae, rather interpolate within the space of numerical relativity waveforms. In this work, we introduce~\texttt{NRSurNN3dq4}, a surrogate model for non-precessing BBH merger waveforms powered by neural networks. By relying on the power of deep learning, this approximant is remarkably fast and competitively accurate, as it can generate millions of waveforms in a tenth of a second, while mismatches with numerical relativity waveforms are restrained below $10^{-3}$. We implement this approximant within the~\textsc{bilby} framework for gravitational-wave parameter inference, and show that it it is suitable for parameter estimation tasks.</description>

      <title>Non-Vacuum Solutions in Cotton Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cotton theory (CT) introduces a higher derivative extension of General Relativity (GR) characterized by third-rank field equations. Recently, key distinctions between CT and GR concerning wave and vacuum solutions have been highlighted in [1, 2]. In this study, two particular non-vacuum solutions of CT are investigated within its Codazzi formulation. The motivation is to reveal how this theory might account for or adapt to the effects of non-vacuum sources, and whether it can provide new insights into the behavior of both singular and regular black holes in astrophysical contexts. It is shown that CT generalizes the Kiselev and Dymnikova solutions in GR. Some aspects of the generalized solutions, in particular concerning singularities, thermodynamics, and geodesics, are addressed in comparison to GR.</description>

      <title>Scalar-tensor Baryogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a baryogenesis mechanism termed scalar-tensor baryogenesis, analogous to gravitational and spontaneous baryogenesis, driven by scalar fields arising from the scalar-tensor representation of modified gravity theories. This mechanism reproduces the original interaction term of gravitational baryogenesis and those commonly introduced in modified gravity contexts. We demonstrate the mechanism within $f(R,T)$ and $f(R)$ gravity frameworks, focusing on $f(R)$. We explore a quintessence potential given by $V(\phi) = \alpha \frac{\phi^{m+1}}{{m+1}}$ and a potential given $V(\phi) = \beta^{-\frac{1}{n-1}}(n-1)\left(\frac{\phi - 1}{n}\right)^{\frac{n}{n-1}}$ that corresponds in the geometric representation to models of the form $R + \beta R^n$. The model with $n=2$ presented the best behavior in generating an acceptable asymmetry during the radiation-dominated epoch. Inspired by this result, employing Planck data, we explored the Starobinsky inflation model obtaining successful baryogenesis during the inflationary epoch for both gravitational and scalar-tensor baryogenesis.</description>

      <title>Searching for the classical analogue of Hawking radiation and screening of Coulomb field by the horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of the existence of a classical analogue of Hawking radiation -- solutions to classical field equations that consist solely of outgoing waves, in the spacetime of a collapsing black hole. The non-static nature of the corresponding metric results in the absence of energy conservation for matter, which could otherwise a priori prohibit such solutions. A specific and simple scenario is considered: a black hole formation as a result of the collapse of a thin shell, which is not necessarily dust-like. In the corresponding spacetime, we study solutions of the equations for a real massless scalar field that take the form of purely outgoing waves. In addition to the homogeneous equation, we also examine the case of a constant point source of the field located at the symmetry center. The general solution outside the shell is expressed in terms of the confluent Heun function, while the equations inside the shell and the matching conditions at its surface are formulated as an integral equation. The analysis of various solution asymptotics enables the reduction of the integral equation to a matrix equation, which is subsequently solved numerically.</description>

      <title>Gravitational focusing and horizon entropy for higher-spin fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previously, the Raychaudhuri equation and the focusing theorem in General Relativity were generalised to diffeomorphism-invariant theories of gravity coupled to scalar and vector fields on linearly perturbed Killing horizons. The Wall entropy can be extracted from the generalised focusing equation and it satisfies the first and the second laws of thermodynamics. In this paper, we further extend the discussion of gravitational focusing on the horizon to include arbitrary bosonic fields with spin $s \geq 2$. These higher-spin fields introduce indefinite terms into the generalised focusing equation, obstructing the proof of the focusing theorem and the existence of an increasing horizon entropy. To resolve this issue, we propose a higher-spin focusing condition that eliminates these indefinite terms, thereby restoring the focusing theorem and the associated thermodynamic laws. We speculate that the focusing condition could be a necessary condition for the physical consistency of higher-spin theories.</description>

      <title>Probing black holes via quasinormal modes in a dark energy-induced dark matter halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into the existence of dark matter halo around supermassive black holes in galactic cores using a novel gravitational model. By analyzing gravitational waves emitted during the ringdown phase of black holes under different field perturbations, we explore the potential for detecting dark matter halos. The model hypothesizes that the dark matter distribution around black hole is driven by a mechanism where dark energy endows gravitons with mass, thereby forming a new spacetime structure. Results reveal that as relevant parameters increase, the quasinormal modes (QNMs) exhibit a gradual reduction in real parts, with negative imaginary parts whose absolute values also decrease. Moreover, compared to gravitational wave signals from Schwarzschild black hole without dark matter halos, this system demonstrates significant differences in oscillation modes and frequencies. This achievement not only validates the self-consistency of the new gravitational model but also lays a theoretical foundation for subsequent gravitational wave detection within dark matter halo. Simultaneously, it provides new theoretical support for understanding the mechanism of dark energy in large-scale cosmic structures and broadens the research perspective on the relationships between black hole physics, dark matter, and dark energy.</description>

      <title>Vacuum polarization around cosmic strings in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic strings are the most popular topological defects arising from the spontaneous breaking of fundamental symmetries in the early Universe. They are the source of a number of interesting effects in cosmology and astrophysics. An interesting effect is the polarization of the vacuum state for quantum fields induced by the non-trivial topology of the spacetime around cosmic strings. In the present paper we describe the combined effects of the straight cosmic string and the gravitational field on the local properties of scalar, spinor and electromagnetic vacua. The local de Sitter spacetime is considered as the background geometry. It is shown that the influence of the spacetime curvature is essential at distances from the string of the order of or larger than the curvature radius.

      <title>Wormhole Solutions in deformed space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct and analyse wormhole solutions in quantised space-time. The field equations are constructed from the deformed wormhole metric in the proper reference frame using tetrads. The spatial geometry of the wormhole is analysed in the kappa space-time. Further, the modifications to the conditions that ensure traversibility of the wormhole are studied and it is found that the necessity of the exotic matter persists in the non-commuative case as in the commutative space-time. Casimir energy is considered a possible source for exotic matter and it is shown that the time to pass through the wormhole as well as the amount of exotic matter required to create the wormhole reduce due to non-commutativity of space-time.</description>

      <title>Ultra-compact Objects of Non-minimally Coupled Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of a collisionless dark matter fluid which is non-minimally coupled to gravity, we investigate the existence and properties of static, spherically symmetric solutions of the general relativistic field equations. We show that the non-minimal coupling originates an (anisotropic) pressure able to counteract gravity and to allow the formation of regular, horizonless ultra-compact objects of dark matter (NMC-UCOs). We then analyze the orbits of massive and massless particles in the gravitational field of NMC-UCOs, providing some specific example and a general discussion in terms of phase portraits. Finally, we study the gravitational lensing effects around NMC-UCOs, and effectively describe these in terms of a pseudo-shadow.</description>

      <title>Charged black holes in Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity: An in-depth analysis of the structure of spacetime geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus upon the behaviour of spacetime of charged black holes described by Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) gravity. With a static and spherically symmetric metric, we solve the ensuing field equations obtained from the EiBI-Maxwell action in the Palatini formalism. Consequently we carry out, for the first time, an in-depth analysis of the structure of spacetime geometry in several regions of the charged EiBI black hole. In particular, we consider the analytical behaviours of the metric coefficients and the Kretschmann scalar by probing their asymptotic nature {\em analytically} in different regions of the black hole spacetime, such as, near the center, in the intermediate region, and near the horizon, for both positive and negative EiBI coupling. These analyses give a thorough understanding of the nature of spacetime of EiBI-Maxwell black holes. In order to aide our understanding further, we solve the EiBI-Maxwell field equation numerically with different values of the parameters involved. We find close agreement between the analytical behaviours and those obtained from numerical integration of the EiBI-Maxwell field equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain walls represent two-dimensional topological defects that emerge from the spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries in various new physics models. In this study, we undertake the first calculation of gravitational waves produced by scalar perturbations generated from the domain wall network. Our findings indicate that the gravitational wave spectrum is notably distinct from that of other sources. This opens up a promising avenue for future gravitational wave experiments aimed at exploring the role of domain walls in the early Universe. Our results could significantly enhance the capabilities of gravitational wave experiments, serving as a valuable method for testing new physics and better identifying diverse sources of gravitational waves.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend recent work on quantum geodesics on the Heisenberg algebra for flat spacetime to quantum geodesics on the algebra $D(M)$ of differential operators on a Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifold $M$. The required differential structure has a hidden non-associativity for the product of 1-forms with functions at order $\hbar^2$ due the Riemann curvature, i.e. in the presence of gravity, which is not visible at the operator level. The calculus commutation relations involve the Ricci curvature. As an application, the case of $M$ spacetime provides a new approach to general relativistic quantum mechanics on curved spacetime, with an operator version of the geodesic equations in the Heisenberg picture. In the case of a static metric, there is an effective Schroedinger-like equation with an induced potential depending on the energy with respect to coordinate time. The case of $M$ a Schwarzschild black hole is exhibited in detail and the black-hole gravatom is solved. It is found that its eigenfunctions exhibit probability density banding of a fractal nature approaching the horizon.</description>

      <title>Revisiting holographic dark energy from the perspective of multi-messenger gravitational wave astronomy: future joint observations with short gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors opens new opportunities for multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star merger events, holding significant potential for probing the history of cosmic expansion. In this paper, we investigate the holographic dark energy (HDE) model by using the future GW standard siren data observed from the 3G GW detectors and the short $\gamma$-ray burst THESEUS-like detector joint observations. We find that GW data alone can achieve a relatively precise estimation of the Hubble constant, with precision of $0.2\%$-$0.6\%$, but its ability to constrain other cosmological parameters remains limited. Nonetheless, since the GW data can break parameter degeneracies generated by the mainstream EM observations, CMB + BAO + SN (CBS), GW standard sirens play a crucial role in enhancing the accuracy of parameter estimation. With the addition of GW data to CBS, the constraints on cosmological parameters $H_0$, $c$ and $\Omega_{\rm{m}}$ can be improved by $63\%$-$88\%$, $27\%$-$44\%$ and $55\%$-$70\%$. In summary, observations of GW standard sirens from 3G GW detectors could be pivotal in helping solve the Hubble tension and probe the fundamental nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Counting microstates of out-of-equilibrium black hole fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct and count the microstates of out-of-equilibrium eternal AdS black holes in which a shell carrying an order one fraction of the black hole mass is emitted from the past horizon and re-absorbed at the future horizon. Our microstates have semiclassical interpretations in terms of matter propagating behind the horizon. We show that they span a Hilbert space with a dimension equal to the exponential of the horizon area of the intermediate black hole. This is consistent with the idea that, in a non-equilibrium setting, entropy is the logarithm of the number of microscopic configurations consistent with the dynamical macroscopic state. In our case, therefore, the entropy should measure the number of microstates consistent with a large and atypical macroscopic black hole fluctuation due to which part of the early time state becomes fully known to an external observer.</description>

      <title>Causality bounds from charged shockwaves in 5d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective field theories are constrained by the requirement that their constituents never move superluminally on non-trivial backgrounds. In this paper, we study time delays experienced by photons propagating on charged shockwave backgrounds in five dimensions. In the absence of gravity -- where the shockwaves are electric fields sourced by boosted charges -- we derive positivity bounds for the four-derivative corrections to electromagnetism, reproducing previous results derived from scattering amplitudes. By considering the gravitational shockwaves sourced by Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes, we derive new constraints in the presence of gravity. We observe the by-now familiar weakening of positivity bounds in the presence of gravity, but without the logarithmic divergences present in 4d. We find that the strongest bounds appear by examining the time delay near the horizon of the smallest possible black hole, and discuss on the validity of the EFT expansion in this region. We comment on our bounds in the context of the swampland program as well as their relation with the positivity bounds obtained from dispersion relations.</description>

      <title>Do we owe our existence to a Gravitational Anomaly?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I review a mechanism for a potential explanation of the dominance of matter over antimatter in the Universe (``our existence''), based on a (3+1)-dimensional string-inspired cosmological model, characterised by (uncancelled) gravitational Chern-Simons (gCS) anomalies in the premordial epochs. The model is consistent with general covariance but entails spontaneous Lorentz (LV) and CPT Violation (CPTV), due to appropriate backgrounds of axion fields, which couple to the anomaly terms. Upon condensation of the gCS terms, due to primordial gravitational waves, these axions acquire a linear potential, which drives inflation of a Running-Vacuum-Model (RVM) type, while the effective action is also characterised by imaginary parts as well, which imply metastability of this RVM inflation. The axion backgrounds remain undiluted until the exit from inflation, and are responsible for yielding unconventional LV and CPTV Leptogenesis, which is then communicated to the baryon sector (Baryogenesis) via sphaleron processes. The model provides a phenomenologically consistent cosmological evolution from inflation till the modern era.</description>

      <title>The Born approximation in wave optics gravitational lensing revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves provides us with much information about the Universe, including the dark matter distribution at small scales. The information about lensed gravitational waves is encapsulated by an amplification factor, which is calculated by an integration of an oscillatory function. The Born approximation, which has been studied in terms of wave optics in gravitational lensing, may provide a means of overcoming the difficulty in evaluating the oscillating function and better understanding the connection between the amplification factor and the lens mass distribution. In this paper, we revisit the Born approximation for a single lens plane. We find that the distortion of gravitational waves induced by wave optics gravitational lensing is in general connected with the mass distribution of the lens object through a convolution integral, where the scale of the kernel is determined by the Fresnel scale. We then study the validivity and accuracy of the Born approximation specifically for the case of a point mass lens for which the exact analytical expression of the amplicfication factor is available. Using the dimensionless parameter $y$, which represents the normalized impact parameter, and the dimensionless parameter $w$, which denotes the normalized frequency, we show that the $n$-th term of the Born approximation scales as $y^{-2}w^{n-1}$. This indicates that, for the case of a point mass lens, the Born approximation is valid when $w$ is less than 1, with its accuracy scaling as $wy^{-2}$ in this regime.</description>

      <title>Impact of spatial curvature on forecast constraints from standard and differential redshift drift measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The redshift drift of objects following the cosmological expansion is a unique model-independent probe of background cosmology, detectable by astrophysical facilities presently under construction. Previous forecasts for such measurements assume flat universes. We explore the impact of relaxing this assumption on the constraining power of the redshift drift, focusing on the two most promising routes for its measurement: the SKA at low redshifts, and the Golden Sample for the ELT's ANDES spectrograph at higher redshifts. We also discuss the cosmological sensitivity of possible differential redshift drift measurements, both on their own and, for the specific case of the Golden Sample, in combination with the standard method. Overall, we find that the sensitivity of the redshift drift to curvature is comparable to that of matter (especially at low redshifts) and higher than the sensitivity to the dark energy equation of state. We also show that the sensitivity of redshift drift measurements to these cosmological parameters is asymmetric with respect to the curvature parameter, being different for open and closed universes with the same absolute value of the curvature parameter $\Omega_k$.</description>

      <title>Detection and parameter estimation of supermassive black hole ringdown signals using a pulsar timing array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) searches using pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are commonly assumed to be limited to a GW frequency of $\lesssim 4\times 10^{-7}$Hz given by the Nyquist rate associated with the average observational cadence of $2$ weeks for a single pulsar. However, by taking advantage of asynchronous observations of multiple pulsars, a PTA can detect GW signals at higher frequencies. This allows a sufficiently large PTA to detect and characterize the ringdown signals emitted following the merger of supermassive binary black holes (SMBBHs), leading to stringent tests of the no-hair theorem in the mass range of such systems. Such large-scale PTAs are imminent with the advent of the FAST telescope and the upcoming era of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA). To scope out the data analysis challenges involved in such a search, we propose a likelihood-based method coupled with Particle Swarm Optimization and apply it to a simulated large-scale PTA comprised of $100$ pulsars, each having a timing residual noise standard deviation of $100$~nsec, with randomized observation times. Focusing on the dominant $(2,2)$ mode of the ringdown signal, we show that it is possible to achieve a $99\%$ detection probability with a false alarm probability below $0.2\%$ for an optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $&gt;10$. This corresponds, for example, to an equal-mass non-spinning SMBBH with an observer frame chirp mass $M_c = 9.52\times10^{9}M_{\odot}$ at a luminosity distance of $D_L = 420$ Mpc.</description>

      <title>New Constraints on Lorentz Invariance Violation at High Redshifts from Multiband of GRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the gravity quantum theory, the quantization of spacetime may lead to the modification of the dispersion relation between the energy and the momentum and the Lorentz invariance violation (LIV). High energy and long-distance gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) observations in the universe provide a unique opportunity to test the possibility of LIV. In this paper, by using 93 time delay GRBs covering the redshift range of $0.117 &lt; z &lt; 6.29$, we present a new idea of using cosmological model-independent (based on the luminosity distance data from 174 GRBs) to test the LIV. Combining the observation data from multiband of GRBs provides us with an opportunity to mitigate the potential systematic errors arising from variations in the physical characteristics among diverse object populations, and to add a higher redshift dataset for testing the energy-dependent velocity caused by the corrected dispersion relationship of photons. These robust limits of the energy scale for the linear and quadratic LIV effects are $E_{QG,1} \ge 1.40\times 10^{15}$ GeV, and $E_{QG,2} \ge 8.18\times 10^{9}$ GeV, respectively. It exhibits a significantly reduced value compared to the energy scale of Planck in both scenarios of linear and quadratic LIV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present and classify the supersymmetric extensions of extended kinematical algebras, at the basis of non-Lorentzian physics theories. The diverse kinematical superalgebras are here derived by applying non- and ultra-relativistic expansion procedures involving different semigroups. We then build three-dimensional Chern-Simons non-Lorentzian supergravity theories based on such (extended) kinematical superalgebras, providing the supersymmetry transformation laws of the fields and the field equations of the models, which correspond to the vanishing of the curvature two-forms. In fact, the expansion procedure adopted allows to automatically end up with a non-degenerate bilinear invariant trace for the (extended) kinematical superalgebras. The latter is a crucial ingredient of the Chern-Simons field-theoretical formulation, as it allows to include a kinetic term for each gauge field of the theory, implying the vanishing of the curvature two-forms as field equations.</description>

      <title>The unexpected shape of the primordial black hole mass function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a Universe with nearly-Gaussian initial curvature perturbations, the abundance of primordial black holes can be derived from the curvature power spectrum. When the latter is enhanced within a narrow range around a characteristic scale, the resulting mass function has a single distinct peak, corresponding to Schwarzschild radii set by the horizon entry time of that scale. In contrast, we show (both numerically and by providing an analytic estimation) that a broad enhancement - such as a plateau bounded by infrared and ultraviolet scales - produces a bimodal mass function, with a primary peak close to the infrared scale. We find that the typical initial gravitational potential (compaction function), conditioned on meeting the threshold for critical collapse, is generated by a thin spherical shell with infrared radius and a thickness comparable to the ultraviolet scale. This suggests a higher-than-expected abundance of PBH originating from Type II initial fluctuations. Our results significantly impact overproduction bounds on the amplitude of the power spectrum, and tighten the viable mass range for primordial black holes as dark matter.</description>

      <title>Improving the detection sensitivity to primordial stochastic gravitational waves with reduced astrophysical foregrounds -- II: subthreshold binary neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) consist of a primordial component from early Universe processes and an astrophysical component from compact binary mergers. To detect the primordial stochastic GW background (SGWB), the astrophysical foregrounds must be reduced to high precision, which is achievable for third-generation (3G) ground based GW detectors. Previous studies have shown that the foreground from individually detectable merger events can be reduced with fractional residual energy density below $10^{-3}$, and the residual foreground from subthreshold binary neutron stars (BNSs) will be the bottleneck if not be well cleaned. In this work, we propose that the foreground energy density of subthreshold BNSs $\Omega_{\rm sub}$ can be estimated via a population based approach from the individually detectable BNSs utilizing the isotropic orbital orientations of all BNSs, i.e., uniform distribution in $\cos\iota$, where $\iota$ is the BNS inclination angle with respect to the line of sight. Using this approach, we find $\Omega_{\rm sub}$ can be measured with percent-level uncertainty, assuming $O(10^5)$ individually detected BNSs in our simulations. This method represents a promising approach to tackling the foreground cleaning problem.</description>

      <title>The extension of Schwarzschild line element to include uniformly accelerated mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the spacetime geometry due to a Schwarzschild object having uniform accelerated motion. In the beginning, we investigate the gravitational field due to a uniformly moving Schwarzschild object and obtain the spacetime line element for such an object. After analyzing the necessary boundary conditions, the obtained line element is found to be consistent. Next, we extend our work to a uniformly accelerated Schwarzschild object. In that case, we obtain the spacetime line element for both when the acceleration is along the $X-$direction and when the acceleration is in an arbitrary direction on the $XY$ plane. The boundary conditions of those line elements have been examined. Such work will have immense applications in astrophysics when we calculate the geodesic equations of test particles in the gravitational field of objects having uniform accelerated motion.</description>

      <title>Efficient Massive Black Hole Binary parameter estimation for LISA using Sequential Neural Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inspiral, merger, and ringdown of Massive Black Hole Binaries (MBHBs) is one the main sources of Gravitational Waves (GWs) for the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), an ESA-led mission in the implementation phase. It is expected that LISA will detect these systems throughout the entire observable universe. Robust and efficient data analysis algorithms are necessary to detect and estimate physical parameters for these systems. In this work, we explore the application of Sequential Neural Likelihood, a simulation-based inference algorithm, to detect and characterize MBHB GW signals in synthetic LISA data. We describe in detail the different elements of the method, their performance and possible alternatives that can be used to enhance the performance. Instead of sampling from the conventional likelihood function, which requires a forward simulation for each evaluation, this method constructs a surrogate likelihood that is ultimately described by a neural network trained from a dataset of simulations of the MBHB signals and noise. One important advantage of this method is that, given that the likelihood is independent of the priors, we can iteratively train models that target specific observations in a fraction of the time and computational cost that other traditional and machine learning-based strategies would require. Because of the iterative nature of the method, we are able to train models to obtain qualitatively similar posteriors with less than 2\% of the simulator calls that Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods would require. We compare these posteriors with those obtained from Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques and discuss the differences that appear, in particular in relation with the important role that data compression has in the modular implementation of the method that we present.</description>

      <title>$f(Q,L_m)$ gravity, and its cosmological implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we extend the $f(Q)$ symmetric teleparallel gravity by introducing an arbitrary coupling between the non-metricity $Q$ and matter Lagrangian $L_m$ in the Lagrangian density $f$ of the theory, which thus leads to the $f\left(Q,L_m\right)$ theory. This generalisation encompasses Coincident General Relativity (CGR), and the Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent to GR (STEGR). Using the metric formalism, we derive the field equation of the theory, which generalizes the field equations of $f(Q)$ gravity. From the study of the covariant divergence of the field equations, it follows that the presence of the geometry-matter coupling leads to the non-conservation of the matter energy-momentum tensor. The cosmological implications of the theory are investigated in the case of a flat, homogeneous, and isotropic Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker geometry. As a first step in this direction, we obtain the modified Friedmann equations for the $f(Q,L_m)$ gravity in a general form. Specific cosmological models are investigated for several choices of $f(Q,L_m)$, including $f(Q,L_m)=-\alpha Q + 2L_m + \beta$, and $f(Q,L_m)=- \alpha Q + (2L_m)^2 + \beta$, respectively. Comparative analyses with the standard $\Lambda$ CDM paradigm are carried out, and the observational implications of the models are investigated in detail.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on generic models of non-minimal curvature-matter coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate two classes of non-minimally coupled curvature-matter models in the FLRW universe with a perfect fluid and analyze their cosmological implications using Supernova Ia, Observed Hubble Data, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements. Non-minimal coupling is introduced via an additional term $\int d^4x \sqrt{-g} \mathcal{G}({\cal L}_{m}) f_2(R)$ in the Einstein-Hilbert action. To obtain observational constraints, we use an exponential-type fluid-pressure profile $p = p_0e^{ak}$ characterized by the dimensionless parameter $k$ and parameterize $f_2(R)$ as $R^n$ with another dimensionless parameter $n$. Two additional parameters, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in the functional form of $\mathcal{G}({\cal L}_{m})$ determine the coupling strength. We identify significant regions in the $(n, k)$-parameter space for fixed coupling strength values where non-minimally coupled models align with observed late-time cosmic evolution. Additionally, we explore and discuss features of energy transfer between the curvature and matter sectors using observational data.</description>

      <title>A novel probe of graviton dispersion relations at nano-Hertz frequencies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalise Phinney's 'practical theorem' to account for modified graviton dispersion relations motivated by certain cosmological scenarios. Focusing on specific examples, we show how such modifications can induce characteristic localised distortions, bumps, in the frequency profile of the stochastic gravitational wave background emitted from distant binary sources. We concentrate on gravitational waves at nano-Hertz frequencies probed by pulsar timing arrays, and we forecast the capabilities of future experiments to accurately probe parameters controlling modified dispersion relations. Our predictions are based on properties of gravitational waves emitted in the first inspiral phase of the binary process, and do not rely on assumptions of non-linear effects occurring during the binary merging phase</description>

      <title>Black holes of type D revisited: relating their various metric forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a complete family of spacetimes which represent black holes with rotation, NUT twist, acceleration, electric and magnetic charges. These are exact solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations with any cosmological constant, such that the (non-null) electromagnetic field is aligned with both the double-degenerate principal null directions of the Weyl tensor. In particular, we explicitly relate various coordinates and the corresponding physical parameters of such solutions, namely the original Plebanski-Demianski (PD) form, the convenient Astorino (A) form which was found recently, and formally improved here (A+), the Griffiths-Podolsky (GP), and Podolsky-Vratny (PV) form of the metric. It is demonstrated that, if properly mapped and physically interpreted, all these representations cover the complete class of type D black holes. Using the new A-parameters, the two main PD quartic metric functions are factorized into the product of quadratic expressions, enabling thus an explicit analysis. Moreover, we clarify the role of the twist parameter $\omega$, related to both the Kerr-like rotation and the NUT parameters $a$ and $l$, respectively. Special attention is payed to the elusive subclass of accelerating NUT black holes with $a=0$.</description>

      <title>The anti-aligned spin of GW191109: glitch mitigation and its implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03912v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With a high total mass and an inferred effective spin anti-aligned with the orbital axis at the 99.9% level, GW191109 is one of the most promising candidates for a dynamical formation origin among gravitational wave events observed so far. However, the data containing GW191109 are afflicted with terrestrial noise transients, i.e., detector glitches, generated by the scattering of laser light in both LIGO detectors. We study the implications of the glitch(es) on the inferred properties and astrophysical interpretation of GW191109. Using time- and frequency-domain analysis methods, we isolate the critical data for spin inference to 35 - 40 Hz and 0.1 - 0.04 s before the merger in LIGO Livingston, directly coincident with the glitch. Using two models of glitch behavior, one tailored to slow scattered light and one more generic, we perform joint inference of the glitch and binary parameters. When the glitch is modeled as slow scattered light, the binary parameters favor anti-aligned spins, in agreement with existing interpretations. When more flexible glitch modeling based on sine-Gaussian wavelets is used instead, a bimodal aligned/anti-aligned solution emerges. The anti-aligned spin mode is correlated with a weaker inferred glitch and preferred by ~ 70 : 30 compared to the aligned spin mode and a stronger inferred glitch. We conclude that if we assume that the data are only impacted by slow scattering noise, then the anti-aligned spin inference is robust. However, the data alone cannot validate this assumption and resolve the anti-aligned spin and potentially dynamical formation history of GW191109.</description>

      <title>Exact Results On the Number of Gravitons Radiated During Binary Inspiral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14808v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an exact formula $F(e)$ which provides a concrete estimate for the total number and angular momentum of gravitons emitted during the nonrelativistic inspiral of two black holes. We show that the function $F(e)$ is a slowly growing monotonic function of the eccentricity $0 \le e \le 1$ and $F(1) = 1.0128 \cdots $. We confirm and extend the results obtained by Page for the function $F(e)$. We also get an exact result for the ratio $\nu (e_i) = \frac{2\hbar N(L_i, e_i)}{L_i}$ where the numerator $2\hbar N(L_i, e_i)$ is the sum of the spin angular momentum magnitudes of the gravitons emitted and $N(L_i, e_i)$ is the total number of gravitons emitted in the gravitational waves during nonrelativistic inspiral from an initial eccentricity $e_i$ down to a final eccentricity $e = 0$ and the denominator $L_i$ is the magnitude of the initial orbital angular momentum. If the orbit starts off with unit eccentricity $e_i=1$, we get the value $\nu(1) = 1.002\, 268\, 666\, 2 \pm 10^{-10}$ which confirms the Page's conjecture that the true value of $\nu(1)$ will lie between $1.001\cdots$ and $1.003\cdots$. We also show that the formula $F(e)$ for gravitons emitted, originally expressed as an infinite series, can be represented by a single function through an integral representation.</description>

Abstract: We discuss an evolutionary dark energy model, based on the presence of non-equilibrium effects on the dark energy constituents, which are described via a bulk viscosity contribution. We implement the proposed dynamics by the analysis of the 40-bins Type Ia Supernovae (SNe) Pantheon sample data, in order to outline the existence of a running Hubble constant with the redshift. Via a fitting procedure, we determine the value of the additional parameter that our model possesses with respect a standard $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) scenario. As important result, the evolutionary dark energy proposal seems more appropriate to describe the binned SN analysis with respect to the $\Lambda$CDM Hubble parameter, i.e. a non running value for the Hubble constant over the bins.</description>

Abstract: We present an exact solution to standard model cosmological perturbation theory in a matter-dominated, adiabatic, hydrodynamic era. The solution is in the form of hypergeometric functions. While such functions can oscillate with the sound velocity, they can only do so at high frequency. There is thus a maximum wavelength to these oscillations, with this maximum wavelength serving to provide a horizon for acoustic oscillations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmological history and evolution are examined for gravitational models with interaction in the dark sector of the universe. In particular, we consider the dark energy to be described by a phantom scalar field and the dark matter $\rho _{m}$ as a pressureless ideal gas. We introduce the interacting function $Q=\beta \left( t\right) \rho_{m}$, where the function $% \beta \left( t\right) $ is considered to be proportional to $\dot{\phi}, \dot{\phi}^{2}H^{-1},~H$, or a constant parameter with dimensions of $\left[H_{0}\right] $. For the four interacting models, we study in details the phase space by calculating the stationary points. The latter are applied to reconstruct the cosmological evolution. Compactified variables are essential to understand the complete picture of the phase space and to conclude about the cosmological viability of these interacting models. The detailed analysis is performed for the exponential potential $V\left( \phi \right) =V_{0}e^{\lambda \phi }$. The effects of other scalar field potential functions on the cosmological dynamics are examined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02993v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose using fuzzy axion dark matter to test the anthropic principle. A very light axion can be directly detectable, at least by black hole superradiance effects. The idea then is that gravitational and astrophysical observations can discover a light axion in the regime where it must be all of dark matter with abundance which must be set up by the anthropic principle, due to excessive primordial misalignment induced by inflation-induced Brownian drift of fluctuations. Yet it may turn out that dark matter is something else instead of this axion. Since the de Sitter-induced axion misalignment controlled only by the de Sitter curvature cannot be evaded, this would invalidate the anthropic prediction of the dark matter abundance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19443v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes and their surrounding dense stellar environments nourish a variety of astrophysical phenomena. We focus on the distribution of stellar-mass black holes around the supermassive black hole and the consequent formation of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). We derive a steady-state distribution, considering the effects of two-body scattering and gravitational-wave emission, and calculate the EMRI formation rate, eccentricity distribution, and EMRI-to-plunge ratio. Our model predicts: (a) a stronger segregation than previously estimated at the outskirts of the sphere of influence (at $\sim0.01-2\rm pc$ for a Milky Way-like galaxy); (b) an increased EMRI-to-plunge ratio, favoring EMRIs at galaxies where stellar-mass black holes are scarce; (c) a detection of about $2\times10^3$ resolvable EMRIs, with a signal-to-noise ratio above $20$, along a $4\ \rm yr$ LISA mission time; and (d) a confusion noise, induced by a cosmological population of unresolved EMRIs, reducing the LISA sensitivity in the $1-5\ \rm mHz$ frequency range by up to a factor of $\approx2$, relative to the instrumental noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sydney Coleman's Q-ball remains a compelling instance of localised object formation within classical field theory, independently of the quantum evolution. The theoretical possibility of such objects forming and colliding in the early universe from models such as Affleck-Dine fragmentation, or from a number of mechanisms where they are produced copiously with various size and charges to be dark matter candidates, makes it important to study in detail Q-ball collision phenomenology. In this work we present results from a study of Q-ball collisions and their gravitational waves, using a new general code package for scalar fields coupled to gravity. We then comment on the possibility of future gravitational wave detectors searching for signals of Q-ball collisions.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Origin of Spacetime Non-Commutativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a stochastic interpretation of spacetime non-commutativity starting from the path integral formulation of quantum mechanical commutation relations. We discuss how the (non-)commutativity of spacetime is inherently related to the continuity or discontinuity of paths in the path integral formulation. Utilizing Wiener processes, we demonstrate that continuous paths lead to commutative spacetime, whereas discontinuous paths correspond to non-commutative spacetime structures. As an example we introduce discontinuous paths from which the $\kappa$-Minkowski spacetime commutators can be obtained. Moreover we focus on modifications of the Leibniz rule for differentials acting on discontinuous trajectories. We show how these can be related to the deformed action of translation generators focusing, as a working example, on the $\kappa$-Poincar\'e algebra. Our findings suggest that spacetime non-commutativity can be understood as a result of fundamental discreteness in temporal and/or spatial evolution.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of common envelope stage in close binary systems: comparison between Newtonian and modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18233v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the important stage in evolution of close binary system namely common envelope phase in framework of various models of modified gravity. The comparison of results between calculations in Newtonian gravity and modified gravity allows to estimate possible observational imprints of modified gravity. Although declination from Newtonian gravity should be negligible we can propose that due to the long times some new effects can appear. We use the moving-mesh code AREPO for numerical simulation of binary system consisting of $\sim M_{\odot}$ white dwarf and a red giant with mass $\sim 2 M_{\odot}$. For implementing modified gravity into AREPO code we apply the method of (pseudo)potential, assuming that modified gravity can be described by small corrections to usual Newtonian gravitational potential. As in Newtonian case initial orbit has to shrink due to the energy transfer to the envelope of a giant. We investigated evolution of common envelope in a case of simple model of modified gravity with various values of parameters and compared results with simulation in frames of Newtonian gravity.</description>

      <title>Signal-to-noise Ratio Analytic Formulae of the Inspiral Binary Black Holes in TianQin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary black holes are one of the important sources for the TianQin gravitational wave project. Our research has revealed that, for TianQin, the signal-to-noise ratio of inspiral binary black holes can be computed analytically. This finding is expected to greatly simplify the estimation of detection capabilities for binary black holes. In this paper, we demonstrated the signal-to-noise ratio relationships from stellar-mass black holes to massive black holes. With the all-sky average condition, the signal-to-noise ratio for most binary black hole signals can be determined with a relative error of $\lesssim10\%$, with notable deviations only for chirp masses near $1000~M_\odot$. In contrast, the signal-to-noise ratio without the average includes an additional term, which we refer to as the response factor. Although this term is not easily calculated analytically, we provide a straightforward estimation method with an error margin of $1\sigma$ within 2\%.</description>

      <title>Bekenstein bound on black hole entropy in non-Gaussian statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bekenstein bound, inspired by the physics of black holes, is introduced to constrain the entropy growth of a physical system down to the quantum level in the context of a generalized second law of thermodynamics. We first show that the standard Bekenstein bound is violated when the entropy of a Schwarzschild black hole is described in non-Gaussian statistics Barrow, Tsallis, and Kaniadakis due to the presence of the related indices $\Delta$, $q$ and $\kappa$, respectively. Then, by adding the GUP effects into the Bekenstein bound, we find that the generalized bound is satisfied in the context of the mentioned entropies through a possible connection between the entropies indices and the GUP parameter $\beta$.</description>

      <title>Smooth extremal horizons are the exception, not the rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the general charged, rotating black hole in five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory has a singular extremal limit. Only the known analytic solutions with exactly zero charge or zero angular momenta have smooth extremal horizons. We also consider general black holes in five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory, and show that they also have singular extremal limits except for one special value of the coefficient of the Chern-Simons term (the one fixed by supergravity). Combining this with earlier results showing that extremal black holes have singular horizons in four-dimensional general relativity with small higher derivative corrections, and in anti-de Sitter space with perturbed boundary conditions, one sees that smooth extremal horizons are indeed the exception and not the rule.</description>

      <title>Hidden Adler zeros and soft theorems for inflationary perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17591v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive soft theorems for on-shell scattering amplitudes from non-linearly realised global space-time symmetries, arising from the flat space and decoupling limits of the effective field theories (EFTs) of inflation, while taking particular care of on-shell limits, soft limits, time-ordered correlations, momentum derivatives, energy-momentum conserving delta functions and $i\varepsilon$ prescriptions. Intriguingly, contrary to common belief, we find with a preferred soft hierarchy among the soft momentum $q$, on-shell residue $p_a^0 \pm E_a$, and $\varepsilon$, the soft theorems do not have dependence on off-shell interactions, even in the presence of cubic vertices. We also argue that the soft hierarchy is a natural choice, ensuring the soft limit and on-shell limit commute. Our soft theorems depend solely on on-shell data and hold to all orders in perturbation theory. We present various examples including polynomial shift symmetries, non-linear realisation of Lorentz boosts and dilatations on how the soft theorems work. We find that the collection of exchange diagrams, where the soft momentum is associated with a cubic vertex, exhibits an enhanced soft scaling. The enhanced soft scaling explains why the sum of such diagrams do not enter the soft theorems non-trivially. We further apply the soft theorems to bootstrap the scattering amplitudes of the superfluid and scaling superfluid EFTs, finding agreement with the Hamiltonian analysis.</description>

      <title>Quantum Rods and Clock in a Gravitational Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local operators are the basic observables in quantum field theory which encode the physics observed by a local experimentalist. However, when gravity is dynamical, diffeomorphism symmetries are gauged which apparently obstructs a sensible definition of local operators, as different locations in spacetime are connected by these gauged symmetries. This consideration brings in the puzzle of reconciling our empirical world with quantum gravity. Intuitively, this puzzle can be avoided using relatively defined observables when there exists a natural reference system such as a distribution of galaxies in our universe. Nevertheless, this intuition is classical as the rods and clock defined in this way may also have quantum fluctuations so it is not a priori clear if it can be realized in the quantum regime. In this letter, we provide an affirmative answer to this question. Interestingly, we notice that the quantum fluctuations of the reference system are in fact essential for the realization of the above intuition in the quantum regime.</description>

      <title>Can decaying vacuum solve the H_0 Tension?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work we analyze two different models of interaction between dark energy and dark matter, also known as vacuum decay models or $\Lambda(t)$CDM models. In both models, when the $H_0$ parameter is constrained by the Planck distance priors, its value is compatible with a higher value of $H_0$, in agreement with SH0ES data, while simultaneously reducing the values of $\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_b$. In both models, we find $H_0=73.1\pm0.86$ at 68\% c.l. by combining Planck+SH0ES data. We also find the decay parameter to be $\varepsilon=0.0197^{+0.0032}_{-0.0027}$ for one model and $\varepsilon=0.0203\pm0.0034$ for the other one. From these analyses, a noninteracting model is excluded at least at $6\sigma$ c.l.! This shows that these types of models are promising in solving or at least alleviating the $H_0$ tension problem. Our analysis also shows a preference for the decay of vacuum into dark matter, in agreement to thermodynamic analyses.</description>
