      <title>Mixing Paint: An analysis of color value transformations in multiple coordinate spaces using multivariate linear regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I explore the mathematical transformation that occurs in color coordinate space when physically mixing paints of two different colors. I tested 120 pairs of 16 paint colors and used a linear regression to find the most accurate combination of input parameters, both in RGB space and several other color spaces. I found that the fit with the strongest coefficient of determination was a geometrically symmetrized linear combination of the colors in CIEXYZ space, while this same mapping in RGB space returns a better mean squared error.</description>

      <title>Large-Core Optics for Simplified Short-Range FSO Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate large-core FSO links where excellent coupling pairs with bandwidth fading due to multi-mode propagation. The 10-Gb/s/{\lambda} limit for 105-{\mu}m double-clad fibers is mitigated by spectral launch tuning, restoring 84% of single-clad 25-Gb/s/{\lambda} capacity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We respond to the recent comment in Optics Communications by Kayn Forbes on our recent Optics Communications article and we maintain that, contrary to what Forbes claims, substantial superchirality exists as a property of the $m\geq 1$ higher order Poincare modes. Forbes arguments are based on misconceptions and analytical errors, leading to erroneous results and unjustified criticism.</description>

      <title>Quantum Diamond Microscope for Narrowband Magnetic Imaging with High Spatial and Spectral Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum diamond microscope (QDM) is a recently developed technology for near-field imaging of magnetic fields with micron-scale spatial resolution. In the present work, we integrate a QDM with a narrowband measurement protocol and a lock-in camera; and demonstrate imaging of radiofrequency (RF) magnetic field patterns produced by microcoils, with spectral resolution $\approx1$\,Hz. This RF-QDM provides multi-frequency imaging with a central detection frequency that is easily tunable over the MHz-scale, allowing spatial discrimination of both crowded spectral peaks and spectrally well-separated signals. The present instrument has spatial resolution $\approx2\,\mathrm{\mu m}$, field-of-view $\approx300\times300\,\mathrm{\mu m^2}$, and per-pixel sensitivity to narrowband fields $\sim{1}\,$nT$\cdot$Hz$^{-1/2}$. Spatial noise can be reduced to the picotesla scale by signal averaging and/or spatial binning. The RF-QDM enables simultaneous imaging of the amplitude, frequency, and phase of narrowband magnetic field patterns at the micron-scale, with potential applications in real-space NMR imaging, AC susceptibility mapping, impedance tomography, analysis of electronic circuits, and spatial eddy-current-based inspection.</description>

      <title>Integrated optical wave analyzer using the discrete fractional Fourier transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the expansive domain of optical sciences, achieving the precise characterization of light beams stands as a fundamental pursuit, pivotal for various applications, including telecommunications and imaging technologies. This study introduces an innovative methodology aimed at reconstructing the Wigner distribution function of optical signals; a crucial tool in comprehending the time-frequency behavior exhibited by these signals. The proposed approach integrates two robust mathematical tools: the discrete realization of fractional Fourier transform, and the propagator of the quantum harmonic oscillator in waveguide arrays. This integration offers a direct and efficient method for characterizing optical signals by reconstructing their Wigner distribution function in the scope of integrated optics. We provide evidence of how having knowledge of the signal propagation amid the phase-space reconstruction, has desirable advantages in respect to only knowing the signal state.</description>

      <title>Photonics-integrated terahertz transmission lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern communication and sensing technologies rely on connecting the optical domain with the microwave domain. Terahertz technologies, spanning increased frequencies from 100 GHz to 10 THz, are critical for providing larger bandwidths and faster switching capabilities. Despite progress in high-frequency electronic sources and detectors, these technologies lack a direct link to the optical domain, and face challenges with increasing frequencies (&gt; 1 THz). Nonlinear processes, such as optical rectification, offer potential solutions for terahertz generation but are currently limited to discrete components based on bulk nonlinear crystals, missing out miniaturisation opportunities from integration of optical circuits with terahertz ones. We address this challenge by integrating phase-matched terahertz transmission lines with photonic circuits in a single hybrid architecture on the thin-film lithium niobate~(TFLN) platform. This design demonstrates phase-matched, broadband terahertz emission spanning four octaves (200 GHz to 3.5 THz) through broadband down-conversion of optical signals at telecommunication wavelengths. The micron-sized transmission lines provide terahertz field confinement with minimal radiative loss, enabling compact THz cavities embedded in integrated photonic circuits. This integration is crucial for leveraging photonics' advantages in low-noise, low-loss, and high-speed operations for terahertz generation. Our platform can readily be integrated with other mature photonics components, such as electro-optic modulators, frequency comb sources, or femtosecond sources to pave the way for compact, power-efficient, and frequency-agile broadband sources with applications in telecommunications, spectroscopy, quantum electrodynamics and optical computing.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency Low-Noise Optomechanical Crystal Photon-Phonon Transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optomechanical crystals (OMCs) enable coherent interactions between optical photons and microwave acoustic phonons, and represent a platform for implementing quantum transduction between microwave and optical signals. Optical absorption-induced thermal noise at cryogenic (millikelvin) temperatures is one of the primary limitations of performance for OMC-based quantum transducers. Here, we address this challenge with a two-dimensional silicon OMC resonator that is side-coupled to a mechanically detached optical waveguide, realizing a six-fold reduction in the heating rate of the acoustic resonator compared to prior state-of-the-art, while operating in a regime of high optomechanical-backaction and millikelvin base temperature. This reduced heating translates into a demonstrated phonon-to-photon conversion efficiency of 93.1 $\pm$ 0.8% at an added noise of 0.25 $\pm$ 0.01 quanta, representing a significant advance toward quantum-limited microwave-optical frequency conversion and optically-controlled quantum acoustic memories.</description>

      <title>Robust Ptychographic Reconstruction with an Out-of-Focus Electron Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a burgeoning technique, out-of-focus electron ptychography offers the potential for rapidly imaging atomic-scale large fields of view (FoV) using a single diffraction dataset. However, achieving robust out-of-focus ptychographic reconstruction poses a significant challenge due to the inherent scan instabilities of electron microscopes, compounded by the presence of unknown aberrations in the probe-forming lens. In this study, we substantially enhance the robustness of out-of-focus ptychographic reconstruction by extending our previous calibration method (the Fourier method), which was originally developed for the in-focus scenario. This extended Fourier method surpasses existing calibration techniques by providing more reliable and accurate initialization of scan positions and electron probes. Additionally, we comprehensively explore and recommend optimized experimental parameters for robust out-of-focus ptychography, includingaperture size and defocus, through extensive simulations. Lastly, we conduct a comprehensive comparison between ptychographic reconstructions obtained with focused and defocused electron probes, particularly in the context of low-dose and precise phase imaging, utilizing our calibration method as the basis for evaluation.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional Chiral Emission via Twisted Bi-layer Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling and channelling light emissions from unpolarized quantum dots into specific directions with chiral polarization remains a key challenge in modern photonics. Stacked metasurface designs offer a potential compact solution for chirality and directionality engineering. However, experimental observations of directional chiral radiation from resonant metasurfaces with quantum emitters remain obscure. In this paper, we present experimental observations of unidirectional chiral emission from a twisted bi-layer metasurface via multi-dimensional control, including twist angle, interlayer distance, and lateral displacement between the top and bottom layers, as enabled by doublet alignment lithography (DAL). First, maintaining alignment, the metasurface demonstrates a resonant intrinsic optical chirality with near-unity circular dichroism of 0.94 and reflectance difference of 74%, where a high circular dichroism greater than 0.9 persists across a wide range of angles from -11 to 11 degrees. Second, engineered lateral displacement induces a unidirectional chiral resonance, resulting in unidirectional chiral emission from the quantum dots deposited onto the metasurface. Our bi-layer metasurfaces offer a universal compact platform for efficient radiation manipulation over a wide angular range, promising potential applications in miniaturized lasers, grating couplers, and chiral nanoantennas.</description>

      <title>Shadow Mask Molecular Beam Epitaxy for In-Plane Gradient Permittivity Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared spectroscopy currently requires the use of bulky, expensive, and/or fragile spectrometers. For gas sensing, environmental monitoring, or other applications in the field, an inexpensive, compact, robust on-chip spectrometer is needed. One way to achieve this goal is through gradient permittivity materials, in which the material permittivity changes as a function of position in the plane. In this paper, we demonstrate the synthesis of infrared gradient permittivity materials using shadow mask molecular beam epitaxy. The permittivity of our material changes as a function of position in the lateral direction, allowing us to confine varying wavelengths of infrared light at varying horizontal locations. We see an electric field enhancement corresponding to a wavenumber gradient of ~650 cm$^{-1}$ to 900 cm$^{-1}$ over an in-plane gradient width of ~13 $\mu$ m on the flat mesa of our sample. In addition, we see a wavenumber gradient of ~900 cm$^{-1}$ to 1250 cm$^{-1}$ over an in-plane gradient width of ~13 $\mu$m on the slope of our sample. These two different wavenumber gradient regions develop on two opposite sides of our material. This demonstration of a scalable method of creating an in-plane gradient permittivity material could be leveraged for the creation of a variety of miniature infrared devices, such as an ultracompact spectrometer.</description>

      <title>A Precision Gyroscope from the Spin of Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a gyroscope that measures rotation based on the effects of the rotation on the polarization of light. Rotation induces a differential phase shift in the propagation of left and right circularly polarized light and this phase shift can be measured in suitably designed interferometric setups. The signal in this setup is independent of the frequency of light, unlike various sources of noise such as vibrations, which cause phase shifts that depend on the frequency. Such vibrations are the practical limit on the sensitivity of conventional Sagnac-style optical interferometers that are typically used as gyroscopes. In the proposed setup, one can potentially mitigate this source of noise by simultaneously using two (or more) sources of light that have different frequencies. The signal in this setup scales with the total storage time of the light. Due to its frequency independence, it is thus most optimal to measure the signal using superconducting RF systems where the high finesse of the available cavities enables considerably longer storage times than is possible in an optical setup.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown numerically that in a lightguide possessing a helical symmetry, stable solutions exist for the coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equations describing interaction between the left and the right circular polarizations of an optical wave in a defocusing Kerr medium with anomalous dispersion, in the form of stationary rotating oblong bubbles with attached several optical vortices. A bubble is an arbitrary long quasi-cylindrical three-dimensional cavity inside the first component, filled with the second component. At each of the two ends of the bubble, two stationary two-dimensional configurations are connected, in one of them only the first component with separated vortices is present while in the other one there is a single multiple vortex with a filled core. The cross-section of the lightguide, the screw pitch, the number of vortices, and the background intensity of the first component influence upon the profile of the bubble, but the total amount of the trapped second component does not.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensionally sculpted dielectric nanostructures supporting material(air) confined optical modes with single-emitter mode volumes three(four) orders of magnitude below the diffraction limit, $V_{\textbf{r}_0} \approx 0.0004 \left[\lambda/(2 n)\right]^3 \left( V_{\textbf{r}_0} \approx 0.00003 \left[\lambda/2\right]^3\right)$, are discovered using topology optimization. Encapsulating the nanostructure by ellipsoidal shells enables seemingly unbounded mode quality factor enhancement ($Q &gt; 10^8$ demonstrated numerically) leading to Purcell enhancement above $10^{11}$. It is studied how $V_{\textbf{r}_0}$ and $Q$ depend on the choice of material, device volume, minimum feature size and number of shells.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Emission From Diamond Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent light sources emitting in the terahertz range are highly sought after for fundamental research and applications. THz lasers rely on achieving population inversion. We demonstrate the generation of THz radiation using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in a diamond single crystal. Population inversion is achieved through the Zeeman splitting of the $S=1$ state in $15\ \text{T}$, resulting in a splitting of $0.42\ \text{THz}$, where the middle $S_z=0$ sublevel is selectively pumped by visible light. To detect the THz radiation, we utilize a phase-sensitive THz setup, optimized for electron spin resonance measurements (ESR). We determine the spin-lattice relaxation time up to $15\ \text{T}$ using the light-induced ESR measurement, which shows the dominance of phonon-mediated relaxation and the high efficacy of the population inversion. The THz radiation is tunable by the magnetic field, thus these findings may lead to the next generation of tunable coherent THz sources.</description>

Cryogenic operation of these devices is becoming essential for advancing photonic quantum technologies, accommodating components like quantum light sources, single photon detectors and quantum memories operating at liquid helium temperatures. In this work, we report on a programmable glass photonic integrated circuit (PIC) fabricated through femtosecond laser waveguide writing (FLW) and controlled by thermo-optic phase shifters both in a room-temperature and in a cryogenic setting. By taking advantage of a femtosecond laser microstructuring process, we achieved reliable PIC operation with minimal power consumption and confined temperature gradients in both conditions. This advancement marks the first cryogenically-compatible programmable FLW PIC, paving the way for fully integrated quantum architectures realized on a laser-written photonic chip.</description>

      <title>High-quality activation function for applications in neuromorphic photonic chips realized using low-quality nonlinear optical resonators</title>

Abstract: Integrated optical devices that can realize a threshold filtration of signals are in demand in photonics. In particular, they play a key role in neuromorphic chips, acting as optical neurons. A list of requirements exist for thresholders to be practically applicable in this context. A value of the threshold, in general, should be independently tunable for each neuron. A sharpness of the corresponding step function should be also dynamically variable, to allow switching between deterministic and stochastic algorithms, for example, in optical Ising machines. Nonlinear ring resonators draw the attention of researchers in this field since they potentially can provide the required type of threshold behavior. Here we suggest the switching mechanism that implements the property of resonators to provide extremely sharp (with respect to the wavelength) $\pi$ phase shifts near the critical coupling regime. Adding a variable source of losses into the resonator, a well controlled broadening of the threshold can be achieved. Sharpness of the step in this case is independent on the quality factor of resonators and corresponding width of resonances. The nonlinear switching mechanism allows to use this feature to construct efficient optical neurons, that operate at small intensities. It also allows to use conventional materials like silicon with a relatively weak Kerr nonlinearity. The obtained results potentially lead the way to fast nonlinear Kerr effect based activation functions that can operate in continuous wave regime.</description>

      <title>DEDALO: Device for Enhanced Dust Analyses with Light Obscuration sensors</title>

Abstract: Instruments based on light obscuration sensors are widely used for measuring the size distribution of insoluble sub-visible particles in liquid suspensions, being fast and suitable for in situ and real-time measurements. Such instruments are typically calibrated by means of reference polystyrene spherical particles with a specific refractive index, which unavoidably leads to systematic errors when determining the size of particles of different materials. In this paper, we propose a reliable and consistent method to overcome this limitation by setting the refractive index value according to the sample, thus achieving an improved particle size distribution (PSD) measurement. An ad hoc, ready-to-use, open source code with a graphical interface able to drive an in-line instrument and obtain a real-time correction to the PSD has been developed. The method has been extensively validated with several oil emulsions characterized by different refractive index values and the results have been compared with an independent optical method. As an example of application, we have adopted this approach for the analysis of dust suspended in meltwater of an ice core from a glacier in the Aosta Valley (Italy). We believe that our approach will strongly improve the accuracy in characterizing liquid suspensions and reduce discrepancies between data obtained with different methods. The code has been made publicly available at:https://instrumentaloptics.fisica.unimi.it/dedalo/ and on the GitHub page of the corresponding author (https://github.com/LucaTeruzzi/DEDALO).</description>

      <title>Quantum-enhanced photoprotection in neuroprotein architectures emerges from collective light-matter interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study here the collective quantum optical effect of superradiance in neuroprotein architectures. This phenomenon arises from the interaction of the electromagnetic field with an organized network of tryptophan chromophores, where each can be effectively modeled as a two-level quantum emitter. Building on our prior experimental confirmation of single-photon superradiance in microtubules, we predict that bright superradiant states will also emerge in simulated actin filament bundles and amyloid fibrils, which manifests in the form of high quantum yields that are robust to static disorder up to five times that of room temperature. For microtubules and amyloid fibrils, the quantum yield is enhanced with increasing system size, contrary to the conventional expectations of quantum effects in a thermally equilibrated environment. We conduct our analyses using a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian derived from the Lindblad equation for an open quantum system that describes the interaction of a chromophore network with the electromagnetic field, in the single-photon limit. Our detailed quantum yield predictions in realistic neuroprotein structures -- including analysis of the potential information-processing applications of correlated superradiant and subradiant states at divergent timescales -- provide motivation for a range of in vitro experiments to confirm these quantum enhancements, which can serve in vivo as a mechanism for dissipating or downconverting high-energy UV metabolic photon emissions in intensely oxidative pathological environments, including those found in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive overview of diffuse correlation spectroscopy: theoretical framework, recent advances in hardware, analysis, and applications</title>

Abstract: Diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) is a powerful tool for assessing microvascular hemodynamic in deep tissues. Recent advances in sensors, lasers, and deep learning have further boosted the development of new DCS methods. However, newcomers might feel overwhelmed, not only by the already complex DCS theoretical framework but also by the broad range of component options and system architectures. To facilitate new entry into this exciting field, we present a comprehensive review of DCS hardware architectures (continuous-wave, frequency-domain, and time-domain) and summarize corresponding theoretical models. Further, we discuss new applications of highly integrated silicon single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) sensors in DCS, compare SPADs with existing sensors, and review other components (lasers, fibers, and correlators), as well as new data analysis tools, including deep learning. Potential applications in medical diagnosis are discussed, and an outlook for the future directions is provided, to offer effective guidance to embark on DCS research.</description>

Abstract: Cavity ring-down is an essential test to measure ultra-high quality factor (UHQ) optical cavities, which is, however, frequently misinterpreted due to lacking of a specified analysis guideline. Here we clarify the basic property of cavity ring down and present a step-by-step method that enables extraction of the overall quality factor, as well as the intrinsic loss and coupling state of UHQ cavities with better fidelity and simplicity than prior schemes. Our work can facilitate acurrate design and characterization of UHQ cavities for ultra-low noise lasers, high finesse reference cavities, and ultra-narrow optical filters.</description>

      <title>Phase space framework enables a variable-scale diffraction model for coherent imaging and display</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fast algorithms in Fourier optics have invigorated multifunctional device design and advanced imaging technologies. However, the necessity for fast computations has led to limitations in the widely used conventional Fourier methods, manifesting as fixed size image plane at a certain diffraction distance. These limitations pose challenges in intricate scaling transformations, 3D reconstructions and full-color displays. Currently, there is a lack of effective solutions, often resorting to pre-processing that compromise fidelity. In this paper, leveraging a higher-dimensional phase space method, we present a universal framework allowing for customized diffraction calculation methods. Within this framework, we establish a variable-scale diffraction computation model which allows the adjustment of the size of the image plane and can be operated by fast algorithms. We validate the model's robust variable-scale capabilities and its aberration automatic correction capability for full-color holography, achieving high fidelity. The large-magnification tomography experiment demonstrates that this model provides a superior solution for holographic 3D reconstruction. In addition, this model is applied to achieve full-color metasurface holography with near-zero crosstalk, showcasing its versatile applicability at nanoscale. Our model presents significant prospects for applications in the optics community, such as beam shaping, computer-generated holograms (CGHs), augmented reality (AR), metasurface optical elements (MOEs) and advanced holographic head-up display (HUD) systems.</description>

      <title>A photonic quantum engine driven by superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Performance of nano- and micro-scale heat engines can be improved with a help from quantum mechanical phenomena. Recently, heat reservoirs with quantum coherence have been proposed to enhance engine performance beyond the Carnot limit even with a single reservoir. However, no physical realizations have been achieved so far. Here, we report the first proof-of-principle experimental demonstration of a photonic quantum engine driven by superradiance employing a single heat reservoir composed of atoms and photonic vacuum. Reservoir atoms prepared in a quantum coherent superposition state underwent superradiance while traversing the cavity. This led to about 40-fold increase of the effective engine temperature, resulting in a near-unity engine efficiency. Moreover, the observed engine output power grew quadratically with respect to the atomic injection rate. Our work can be utilized in quantum mechanical heat transfer as well as in boosting engine powers, opening a pathway to development of photomechanical devices that run on quantum coherence embedded in heat baths.</description>

Abstract: We have investigated electromagnetically induced transparency in the spectrum of selective reflection at the interface of Rb atom vapors and a dielectric nanocell window. A nanocell with atomic vapor column thicknesses ranging from 150 to 1200 nm, as well as a 50~$\mu$m thickness microcell were used. We have compared electromagnetically induced transparency observed for the cases of the selective reflection and transmission. It was demonstrated that for the thicknesses of below $\leq 1000$ nm selective reflection technique is more favorable. In contrast, for wider cells and microcells, using transmitted radiation as probe field is more effective.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Mapping of Magnetic Auto-oscillations with a single Spin Sensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic auto-oscillations are damping-compensated magnetization precessions. They can be generated in spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNO) among others. Current research on these devices is dedicated to create next generation energy-efficient hardware for communication technologies. However, the underlying physics governing the formation of auto-oscillation modes, their output power and line width in a single SHNO device have remained elusive so far. We image the sources of magnetic auto-oscillations in a metallic SHNO using a single spin quantum sensor. We directly measure the microwave field generated by an auto-oscillation spot at the nanoscale by driving the electron spin resonance transition of the sensor spin, enabling faster acquisition speed (100 ms/pixel). Instead of being defined by the points of the largest antidamping only, we experimentally demonstrate for the first time with quantitative magnetometry that the auto-oscillation spots are determined by the positions of the magnetic field minima. The latter act as local potential wells for confining spin-waves, thus supporting large amplitude auto-oscillations. By comparing the magnitude of the magnetic stray field at these spots, we decipher the different frequencies of the auto-oscillation modes. The insights gained regarding the interaction between auto-oscillation modes and spin-wave potential wells enable advanced engineering of real devices.</description>

      <title>Picosecond all-optical switching of Co/Gd based synthetic ferrimagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single pulse all-optical switching of magnetization (AOS) in Co/Gd based synthetic ferrimagnets carries promises for hybrid spintronic-photonic integration. A crucial next step progressing towards this vision is to gain insight into AOS and multi-domain state (MDS) behavior using longer pulses, which is compatible with state-of-the-art integrated photonics. In this work, we present our studies on the AOS and MDS of [Co/Gd]n (n = 1, 2) using ps optical pulses across a large composition range. We theoretically and experimentally show that a large Gd layer thickness can enhance the AOS energy efficiency and maximum pulse duration. We have identified two augmenting roles of Gd in extending the maximum pulse duration. On the inter-atomic level, we found that more Gd offers a prolonged angular momentum supply to Co. On the micromagnetic level, a higher Gd content brings the system to be closer to magnetic compensation in the equilibrized hot state, thereby reducing the driving force for thermally assisted nucleation of domain walls, combating the formation of a MDS. Our study presents a composition overview of AOS in [Co/Gd]n and offers useful physical insights regarding AOS fundamentals as well as the projected photonic integration.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{PT}$ Symmetric Non-Hermitian Cavity Magnomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We design and explore PT-symmetric behavior of a hybrid non-Hermitian cavity magnomechanics consisting of a ferromagnetic YIG sphere driven by external magnetic field. Non-Hermicity is engineered by using a traveling field directly interacting with YIG. The external magnetic field excites collective mechanical modes of magnons, which later excites cavity mode leading to a coupling between cavity magnons and photons. The magnomechanical interaction of the system also excites phonon and couple them to the system. By computing eigenvalue spectrum, we demonstrate the occurrence of three-order exceptional point emerge with the increase of magnon-photon coupling at a specific incidence angle of traveling field. We illustrate the unique bi-broken and uni-protected PT-symmetry regions in eigenvalue spectrum unlike previously investigated non-Hermitian system, which can be tuned with gain and loss configuration by manipulating ratio between traveling field strength and magnon-photon coupling. Interestingly, protected PT-symmetry only exists on the axis of exceptional point. We further show that the PT-symmetry can only be govern at two angle of incident of traveling field. However, later, by performing stability analysis, we illustrate that the system is only stable at $\pi/2$ and, on all other angles, either the system is non-PT-symmetric or it is unstable. Furthermore, we govern the parametric stability conditions for the system and, by defining stablity parameter, illustrate the stable and unstable parametric regimes. Our finding not only discusses a new type of PT-symmetric system, but also could act as foundation to bring cavity magnomechanics to the subject of quantum information and process.</description>

      <title>Label-free mid-infrared photothermal microscopy revisits intracellular thermal dynamics: what do fluorescent nanothermometers measure?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluorescent nanothermometry has revealed pronounced inhomogeneous temperature distributions within cells and has opened the field of single-cell thermal biology. However, this finding has sparked a controversial discussion known as the 10^5 gap issue, which arises from a simple heat conduction calculation suggesting such large temperature distributions should not exist inside cells. This debate has led to a hypothesis that intracellular thermal conduction is considerably slower than in water. Although various efforts have been made to measure intracellular thermal conduction, there are significant variations in the reported values. Here, we address this issue using label-free mid-infrared photothermal microscopy, which enables us to measure heat-induced temperature variations under local thermal equilibrium via refractive index changes. We measured intracellular thermal diffusivity via transient thermal decay and found that thermal diffusivity within living cells is 93-94% of water in the cytoplasm and nucleus. This result suggests that intracellular thermal conduction cannot explain the 10^5 gap issue. To investigate this issue further, we compared fluorescent nanothermometry with our label-free thermometry by measuring heat-induced temperature variations in living cells. This experiment revealed intriguing results where the fluorescent nanothermometry showed a slowly varying unexpected signal in addition to a constant temperature change. This result indicates that fluorescent nanothermometers are sensitive to additional factors on top of the temperature variation under local thermal equilibrium, raising an open question of what fluorescent nanothermometry measures.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a Squeezed Light Source on Thin-Film Lithium Niobate with Modal Phase Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Squeezed states are essential for continuous variable (CV) quantum information processing, with wide-ranging applications in computing, sensing and communications. Integrated photonic circuits provide a scalable, convenient platform for building large CV circuits. Thin-film Lithium Niobate (TFLN) is particularly promising due to its low propagation loss, efficient parametric down conversion, and fast electro-optical modulation.
  In this work, we demonstrate a squeezed light source on an integrated TFLN platform, achieving a measured shot noise reduction of 0.46 dB using modal phase matching and grating couplers with an efficiency of up to -2.2 dB.
  The achieved squeezing is comparable to what has been observed using more complex circuitry based on periodic poling.
  The simpler design allows for compact, efficient and reproducible sources of squeezed light.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Generation of Quantum Frequency Combs across Distinct Modal Families in a Single $Si_3 N_4$ Whispering Gallery Mode Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum frequency combs (QFCs) are versatile resources for multi-mode entanglement, such as cluster states, crucial for quantum communication and computation. On-chip whispering gallery mode resonators (WGMRs) can generate these states at ultra-low threshold power. In this paper, we demonstrate the simultaneous generation of three QFCs using a single on-chip $Si_3N_4$ WGMR across distinct modal families. We designed a micro-ring resonator with a radius of 240 $\mu m$, capable of supporting four modal families within the 130 to 260 $THz$ frequency range for consistency regulation. Our results indicate that, by carefully designing the structure of $Si_3 N_4$ WGMRs, it is possible to generate quantum entangled frequency combs across distinct modal families simultaneously using monochromatic pump light. This is achieved by modulating the pump mode profiles with a spatial light modulator (SLM). Our approach offers a simple and low-cost method to achieve higher-density entanglement integration on-chip.</description>

      <title>Quantum resolution limit of long-baseline imaging using distributed entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been shown that shared entanglement between two telescope sites can in principle be used to localize a point source by mimicking the standard phase-scanning interferometer, but without physically bringing the light from the distant telescopes together. In this paper, we show that a receiver that employs spatial-mode sorting at each telescope site, combined with pre-shared entanglement and local quantum operations can be used to mimic the most general multimode interferometer acting on light collected from the telescopes. As an example application to a quantitative passive-imaging problem, we show that the quantum-limited precision of estimating the angular separation between two stars can be attained by an instantiation of the aforesaid entanglement based receiver. We discuss how this entanglement assisted strategy can be used to achieve the quantum-limited precision of any complex quantitative imaging task involving any number of telescopes. We provide a blueprint of this general receiver that involves quantum transduction of starlight into quantum memory banks and spatial mode sorters deployed at each telescope site, and measurements that include optical detection as well as qubit gates and measurements on the quantum memories. We discuss the relative contributions of local mode sorting at telescope sites vis-a-vis distributed entanglement-assisted interferometry, to the overall quantum-limited information about the scene, based on the ratio of the baseline distance to the individual telescope diameter.</description>

      <title>Periodic skyrmionic textures via conformal cartographic projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find periodic skyrmionic textures via conformal cartographic projections that map either an entire spherical parameter space or a hemisphere onto every regular polygon that provides regular tessellations of the plane. These textures minimize the energy inherent to the mapping and preserve the sign of the Skyrme density throughout the entire space. We show that 2D spinor fields (e.g., 2D polarization) that present periodic textures preserving the sign of the Skyrme density, unavoidably exhibit zeros. We implement these textures in the polarization state of a laser beam.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal optical vortices: principles of description and basic properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01751v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These notes appeared as a summary during the initial acquaintance with the structure and properties of spatio-temporal optical vortices (STOV), as these are presented in the current literature. The general approach to the STOV description and characterization is based on the model of scalar paraxial Gaussian wave packet. On this ground, the STOV structures of arbitrary orders are considered as superpositions of spatio-temporal Hermite-Gaussian modes. This representation enables the direct and physically meaningful characterization of the STOV amplitude and phase distributions, their evolution upon free propagation and in optical systems, internal energy flows and the orbital angular momentum. The topologically determined asymmetry and the difference between the "energy center" and "probability center" [Phys. Rev. A 107, L031501 (2023)] is discussed and qualitatively interpreted. Methods for the STOV generation and diagnostics are outlined, and the main properties of non-Gaussian (Bessel-type) STOVs are briefly described. The notes may be useful as initial introduction to the STOV-associated ideas and their extraordinary properties.</description>

      <title>Optical microscope with nanometer longitudinal resolution based on a Linnik interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A microscope based on the Linnik interferometer was designed, built, and tested. Two methods were used for interference pattern measurement: phase-shifting and polarized single-shot methods. The former uses a low coherence light emitting diode as a light source, providing 10 nm resolution in the Z direction and diffraction-limited resolution in the X and Y directions. The second method is insensitive to vibrations and enables observation of moving objects. The simplicity and low cost of this instrument make it valuable for a variety of applications.</description>

      <title>Broadband Fourier-Transform Optical Photothermal Infrared Spectroscopy and Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical photothermal microscopy is a powerful, emerging method that overcomes the diffraction limit in infrared hyperspectral imaging by utilizing a visible probe laser beam to detect local temperature-induced modulation at the visible diffraction limit. However, the spectral range of this technique has been limited by the tuning range of infrared sources, which is generally restricted to the fingerprint window with commercially available quantum cascade lasers. In this work, ultra-broadband synchrotron infrared radiation was used for infrared photothermal imaging and spectroscopy, spanning the entire mid-infrared range. Both optical- and fluorescence-detected photothermal modalities were performed, demonstrating improved spectral range when compared to optical photothermal microscopy using commercial sources and improved spatial resolution when compared to synchrotron micro-spectroscopy measurements. Following these initial validation studies, synchrotron Fourier-transform optical photothermal infrared spectroscopy (FT-OPTIR) in combination with synchrotron micro-spectroscopy measurements were used to differentiate cells in mouse brain tissue sections.</description>

      <title>Free Space Optical Frequency Comparison Over Rapidly Moving Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08899v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The comparison of optical reference frequency signals over free-space optical links is limited by the relative motion between local and remote sites. For ground to low earth orbit comparison, the expected Doppler shift and Doppler rate typically reach 4 GHz at 100 MHz/s, which prevents the narrow-band detection required to compare optical frequencies at the highest levels of stability. We demonstrate a system capable of optical frequency comparison in the presence of these significant Doppler shifts, using an electro-optic phase modulator with an actuation bandwidth of 10 GHz, which will enable ground-to-space frequency comparison. This system was demonstrated over a retro-reflected drone link, with a maximum line-of-sight velocity of 15 m/s and Doppler shift of 19 MHz at a Doppler rate of 1 MHz/s. The best fractional frequency stability obtained was 7E-18 at an integration time of 5s. These results are an important step toward ground to low earth orbit optical frequency comparison, providing a scalable terrestrial test bed.</description>

      <title>Transverse Magnetic ENZ Resonators: Robustness and Optimal Shape Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study certain "geometric-invariant resonant cavitie"' introduced by Liberal et. al in a 2016 Nature Comm. paper, modeled using the transverse magnetic reduction of Maxwell's equations. The cross-section consists of a dielectric inclusion surrounded by an "epsilon-near-zero" (ENZ) shell. When the shell has the right area, its interaction with the inclusion produces a resonance. Mathematically, the resonance is a nontrivial solution of a 2D divergence-form Helmoltz equation $\nabla \cdot \left(\varepsilon^{-1}(x,\omega) \nabla u \right) + \omega^2 \mu u = 0$, where $\varepsilon(x,\omega)$ is the (complex-valued) dielectric permittivity, $\omega$ is the frequency, $\mu$ is the magnetic permeability, and a homogeneous Neumann condition is imposed at the outer boundary of the shell. This is a nonlinear eigenvalue problem, since $\varepsilon$ depends on $\omega$. Use of an ENZ material in the shell means that $\varepsilon(x,\omega)$ is nearly zero there, so the PDE is rather singular. Working with a Lorentz model for the dispersion of the ENZ material, we put the discussion of Liberal et.~al.~on a sound foundation by proving the existence of the anticipated resonance when the loss is sufficiently small. Our analysis is perturbative in character despite the apparently singular form of the PDE. While the existence of the resonance depends only on the area of the ENZ shell, the rate at which it decays depends on the shape of the shell. We consider an associated optimal design problem: what shape shell gives the slowest-decaying resonance? We prove that if the dielectric inclusion is a ball then the optimal shell is a concentric annulus. For an inclusion of any shape, we study a convex relaxation of the design problem using tools from convex duality, and discuss the conjecture that our relaxed problem amounts to considering homogenization-like limits of nearly optimal designs.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Domain Adaptation to Understand Physico-Chemical Processes from Fluorescence Spectroscopy Small Datasets: Application to Ageing of Olive Oil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluorescence spectroscopy is a fundamental tool in life sciences and chemistry, widely used for applications such as environmental monitoring, food quality control, and biomedical diagnostics. However, analysis of spectroscopic data with deep learning, in particular of fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs), presents significant challenges due to the typically small and sparse datasets available. Furthermore, the analysis of EEMs is difficult due to their high dimensionality and overlapping spectral features. This study proposes a new approach that exploits domain adaptation with pretrained vision models, alongside a novel interpretability algorithm to address these challenges. Thanks to specialised feature engineering of the neural networks described in this work, we are now able to provide deeper insights into the physico-chemical processes underlying the data. The proposed approach is demonstrated through the analysis of the oxidation process in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) during ageing, showing its effectiveness in predicting quality indicators and identifying the spectral bands, and thus the molecules involved in the process. This work describes a significantly innovative approach in the use of deep learning for spectroscopy, transforming it from a black box into a tool for understanding complex biological and chemical processes.</description>
