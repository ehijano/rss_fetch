      <title>Structural barriers to complete homogenization and wormholing in dissolving porous and fractured rocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissolution in porous media and fractured rocks alters both the chemical composition of the fluid and the physical properties of the solid. Depending on system conditions, reactive flow may enlarge pores uniformly, widen pre-existing channels, or trigger instabilities that form wormholes. The resulting pattern reflects feedbacks among advection, diffusion, surface reaction, and the initial heterogeneity of the medium. Porous and fractured media can exhibit distinct characteristics -- for example, the presence of large fractures can significantly alter the network topology and overall connectivity of the system. We quantify these differences with three network models -- a regular pore network, a disordered pore network, and a discrete fracture network -- evaluated with a unified metric: the flow focusing profile. This metric effectively captures evolution of flow paths across all systems: it reveals a focusing front that propagates from the inlet in the wormholing regime, a system-wide decrease in focusing during uniform dissolution, and the progressive enlargement of pre-existing flow paths in the channeling regime. The metric shows that uniform dissolution cannot eliminate heterogeneity resulting from the network topology. This structural heterogeneity -- rather than just pore-diameter or fracture-aperture variance -- sets a fundamental limit on flow homogenization and must be accounted for when upscaling dissolution kinetics from pore or fracture scale to the reservoir level.</description>

      <title>Theoretical constraints on tidal triggering of slow earthquakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal stress is a globally acting perturbation driven primarily by the gravitational forcing of the Moon and the Sun. Understanding how tidal stresses can trigger seismic events is essential for constraining tectonic environments that are sensitive to small stress perturbations. Here, employing a spring-block with rate-and-state friction, we investigate tidal triggering on velocity-weakening stable sliding faults with stiffness slightly exceeding the critical stiffness. We first apply idealized step-like and boxcar normal stress perturbations to demonstrate a resonance-like amplification of slip rate when the perturbation period approaches the intrinsic frictional timescale of state evolution. Next, we perform nondimensional analyses and numerical simulations with harmonic tidal-like perturbations to identify the key parameters controlling tidal triggering and their admissible ranges. Triggered slip events are further characterized using physically interpretable quantities, including radiation efficiency and tidal phase. Our results show that even small stress perturbations can trigger periodic as well as complex slip events on stable sliding faults. The triggering behavior is primarily controlled by the normalized perturbation period and the normalized perturbation amplitude. An increase in the normalized period shifts event timing from the peak of tidal stress toward the peak of stress rate, whereas increasing the normalized amplitude promotes a transition from slow to fast events. The parameter space permitting triggered events suggests that the parameter which characterizes the instantaneous frictional strength of an interface, should not exceed tens to hundreds of kilopascals, and that the characteristic slip distance for frictional weakening is likely on the order of micrometers.</description>

      <title>Reclaiming First Principles: A Differentiable Framework for Conceptual Hydrologic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conceptual hydrologic models remain the cornerstone of rainfall-runoff modeling, yet their calibration is often slow and numerically fragile. Most gradient-based parameter estimation methods rely on finite-difference approximations or automatic differentiation frameworks (e.g., JAX, PyTorch and TensorFlow), which are computationally demanding and introduce truncation errors, solver instabilities, and substantial overhead. These limitations are particularly acute for the ODE systems of conceptual watershed models. Here we introduce a fully analytic and computationally efficient framework for differentiable hydrologic modeling based on exact parameter sensitivities. By augmenting the governing ODE system with sensitivity equations, we jointly evolve the model states and the Jacobian matrix with respect to all parameters. This Jacobian then provides fully analytic gradient vectors for any differentiable loss function. These include classical objective functions such as the sum of absolute and squared residuals, widely used hydrologic performance metrics such as the Nash-Sutcliffe and Kling-Gupta efficiencies, robust loss functions that down-weight extreme events, and hydrograph-based functionals such as flow-duration and recession curves. The analytic sensitivities eliminate the step-size dependence and noise inherent to numerical differentiation, while avoiding the instability of adjoint methods and the overhead of modern machine-learning autodiff toolchains. The resulting gradients are deterministic, physically interpretable, and straightforward to embed in gradient-based optimizers. Overall, this work enables rapid, stable, and transparent gradient-based calibration of conceptual hydrologic models, unlocking the full potential of differentiable modeling without reliance on external, opaque, or CPU-intensive automatic-differentiation libraries.</description>

      <title>A rate-and-state friction based criterion for the probability of earthquake fault jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geometrical complexities in natural fault zones, such as steps and gaps, pose a challenge in seismic hazard studies as they can act as obstacles to seismic ruptures. In this study, we propose a criterion, which is based on the rate-and-state equation, to estimate the efficiency of an earthquake rupture to jump between two spatially disconnected faults. The proposed jump criterion is tested using a 2D quasi-dynamic numerical simulations of the seismic cycle. The criterion successfully predicts fault jumps where the simpler Coulomb stress change calculation fails to do so. The criterion includes the Coulomb stress change as a parameter but is also dependent on other important parameters among which is the absolute normal stress on the fault the rupture jumps to. Based on the criterion, the maximum jump distance increases with decreasing absolute normal stress, i.e. as the rupture process occurs closer to the Earth's surface or as pore pressure increases. The criterion implies that earthquakes can jump to arbitrary large distances at the Earth's surface if the normal stress is allowed to go to zero, underscoring the potential for large jump distances (i.e. &gt;5 km). We further propose a probabilistic framework to estimate the likelihood of rupture jumps by accounting for uncertainties in fault geometry and earthquake source parameters. Additionally to its role into seismic hazard assessment, this criterion could complement Coulomb stress change maps with those of triggered slip-rates on receiver faults due to quasi-instantaneous stress perturbations, as well as estimates of jump probabilities accounting for parameter uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed extreme learning machine for Terzaghi consolidation problems and interpretation of coefficient of consolidation based on CPTu data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08381v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper conducts a preliminary study to investigate the feasibility of a physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) for solving the Terzaghi consolidation equation and interpreting the coefficient of consolidation of soil from piezocone penetration tests (CPTu). In the PIELM framework, the target solution is approximated by a single-layer feed-forward extreme learning machine (ELM) network, instead of the deep neural networks typically employed in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Physical laws and measured data are integrated into a loss vector, which is minimized via least squares methods during ELM training. As a result, training efficiency is significantly improved by avoiding the gradient-descent optimisation commonly used in PINNs. The performance of PIELM is evaluated using three forward-problem case studies. Notably, a time-stepping strategy is incorporated into the PIELM framework to alleviate sharp gradients caused by inconsistent initial and boundary conditions. This paper further applies PIELM to estimate the soil consolidation coefficient, given that initial distributions of excess water pressure are often unavailable in CPTu dissipation tests (conducted following the pauses of penetration). By combining physical laws (excluding initial conditions) with measured data (i.e., excess pore-water pressure at the probe surface), the results demonstrate that PIELM is an effective tool for interpreting CPTu dissipation tests, owing to its ability to fuse data with physical constraints. This study contributes to the interpretation of consolidation coefficients from CPTu dissipation tests, particularly in scenarios where initial distributions of excess water pressure are not prior-known.</description>
