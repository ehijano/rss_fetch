      <title>EPI-VALID : Validation of an algorithm for identifying patients with epilepsy in the SNDS using data from the CONSTANCES cohort</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction: The HAS conducted a study in 2018 using the French National Health Data System (SNDS) on the care pathway of patients with epilepsy. This study used 2 algorithms to identify patients with epilepsy, based on hospitalization for epilepsy, insurance for chronic severe epilepsy, and antiepileptic drug (AE) dispensing, with exclusion of AEs not specific to epilepsy offering a low population estimate, or exclusion of dispensing in a context other than epilepsy (migraine, neuropathic pain, bipolar disorder, alcohol dependence, anxiety) offering a high population estimate. To study the characteristics of these 2 algorithms (low and high populations), we used data from CONSTANCES, a French generalist cohort and its control sample, which are matched to SNDS data. 
  Method: This is a validation study of a method for identifying patients with epilepsy in the SNDS. The study population was patients identified as epileptic according to the algorithms defined in the introduction, applied over the year 2018 and the reference population was all patients for whom there is a mention of epilepsy (free text field) in the inclusion and/or follow-up questionnaires of the CONSTANCES cohort for the years prior to 2019.
  Results: Among 156,819 patients present in the CONSTANCES cohort in 2018, 689 patients mentioned epilepsy in one of the questionnaires (0.4%). This number is lower than expected: in the literature, the prevalence of epilepsy in the general population is estimated at 0.6-0.7% in adults. This is due to under-reporting and lack of representativeness of epilepsy in the cohort, which we were able to estimate from the control sample data. Aware of these two limitations, we compared the characteristics of the algorithms with those of a control algorithm using insurance for chronic severe epilepsy and/or hospitalization for epilepsy as inclusion criteria in the SNDS. The accuracy of our SNDS algorithms is not very high (17.8% and 35% respectively in high and low populations) compared with the control algorithm (58.1%). However, they do improve sensitivity (+33 and +14 points respectively), with little loss of specificity (-1.2 and -0.3 points respectively).
  Discussion: The analysis of false-positive patients has enabled us to identify ways of improving the algorithms. Indeed, some AE drugs could be excluded from the inclusion criteria, as they are widely used in another indication. For example, eliminating pregabalin and gabapentin from the high-population algorithm would significantly improve its accuracy (45.3% vs. 17.8%).</description>

      <title>Universal deterministic patterns in stochastic count data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the existence of deterministic patterns in plots showing the relationship between the mean and the Fano factor (ratio of variance and mean) of stochastic count data. These patterns are found in a wide variety of datasets, including those from genomics, paper citations, commerce, ecology, disease outbreaks, and employment statistics. We develop a theory showing that the patterns naturally emerge when data sampled from discrete probability distributions is organised in matrix form. The theory precisely predicts the patterns and shows that they are a function of only one variable - the sample size.</description>

      <title>Histopathology Based AI Model Predicts Anti-Angiogenic Therapy Response in Renal Cancer Clinical Trial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictive biomarkers of treatment response are lacking for metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), a tumor type that is treated with angiogenesis inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors and a HIF2 inhibitor. The Angioscore, an RNA-based quantification of angiogenesis, is arguably the best candidate to predict anti-angiogenic (AA) response. However, the clinical adoption of transcriptomic assays faces several challenges including standardization, time delay, and high cost. Further, ccRCC tumors are highly heterogenous, and sampling multiple areas for sequencing is impractical. Here we present a novel deep learning (DL) approach to predict the Angioscore from ubiquitous histopathology slides. To overcome the lack of interpretability, one of the biggest limitations of typical DL models, our model produces a visual vascular network which is the basis of the model's prediction. To test its reliability, we applied this model to multiple cohorts including a clinical trial dataset. Our model accurately predicts the RNA-based Angioscore on multiple independent cohorts (spearman correlations of 0.77 and 0.73). Further, the predictions help unravel meaningful biology such as association of angiogenesis with grade, stage, and driver mutation status. Finally, we find our model can predict response to AA therapy, in both a real-world cohort and the IMmotion150 clinical trial. The predictive power of our model vastly exceeds that of CD31, a marker of vasculature, and nearly rivals the performance (c-index 0.66 vs 0.67) of the ground truth RNA-based Angioscore at a fraction of the cost. By providing a robust yet interpretable prediction of the Angioscore from histopathology slides alone, our approach offers insights into angiogenesis biology and AA treatment response.</description>

      <title>CrEIMBO: Cross Ensemble Interactions in Multi-view Brain Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern recordings of neural activity provide diverse observations of neurons across brain areas, behavioral conditions, and subjects -- thus presenting an exciting opportunity to reveal the fundamentals of brain-wide dynamics underlying cognitive function. Current methods, however, often fail to fully harness the richness of such data as they either provide an uninterpretable representation (e.g., via "black box" deep networks) or over-simplify the model (e.g., assume stationary dynamics or analyze each session independently). Here, instead of regarding asynchronous recordings that lack alignment in neural identity or brain areas as a limitation, we exploit these diverse views of the same brain system to learn a unified model of brain dynamics. We assume that brain observations stem from the joint activity of a set of functional neural ensembles (groups of co-active neurons) that are similar in functionality across recordings, and propose to discover the ensemble and their non-stationary dynamical interactions in a new model we term CrEIMBO (Cross-Ensemble Interactions in Multi-view Brain Observations). CrEIMBO identifies the composition of the per-session neural ensembles through graph-driven dictionary learning and models the ensemble dynamics as a latent sparse time-varying decomposition of global sub-circuits, thereby capturing non-stationary dynamics. CrEIMBO identifies multiple co-active sub-circuits while maintaining representation interpretability due to sharing sub-circuits across sessions. CrEIMBO distinguishes session-specific from global (session-invariant) computations by exploring when distinct sub-circuits are active. We demonstrate CrEIMBO's ability to recover ground truth components in synthetic data and uncover meaningful brain dynamics, capturing cross-subject and inter- and intra-area variability, in high-density electrode recordings of humans performing a memory task.</description>

      <title>Alignment is Key for Applying Diffusion Models to Retrosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrosynthesis, the task of identifying precursors for a given molecule, can be naturally framed as a conditional graph generation task. Diffusion models are a particularly promising modelling approach, enabling post-hoc conditioning and trading off quality for speed during generation. We show mathematically that permutation equivariant denoisers severely limit the expressiveness of graph diffusion models and thus their adaptation to retrosynthesis. To address this limitation, we relax the equivariance requirement such that it only applies to aligned permutations of the conditioning and the generated graphs obtained through atom mapping. Our new denoiser achieves the highest top-$1$ accuracy ($54.7$\%) across template-free and template-based methods on USPTO-50k. We also demonstrate the ability for flexible post-training conditioning and good sample quality with small diffusion step counts, highlighting the potential for interactive applications and additional controls for multi-step planning.</description>

      <title>Predicting Progression Events in Multiple Myeloma from Routine Blood Work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to accurately predict disease progression is paramount for optimizing multiple myeloma patient care. This study introduces a hybrid neural network architecture, combining Long Short-Term Memory networks with a Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine, to predict future blood work of affected patients from a series of historical laboratory results. We demonstrate that our model can replicate the statistical moments of the time series ($0.95~\pm~0.01~\geq~R^2~\geq~0.83~\pm~0.03$) and forecast future blood work features with high correlation to actual patient data ($0.92\pm0.02~\geq~r~\geq~0.52~\pm~0.09$). Subsequently, a second Long Short-Term Memory network is employed to detect and annotate disease progression events within the forecasted blood work time series. We show that these annotations enable the prediction of progression events with significant reliability (AUROC$~=~0.88~\pm~0.01$), up to 12 months in advance (AUROC($t+12~$mos)$~=0.65~\pm~0.01$). Our system is designed in a modular fashion, featuring separate entities for forecasting and progression event annotation. This structure not only enhances interpretability but also facilitates the integration of additional modules to perform subsequent operations on the generated outputs. Our approach utilizes a minimal set of routine blood work measurements, which avoids the need for expensive or resource-intensive tests and ensures accessibility of the system in clinical routine. This capability allows for individualized risk assessment and making informed treatment decisions tailored to a patient's unique disease kinetics. The represented approach contributes to the development of a scalable and cost-effective virtual human twin system for optimized healthcare resource utilization and improved patient outcomes in multiple myeloma care.</description>

      <title>An algorithmic framework for synthetic cost-aware decision making in molecular design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02187v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small molecules exhibiting desirable property profiles are often discovered through an iterative process of designing, synthesizing, and testing sets of molecules. The selection of molecules to synthesize from all possible candidates is a complex decision-making process that typically relies on expert chemist intuition. We propose a quantitative decision-making framework, SPARROW, that prioritizes molecules for evaluation by balancing expected information gain and synthetic cost. SPARROW integrates molecular design, property prediction, and retrosynthetic planning to balance the utility of testing a molecule with the cost of batch synthesis. We demonstrate through three case studies that the developed algorithm captures the non-additive costs inherent to batch synthesis, leverages common reaction steps and intermediates, and scales to hundreds of molecules. SPARROW is open source and can be found at http://github.com/coleygroup/sparrow.</description>

      <title>Transition Path Sampling with Boltzmann Generator-based MCMC Moves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sampling all possible transition paths between two 3D states of a molecular system has various applications ranging from catalyst design to drug discovery. Current approaches to sample transition paths use Markov chain Monte Carlo and rely on time-intensive molecular dynamics simulations to find new paths. Our approach operates in the latent space of a normalizing flow that maps from the molecule's Boltzmann distribution to a Gaussian, where we propose new paths without requiring molecular simulations. Using alanine dipeptide, we explore Metropolis-Hastings acceptance criteria in the latent space for exact sampling and investigate different latent proposal mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Instrumental Variable Estimation for Compositional Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.11234v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many scientific datasets are compositional in nature. Important biological examples include species abundances in ecology, cell-type compositions derived from single-cell sequencing data, and amplicon abundance data in microbiome research. Here, we provide a causal view on compositional data in an instrumental variable setting where the composition acts as the cause. First, we crisply articulate potential pitfalls for practitioners regarding the interpretation of compositional causes from the viewpoint of interventions and warn against attributing causal meaning to common summary statistics such as diversity indices in microbiome data analysis. We then advocate for and develop multivariate methods using statistical data transformations and regression techniques that take the special structure of the compositional sample space into account while still yielding scientifically interpretable results. In a comparative analysis on synthetic and real microbiome data we show the advantages and limitations of our proposal. We posit that our analysis provides a useful framework and guidance for valid and informative cause-effect estimation in the context of compositional data.</description>

      <title>Med-Real2Sim: Non-Invasive Medical Digital Twins using Physics-Informed Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A digital twin is a virtual replica of a real-world physical phenomena that uses mathematical modeling to characterize and simulate its defining features. By constructing digital twins for disease processes, we can perform in-silico simulations that mimic patients' health conditions and counterfactual outcomes under hypothetical interventions in a virtual setting. This eliminates the need for invasive procedures or uncertain treatment decisions. In this paper, we propose a method to identify digital twin model parameters using only noninvasive patient health data. We approach the digital twin modeling as a composite inverse problem, and observe that its structure resembles pretraining and finetuning in self-supervised learning (SSL). Leveraging this, we introduce a physics-informed SSL algorithm that initially pretrains a neural network on the pretext task of learning a differentiable simulator of a physiological process. Subsequently, the model is trained to reconstruct physiological measurements from noninvasive modalities while being constrained by the physical equations learned in pretraining. We apply our method to identify digital twins of cardiac hemodynamics using noninvasive echocardiogram videos, and demonstrate its utility in unsupervised disease detection and in-silico clinical trials.</description>
