      <title>Astroparticle Physics at the Forward Physics Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy collisions at the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) will generate a substantial flux of particles along the beam collision axis that current LHC experiments cannot access. Multi-particle production in the far-forward region is particularly relevant to astroparticle physics. High-energy cosmic rays initiate extensive air showers (EASs) in the atmosphere, driven by hadron-ion collisions at low momentum transfer in the non-perturbative regime of QCD. Therefore, understanding high-energy hadronic interactions in the forward region is essential for interpreting EAS data and estimating backgrounds for astrophysical neutrino searches, among other applications. The Forward Physics Facility (FPF) is a proposal to construct a new underground cavern at the HL-LHC dedicated to hosting a range of experiments aimed at detecting particles beyond the current capabilities of LHC experiments. This article will provide an update on the current planning status of the FPF and emphasize its synergies with astroparticle physics.</description>

      <title>Exotic and physics-informed support vector machines for high energy physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we explore machine learning techniques using support vector machines with two novel approaches: exotic and physics-informed support vector machines. Exotic support vector machines employ unconventional techniques such as genetic algorithms and boosting. Physics-informed support vector machines integrate the physics dynamics of a given high-energy physics process in a straightforward manner. The goal is to efficiently distinguish signal and background events in high-energy physics collision data. To test our algorithms, we perform computational experiments with simulated Drell-Yan events in proton-proton collisions. Our results highlight the superiority of the physics-informed support vector machines, emphasizing their potential in high-energy physics and promoting the inclusion of physics information in machine learning algorithms for future research.</description>

      <title>Evidence of $h_{b}(\text{2P}) \to \Upsilon(\text{1S})\eta$ decay and search for $h_{b}(\text{1P,2P}) \to \Upsilon(\text{1S})\pi^0$ with the Belle detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first evidence for the $h_{b}(\text{2P}) \to \Upsilon(\text{1S})\eta$ transition with a significance of $3.5$ standard deviations. The decay branching fraction is measured to be $\mathcal{B}[h_{b}(\text{2P}) \to \Upsilon(\text{1S})\eta]=(7.1 ~^{+3.7} _{-3.2}\pm 0.8)\times10^{-3}$, which is noticeably smaller than expected. We also set upper limits on $\pi^0$ transitions of $\mathcal{B}[h_{b}(\text{2P}) \to \Upsilon(\text{1S})\pi^0] &lt; 1.8\times10^{-3}$, and $\mathcal{B}[h_{b}(\text{1P})\to \Upsilon(\text{1S})\pi^0] &lt; 1.8\times10^{-3}$, at the $90\%$ confidence level. These results are obtained with a $131.4$~fb$^{-1}$ data sample collected near the $\Upsilon(\text{5S})$ resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy $e^+e^-$ collider.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the differential Higgs boson production cross sections in ATLAS and CMS experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive set of studies has been conducted to measure the fiducial differential cross sections of Higgs boson production by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. These analyses are based on proton-proton collision data collected by both experiments at the CERN LHC, with a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of up to 140 fb$^{-1}$. Fiducial Differential cross sections are measured for various observables sensitive to the production and decay of the Higgs boson. All measurements align with Standard Model predictions. The results are used to constrain potential anomalous interactions between the Higgs boson and other Standard Model particles.</description>

      <title>Prospects of angular correlation studies of identified hadrons in the LHC Run 3 with the ALICE experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of angular correlations of identified hadrons makes it possible to understand the impact of different processes that contribute to the hadronization mechanism in heavy-ion collisions and small collision systems. Depending on the quark composition and the system properties, the angular correlations exhibit different shapes.
  The mechanism of hadron production is non-perturbative, and because of that, only phenomenological models can be used. Those models still fail to fully describe hadron production. In particular, angular correlations for like-sign baryons are not reproduced by the models. The upgraded ALICE detector and the new analysis framework allow for precise measurements of baryon angular correlations which provide stronger constraints on the hadronization mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Backward DVCS on the pion in Sullivan processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to do a systematic feasibility study of measuring in backward region deeply virtual Compton scattering on the pion in Sullivan processes in the framework of collinear QCD factorization where pion to photon transition distribution amplitudes (TDAs) describe the photon content of the $\pi$ meson. Our approach employs TDAs based on the overlap of light front wave functions, using a previously developed pion light-front wave function and deriving a consistent model for the light front wave functions of the photon. This work is expected to lead us to an estimate of the cross-sections that could be measured in the future U.S. and China's electron-ion colliders. It will also provide a comparison with the forward Sullivan DVCS case, which gives access to pion GPDs and for which a strong signal is expected.</description>

      <title>Muon-induced baryon number violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for charged-lepton flavor violation in muon capture on nuclei is a powerful probe of heavy new physics. A smoking gun signal for $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion is a monochromatic electron with energy almost equal to the muon mass. We show that light new physics can mimic this signature and that it can also lead to electrons above the $\mu \rightarrow e$ signal peak. A concrete example of such light new physics is $\mu^- $-nucleon annihilation into a light dark sector, which can produce an energetic $e^-$ as well as $e^+e^-$ byproducts. Due to the size of the muon mass, the exotic muon capture process can be kinematically allowed, while the otherwise stringent constraints, e.g., from proton decay, are kinematically forbidden. We also discuss other relevant constraints, including those from the stability of nuclei and muon capture in the interior of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>EFT at JADE: a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As we use the standard model effective field theory to search for signs of new physics beyond the reach of the LHC, we often wonder what we may learn from the effective field theory, and what it would look like to make a discovery via effective field theory. This article presents a case study that provides some answers to these questions. We apply the low-energy effective field theory to $e^+e^- \to \mu^+\mu^-$ data below the Z boson mass from the JADE experiment at DESY. The low-energy effective field theory allows the observation of physics beyond QED in the JADE data and furthermore, by matching the Wilson coefficients to the electroweak theory, a rough measurement of the masses of the W and Z bosons is possible. This rough measurement would have been sufficient to guide the construction of colliders such as the super proton-antiproton synchrotron or the large electron-positron collider, and so we anticipate that a discovery of new physics via effective field theory at the LHC would be similarly sufficient to guide the construction of future colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the systematic uncertainty and biases introduced by theoretical assumptions needed to include large-$x$ DIS data in a global QCD analysis. Working in the CTEQ-JLab framework, we focus on different implementations of higher-twist corrections to the nucleon structure functions and of offshell PDF deformations in deuteron targets and discuss how their interplay impacts the extraction of the $d$-quark PDF and the calculation of the neutron structure function at large $x$.</description>

      <title>Charm physics with overlap fermions on 2+1-flavor domain wall fermion configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decay constants of pseudoscalar mesons $D$, $D_s$, $\eta_c$ and vector mesons $D^*$, $D_s^*$, $J/\psi$ are determined from $N_f=2+1$ lattice QCD at a lattice spacing $a\sim0.08$ fm. For vector mesons, the decay constants defined by tensor currents are given in the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme at $2$ GeV. The calculation is performed on domain wall fermion configurations generated by the RBC-UKQCD Collaborations and the overlap fermion action is used for the valence quarks. Comparing the current results with our previous ones at a coarser lattice spacing $a\sim0.11$ fm gives us a better understanding of the discretization error. We obtain $f_{D_s^*}^T(\overline{\rm MS},\text{2 GeV})/f_{D_s^*}=0.907(20)$ with a better precision than our previous result. Combining our $f_{D_s^*}=277(11)$ MeV with the total width of $D_s^*$ determined in a recent work gives a branching fraction $4.26(52)\times10^{-5}$ for $D_s^*$ leptonic decay.</description>

      <title>Role of clustered nuclear geometry in particle production through p-C and p-O collisions at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-range multi-particle correlations in heavy-ion collisions have shown conclusive evidence of the hydrodynamic behavior of strongly interacting matter, and are associated with the final-state azimuthal momentum anisotropy. In small collision systems, azimuthal anisotropy can be influenced by the hadronization mechanism and residual jet-like correlations. Thus, one of the motives of the planned p--O and O--O collisions at the LHC and RHIC is to understand the origin of small system collectivity. As the anisotropic flow coefficients ($v_n$) are sensitive to the initial-state effects including nuclear shape, deformation, and charge density profiles, studies involving $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O nuclei are transpiring due to the presence of exotic $\alpha$ ($^{4}$He) clusters in such nuclei. In this study, for the first time, we investigate the effects of nuclear $\alpha$--clusters on the azimuthal anisotropy of the final-state hadrons in p--C and p--O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}= 9.9$ TeV within a multi-phase transport model framework. We report the transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) and pseudorapidity ($\eta$) spectra, participant eccentricity ($\epsilon_2$) and triangularity ($\epsilon_3$), and estimate the elliptic flow ($v_2$) and triangular flow ($v_3$) of the final-state hadrons using the two-particle cumulant method. These results are compared with a model-independent Sum of Gaussians (SOG) type nuclear density profile for $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O nuclei.</description>

      <title>An event generator for neutrino-induced Deep Inelastic Scattering and applications to neutrino astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the recently presented, fully exclusive, next-to-leading-order accurate event generator for the simulation of massless neutral- and charged-current deep inelastic scattering (DIS) to the case of incoming neutrinos. The generator can be used to study neutrino-nucleon interactions at (ultra) high energies, and is relevant for a range of fixed-target collider experiments and large-volume neutrino detectors, investigating atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos. The matching with multi-purpose event generators such as PYTHIA 8 is performed with the POWHEG method, and accounts for parton showering and non-perturbative effects such as hadronization. This makes it possible to investigate higher-order perturbative corrections to realistic observables, such as the distribution of charged particles. To illustrate the capabilities of the code we provide predictions for several differential distributions in fixed-target collisions for neutrino energies up to 1 PeV.</description>

      <title>CP Violation of Baryon Decays from $N\pi$ Scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a long-standing puzzle that the CP violation (CPV) in the baryon systems has never been well established in experiments, while the CPV of mesons have been observed by decades. In this paper, we propose that the CPV of baryon decays can be generated by the scatterings of a nucleon and a pion into some final states, i.e. $N\pi$ scatterings. Benefited by the fruitful data of $N\pi$ scatterings, we can model-independently analyse the strong phases of $b$-baryon decays using the partial wave amplitudes of $N\pi$ scatterings. This makes a great advantage to predict the CPV of baryon decays. We study the processes of $\Lambda_b^0\to (p\pi^+\pi^-)h^-$, $(p\pi^0)h^-$ with $h=\pi$ or $K$. It is found that the total CPV of the above processes in the invariant mass region of $N\pi$ scatterings are at the order of several percent. More importantly, the regional CPV in the Dalitz plot can reach as large as $20\%$. Therefore, we suggest to measure the CPV of these processes, which has a large possibility to achieve the first observation of CPV in the baryon system.</description>

      <title>Compact Ion Beam System for Fusion Demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a compact ion beam device capable of accelerating H$^+$ and D$^+$ ions up to 75keV energy, on to a solid target, with sufficient beam current to study fusion reactions. The ion beam system uses a microwave driven plasma source to generate ions that are accelerated to high energy with a DC acceleration structure. The plasma source is driven by pulsed microwaves from a solid-state RF amplifier, which is impedance matched to the plasma source chamber at the ISM band frequency (2.4-2.5GHz). The plasma chamber is held at high positive DC potential and is isolated from the impedance matching structure (at ground potential) by a dielectric-filled gap. To facilitate the use of high-energy-particle detectors near the target, the plasma chamber is biased to a high positive voltage, while the target remains grounded. A target loaded with deuterium is used to study D-D fusion and a B$_4$C or LaB$_6$ target is used to study p-$^{11}$B fusion. Detectors include solid-state charged particle detector and a scintillation fast neutron detector. The complete ion beam system can fit on a laboratory table and is a useful tool for teaching undergraduate and graduate students about the physics of fusion.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing a Heavy Neutral Lepton at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heavy lepton singlets $N$ slightly mixed with a standard neutrino $\nu_\ell$ are usually searched at the LHC in the trilepton plus $p_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}$ channel: $pp \to W^+ \to \ell^+ N$ with $N\to \ell^- W^+ \to \ell^- \ell'^+ \nu$. We show that for $m_N&gt;m_W$ the mass of the heavy lepton can be reconstructed. For $m_N\approx 90$-$130$ GeV and the current luminosity (138 fb$^{-1}$ at 13 TeV), we estimate that this reconstruction would set the bound on $|V_{\ell N}|^2$ at $4\times 10^{-4}$, versus the limit around $2\times 10^{-3}$ obtained in a recent CMS analysis or $|V_{\ell N}|^2&lt;10^{-3}$ from flavor and electroweak precision data.</description>

      <title>Global analysis of fragmentation functions to charged hadrons with high-precision data from the LHC</title>

Abstract: Fragmentation functions (FFs) are essential non-perturbative QCD inputs for predicting hadron production cross sections in high energy scatterings. In this study, we present a joint determination of FFs for light charged hadrons through a global analysis at next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD. Our analysis incorporates a wide range of precision measurements from the LHC, as well as data from electron-positron collisions and semi-inclusive deep inelastic scatterings. By including measurements of jet fragmentation at the LHC in our global analysis, we are able to impose strong constraints on the gluon FFs. A careful selection of hadron kinematics is applied to ensure the validity of factorization and perturbative calculations of QCD. In addition, we introduce several methodological advances in fitting, resulting in a flexible parametrization form and the inclusion of theoretical uncertainties from perturbative calculations. Our best-fit predictions show very good agreement with the global data, with $\chi^2/N_{pt}\sim 0.90$. We also generate a large number of Hessian error sets to estimate uncertainties and correlations of the extracted FFs. FFs to charged pions (kaons and protons) are well constrained for momentum fractions down to 0.01 (0.1). Total momentum of partons carried by light charged hadrons are determined precisely. Their values for $u$, $d$ quarks and gluon saturate at about 50\% for a lower cut of the momentum fraction of 0.01. Pulls from individual datasets and impact of various choices of the analysis are also studied in details. Additionally, we present an update of the FMNLO program used for calculating hadron production cross sections. Our FFs, including the error sets (denoted as NPC23), are publicly available in the form of LHAPDF6 grids.</description>

      <title>Internal structure of the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ from its light-quark mass dependence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a chiral effective field theory-based approach to connect $DD^*$ scattering observables at the physical and variable pion masses accessible in lattice QCD simulations. We incorporate all relevant scales associated with three-body $DD\pi$ dynamics and the left-hand cut induced by the one-pion exchange for pion masses higher than the physical one, as required by analyticity and unitarity. By adjusting the contact interactions to match experimental data at the physical pion mass and lattice finite-volume energy levels at $m_{\pi} = 280$ MeV, we predict the trajectory of the $T_{cc}$ pole as a function of the pion mass, finding it consistent with the hadronic-molecule scenario. In particular, we find that the explicit treatment of the one-pion exchange has a pronounced effect on the pole trajectory for $m_\pi \gtrsim 230$ MeV by pushing it into the complex energy plane.</description>

      <title>Autoencoders for Real-Time SUEP Detection</title>

Abstract: Confining dark sectors with pseudo-conformal dynamics can produce Soft Unclustered Energy Patterns (SUEP), at the Large Hadron Collider: the production of dark quarks in proton-proton collisions leading to a dark shower and the high-multiplicity production of dark hadrons. The final experimental signature is spherically-symmetric energy deposits by an anomalously large number of soft Standard Model particles with a transverse energy of O(100) MeV. Assuming Yukawa-like couplings of the scalar portal state, the dominant production mode is gluon fusion, and the dominant background comes from multi-jet QCD events. We have developed a deep learning-based Anomaly Detection technique to reject QCD jets and identify any anomalous signature, including SUEP, in real-time in the High-Level Trigger system of the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. A deep convolutional neural autoencoder network has been trained using QCD events by taking transverse energy deposits in the inner tracker, electromagnetic calorimeter, and hadron calorimeter sub-detectors as 3-channel image data. Due to the sparse nature of the data, only ~0.5% of the total ~300 k image pixels have non-zero values. To tackle this challenge, a non-standard loss function, the inverse of the so-called Dice Loss, is exploited. The trained autoencoder with learned spatial features of QCD jets can detect 40% of the SUEP events, with a QCD event mistagging rate as low as 2%. The model inference time has been measured using the Intel CoreTM i5-9600KF processor and found to be ~20 ms, which perfectly satisfies the High-Level Trigger system's latency of O(100) ms. Given the virtue of the unsupervised learning of the autoencoders, the trained model can be applied to any new physics model that predicts an experimental signature anomalous to QCD jets.</description>

      <title>Projected WIMP sensitivity of the CDEX-50 dark matter experiment</title>

Abstract: CDEX-50 is a next-generation project of the China Dark Matter Experiment (CDEX) that aims to search for dark matter using a 50-kg germanium detector array. This paper comprises a thorough summary of the CDEX-50 dark matter experiment, including an investigation of potential background sources and the development of a background model. Based on the baseline model, the projected sensitivity of weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) is also presented. The expected background level within the energy region of interest, set to 2--2.5 keVee, is $\sim$0.01 counts keVee$^{-1}$ kg$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$. At 90\% confidence level, the expected sensitivity to spin-independent WIMP-nucleon couplings is estimated to reach a cross-section of 5.1 $\times$ 10$^{-45}$ cm$^{2}$ for a WIMP mass of 5 GeV/c$^{2}$ with an exposure objective of 150 kg$\cdot$year and an analysis threshold of 160 eVee. This science goal will correspond to the most sensitive results for WIMPs with a mass of 2.2--8 GeV/c$^{2}$.</description>

      <title>CALPAGAN: Calorimetry for Particles using GANs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, a novel approach is demonstrated for converting calorimeter images from fast simulations to those akin to comprehensive full simulations, utilizing conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The concept of pix2pix is tailored for CALPAGAN, where images from fast simulations serve as the basis(condition) for generating outputs that closely resemble those from detailed simulations. The findings indicate a strong correlation between the generated images and those from full simulations, especially in terms of key observables like jet transverse momentum distribution, jet mass, jet subjettiness, and jet girth. Additionally, the paper explores the efficacy of this method and its intrinsic limitations. This research marks a significant step towards exploring more efficient simulation methodologies in High Energy Particle Physics.</description>

      <title>Test of lepton flavor universality in B$^{\pm}$ $\to$ K$^{\pm}\mu^+\mu^-$ and B$^{\pm}$ $\to$ K$^{\pm}$e$^+$e$^-$ decays in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A test of lepton flavor universality in B$^{\pm}$ $\to$ K$^{\pm}\mu^+\mu^-$ and B$^{\pm}$ $\to$ K$^{\pm}$e$^+$e$^-$ decays, as well as a measurement of differential and integrated branching fractions of a nonresonant B$^{\pm}$ $\to$ K$^{\pm}\mu^+\mu^-$ decay are presented. The analysis is made possible by a dedicated data set of proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV recorded in 2018, by the CMS experiment at the LHC, using a special high-rate data stream designed for collecting about 10 billion unbiased b hadron decays. The ratio of the branching fractions $\mathcal{B}$(B$^{\pm}$ $\to$ K$^{\pm}\mu^+\mu^-$) to $\mathcal{B}$(B$^{\pm}$ $\to$ K$^{\pm}$e$^+$e$^-$) is determined from the measured double ratio $R$(K) of these decays to the respective branching fractions of the B$^\pm$ $\to$ J/$\psi$K$^\pm$ with J/$\psi$ $\to$ $\mu^+\mu^-$ and e$^+$e$^-$ decays, which allow for significant cancellation of systematic uncertainties. The ratio $R$(K) is measured in the range 1.1 $\lt$ $q^2$ $\lt$ 6.0 GeV$^2$, where $q$ is the invariant mass of the lepton pair, and is found to be $R$(K) = 0.78 $^{+0.47}_{-0.23}$, in agreement with the standard model expectation $R$(K) $\approx$ 1. This measurement is limited by the statistical precision of the electron channel. The integrated branching fraction in the same $q^2$ range, $\mathcal{B}$(B$^{\pm}$ $\to$ K$^{\pm}\mu^+\mu^-$) = (12.42 $\pm$ 0.68) $\times$ 10$^{-8}$, is consistent with the present world-average value and has a comparable precision.</description>

Abstract: Three machine learning models are used to perform jet origin classification. These models are optimized for deployment on a field-programmable gate array device. In this context, we demonstrate how latency and resource consumption scale with the input size and choice of algorithm. Moreover, the models proposed here are designed to work on the type of data and under the foreseen conditions at the CERN LHC during its high-luminosity phase. Through quantization-aware training and efficient synthetization for a specific field programmable gate array, we show that $O(100)$ ns inference of complex architectures such as Deep Sets and Interaction Networks is feasible at a relatively low computational resource cost.</description>

Abstract: In high energy physics experiments, the numerical estimation of primary ionization is crucial. An advance study on primary ionization can help in minimizing the effects such as electrical discharges that can damage the gaseous detectors used in high energy physics experiments. The simulation of primary ionization of electrons and positrons with the noble gases using the geant4 toolkit have been presented. The obtained primaries have been separated from secondaries as the later contribute towards electrical discharges and further damage the detectors. The xenon gas shows highest primary ionization among the noble gases.</description>

Abstract: We report a study of the hadronic transitions $\chi_{bJ}(2P)\to\omega\Upsilon(1S)$, with $\omega\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\pi^{0}$, using $28.2\times10^6~\Upsilon(3S)$ mesons recorded by the Belle detector. We present the first evidence for the near--threshold transition $\chi_{b0}(2P)\to\omega\Upsilon(1S)$, the analog of the charm sector decay $\chi_{c1}(3872)\to\omega J/\psi$, with a branching fraction of $\mathcal{B}\big(\chi_{b0}(2P)\to\omega\Upsilon(1S)\big) = \big(0.55\pm0.19\pm0.07\big)\%$. We also obtain branching fractions of $\mathcal{B}\big(\chi_{b1}(2P)\to\omega\Upsilon(1S)\big) = \big(2.39{}^{+0.20}_{-0.19}\pm0.24\big)\%$ and $\mathcal{B}\big(\chi_{b2}(2P)\to\omega\Upsilon(1S)\big) = \big(0.47{}^{+0.13}_{-0.12}\pm0.06\big)\%$, confirming the measurement of the $\omega$ transitions of the $J=1,2~P$--wave states. The ratio for the $J=2$ to $J=1$ transitions is also measured and found to differ by 3.3 standard deviations from the expected value in the QCD multipole expansion.</description>

      <title>Towards observation of three-nucleon short-range correlations in high Q^2 A(e, e')X reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07629</link>
      <description>arXiv:1803.07629v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of kinematical and dynamical conditions necessary for probing highly elusive three-nucleon short range correlations~(3N-SRCs) in nuclei through inclusive electron scattering. The kinematic requirements that should be satisfied in order to isolate 3N-SRCs in inclusive processes are derived. We demonstrate that a sequence of two short-range NN interactions represents the main mechanism for 3N-SRCs in inclusive processes. Within this mechanism we predict a quadratic dependence of the inclusive cross section ratios of nuclei to $^3$He in the 3N-SRC region to the same ratio measured in 2N-SRC domain. The extended analysis of the available data satisfying the necessary 3N-SRC kinematical conditions is presented. This analysis provides tantalizing signatures of scaling associated with the onset of 3N-SRC dominance. The same data are also consistent with the prediction of the quadratic relation between the ratios measured in the 3N and 2N-SRC regions for nuclei ranging $4 \le A \le 197$. This agreement made it possible to extract $a_3(A)$, the probability of 3N-SRCs relative to the A=3 nucleus. We find $a_3(A)$ to be significantly larger in magnitude than the analogous parameter, $a_2(A)$, for 2N-SRCs.</description>

      <title>Exciting Ions: a Systematic Treatment of Ultraperipheral Heavy Ion Collisions with Nuclear Breakup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an updated theoretical treatment of ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) of heavy ions, within the SuperChic Monte Carlo generator. This in particular accounts for mutual ion excitation through additional photon exchanges between the colliding ions. This effect occurs frequently in UPCs, and indeed can be (and has been) measured in data through the use of zero degree calorimeter (ZDC) detectors installed in the far forward region. The theoretical approach presented here accounts for the non-trivial and non-negligible impact such ion dissociation has on the measured cross sections and distributions of the produced particles in the central detectors. This builds on previous work, whereby the survival factor probability of no additional inelastic ion-ion scattering due to the strong interaction, and its kinematic impact, are also accounted for within the same overall framework. We compare to data from ATLAS and CMS at the LHC, and STAR at RHIC, and find in general encouraging agreement for a range of observables and ZDC neutron tags, with some room for further improvement, suggesting the inclusion of higher order QED effects and/or tuning of the the $\gamma A \to A^*$ cross section may be desirable. Overall, this gives confidence in the approach considered here and for applications to new phenomena within and beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>When the Machine Chimes the Bell: Entanglement and Bell Inequalities with Boosted $t\bar{t}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07075v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Large Hadron Collider provides a unique opportunity to study quantum entanglement and violation of Bell inequalities at the highest energy available today. In this paper, we will investigate these quantum correlations with top quark pair production, which represents a system of two-qubits. The spacelike separation requirement for the two causally disconnected top quarks requires they fly relativistically away from each other, which motivates the use of the boosted top-tagging with the semi-leptonic top pair channel. Although measuring the spin polarization of the hadronic top quark is known to be challenging, our study indicates that it is feasible to reconstruct the spin density matrix of the two-qubit system using an optimal hadronic polarimeter. This is achieved with the aid of jet substructure techniques and NN-inspired reconstruction methods, which improve the mapping between subjets and quarks. We find that entanglement can already be observed at more than $5\sigma$ level with existing data, and violation of Bell inequalities may be probed above 4$\sigma$ level at the HL-LHC with 3 ab$^{-1}$ of data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit our argument that shows that parton distribution Functions (PDFs) in the MSbar{ scheme are non-negative in the perturbative region, with the main goals of elucidating its domain of validity and clarifying its theoretical underpinnings. We specifically discuss recent results proving that PDFs can turn negative at sufficiently low scale, we clarify quantitatively various aspects of our derivation of positivity in the perturbative region, and we provide an estimate for the scale above which PDF positivity holds.</description>

      <title>Neutrino CP Measurement in the Presence of RG Running with Mismatched Momentum Transfers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The neutrino mixing parameters are expected to have RG running effect in the presence of new physics. If the momentum transfers at production and detection mismatch with each other, the oscillation probabilities are generally modified and become dependent on not just the neutrino energy but also the momentum transfer. Even in the limit of vanishing baseline, the transition probability for the appearance channel is interestingly not zero. This would significantly affect the sensitivity of the genuine leptonic Dirac CP phase. We further explore the possibility of combing the long- and short-baseline neutrino experiments to constrain such RG running effect for the purpose of guaranteeing the CP measurement. To simulate the double dependence on the neutrino energy and momentum transfer, we extend the usual GLoBES simulation of fixed baseline experiments and use a two-dimensional $\chi^2$ analysis to obtain sensitivities.</description>

      <title>The Design and Technology Development of the JUNO Central Detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) is a large scale neutrino experiment with multiple physics goals including deter mining the neutrino mass hierarchy, the accurate measurement of neutrino oscillation parameters, the neutrino detection from the super nova, the Sun, and the Earth, etc. JUNO puts forward physically and technologically stringent requirements for its central detector (CD), including a large volume and target mass (20 kt liquid scintillator, LS), a high energy resolution (3% at 1 MeV), a high light transmittance, the largest possible photomultiplier (PMT) coverage, the lowest possible radioactive background, etc. The CD design, using a spherical acrylic vessel with a diameter of 35.4 m to contain the LS and a stainless steel structure to support the acrylic vessel and PMTs, was chosen and optimized. The acrylic vessel and the stainless steel structure will be immersed in pure water to shield the radioactive back ground and bear great buoyancy. The challenging requirements of the acrylic sphere have been achieved, such as a low intrinsic radioactivity and high transmittance of the manufactured acrylic panels, the tensile and compressive acrylic node design with embedded stainless steel pad, one-time polymerization for multiple bonding lines. Moreover, several technical challenges of the stainless steel structure have been solved: the production of low radioactivity stainless steel material, the deformation and precision control during production and assembly, the usage of high strength stainless steel rivet bolt and of high friction efficient linkage plate. Finally, the design of the ancillary equipment like the LS filling, overflowing and circulating system was done.</description>

      <title>The Path to N$^3$LO Parton Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the existing leading (LO), next-to-leading (NLO), and next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) NNPDF4.0 sets of parton distribution functions (PDFs) to approximate next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (aN$^3$LO). We construct an approximation to the N$^3$LO splitting functions that includes all available partial information from both fixed-order computations and from small and large $x$ resummation, and estimate the uncertainty on this approximation by varying the set of basis functions used to construct the approximation. We include known N$^3$LO corrections to deep-inelastic scattering structure functions and extend the FONLL general-mass scheme to $\mathcal{O}\left( \alpha_s^3\right)$ accuracy. We determine a set of aN$^3$LO PDFs by accounting both for the uncertainty on splitting functions due to the incomplete knowledge of N$^3$LO terms, and to the uncertainty related to missing higher corrections (MHOU), estimated by scale variation, through a theory covariance matrix formalism. We assess the perturbative stability of the resulting PDFs, we study the impact of MHOUs on them, and we compare our results to the aN$^3$LO PDFs from the MSHT group. We examine the phenomenological impact of aN$^3$LO corrections on parton luminosities at the LHC, and give a first assessment of the impact of aN$^3$LO PDFs on the Higgs and Drell-Yan total production cross-sections. We find that the aN$^3$LO NNPDF4.0 PDFs are consistent within uncertainties with their NNLO counterparts, that they improve the description of the global dataset and the perturbative convergence of Higgs and Drell-Yan cross-sections, and that MHOUs on PDFs decrease substantially with the increase of perturbative order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of the Efimov effect in the $D^*D^*D^*$ system is explored under the assumption that the heavy partner of the $T_{cc}^+$ exists as a $D^*D^*$ molecule with $(I)J^P=(0)1^+$. The three-to-three relativistic scattering amplitude is obtained from the ladder amplitude formalism, built from an energy-dependent contact two-body potential where the molecular component of the $T_{cc}^*$ state can be varied. We find that $(I)J^P=(\tfrac{1}{2})0^-$ three-body bound states can be formed, with properties that suggest that the Efimov effect can be realised for reasonable values of the molecular probability and binding energy of the $T_{cc}^*$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern particle physics experiments usually rely on highly complex and large-scale spectrometer devices. In high energy physics experiments, visualization helps detector design, data quality monitoring, offline data processing, and has great potential for improving physics analysis. In addition to the traditional physics data analysis based on statistical methods, visualization provides unique intuitive advantages in searching for rare signal events and reducing background noises. By applying the event display tool to several physics analyses in the BESIII experiment, we demonstrate that visualization can benefit potential physics discovery and improve the signal significance. With the development of modern visualization techniques, it is expected to play a more important role in future data processing and physics analysis of particle physics experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several current measurements of $b \rightarrow s l^+ l^-$ processes are in tension with Standard Model predictions, whereas others (e.g.\ $R_K$ and $R_{K^\ast}$) are in reasonable agreement with them. We examine some recent $Z^\prime$ models that fit the data as a whole appreciably better than does the Standard Model, confronting the models with ATLAS resonance searches in the $e^+e^-$ and $\mu^+\mu^-$ channels. Both channels constrain the models; we find that the searches rule out less than one fifth of the allowed range of $M_{Z^\prime}$. We estimate that the HL-LHC can roughly double the current sensitivity in $M_{Z^\prime}$, but covering the whole parameter space would take a more powerful machine, such as a 100 TeV $pp$ collider.</description>

      <title>Steady electric currents in magnetized QCD and their use for the equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the emergence of steady electric currents in QCD as a response to a non-uniform magnetic background using lattice simulations with 2 + 1 quark flavors at the physical point, as well as leading-order chiral perturbation theory. Using these currents, we develop a novel method to determine the leading-order coefficient of the equation of state in a magnetic field expansion: the magnetic susceptibility of the QCD medium. We decompose the current expectation value into valence- and sea-quark contributions and demonstrate that the dominant contribution to the electric current is captured by the valence term alone, allowing for a comparably cheap determination of the susceptibility. Our continuum extrapolated lattice results for the equation of state confirm the findings of some of the existing studies in the literature, namely that the QCD medium behaves diamagnetically at low and paramagnetically at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>The third family quark mass hierarchy and FCNC in the universal seesaw model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the study of the quark sector of the universal seesaw model with $\mathrm{SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{Y'}}$ gauge symmetry in the massless case of the two lightest quark families. This model aims to explain the mass hierarchy of the third family quark by introducing a vector-like quark (VLQ) partner for each quark. In this model, we introduce $\mathrm{SU(2)_L}$ and $\mathrm{SU(2)_R}$ Higgs doublets. We derive explicitly the Lagrangian for the quark sector, Higgs sector, and kinetic terms of the gauge fields, starting from the Lagrangian, which is invariant under $\mathrm{SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{Y'}}$ gauge symmetry. At each stage of the symmetry breaking, we present the Lagrangian with the remaining gauge symmetry. Additionally, we investigate the flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNC) of Higgs ($h$) and $Z$-boson in the interaction with the top, heavy top, bottom, and heavy bottom quark.</description>
