      <title>Modeling Non-Gaussianities in Pulsar Timing Array data analysis using Gaussian Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) data analysis, noise is typically assumed to be Gaussian, and the marginalized likelihood has a well-established analytical form derived within the framework of Gaussian processes. However, this Gaussianity assumption may break down for certain classes of astrophysical and cosmological signals, particularly for a gravitational wave background (GWB) generated by a population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). In this work, we present a new method for testing the presence of non-Gaussian features in PTA data. We go beyond the Gaussian assumption by modeling the noise or signal statistics using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). An advantage of this approach is that the marginalization of the likelihood remains fully analytical, expressed as a linear combination of Gaussian PTA likelihoods. This makes the method straightforward to implement within existing data analysis tools. Moreover, this method extends beyond the free spectrum analysis by producing posterior probability distributions of higher-order moments inferred from the data, which can be incorporated into spectral refitting techniques. We validate the model using simulations and demonstrate the sensitivity of PTAs to non-Gaussianity by computing the Bayes factor in favor of the GMM as a function of the injected excess moments. We apply the method to a more astrophysically motivated scenario where a single SMBHB is resolved on top of a Gaussian GWB and show that significant non-Gaussianities are introduced by the individual source. Finally, we test our model on a realistic GWB generated from a simulated population of SMBHBs.</description>

      <title>Optimized smoothing kernels for SPH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a set of new smoothing kernels for smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) that improve the convergence of the method without any additional computational cost. These kernels are generated through a linear combination of other SPH kernels, combined with an optimization strategy to minimize the error in the Gresho-Chan vortex test case. To facilitate the different choices in gradient operators for SPH in the literature, we perform this optimization for both geometric density average force SPH (GDSPH) and linear-corrected gradient SPH (ISPH). In addition to the Gresho-Chan vortex, we also perform simulations of the hydrostatic glass, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and the Sod shocktube case. At low neighbour numbers (&lt; 128), there is a significant improvement across the different tests, with the greatest impact shown for GDSPH. Apart from the popular Wendland kernels, we also explore other positive-definite kernels in this paper, which include the "missing" Wendland kernels, Wu kernels, and Buhmann kernels. In addition, we also present a method for producing arbitrary non-biased initial conditions in SPH. This method uses the SPH momentum equation together with an artificial pressure, combined with a global and local relaxation stage to minimize local and global errors.</description>

      <title>SKYSURF VIII -- Modeling SKYSURF Completeness Data for Comparison to the Hubble Space Telescope Exposure Time Calculator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately assessing image source completeness is critical for interpreting measurements on telescope data. Using the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) and Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) data from the Hubble Space Telescope ($HST$) archival project "SKYSURF", we model galaxy completeness as a function of the exposure time and background of an image. This is accomplished by adding simulated objects with varying magnitudes and sizes into these images, and determining the detection rate for each set of parameters. The fifty percent completeness results are then compared to the Exposure Time Calculator (ETC), in order to assess the differences between the STSCI ETC and our analysis of the archival data. Ultimately, we find that, for extended galaxies, the ETC predicts a 1-2 magnitudes fainter completeness limit than our data. We believe the difference is due to the ETC's flat surface brightness profiles being less accurate at predicting for extended sources compared to our more realistic profiles.</description>

      <title>A 2821 Star Optical SETI Survey using ESO HARPS archival data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examined archived observations of 2,821 stars taken by the high-resolution ESO HARPS spectrograph to search for potential narrow-band laser emissions from extraterrestrial sources. From one observation of each star, our search algorithm identified a total of 285 spectral peaks with line widths slightly larger than the instrument's point-spread function. After eliminating false positives (including cosmic rays, instrumental artifacts, and terrestrial airglow lines, we identified 8 sources worthy of follow-up observations. We then analyzed all 1,835 additional observations of these follow-up targets, looking for recurring signals. We found 1 additional unexplained candidate in this followup search, but no candidate spikes which repeated at the same wavelength as one of the initial candidates at a later time. Further analysis identified one candidate as a likely faint airglow line. The remaining seven candidates continued to defy all false positive categories, including interference by LiDAR satellites and adaptive optics lasers from neighboring observatories. However, observations of other stars on the same night showed identical spectral spikes (in the telescope's reference frame) for four of these seven candidates -- indicating an as-yet unknown terrestrial source. This leaves 3 final candidates which currently defy the prosaic explanations examined thus far, show no indication of a terrestrial origin and therefore warrant further investigation. Two of these three candidates originate from M-Type stars and one of them originates from an oscillating red giant, so follow-up work will need to disentangle natural astrophysical stellar processes from potential SETI sources.</description>

      <title>Additive manufacturing in aluminium of a primary mirror for a CubeSat application: manufacture, testing and evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additive manufacturing (AM; 3D Printing), a process which creates a part layer-by-layer, has the potential to improve upon conventional lightweight mirror manufacturing techniques, including subtractive (milling), formative (casting) and fabricative (bonding) manufacturing. Increased mass reduction whilst maintaining mechanical performance can be achieved through the creation of intricate lattice geometries, which are impossible to manufacture conventionally. Further, part consolidation can be introduced to reduce the number of interfaces and thereby points of failure. AM design optimisation using computational tools has been extensively covered in existing literature. However, additional research, specifically evaluation of the optical surface, is required to qualify these results before these advantages can be realised. This paper outlines the development &amp; metrology of an AM mirror for a CubeSat platform with a targeted mass reduction of 60% compared to an equivalent solid body. This project aims to incorporate recent developments in AM mirror design, with a focus on manufacture, testing &amp; evaluation. This is achieved through a simplified design process of a Cassegrain telescope primary mirror mounted within a 3U CubeSat chassis. The mirror geometry is annular with an external diameter of 84 mm and an internal diameter of 32 mm; the optical prescription is flat for ease of manufacture. Prototypes were printed in AlSi10Mg, a low-cost aluminium alloy commonly used in metal additive manufacturing. They were then machined and single-point diamond turned to achieve a reflective surface. Both quantitative &amp; qualitative evaluations of the optical surface were conducted to assess the effect of hot isostatic pressing (HIP) on the optical surface quality. The results indicated that HIP reduced surface porosity; however, it also increased surface roughness and, consequently, optical scatter.</description>

      <title>Calibration and Performance Validation of the SST-1M Telescopes Using Crab Nebula Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SST-1M is a prototype single mirror Small Sized Cherenkov Telescope designed for very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray astronomy. With a 4 meter primary mirror and a 5.6 meter focal length, it provides a wide 9 degree optical field of view, optimized for detecting VHE gamma-rays from 1 TeV to several hundred TeV. Its focal plane is equipped with DigiCam, a fully digital trigger and readout camera made of 1296 silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) pixels. The use of SiPM sensors enables observation under high night sky background (NSB) conditions, significantly enhancing the instrument's duty cycle and allowing observations under moonlight.
  Currently, two SST-1M telescopes are deployed at the Ond\v rejov Observatory in the Czech Republic, operating in stereo, at 510 m altitude, to observe astrophysical sources. This contribution presents the SiPM calibration procedure and performance validation of the instrument, based on updated results from Crab Nebula observations.</description>

      <title>Photometric Stability of an EMCCD Camera at 1-s Exposures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of testing an iXonUltra 888 EMCCDcamera to determine the operating parameters for short-exposure photometry of stars. As a result of the testing, those camera modes were selected in which the temporal instability of the electron multiplication charge does not significantly affect the light curves. In addition, the photometry of the eclipsing variable star ZTFJ 0038+2030, obtained with the Zeiss-1000 telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences, is presented. We have shown the advantages and disadvantages of 1-s exposures for studying variable stars.</description>

      <title>Design and Commissioning of an LWA Swarm Station: The Long Wavelength Array -- North Arm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern radio interferometers are designed with increasingly sprawling geographical footprints, offering enhanced sensitivity and resolution. However, managing such extensive facilities presents operational challenges that can potentially impede or delay scientific progress. One solution to such obstacles is the `swarm telescope' concept which enables collaborative use of individual telescope systems, overseen by separate institutions, to create a more powerful and manageable facility. We present the design, construction, and commissioning of the Long Wavelength Array -- North Arm (LWA-NA) station, a prototype 64-element LWA Swarm telescope. LWA-NA is a cost-efficient, rapidly deployable platform for radio astronomy, and serves as a pathfinder for the larger LWA Swarm project.</description>

      <title>Toward Low-Latency, High-Fidelity Calibration of the LIGO Detectors with Enhanced Monitoring Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and reliable calibration of the Advanced LIGO detectors has enabled a plethora of gravitational-wave discoveries over the past decade, starting with the ground-breaking discovery, GW150914. Over the past ten years, the calibrated strain data from Advanced LIGO detectors has become available at a lower latency and with more reliability. In this paper, we discuss the relevant history of Advanced LIGO calibration and introduce new tools that have been developed to enable faster and more robust calibrated strain data products in the current observing run. We discuss improvements to the robustness, reliability, and accuracy of the low-latency calibration pipeline as well as the development of a new tool for monitoring the LIGO calibration in real time.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Benchmarking of GBEES Applied to Outer Planet Orbiter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moment-based estimation filters have successfully aided spacecraft navigation for decades. However, future missions plan to venture into deep-space regimes with significant round-trip light-time telecommunication delays, operate in unstable, quasi-periodic orbits, and perform highly precise, low-altitude flybys of outer planet moons. These complex trajectories may necessitate ensemble-based filters for accurate estimation over realistic measurement cadences. To mitigate the inherent risk associated with testing novel navigation software, ensemble filters must be accurate, efficient, and robust. Grid-based, Bayesian Estimation Exploiting Sparsity, a high-dimensional Godunov-type finite volume method that propagates the full probability distribution function, demonstrates strong overall performance across all these criteria when compared with the contemporary landscape of filters. These qualities are exhibited via a Bayesian investigation in which the state uncertainty of a Saturn-Enceladus Distant Prograde Orbit is propagated, incorporating infrequent, nonlinear measurement updates. Along with root mean square error, we use the Bhattacharyya coefficient, a non-normal metric for measuring the dissimilarity between distributions, and the Effective Sampling Size, a measure of particle degeneracy, to quantitatively ascertain that in this application, Grid-based, Bayesian Estimation Exploiting Sparsity outperforms the other ensemble filters assessed, though it comes at a nontrivial computational cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have introduced a new Fourier-expansion technique for computing gravitational-wave emission from non-spinning binaries in the post-Newtonian framework. Using this approach, we derived the full set of 3PN dynamical quantities and gravitational-wave Fourier modes and have released the corresponding numerical code as open source. Furthermore, applying the method to the tail contribution of the energy flux, we found that it can be resummed into an exceptionally compact expression. These advances pave the way for more convenient and accurate frequency-domain waveform modeling in the future.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) is an instrument onboard Aditya--L1, the first solar space observatory of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), India, launched on September 2, 2023. SUIT is designed to image the Sun in the 200--400 nm wavelength band in eight narrowband and three broadband filters. SUIT's science goals start with observing the solar atmosphere and large-scale continuum variations, the physics of solar flares in the NUV region, and many more. The paper elucidates the functioning of the instrument, software packages developed for easier calibration, analysis, and feedback, calibration routines, and the regular maintenance activity of SUIT during the first year of its operation. The paper also presents the various operations undergone by, numerous program sequences orchestrated to achieve the science requirements, and highlights some remarkable observations made during the first year of observations with SUIT.</description>

      <title>A New Method of Deriving Doppler Velocities for Solar Orbiter SPICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a follow-up to previous work on correcting PSF-induced Doppler artifacts in observations by the SPICE spectrograph on Solar Orbiter. In a previous paper, we demonstrated correction of these artifacts in the $y-\lambda$ plane with PSF Regularization, treating the forward problem with a method based on large sparse matrix inversion. It has since been found that similar apparent artifacts are also present in the $x-\lambda$ direction, i.e., across adjacent slit positions. This is difficult (although not impossible) to correct with the previous matrix inversion method due to the time variation between slit positions. We have therefore devised a new method which addresses both $x-\lambda$ and $y-\lambda$ artifacts simultaneously by applying wavelength dependent shifts at each $x-y$ plane of the spectral cube. This paper demonstrates the SPICE data issue, describes the new method, and shows a comparison with the previous one. We explore the time variation of the correction parameters for the SPICE data and show a clear orbit dependence. The results of the method are significantly higher quality derived Doppler signals, which we estimate at less than $\sim$ 5 km/s uncertainty for brighter lines in the absence of other systematics. Furthermore, we show the new SPICE polar observation results as a demonstration. The correction codes are written in Python, publicly available on GitHub, and can be directly applied to SPICE level 2 datasets.</description>

      <title>Investigating mutual coupling in the MWA Phase II compact array</title>

Abstract: Measurement of the power spectrum of high redshift 21 cm emission from neutral hydrogen probes the formation of the first luminous objects and the ionization of intergalactic medium by the first stars. However, the 21 cm signal at these redshifts is orders of magnitude fainter than astrophysical foregrounds, making it challenging to measure. Power spectrum techniques may be able to avoid these foregrounds by extracting foreground-free Fourier modes, but this is exacerbated by instrumental systematics that can add spectral structure to the data, leaking foreground power to the foreground-free Fourier modes. It is therefore imperative that any instrumental systematic effects are properly understood and mitigated. One such systematic occurs when neighboring antennas have undesired coupling. A systematic in Phase II data from the MWA was identified which manifests as excess correlation in the visibilities. One possible explanation for such an effect is mutual coupling between antennas. A numerical electromagnetic software simulation of the antenna beam using FEKO has been built to estimate the amplitude of this effect for multiple antennas in the MWA. The numerical model predicts an amplitude which exceeds the requirement to avoid spreading the foreground. More work is necessary to better validate the required level of coupling and to verify that approximations did not under estimate the level of coupling.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Pre-Trained Visual Transformers for Multi-Band Photometric Light Curve Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the potential of a pre-trained visual transformer (VT) model, specifically the Swin Transformer V2 (SwinV2), to classify photometric light curves without the need for feature extraction or multi-band preprocessing. The goal is to assess whether this image-based approach can accurately differentiate astronomical phenomena and serve as a viable option for working with multi-band photometric light curves. We transformed each multi-band light curve into an image. These images serve as input to the SwinV2 model, which is pre-trained on ImageNet-21K. The datasets employed include the public Catalog of Variable Stars from the Massive Compact Halo Object (MACHO) survey, using both one and two bands, and the first round of the recent Extended LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC), which includes six bands. The performance of the model was evaluated on six classes for the MACHO dataset and 20 distinct classes of variable stars and transient events for the ELAsTiCC dataset. The fine-tuned SwinV2 achieved better performance than models specifically designed for light curves, such as Astromer and the Astronomical Transformer for Time Series and Tabular Data (ATAT). When trained on the full MACHO dataset, it attained a macro F1-score of 80.2 and outperformed Astromer in single-band experiments. Incorporating a second band further improved performance, increasing the F1-score to 84.1. In the ELAsTiCC dataset, SwinV2 achieved a macro F1-score of 65.5, slightly surpassing ATAT by 1.3.</description>

      <title>MIRAC-5 on the MMT with MAPS: annular groove phase mask N-band coronagraphic upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the coronagraphic upgrade underway for the Mid-Infrared Array Camera-5 (MIRAC-5) to be used with the 6.5-m MMT telescope utilizing the new MMT Adaptive optics exoPlanet characterization System (MAPS). Mid-IR ground-based coronagraphic adaptive-optics-assisted imaging can be a powerful tool for characterizing exoplanet atmospheres and studying protoplanets in formation within circumstellar disks around young stars. In addition to enabling ground-based observations of bright targets in the background limit, high actuator density 1-2 kHz adaptive optics systems can be competitive with JWST in the contrast limit. We have procured an annular groove phase mask (AGPM) and performed preliminary characterization of its on-axis source rejection as a function of wavelength. We present an optimized Lyot Stop design for use with the AGPM using the High-contrast End-to-End Performance Simulator (HEEPS). Future work includes implementing the Quadrant Analysis of Coronagraphic Images for Tip-tilt Sensing (QACITS) control loop algorithm with MAPS. We present the system overview, pupil mask design, and expected performance metrics aligned with our scientific goals, building upon recent advances with MIRAC-5 (Bowens et al. 2025) and MAPS.</description>

      <title>Fringing analysis and forward modeling of Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) combines high contrast imaging with high resolution spectroscopy (R~35,000 in K band) to study directly imaged exoplanets and brown dwarfs in unprecedented detail. KPIC aims to spectrally characterize substellar companions through measurements of planetary radial velocities, spins, and atmospheric composition. Currently, the dominant source of systematic noise for KPIC is fringing, or oscillations in the spectrum as a function of wavelength. The fringing signal can dominate residuals by up to 10% of the continuum for high S/N exposures, preventing accurate wavelength calibration, retrieval of atmospheric parameters, and detection of planets with flux ratios less than 1% of the host star. To combat contamination from fringing, we first identify its three unique sources and adopt a physically informed model of Fabry-Perot cavities to apply to post-processed data. We find this strategy can effectively model the fringing in observations of A0V/F0V stars, reducing the residual systematics caused by fringing by a factor of 2. Next, we wedge two of the transmissive optics internal to KPIC to eliminate two sources of fringing and confirm the third source as the entrance window to the spectrograph. Finally, we apply our previous model of the Fabry-Perot cavity to new data taken with the wedged optics to reduce the amplitude of the residuals by a factor of 10.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Approaches for Black Hole Spin Estimation: From Classical Spectroscopy to Physics-Informed Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The measurement of black hole spin is considered one of the key problems in relativistic astrophysics. Existing methods, such as continuum fitting, X-ray reflection spectroscopy and quasi-periodic oscillation analysis, have systematic limitations in accuracy, interpretability and scalability. In this work, a hybrid approach is proposed in which theoretical models based on the Teukolsky formalism are integrated with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). A PINN model is developed to solve the linearized spin problem in the scalar case, with physical constraints directly embedded into the training process. Annotated data are not required; instead, the model is trained using the differential operator and boundary conditions as supervision. It is demonstrated that the PINN converges reliably, with residual loss values below 1e-7 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of the order of 1e-6 (final approx 5.4 x 1e-8). Benchmarking results indicate that the proposed method outperforms both classical and data-driven machine learning approaches in terms of AUC and sensitivity, while also exhibiting superior interpretability, generalizability and adherence to physical principles, with moderate computational cost. Potential extensions include integration with general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) solvers and application to real observational data. These findings support the viability of physics-based machine learning as a robust framework for accurate and interpretable black hole spin estimation.</description>
