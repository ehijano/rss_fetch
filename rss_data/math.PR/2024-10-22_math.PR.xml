      <title>Product systems arising from L\'evy processe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of product systems of Hilbert spaces derived from Banach space-valued L\'evy processes. We establish conditions under which these product systems are completely spatial and show that Gaussian L\'evy processes with non-degenerate covariance always give rise to product systems of type I. Furthermore, we construct a continuum of non-isomorphic product systems of type \(\rm{II}\sb\infty\) from pure jump L\'evy processes.</description>

      <title>Largest Eigenvalues of Principal Minors of Deformed Gaussian Orthogonal Ensembles and Wishart Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a high-dimensional Wishart matrix $\bd{W}=\bd{X}^T\bd{X}$ where the entries of $\bd{X}$ are i.i.d. random variables with mean zero, variance one, and a finite fourth moment $\eta$. Motivated by problems in signal processing and high-dimensional statistics, we study the maximum of the largest eigenvalues of any two-by-two principal minors of $\bd{W}$. Under certain restrictions on the sample size and the population dimension of $\bd{W}$, we obtain the limiting distribution of the maximum, which follows the Gumbel distribution when $\eta$ is between 0 and 3, and a new distribution when $\eta$ exceeds 3. To derive this result, we first address a simpler problem on a new object named a deformed Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE). The Wishart case is then resolved using results from the deformed GOE and a high-dimensional central limit theorem. Our proof strategy combines the Stein-Poisson approximation method, conditioning, U-statistics, and the H\'ajek projection. This method may also be applicable to other extreme-value problems. Some open questions are posed.</description>

      <title>On symmetric fuzzy stochastic Volterra integral equations with retardation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper contains a study on stochastic Volterra integral equations with fuzzy sets-values and involving on a constant retardation. Moreover, the form of the equation is symmetric in the sense that fuzzy stochastic integrals are placed on both sides of the equation. We show that the considered initial value problem formulated in terms of symmetric fuzzy stochastic Volterra integral equation is well-posed. In particular, we show that there exists a unique solution and this solution depends continuously on the parameters of the equation. The results are achieved with the conditions of Lipschitz continuity of drift and diffusion coefficients, and continuity of kernels</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computer assisted proof for a result concerning a three player betting game, introduced by Angel and Holmes. The three players start with initial capital $x, y, z &gt; 0$ respectively. At each step of this game two players are selected at random to bet on the outcome of a fair coin toss, with the size of the bet being the largest possible, namely the total capital held by the poorer of the two players at that time. The main quantity of interest is the probability of player 1 being eliminated (reaching 0 capital) first. Angel and Holmes have shown that this probability is not monotone decreasing as a function of the initial capital $x$ of player 1. They conjecture that if $x &lt; y &lt; z$ then player 1 would be better off (less likely to be eliminated first) by swapping their capital with another player.
  In this paper we present a computer-assisted proof of this conjecture. To achieve this, we introduce the theoretical framework MeshItUp, and then perform a two-stage reduction to make MeshItUp computationally feasible, through the use of mixed-integer programming.</description>

      <title>Entrance boundary for standard processes with no negative jumps and its application to exponential convergence to the Yaglom limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study standard processes with no negative jumps under the entrance boundary condition. Similarly to one-dimensional diffusions, we show that the process can be made into a Feller process by attaching the boundary point to the state space and extending the transition semigroup. We investigate the spectrum of the generator in detail via the scale function, characterizing it as the zeros of an entire function. As an application, we prove that under the strong Feller property, the convergence to the Yaglom limit of the process killed at the boundary is exponentially fast.</description>

      <title>On the Replica Symmetric Solution in General Diluted Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unifying approach to studying the replica symmetric solution in general diluted spin glass models on random $p$-uniform hypergraphs with sparsity parameter $\alpha$. Our result shows that there exist two key regimes in which the model exhibits replica symmetry and the free energy can be explicitly represented as the evaluation of an energy functional at the unique fixed point of a recursive distributional equation. One is called the high temperature regime, where the temperature and the sparsity parameter are essentially inversely proportional to each other; the other is the subcritical regime defined as $\alpha p (p-1)\leq 1$. In particular, the fact that the second regime is independent of the temperature parameter further allows us to deduce an analogous representation of the ground state energy in the subcritical regime. Along the way, we revisit several well-known formulas and also derive new ones for the free and ground state energies in the constraint satisfaction problem, Potts model, XY model, and continuous hardcore model.</description>

      <title>Diffusions and random walks with prescribed sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given suitable functions $V, \Psi:[0,\infty) \to [0,\infty)$, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions on $V,\Psi$ for the existence of a metric measure space and a symmetric diffusion process that satisfies sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates with volume growth profile $V$ and escape time profile $\Psi$. We prove sufficiency by constructing a new family of diffusions. Special cases of this construction also leads to a new family of infinite graphs whose simple random walks satisfy sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates with prescribed volume growth and escape time profiles. In particular, these random walks on graphs generalizes earlier results of Barlow who considered the case $V(r)=r^\alpha$ and $\Psi(r)=r^\beta$ (Rev Mat Iberoam 2004). The family of diffusions we construct have martingale dimension one but can have arbitrarily high spectral dimension. Therefore our construction shows the impossibility of obtaining non-trivial \emph{lower} bounds on martingale dimension in terms of spectral dimension which is in contrast with upper bounds on martingale dimension using spectral dimension obtained by Hino (Probab Theory Relat Fields 2013).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain Hanson-Wright inequalities for the quadratic form of a random vector with independent sparse random variables. Specifically, we consider cases where the components of the random vector are sparse $\alpha$-sub-exponential random variables with $\alpha&gt;0$. Our proof relies on a novel combinatorial approach to estimate the moments of the random quadratic form.</description>

      <title>Subcritical Boolean percolation on graphs of bounded degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a model of long-range site percolation on graphs of bounded degree, namely the Boolean percolation model. In this model, each vertex of an infinite connected graph is the center of a ball of random radius, and vertices are said to be active independently with probability $p \in [0, 1]$. We consider $W$ to be the reunion of random balls with an active center. In certain circumstances, the model does not exhibit a phase transition, in the sense that $W$ almost surely contains an infinite component for all $p &gt; 0$, or even $W$ covers the entire graph. In this paper, we give a sufficient condition on the radius distribution for the existence of a subcritical phase, namely a regime such that almost surely all the connected components of $W$ are finite. Additionally, we provide a sufficient condition for the exponential decay of the size of a typical component.</description>

      <title>Law of large numbers for greedy animals and paths in a Poissonian environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two continuous and isotropic analogues of the model of greedy lattice animals introduced by Cox, Gandolfi, Griffin and Kesten in 1993. In our framework, animals collect masses scattered on a Poisson point process on $\mathbb R^d$, and are allowed to have vertices outside the process or not, depending on the model. The author recently proved in a more general setting that for all $u$ in the Euclidean open unit ball, the maximal mass of animals with length $\ell$, containing $0$ and $\ell u$ satisfies a law of large numbers. We prove some additional properties in the Poissonian case, including an extension of the functional law of large numbers to the closed unit ball, and study strict monotonicity of the limit function along a radius. Moreover, we prove that a third, penalized model is a suitable interpolation between the former two.</description>

      <title>Long time behavior of semi-Markov modulated perpetuity and some related processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Examples of stochastic processes whose state space representations involve functions of an integral type structure $$I_{t}^{(a,b)}:=\int_{0}^{t}b(Y_{s})e^{-\int_{s}^{t}a(Y_{r})dr}ds, \quad t\ge 0$$ are studied under an ergodic semi-Markovian environment described by an $S$ valued jump type process $Y:=(Y_{s}:s\in\mathbb{R}^{+})$ that is ergodic with a limiting distribution $\pi\in\mathcal{P}(S)$. Under different assumptions on signs of $E_{\pi}a(\cdot):=\sum_{j\in S}\pi_{j}a(j)$ and tail properties of the sojourn times of $Y$ we obtain different long time limit results for $I^{(a,b)}_{}:=(I^{(a,b)}_{t}:t\ge 0).$ In all cases mixture type of laws emerge which are naturally represented through an affine stochastic recurrence equation (SRE) $X\stackrel{d}{=}AX+B,\,\, X\perp\!\!\!\perp (A, B)$. Examples include explicit long-time representations of pitchfork bifurcation, and regime-switching diffusions under semi-Markov modulated environments, etc.</description>

      <title>Global existence and mean-field limit for a stochastic interacting particle system of signed Coulomb charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a system of stochastic differential equations with singular drift which describes the dynamics of signed particles in two dimensions interacting by the Coulomb potential. In contrast to the well-studied cases of identical particles that either all repel each other or all attract each other, this system contains both `positive' and `negative' particles. Equal signs repel and opposite signs attract each other; apart from the sign, the potential is the same.
  We derive results on well-posedness of the system, on the type of collisions that can occur, and on the mean-field limit as the number of particles tends to infinity. Our results demonstrate that the signed system shares features of both the fully repulsive and the fully attractive cases. Our proof method is inspired by the work of Fournier and Jourdain (The Annals of Applied Probability, 27, pp. 2807-2861, 2017) on the fully attractive case; we construct an approximate system of equations, establish uniform estimates, and use tightness to pass to limits.</description>

      <title>A Critical Drift-Diffusion Equation: Connections to the Diffusion on $\textbf{SL}(2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we connect two seemingly unrelated objects: On the one hand is a two-dimensional drift-diffusion process $X$ with divergence-free and time-independent drift $b$. The drift is given by a stationary Gaussian ensemble, and we focus on the critical case where a small-scale cut-off is necessary for well-posedness and the large-scale cancellations lead to a borderline super-diffusive behavior. On the other hand is the natural diffusion $F$ on the Lie group $\textbf{SL}(2)$ of matrices of determinant one. As a consequence of this connection, the strongly non-Gaussian character of $F$ transmits to how $X$ depends on its starting point.</description>

      <title>The essential m-dissipativity for degenerate infinite dimensional stochastic Hamiltonian systems and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a degenerate infinite dimensional stochastic Hamiltonian system with multiplicative noise and establish the essential m-dissipativity on $L^2(\mu^{\Phi})$ of the corresponding Kolmogorov (backwards) operator. Here, $\Phi$ is the potential and $\mu^{\Phi}$ the invariant measure with density $e^{-\Phi}$ with respect to an infinite dimensional non-degenerate Gaussian measure. The main difficulty, besides the non-sectorality of the Kolmogorov operator, is the coverage of a large class of potentials. We include potentials that have neither a bounded nor a Lipschitz continuous gradient. The essential m-dissipativity is the starting point to establish the hypocoercivity of the strongly continuous contraction semigroup $(T_t)_{t\geq 0}$ generated by the Kolmogorov operator. By using the refined abstract Hilbert space hypocoercivity method of Grothaus and Stilgenbauer, originally introduced by Dolbeault, Mouhot and Schmeiser, we construct a $\mu^{\Phi}$-invariant Hunt process with weakly continuous paths and infinite lifetime, whose transition semigroup is associated with $(T_t)_{t\geq 0}$. This process provides a stochastically and analytically weak solution to the degenerate infinite dimensional stochastic Hamiltonian system with multiplicative noise. The hypocoercivity of $(T_t)_{t\geq 0}$ and the identification of $(T_t)_{t\geq 0}$ with the transition semigroup of the process leads to the exponential ergodicity. Finally, we apply our results to degenerate second order in time stochastic reaction-diffusion equations with multiplicative noise. A discussion of the class of applicable potentials and coefficients governing these equations completes our analysis.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously Solving FBSDEs with Neural Operators of Logarithmic Depth, Constant Width, and Sub-Linear Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forward-backwards stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) are central in optimal control, game theory, economics, and mathematical finance. Unfortunately, the available FBSDE solvers operate on \textit{individual} FBSDEs, meaning that they cannot provide a computationally feasible strategy for solving large families of FBSDEs as these solvers must be re-run several times. \textit{Neural operators} (NOs) offer an alternative approach for \textit{simultaneously solving} large families of FBSDEs by directly approximating the solution operator mapping \textit{inputs:} terminal conditions and dynamics of the backwards process to \textit{outputs:} solutions to the associated FBSDE. Though universal approximation theorems (UATs) guarantee the existence of such NOs, these NOs are unrealistically large. We confirm that ``small'' NOs can uniformly approximate the solution operator to structured families of FBSDEs with random terminal time, uniformly on suitable compact sets determined by Sobolev norms, to any prescribed error $\varepsilon&gt;0$ using a depth of $\mathcal{O}(\log(1/\varepsilon))$, a width of $\mathcal{O}(1)$, and a sub-linear rank; i.e. $\mathcal{O}(1/\varepsilon^r)$ for some $r&lt;1$. This result is rooted in our second main contribution, which shows that convolutional NOs of similar depth, width, and rank can approximate the solution operator to a broad class of Elliptic PDEs. A key insight here is that the convolutional layers of our NO can efficiently encode the Green's function associated to the Elliptic PDEs linked to our FBSDEs. A byproduct of our analysis is the first theoretical justification for the benefit of lifting channels in NOs: they exponentially decelerate the growth rate of the NO's rank.</description>

      <title>Disease Incidence in a Stochastic SVIRS Model with Waning Immunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the long-term behaviour and incidence of a vaccine-preventable contact disease, under the assumption that both vaccine protection and immunity after recovery are not lifelong. The mathematical model is developed in a stochastic markovian framework. The evolution of the disease in a finite population is thus represented by a three-dimensional continuous-time Markov chain, which is versatile enough to be able to compensate for the loss of protection by including vaccination before the onset of the outbreak and also during the course of the epidemics.</description>

      <title>Achieving O(1/N) Optimality Gap in Restless Bandits through Diffusion Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the finite horizon Restless Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) problem with $N$ homogeneous arms, focusing on the challenges posed by degenerate RMABs, which are prevalent in practical applications. While previous work has shown that Linear Programming (LP)-based policies achieve exponentially fast convergence relative to the LP upper bound in non-degenerate models, applying these LP-based policies to degenerate RMABs results in slower convergence rates of $O(1/\sqrt{N})$. We construct a diffusion system that incorporates both the mean and variance of the stochastic processes, in contrast to the fluid system from the LP, which only accounts for the mean, thereby providing a more accurate representation of RMAB dynamics. Consequently, our novel diffusion-resolving policy achieves an optimality gap of $O(1/N)$ relative to the true optimal value, rather than the LP upper bound, revealing that the fluid approximation and the LP upper bound are too loose in degenerate settings. These insights pave the way for constructing policies that surpass the $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ optimality gap for any RMAB, whether degenerate or not.</description>

      <title>Random acoustic boundary conditions and Weyl's law for Laplace-Beltrami operators on non-smooth boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by engineering and photonics research on resonators in random or uncertain environments, we study rigorous randomizations of boundary conditions for wave equations of the acoustic-type in Lipschitz domains $\mathcal{O}$. First, a parametrization of essentially all m-dissipative boundary condition by contraction operators in the boundary $L^2$-space is constructed with the use of m-boundary tuples (boundary value spaces). We consider randomizations of these contraction operators that lead to acoustic operators random in the resolvent sense. To this end, the use of Neumann-to-Dirichlet maps and Krein-type resolvent formulae is crucial. We give a description of random m-dissipative boundary conditions that produce acoustic operators with almost surely (a.s.) compact resolvents, and so, also with a.s. discrete spectra. For each particular applied model, one can choose a specific boundary condition from the constructed class either by means of optimization, or on the base of empirical observations. A mathematically convenient randomization is constructed in terms of eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\Delta^{\partial \mathcal{O}}$ on the boundary $\mathcal{O}$ of the domain. We show that for this randomization the compactness of the resolvent is connected with the Weyl-type asymptotics for the eigenvalues of $\Delta^{\partial \mathcal{O}}$.</description>

Abstract: Random walk spaces are a general framework for the study of PDEs. They include as particular cases locally finite weighted connected graphs and nonlocal settings involving symmetric integrable kernels on $\mathbb{R}^N$. We are interested in the study of evolution problems involving two random walk structures so that the associated functionals have different growth on each structure. We also deal with the case of a functional with different growth on a partition of the random walk.</description>

      <title>Cascade equation for the discontinuities in the Stefan problem with surface tension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Stefan problem with surface tension is well known to exhibit discontinuities in the associated moving aggregate (i.e., in the domain occupied by the solid), whose structure has only been understood under translational or radial symmetry so far. In this paper, we derive an auxiliary partial differential equation of second-order hyperbolic type, referred to as the cascade equation, that captures said discontinuities in the absence of any symmetry assumptions. Specializing to the one-phase setting, we introduce a novel (global) notion of weak solution to the cascade equation, which is defined as a limit of mean-field game equilibria. For the spatial dimension two, we show the existence of such a weak solution and prove a natural perimeter estimate on the associated moving aggregate.</description>

Abstract: We prove the global well-posedness of the dynamical sine-Gordon model up to the third threshold, i.e., for parameters $\beta^2 &lt; 6\pi$. The key novelty in our approach is the introduction of the so-called resonant equation, whose solution is entirely deterministic and completely captures the size of the solution to the dynamical sine-Gordon model. The probabilistic fluctuations in the dynamical sine-Gordon model are then controlled using uniform estimates for modified stochastic objects.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations and Improved Mean-squared Error Rates of Nonlinear SGD: Heavy-tailed Noise and Power of Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study large deviations and mean-squared error (MSE) guarantees of a general framework of nonlinear stochastic gradient methods in the online setting, in the presence of heavy-tailed noise. Unlike existing works that rely on the closed form of a nonlinearity (typically clipping), our framework treats the nonlinearity in a black-box manner, allowing us to provide unified guarantees for a broad class of bounded nonlinearities, including many popular ones, like sign, quantization, normalization, as well as component-wise and joint clipping. We provide several strong results for a broad range of step-sizes in the presence of heavy-tailed noise with symmetric probability density function, positive in a neighbourhood of zero and potentially unbounded moments. In particular, for non-convex costs we provide a large deviation upper bound for the minimum norm-squared of gradients, showing an asymptotic tail decay on an exponential scale, at a rate $\sqrt{t} / \log(t)$. We establish the accompanying rate function, showing an explicit dependence on the choice of step-size, nonlinearity, noise and problem parameters. Next, for non-convex costs and the minimum norm-squared of gradients, we derive the optimal MSE rate $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(t^{-1/2})$. Moreover, for strongly convex costs and the last iterate, we provide an MSE rate that can be made arbitrarily close to the optimal rate $\mathcal{O}(t^{-1})$, improving on the state-of-the-art results in the presence of heavy-tailed noise. Finally, we establish almost sure convergence of the minimum norm-squared of gradients, providing an explicit rate, which can be made arbitrarily close to $o(t^{-1/4})$.</description>

Abstract: We study the mixing properties of the white-forced Navier--Stokes system in an infinite periodic pipe $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{T}$. Assuming that the noise is sufficiently non-degenerate, we prove the uniqueness of stationary measure and polynomial mixing in the dual-Lipschitz metric. The proof combines the coupling method with a Foia\c{s}--Prodi type estimate and weighted growth estimates.</description>

      <title>Three connected problems: principal with multiple agents in cooperation, Principal--Agent with Mckean--Vlasov dynamics and multitask Principal--Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address three Principal--Agent problems in a moral hazard context and show that they are connected. We start by studying the problem of Principal with multiple Agents in cooperation. The term cooperation is manifested here by the fact that the agents optimize their criteria through Pareto equilibria. We show that as the number of agents tends to infinity, the principal's value function converges to the value function of a McKean--Vlasov control problem. Using the solution to this McKean--Vlasov control problem, we derive a constructive method for obtaining approximately optimal contracts for the principal's problem with multiple agents in cooperation. In a second step, we show that the problem of Principal with multiple Agents turns out to also converge, when the number of agents goes to infinity, towards a new Principal--Agent problem which is the Principal--Agent problem with Mckean--Vlasov dynamics. This is a Principal--Agent problem where the agent--controlled production follows a Mckean-Vlasov dynamics and the contract can depend of the distribution of the production. The value function of the principal in this setting is equivalent to that of the same McKean--Vlasov control problem from the multi--agent scenario. Furthermore, we show that an optimal contract can be constructed from the solution to this McKean--Vlasov control problem. We conclude by discussing, in a simple example, the connection of these problems with the multitask Principal--Agent problem which is a situation when a principal delegates multiple tasks that can be correlated to a single agent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we characterise the statistics of Markov chains by constructing an associated sequence of periodic differential operators. Studying the density of states of these operators reveals the absolutely continuous invariant measure of the Markov chain. This approach also leads to a direct proof of convergence to the invariant measure, along with explicit convergence rates. We show how our method can be applied to a class of related Markov chains including the logistic map, the tent map and Chebyshev maps of arbitrary order.</description>

      <title>The mutual arrangement of Wright-Fisher diffusion path measures and its impact on parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wright-Fisher diffusion is a fundamentally important model of evolution encompassing genetic drift, mutation, and natural selection. Suppose you want to infer the parameters associated with these processes from an observed sample path. Then to write down the likelihood one first needs to know the mutual arrangement of two path measures under different parametrizations; that is, whether they are absolutely continuous, equivalent, singular, and so on. In this paper we give a complete answer to this question by finding the separating times for the diffusion - the stopping time before which one measure is absolutely continuous with respect to the other and after which the pair is mutually singular. In one dimension this extends a classical result of Dawson on the local equivalence between neutral and non-neutral Wright-Fisher diffusion measures. Along the way we also develop new zero-one type laws for the diffusion on its approach to, and emergence from, the boundary. As an application we derive an explicit expression for the joint maximum likelihood estimator of the mutation and selection parameters and show that its convergence properties are closely related to the separating time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Robbins-Siegmund theorem is one of the most important results in stochastic optimization, where it is widely used to prove the convergence of stochastic algorithms. We provide a quantitative version of the theorem, establishing a bound on how far one needs to look in order to locate a region of metastability in the sense of Tao. Our proof involves a metastable analogue of Doob's theorem for $L_1$-supermartingales along with a series of technical lemmas that make precise how quantitative information propagates through sums and products of stochastic processes. In this way, our paper establishes a general methodology for finding metastable bounds for stochastic processes that can be reduced to supermartingales, and therefore for obtaining quantitative convergence information across a broad class of stochastic algorithms whose convergence proof relies on some variation of the Robbins-Siegmund theorem. We conclude by discussing how our general quantitative result might be used in practice.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Bayesian networks are typically faithful in the total variation metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for a given DAG $G$, among all observational distributions of Bayesian networks over $G$ with arbitrary outcome spaces, the faithful distributions are `typical': they constitute a dense, open set with respect to the total variation metric. As a consequence, the set of faithful distributions is non-empty, and the unfaithful distributions are nowhere dense. We extend this result to the space of Bayesian networks, where the properties hold for Bayesian networks instead of distributions of Bayesian networks. As special cases, we show that these results also hold for the faithful parameters of the subclasses of linear Gaussian -- and discrete Bayesian networks, giving a topological analogue of the measure-zero results of Spirtes et al. (1993) and Meek (1995). Finally, we extend our topological results and the measure-zero results of Spirtes et al. and Meek to Bayesian networks with latent variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.09986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to deal with the question of the existence of a calibrated local stochastic volatility model in finance, we investigate a class of McKean--Vlasov equations where a minimal continuity assumption is imposed on the coefficients. Namely, the drift coefficient and, in particular, the volatility coefficient are not necessarily continuous in the measure variable for the Wasserstein topology. In this paper, we provide an existence result and show an approximation by $N$--particle system or propagation of chaos for this type of McKean--Vlasov equations. As a direct result, we are able to deduce the existence of a calibrated local stochastic volatility model for an appropriate choice of stochastic volatility parameters. The associated propagation of chaos result is also proved.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous random graphs with infinite-mean fitness variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08462v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an inhomogeneous Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph ensemble with exponentially decaying random disconnection probabilities determined by an i.i.d. field of variables with heavy tails and infinite mean associated to the vertices of the graph. This model was recently investigated in the physics literature in Garuccio et al. (2020) as a scale-invariant random graph within the context of network renormalization. From a mathematical perspective, the model fits in the class of scale-free inhomogeneous random graphs whose asymptotic geometrical features have been recently attracting interest. While for this type of graphs several results are known when the underlying vertex variables have finite mean and variance, here instead we consider the case of one-sided stable variables with necessarily infinite mean. To simplify our analysis, we assume that the variables are sampled from a Pareto distribution with parameter $\alpha\in(0,1)$. We start by characterizing the asymptotic distributions of the typical degrees and some related observables. In particular, we show that the degree of a vertex converges in distribution, after proper scaling, to a mixed Poisson law. We then show that correlations among degrees of different vertices are asymptotically non-vanishing, but at the same time a form of asymptotic tail independence is found when looking at the behavior of the joint Laplace transform around zero. Moreover, we present some findings concerning the asymptotic density of wedges and triangles and show a cross-over for the existence of dust (i.e. disconnected vertices).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain asymptotic approximations for the probability density function of the product of two correlated normal random variables with non-zero means and arbitrary variances. As a consequence, we deduce asymptotic approximations for the tail probabilities and quantile functions of this distribution, as well as an asymptotic approximation for the widely used risk measures value at risk and tail value at risk.</description>

      <title>Convergence of high dimensional Toeplitz and related matrices with correlated inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the joint convergence of independent random Toeplitz matrices with complex input entries that have a pair-correlation structure, along with deterministic Toeplitz matrices and the backward identity permutation matrix. Further, we study the joint convergence of independent generalized Toeplitz matrices along with other related matrices. The limits depend only on the correlation structure but are universal otherwise, in that they do not depend on the underlying distributions of the entries. In particular, these results provide the joint convergence of asymmetric Hankel matrices. Earlier results in the literature on the joint convergence of random symmetric Toeplitz and symmetric Hankel matrices with real entries follow as special cases.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Volterra processes as models of electricity markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a non-Markovian model for electricity markets where the spot price of electricity is driven by several Gaussian Volterra processes, which can be e.g., fractional Brownian motions (fBms), Riemann-Liouville processes or Gaussian-Volterra driven Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. Since in energy markets the spot price is not a tradeable asset, due to the limited storage possibilities, forward contracts are considered as traded products. We ensure necessary and sufficient conditions for the absence of arbitrage that, in this kind of market, reflects the fact that the prices of the forward contracts are (Gaussian) martingales under a risk-neutral measure. Moreover, we characterize the market completeness in terms of the number of forward contracts simultaneously considered and of the kernels of the Gaussian-Volterra processes. We also provide a novel representation of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes driven by Gaussian Volterra processes. Also exploiting this result, we show analytically that, for some kinds of Gaussian-Volterra processes driving the spot prices, under conditions ensuring the absence of arbitrage, the market is complete. Finally, we formulate a portfolio optimization problem for an agent who invests in an electricity market, and we solve it explicitly in the case of CRRA utility functions. We also find closed formulas for the price of options written on forward contracts, together with the hedging strategy.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Optimality of the Speed-Aware Join-the-Shortest-Queue in the Halfin-Whitt Regime for Heterogeneous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10497v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Join-the-Shortest-Queue (JSQ) load balancing scheme is known to minimise the average response time of jobs in homogeneous systems with identical servers. However, for {\em heterogeneous} systems with servers having different processing speeds, finding an optimal load balancing scheme remains an open problem for finite system sizes. Recently, for systems with heterogeneous servers, a variant of the JSQ scheme, called the {\em Speed-Aware-Join-the-Shortest-Queue (SA-JSQ)} scheme, has been shown to achieve asymptotic optimality in the fluid-scaling regime where the number of servers $n$ tends to infinity but the normalised the arrival rate of jobs remains constant. {In this paper, we show that the SA-JSQ scheme is also asymptotically optimal for heterogeneous systems in the {\em Halfin-Whitt} traffic regime where the normalised arrival rate scales as $1-O(1/\sqrt{n})$.} Our analysis begins by establishing that an appropriately scaled and centered version of the Markov process describing system dynamics weakly converges to a two-dimensional reflected {\em Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process}. We then show using {\em Stein's method} that the stationary distribution of the underlying Markov process converges to that of the OU process as the system size increases by establishing the validity of interchange of limits. {Finally, through coupling with a suitably constructed system, we show that SA-JSQ asymptotically minimises the diffusion-scaled total number of jobs and the diffusion-scaled number of waiting jobs in the steady-state in the Halfin-Whitt regime among all policies which dispatch jobs based on queue lengths and server speeds.}</description>

      <title>Diffusion limited aggregation in the layers model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12326v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the classical model of Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA), introduced by Witten and Sander, the process begins with a single particle cluster placed at the origin of a space, and then, one at a time, particles make a random walk from infinity until they collide with, and stick to, the existing cluster.
  We consider an analogous version of this process on large but finite graphs with a designated source and sink vertex. Initially the cluster of halted particles contains a single particle at the sink vertex. Starting one at a time from the source, each particle makes a random walk in the direction of the sink vertex. The particle halts at the last unoccupied vertex before the walk enters the cluster for the first time, thus increasing the size of the cluster. This continues until the source vertex becomes occupied, at which point the process ends. We study the DLA process on several classes of layered graphs, including Cayley trees of branching factor at least two with a sink vertex attached to the leaves. We determine the finish time of the process for a given class of graphs and show that the subcomponent of the final cluster linking source to sink is essentially a unique path.</description>

      <title>Optimal constants in concentration inequalities on the sphere and in the Gauss space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show several variants of concentration inequalities on the sphere stated as subgaussian estimates with optimal constants. For a Lipschitz function, we give one-sided and two-sided bounds for deviation from the median as well as from the mean. For example, we show that if $\mu$ is the normalized surface measure on $S^{n-1}$ with $n\geq 3$, $f : S^{n-1} \to \mathbb{R}$ is $1$-Lipschitz, $M$ is the median of $f$, and $t &gt;0$, then $\mu\big(f \geq M +t\big) \leq \frac 12 e^{-nt^2/2}$. If $M$ is the mean of $f$, we have a two-sided bound $\mu\big(|f - M| \geq t\big) \leq e^{-nt^2/2}$. Consequently, if $\gamma$ is the standard Gaussian measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $f : \mathbb{R}^{n} \to \mathbb{R}$ (again, $1$-Lipschitz, with the mean equal to $M$), then $\gamma \big(|f - M| \geq t\big) \leq e^{-t^2/2}$. These bounds are slightly better and arguably more elegant than those available elsewhere in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi (SHJ) equations, instability points are the space-time locations where two eternal solutions with the same asymptotic velocity differ. Another crucial structure in such equations is shocks, which are the space-time locations where the velocity field is discontinuous. In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of the structure and relationships between shocks, instability, and competition interfaces in the Brownian last-passage percolation model, which serves as a prototype of a semi-discrete inviscid stochastic HJ equation in one space dimension. Among our findings, we show that the shock trees of the two unstable eternal solutions differ within the instability region and align outside of it. Furthermore, we demonstrate that one can reconstruct a skeleton of the instability region from these two shock trees.</description>

      <title>Alternate definitions of Gini, Hoover and Lorenz measures of inequalities and convergence with respect to the Wasserstein W1 metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article focuses on some properties of three tools used to measure economic inequalities with respect to a distribution of wealth $\mu$: Gini coefficient $G$, Hoover coefficient or Robin Hood coefficient $H$, and the Lorenz concentration curve $L$. To express the distributions of resources, we use the framework of random variables and abstract Borel measures.
  In the first part (sections 1-4), we discuss alternate definitions of $G$, $H$ and $L$ that can be found in economics literature. Gini and Hoover coefficients are defined as mean deviation and mean absolute differences, and interpreted as geometrical properties of the Lorenz curve. In particular, we give a more general and straightforward proof of the main result of [Dorfman, 1979].
  The second part of the article (section 5-7) focuses on the consistency of $G(\mu)$, $H(\mu)$ and $L_\mu$ as $\mu$ is approximated or perturbated. The relevant tool to use is the Wasserstein metric $\mathrm{W}_1$, i.e. the $\mathrm{L}^1$ metric between quantile functions. Our main theorem shows that if $\mathrm{W}_1(\mu_n, \mu_\infty) \to 0$ if and only if $L_{\mu_n} \to L_{\mu_\infty}$ uniformly. We discuss the topological implications of this fact. Thus, we show that the empirical Gini, Hoover indexes and Lorenz curves computed on a sample or rebuilt with partial information converge to the real Gini, Hoover indexes and Lorenz curve as information increases in several cases. Eventually, we discuss the situations where the $\mathrm{W}_1$ convergence is not matched but weaker asumptions can be made.</description>

      <title>On the Lebesgue measure of one generalised set of subsums of geometric series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study a set that can be treated as a generalised set of subsums for a geometric series. This object was discovered independently in various mathematical aspects. For instance, it is closely related to various systems of representation of real numbers. The main object of this paper was particularly studied by R. Kenyon, who brought up a question about the Lebesgue measure of the set and conjectured that it is positive. Further, Z. Nitecki confirmed the hypothesis by using nontrivial topological techniques. However, the aforementioned result is quite limited, as this particular case should satisfy a rigid condition of homogeneity. Despite the limited progress, the problem remained understudied in a general framework.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a Stochastic Delay Differential Equation with constant delay $r&gt;0$ and, under the same conditions on the coefficients needed to ensure the smoothness of the density plus an ellipticity condition on the diffusion term, we prove that the density function of the solution is strictly positive in its support. In order to prove it, we give a Gaussian-type lower bound for the density of the solution combining the Nourdin and Viens' density bounding method together with Kohatsu-Higa's method.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear PDEs with modulated dispersion II: Korteweg--de Vries equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.7675</link>
      <description>arXiv:1406.7675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (Due to the limit on the number of characters for an abstract set by arXiv, the full abstract can not be displayed here. See the abstract in the paper.)
  We study dispersive equations with a time non-homogeneous modulation acting on the linear dispersion term. As primary models, we consider the Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV) and related equations such as the Benjamin-Ono equation (BO) and the intermediate long wave equation (ILW), imposing certain irregularity conditions on the time non-homogeneous modulation. In this work, we establish phenomena called regularization by noise in three-folds: (i) When the modulation is sufficiently irregular, we show that the modulated KdV on both the circle and the real line is locally well-posed in the regime where the (unmodulated) KdV equation is known to be ill-posed. In particular, given any $s \in \mathbb R$, we show that the modulated KdV on the circle with a sufficiently irregular modulation is locally well-posed in $H^s(\mathbb T)$. Moreover, by adapting the $I$-method to the current modulated setting, we prove global well-posedness of the modulated KdV in negative Sobolev spaces. (ii) It is known that certain (semilinear) dispersive equations such as BO and ILW exhibit quasilinear nature. We show that sufficiently irregular modulations make the modulated versions of these equations semilinear by establishing their local well-posedness by a contraction argument, providing local Lipschitz continuity of the solution map. (iii) We also prove nonlinear smoothing for these modulated equations, where we show that a gain of regularity of the nonlinear part becomes (arbitrarily) larger for more irregular modulations.
  As applications of our approach, we also include further examples.</description>

      <title>Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing Revisited: Did we Find a Fatal Flaw?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.05671v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The option pricing formula of Black and Scholes (1973) hinges on the continuous-time self-financing condition, which is a special case of the continuous-time budget equation of Merton (1971). The self-financing condition is believed to formalize the economic concept of portfolio rebalancing without inflows or outflows of external funds, but was never formally derived in continuous time. Moreover, and even more problematically, we discover a timing mistake in the model of Merton (1971) and show that his self-financing condition is misspecified both in discrete and continuous time. Our results invalidate seminal contributions to the literature, including the budget equation of Merton (1971), the option pricing formula of Black and Scholes (1973), the continuous trading model of Harrison and Pliska (1981), and the binomial option pricing model of Cox, Ross and Rubinstein (1979). We also show that Black and Scholes (1973) and alternative derivations of their formula implicitly assumed the replication result.</description>

      <title>Piecewise linear interpolation of noise in finite element approximations of parabolic SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient simulation of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE) on general domains requires noise discretization. This paper employs piecewise linear interpolation of noise in a fully discrete finite element approximation of a semilinear stochastic reaction-advection-diffusion equation on a convex polyhedral domain. The Gaussian noise is white in time, spatially correlated, and modeled as a standard cylindrical Wiener process on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This paper provides the first rigorous analysis of the resulting noise discretization error for a general spatial covariance kernel. The kernel is assumed to be defined on a larger regular domain, allowing for sampling by the circulant embedding method. The error bound under mild kernel assumptions requires non-trivial techniques like Hilbert--Schmidt bounds on products of finite element interpolants, entropy numbers of fractional Sobolev space embeddings and an error bound for interpolants in fractional Sobolev norms. Examples with kernels encountered in applications are illustrated in numerical simulations using the FEniCS finite element software. Key findings include: noise interpolation does not introduce additional errors for Mat\'ern kernels in $d\ge2$; there exist kernels that yield dominant interpolation errors; and generating noise on a coarser mesh does not always compromise accuracy.</description>

      <title>On the Asymptotics and the Non-Holonomic Character of First Returns in the Standard Euclidean Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give precise asymptotics to the number of first time returning random walks in the standard orthogonal lattice in $\mathbb{R}$ and we prove that these numbers do not form a $P$-recursive sequence. In the process, the known asymptotics of the number of closed walks are obtained in an elementary way, by using a combinatorial and geometric multiplication principle together with the classical theory of Legendre polynomials. By showing that the relevant generating functions are $G$-functions, we use a form of the Hadamard convolution to find their singularities in all dimensions and give the ODEs that they satisfy for $d\leq 5$, some of which seem to be new. We use the Lucas property of the number of closed walks to prove that the corresponding generating function is not invertible as a $G$-function, which immediately implies that the generating function of the first time returning walks is not holonomic. We propose a few conjectures on the form of the asymptotic coefficients and of the ODEs.</description>

      <title>Concentration of the Langevin Algorithm's Stationary Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A canonical algorithm for log-concave sampling is the Langevin Algorithm, aka the Langevin Diffusion run with some discretization stepsize $\eta &gt; 0$. This discretization leads the Langevin Algorithm to have a stationary distribution $\pi_{\eta}$ which differs from the stationary distribution $\pi$ of the Langevin Diffusion, and it is an important challenge to understand whether the well-known properties of $\pi$ extend to $\pi_{\eta}$. In particular, while concentration properties such as isoperimetry and rapidly decaying tails are classically known for $\pi$, the analogous properties for $\pi_{\eta}$ are open questions with algorithmic implications. This note provides a first step in this direction by establishing concentration results for $\pi_{\eta}$ that mirror classical results for $\pi$. Specifically, we show that for any nontrivial stepsize $\eta &gt; 0$, $\pi_{\eta}$ is sub-exponential (respectively, sub-Gaussian) when the potential is convex (respectively, strongly convex). Moreover, the concentration bounds we show are essentially tight. We also show that these concentration bounds extend to all iterates along the trajectory of the Langevin Algorithm, and to inexact implementations which use sub-Gaussian estimates of the gradient.
  Key to our analysis is the use of a rotation-invariant moment generating function (aka Bessel function) to study the stationary dynamics of the Langevin Algorithm. This technique may be of independent interest because it enables directly analyzing the discrete-time stationary distribution $\pi_{\eta}$ without going through the continuous-time stationary distribution $\pi$ as an intermediary.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Diffusion: Infinite Dimensional Score-Based Diffusion Models for Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04772v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models (SBDM) have recently emerged as state-of-the-art approaches for image generation. Existing SBDMs are typically formulated in a finite-dimensional setting, where images are considered as tensors of finite size. This paper develops SBDMs in the infinite-dimensional setting, that is, we model the training data as functions supported on a rectangular domain. In addition to the quest for generating images at ever-higher resolutions, our primary motivation is to create a well-posed infinite-dimensional learning problem that we can discretize consistently on multiple resolution levels. We thereby intend to obtain diffusion models that generalize across different resolution levels and improve the efficiency of the training process. We demonstrate how to overcome two shortcomings of current SBDM approaches in the infinite-dimensional setting. First, we modify the forward process using trace class operators to ensure that the latent distribution is well-defined in the infinite-dimensional setting and derive the reverse processes for finite-dimensional approximations. Second, we illustrate that approximating the score function with an operator network is beneficial for multilevel training. After deriving the convergence of the discretization and the approximation of multilevel training, we demonstrate some practical benefits of our infinite-dimensional SBDM approach on a synthetic Gaussian mixture example, the MNIST dataset, and a dataset generated from a nonlinear 2D reaction-diffusion equation.</description>

      <title>Limiting Moments of Autocorrelation Demerit Factors of Binary Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14566v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various problems in engineering and natural science demand binary sequences that do not resemble translates of themselves, that is, the sequences must have small aperiodic autocorrelation at every nonzero shift. If $f$ is a sequence, then the demerit factor of $f$ is the sum of the squared magnitudes of the autocorrelations at all nonzero shifts for the sequence obtained by normalizing $f$ to unit Euclidean norm. The demerit factor is the reciprocal of Golay's merit factor, and low demerit factor indicates low self-similarity of a sequence under translation. We endow the $2^\ell$ binary sequences of length $\ell$ with uniform probability measure and consider the distribution of their demerit factors. Earlier works used combinatorial techniques to find exact formulas for the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the distribution as a function of $\ell$. These revealed that for $\ell \geq 4$, the $p$th central moment of this distribution is strictly positive for every $p \geq 2$. This article shows that for every $p$, the $p$th central moment is $\ell^{-2 p}$ times a quasi-polynomial function of $\ell$ with rational coefficients. It also shows that, in the limit as $\ell$ tends to infinity, the $p$th standardized moment is the same as that of the standard normal distribution.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Random Features: Explicit Forms and Sharp Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random features have been introduced to scale up kernel methods via randomization techniques. In particular, random Fourier features and orthogonal random features were used to approximate the popular Gaussian kernel. Random Fourier features are built in this case using a random Gaussian matrix. In this work, we analyze the bias and the variance of the kernel approximation based on orthogonal random features which makes use of Haar orthogonal matrices. We provide explicit expressions for these quantities using normalized Bessel functions, showing that orthogonal random features does not approximate the Gaussian kernel but a Bessel kernel. We also derive sharp exponential bounds supporting the view that orthogonal random features are less dispersed than random Fourier features.</description>

      <title>Complete Asymptotic Expansions for the Normalizing Constants of High-Dimensional Matrix Bingham and Matrix Langevin Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For positive integers $d$ and $p$ such that $d \ge p$, let $\mathbb{R}^{d \times p}$ denote the set of $d \times p$ real matrices, $I_p$ be the identity matrix of order $p$, and $V_{d,p} = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times p} \mid x'x = I_p\}$ be the Stiefel manifold in $\mathbb{R}^{d \times p}$. Complete asymptotic expansions as $d \to \infty$ are obtained for the normalizing constants of the matrix Bingham and matrix Langevin probability distributions on $V_{d,p}$. The accuracy of each truncated expansion is strictly increasing in $d$; also, for sufficiently large $d$, the accuracy is strictly increasing in $m$, the number of terms in the truncated expansion. Lower bounds are obtained for the truncated expansions when the matrix parameters of the matrix Bingham distribution are positive definite and when the matrix parameter of the matrix Langevin distribution is of full rank. These results are applied to obtain the rates of convergence of the asymptotic expansions as both $d \to \infty$ and $p \to \infty$. Values of $d$ and $p$ arising in numerous data sets are used to illustrate the rate of convergence of the truncated approximations as $d$ or $m$ increases. These results extend recently-obtained asymptotic expansions for the normalizing constants of the high-dimensional Bingham distributions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper,we develop a local-to-global and measure-theoretical approach to understand datasets. The idea is to take network models with restricted domains as local charts of datasets. We develop the mathematical foundations for these structures, and show in experiments how it can be used to find fuzzy domains and to improve accuracy in data classification problems.</description>

      <title>Poisson stability of solutions for stochastic evolution equations driven by fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04313v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of Poisson stability of solutions for stochastic semi-linear evolution equation driven by fractional Brownian motion \mathrm{d} X(t)= \left( AX(t) + f(t, X(t)) \right) \mathrm{d}t + g\left(t, X(t)\right)\mathrm{d}B^H_{Q}(t), where A is an exponentially stable linear operator acting on a separable Hilbert space \mathbb{H}, coefficients f and g are Poisson stable in time, and B^H_Q (t) is a Q-cylindrical fBm with Hurst index H. First, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the solution for this equation. Then, we prove that under the condition where the functions f and g are sufficiently "small", the equation admits a solution that exhibits the same character of recurrence as f and g. The discussion is further extended to the asymptotic stability of these Poisson stable solutions. Finally, we include an example to validate our results.</description>

      <title>Theoretical and Empirical Validation of Heston Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on the application of the Heston model to option pricing, employing both theoretical derivations and empirical validations. The Heston model, known for its ability to incorporate stochastic volatility, is derived and analyzed to evaluate its effectiveness in pricing options. For practical application, we utilize Monte Carlo simulations alongside market data from the Crude Oil WTI market to test the model's accuracy. Machine learning based optimization methods are also applied for the estimation of the five Heston parameters. By calibrating the model with real-world data, we assess its robustness and relevance in current financial markets, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical finance models and their practical implementations.</description>

      <title>Exact full-RSB SAT/UNSAT transition in infinitely wide two-layer neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the problem of storing random pattern-label associations using two classes of continuous non-convex weights models, namely the perceptron with negative margin and an infinite-width two-layer neural network with non-overlapping receptive fields and generic activation function. Using a full-RSB ansatz we compute the exact value of the SAT/UNSAT transition. Furthermore, in the case of the negative perceptron we show that the overlap distribution of typical states displays an overlap gap (a disconnected support) in certain regions of the phase diagram defined by the value of the margin and the density of patterns to be stored. This implies that some recent theorems that ensure convergence of Approximate Message Passing (AMP) based algorithms to capacity are not applicable. Finally, we show that Gradient Descent is not able to reach the maximal capacity, irrespectively of the presence of an overlap gap for typical states. This finding, similarly to what occurs in binary weight models, suggests that gradient-based algorithms are biased towards highly atypical states, whose inaccessibility determines the algorithmic threshold.</description>
