      <title>Classical relativistic nonholonomic mechanics and time-dependent $G$-Chaplygin systems with affine constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relativistic formulation of a classical time-dependent nonholonomic Lagrangian mechanics from the perspective of moving frames. We also introduce time-dependent $G$-Chaplygin systems with affine constraints, which are natural objects for the invariant formulation of nonholonomic systems with symmetries. As far as the author is aware, the Hamiltonization problem for time-dependent constraints has not yet been studied. As a first step in this direction, we consider a rolling without sliding of a balanced disc of radius $r$ over a vertical circle of variable radius $R(t)$. We modify the Chaplygin multiplier method and prove that the reduced system becomes the usual Lagrangian system with respect to the new time.</description>

      <title>Four no-go theorems on the existence of spin and orbital angular momentum of massless bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past thirty years there has been an ever-increasing interest in the so-called orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, driven in large part by its diverse range of applications, from new imaging techniques to optical tweezers. However, there are fundamental theoretical issues with splitting the photon angular momentum operator into spin (SAM) and orbital angular momentum parts. While such an SAM-OAM splitting is simple and unambiguous for massive particles, there are many different proposed splittings for massless photons and no consensus about which is correct. Moreover, it has been explicitly shown that most of the proposed SAM and OAM operators do not satisfy the defining commutation relations of angular momentum operators and are thus not legitimate splittings. Here we prove that it is generally impossible to split the total angular momentum operator of massless bosons, like photons and gravitons, into spin and orbital parts. We show that the obstruction to such a splitting can be understood as both geometric and topological. We prove two additional no-go theorems which generalize this result, in particular showing that there are no SAM-OAM splittings even if (1) the SAM operator is allowed to represent non-internal symmetries or (2) if one allows the SAM and OAM operators to generate non-$\mathrm{SO}(3)$ symmetries. We show how gauge redundant descriptions of massless particles can suggest SAM-OAM splittings which are invalid once gauge-invariance is imposed.</description>

      <title>Dirac cones and magic angles in the Bistritzer--MacDonald TBG Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the generic existence of Dirac cones in the full Bistritzer--MacDonald Hamiltonian for twisted bilayer graphene. Its complementary set, when Dirac cones are absent, is the set of magic angles. We show the stability of magic angles obtained in the chiral limit by demonstrating that the perfectly flat bands transform into quadratic band crossings when perturbing away from the chiral limit. Moreover, using the invariance of Euler number, we show that at magic angles there are more band crossings beyond these quadratic band crossings. This is the first result showing the existence of magic angles for the full Bistritzer--MacDonald Hamiltonian and solves Open Problem No.2 proposed in the recent survey arXiv:2310.20642.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of coupled Burgers-like equations induced by conditional symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that $Q$-conditional symmetries of the classical Burgers' equation express in terms of three functions satisfying a coupled system of Burgers-like equations. The search of conditional symmetries of this system leads to a system of five coupled Burgers-like equations. Iterating the procedure, an infinite hierarchy of systems made of an odd number of coupled Burgers-like equations is obtained. Moreover, starting from a pair of Burgers-like equations, a similar hierarchy of systems made of an even number of coupled Burgers-like equations arises; it is also proved that the two hierarchies may be unified. Writing a generic element of this hierarchy as a matrix Burgers' equation, the existence of the matrix Hopf-Cole transformation allows for its linearization and the determination of its solution. Finally, it is shown that each element of the hierarchy possesses a five-dimensional Lie algebra of classical point symmetries. Though these Lie algebras are realized in manifolds with different dimensionality, they are all isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Electrostatics on Branching Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a random probability measure on the profinite completion of the random tree of a branching process and introduce the canonical and grand canonical ensembles of random repelling particles on this random profinite completion at inverse temperature $\beta &gt; 0$. We think of this as a random spatial process of particles in a random tree, and we introduce the notion of the {\em mean} canonical and grand canonical partition functions where in this context `mean' means averaged over the random environment. We give a recursion for these mean partition functions and demonstrate that in certain instances, determined by the law for the branching process, these partition functions as a function of $\beta$ have algebraic properties which generalize those that appear in the non-random and $p$-adic environments.</description>

      <title>Acoustic axes conditions revised</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explanation of the basic acoustic properties of crystals requires a recognition of the acoustic axes. To derive the acoustic axes in a given material, one requires both a workable method and the necessary and sufficient criteria for the existence of the acoustic axes in a partial propagation direction. We apply the reduced form of the acoustic tensor to the acoustic axis conditions in the present work. Using this tensor, we obtain in a compact form, allowing for qualitative analysis, the necessary and sufficient criteria for the existence of the acoustic axis. Furthermore, the well-known Khatkevich criteria and their variants are recast in terms of the reduced acoustic tensor. This paper's primary input is an alternate minimal polynomial-based system of acoustic axes conditions. In this approach, we derive an additional characteristic of acoustic axes: the directions in which the minimal polynomial of the third order is reduced to that of the second order. Next, we offer a general solution to the second-order minimum polynomial equation, that utilizes a scalar and a unit vector for defining the acoustic tensor along the acoustic axis. It is shown that the scalar matches the eigenvalue of the reduced acoustic tensor, and the vector corresponds to the polarization into the single eigenvalue direction. We use the minimal polynomial construction to demonstrate the equivalence of different acoustic axis criteria. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach to actual computations of the acoustic axes and their fundamental properties (phase speeds and polarizations) for high symmetry cases, such as isotropic materials and RTHC crystals.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonians for Quantum Systems with Contact Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the problem of constructing self-adjoint and lower bounded Hamiltonians for a system of $n&gt;2$ non-relativistic quantum particles in dimension three with contact (or zero-range or $\delta$) interactions. Such interactions are described by (singular) boundary conditions satisfied at the coincidence hyperplanes, \emph{i.e.}, when the coordinates of two particles coincide. Following the line of recent works appeared in the literature, we introduce a boundary condition slightly modified with respect to usual boundary condition one has in the one-body problem. With such new boundary condition we can show that the instability property due to the fall to the center phenomenon described by Minlos and Faddeev in 1962 is avoided. Then one obtains a physically reasonable Hamiltonian for the system. We apply the method to the case of a gas of $N$ interacting bosons and to the case of $N$ distinguishable particles of equal mass $M$ interacting with a different particle. In the latter case we also discuss the limit of the model for $M \longrightarrow +\infty$. We show that in the limit one obtains the one-body Hamiltonian for the light particle subject to $N$ (non-local) point interactions placed at fixed positions. We will verify that such non-local point interactions do not exhibit the ultraviolet pathologies that are present in the case of standard local point interactions.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic Yang-Mills fields on $B$-branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considering the $B$-branes over a complex manifold $Y$ as objects of the bounded derived category $D^b(Y)$, we define holomorphic gauge fields on $B$-branes and the Yang-Mills functional for these fields.These definitions are a generalization to $B$-branes of concepts that are well known in the context of vector bundles. Given ${\mathscr F}^{\bullet}\in D^b(Y),$ we show that the Atiyah class $$a({\mathscr F}^{\bullet})\in{\rm Ext}^1({\mathscr F}^{\bullet},\,\Omega^1({\mathscr F}^{\bullet}))$$ is the obstruction to the existence of gauge fields on ${\mathscr F}^{\bullet}.$ When $Y$ be either the projective space ${\mathbb P}^n$ or the variety of complete flags in ${\mathbb C}^3,$ we prove that the cardinal of the set of holomorphic gauge fields on any $B$-brane over $Y$ is $\leq 1.$ We prove that the set of Yang-Mills fields on the $B$-brane ${\mathscr F}^{\bullet},$ if it is nonempty, is in bijective correspondence with the points of an algebraic subset of ${\mathbb C}^m$ defined by $m$ polynomial equations of degree $\leq 3$, where $m={\rm dim}\,{\rm Ext}^0({\mathscr F}^{\bullet},\,\Omega^1({\mathscr F}^{\bullet})).$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain new bounds for the optimal matching cost for empirical measures with unbounded support. For a large class of radially symmetric and rapidly decaying probability laws, we prove for the first time the asymptotic rate of convergence for the whole range of power exponents $p$ and dimensions $d$. Moreover we identify the exact prefactor when $p\le d$. We cover in particular the Gaussian case, going far beyond the currently known bounds. Our proof technique is based on approximate sub- and super-additivity bounds along a geometric decomposition adapted to some features the density, such as its radial symmetry and its decay at infinity.</description>

      <title>Mixing of metastable diffusion processes with Gibbs invariant distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the mixing properties of metastable diffusion processes which possess a Gibbs invariant distribution. For systems with multiple stable equilibria, so-called metastable transitions between these equilibria are required for mixing since the unique invariant distribution is concentrated on these equilibria. Consequently, these systems exhibit slower mixing compared to those with a unique stable equilibrium, as analyzed in Barrera and Jara (Ann. Appl. Probab. 30:1164-1208, 2020). . Our proof is based on the theory of metastability, which is a primary tool for studying systems with multiple stable equilibria. Within this framework, we compute the total variation distance between the distribution of the diffusion process and its invariant distribution for any time scale larger than $\epsilon^{-1}$. Finally, we derive precise asymptotics for the mixing time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study composite assemblages of dielectrics and metamaterials with respectively positive and negative material parameters. In the continuum case, for a scalar equation, such media may exhibit so-called plasmonic resonances for certain values of the (negative) conductivity in the metamaterial. This work investigates such resonances, and the associated eigenfunctions, in the case of composite conducting networks. Unlike the continuous media, we show a surprising specific dependence on the geometry of the network of the resonant values. We also study how the problem is affected by the choice of boundary conditions on the external nodes of the structure.</description>

      <title>Polar Duality and Quasi-States: a Geometric Picture of Quantum Indeterminacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to suggest a new interpretation of quantum indeterminacy using the notion of polar duality from convex geometry. Our approach does not involve the usual variances and covariances, whose use to describe quantum uncertainties has been questioned by Uffink and Hilgevoord. We introduce instead the geometric notion of "quasi-states" which are related in a way that will be explained to the notion of "quantum blob" we have introduced in previous work. Considering the symmetries of the quasi-states leads to the definition of the canonical group of a quasi-state, which allows to classify them.</description>

      <title>Feynman-Kac perturbation of $C^*$ quantum stochastic flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The method of Feynman-Kac perturbation of quantum stochastic processes has a long pedigree, with the theory usually developed within the framework of processes on von Neumann algebras. In this work, the theory of operator spaces is exploited to enable a broadening of the scope to flows on $C^*$ algebras. Although the hypotheses that need to be verified in the general setting may seem numerous, we provide auxiliary results that enable this to be simplified in many of the cases which arise in practice. A wide variety of examples is provided by way of illustration.</description>

      <title>Resolvent analysis of a swimming foil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study employs resolvent analysis to explore the dynamics and coherent structures in the boundary layer of a foil that swims via a travelling wave undulation. A modified NACA foil shape is used together with undulatory kinematics to represent fish-like bodies at realistic Reynolds numbers ($ \mathit{Re} = 10,000 $ and $ \mathit{Re} = 100,000 $) in both thrust- and drag-producing propulsion regimes. We introduce a novel coordinate transformation that enables the implementation of the data-driven resolvent analysis \citep{herrmann_data-driven_2021} to dissect the stability of the boundary layer of the swimming foil. This is the first study to implement resolvent analysis on deforming bodies with non-zero thickness and at realistic swimming Reynolds numbers. The analysis reinforces the notion that swimming kinematics drive the system's physics. In drag-producing regimes, it reveals breakdown mechanisms of the propulsive wave, while thrust-producing regimes show a uniform wave amplification across the foil's back half. The key thrust and drag mechanisms scale with the boundary-layer thickness, implying geometric self-similarity in this $\mathit{Re}$ regime. In addition, we identify a mechanism that is less strongly coupled to the body motion. We offer a comparison to a rough foil that reduces the amplification of this mechanism, demonstrating the potential of roughness to control the amplification of key mechanisms in the flow. The results provide valuable insights into the dynamics of swimming bodies and highlight avenues for developing opposition control strategies.</description>

      <title>Study of Breather Structures in the Framework of Gardner Equation in Electron-Positron-Ion Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In different nonlinear mediums, the wave trains carry energy and expose many amazing features. To describe a nonlinear phenomenon, a soliton is one that preserves its shape and amplitude even after the collision. Breather is one kind of soliton structure, which is a localized wave that periodically oscillates in amplitude. This article uses the reductive perturbation technique (RPT) to get the GE from a plasma system with four parts: cold positrons that can move, hot positrons and hot electrons that are spread out in a kappa pattern, and positive ions that can't move. Then, using the Hirota bilinear method (HBM), it is possible to obtain the multi-soliton and breather structures of GE. Breathers are fluctuating regional wave packets and significantly participate in hydrodynamics as well as optics; besides, their interaction can alter the dynamical characteristics of the wave fields. We also incorporate a detailed numerical simulation study based on a newly designed code by two of the co-authors. It is found that in our plasma system, soliton solutions, especially breather solutions, exist. Although superthermal (kappa-distributed) electrons and positrons play an important role in soliton structures, This type of analysis can also apply to the propagation of finite-amplitude waves in natural phenomena like the atmosphere, ocean, optic fibres, signal processing, etc. It should also be useful to study different electrostatic disturbances in space and laboratory plasmas, where immobile positive ions, superthermal electrons, superthermal hot positrons, and mobile cold positrons are the major plasma species.</description>

      <title>Perturbative approach to time-dependent quantum systems and applications to one-crossing multistate Landau-Zener models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a perturbative approach for studying a class of multi-level time-dependent quantum systems with constant off-diagonal couplings and diabatic energies being odd functions of time. Applying this approach to a general multistate Landau-Zener (MLZ) model with all diabatic levels crossing at one point (named the one-crossing MLZ model), we derive analytical formulas of all its transition probabilities up to $4$th order in the couplings. These analytical asymptotic solutions at the diabatic limit can serve as reliable benchmarks for future studies of any unsolved one-crossing MLZ models.</description>

      <title>Learning Group Invariant Calabi-Yau Metrics by Fundamental Domain Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new invariant machine learning models that approximate the Ricci-flat metric on Calabi-Yau (CY) manifolds with discrete symmetries. We accomplish this by combining the $\phi$-model of the cymetric package with non-trainable, $G$-invariant, canonicalization layers that project the $\phi$-model's input data (i.e. points sampled from the CY geometry) to the fundamental domain of a given symmetry group $G$. These $G$-invariant layers are easy to concatenate, provided one compatibility condition is fulfilled, and combine well with spectral $\phi$-models. Through experiments on different CY geometries, we find that, for fixed point sample size and training time, canonicalized models give slightly more accurate metric approximations than the standard $\phi$-model. The method may also be used to compute Ricci-flat metric on smooth CY quotients. We demonstrate this aspect by experiments on a smooth $\mathbb{Z}^2_5$ quotient of a 5-parameter quintic CY manifold.</description>

      <title>A survey on isothermal and isentropic Baer-Nunziato-type models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-component Baer-Nunziato-type models for isothermal and isentropic fluids are investigated. These are given by balance equations for volume fractions, density and momentum for each component accounting for the relaxation to equilibrium by means of relaxation terms. Mathematical properties of the models are derived such as hyperbolicity and symmetrization. The fields are characterized and corresponding Riemann invariants are determined. Appropriate entropy-entropy flux pairs are derived taking into account the phasic energy equations including the heat flux. Physically meaningful constraints are presented that ensure the entropy inequality to hold. Instantaneous relaxation to equilibrium is investigated and appropriate algorithms are presented. Numerical results for the isothermal Baer-Nunziato model are compared to an isothermal Euler model and to an isothermal phase-field model.</description>

      <title>Applications of the Green tensor estimates of the nonstationary Stokes system in the half space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a series of applications of the pointwise estimates of the (unrestricted) Green tensor of the nonstationary Stokes system in the half space, established in our previous work [CMP 2023]. First, we show the $L^1$-$L^q$ estimates for the Stokes flow with possibly non-solenoidal $L^1$ initial data, generalizing the results of Giga-Matsui-Shimizu [Math. Z. 1999] and Desch-Hieber-Pr\"uss [J. Evol. Equ. 2001]. Second, we construct mild solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations in the half space with mixed-type pointwise decay or with pointwise decay alongside boundary vanishing. Finally, we explore various coupled fluid systems in the half space including viscous resistive magnetohydrodynamics equations, a coupled system for the flow and the magnetic field of MHD type, and the nematic liquid crystal flow. For each of these systems, we construct mild solutions in $L^q$, pointwise decay, and uniformly local $L^q$ spaces.</description>

      <title>Approach to stationarity for the KPZ fixed point with boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current fluctuations for the one-dimensional totally asymmetric exclusion process (TASEP) connected to reservoirs of particles, and their large scale limit to the KPZ fixed point in finite volume, are studied using exact methods. Focusing on the maximal current phase for TASEP, corresponding to infinite boundary slopes for the KPZ height field, we obtain for general initial condition an exact expression for the late time correction to stationarity, involving extreme value statistics of Brownian paths. In the special cases of stationary and narrow wedge initial conditions, a combination of Bethe ansatz and numerical conjectures alternatively provide fully explicit exact expressions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the higher order Schr\"odinger operator $H=(-\Delta)^m+V(x)$ in $n$ dimensions with real-valued potential $V$ when $n&gt;4m$, $m\in \mathbb N$. We adapt our recent results for $m&gt;1$ to show that when $H$ has a threshold eigenvalue the wave operators are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb R^n)$ for the natural range $1\leq p&lt;\frac{n}{2m}$ in both even and odd dimensions. The approach used works without distinguishing even and odd cases, and matches the range of boundedness in the classical case when $m=1$. The proof applies in the classical $m=1$ case as well and simplifies the argument.</description>

      <title>Inner Product in Highest-Weight Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:1803.02679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the inner product of states corresponding to weights of finite-dimensional highest-weight representations of classical groups.
  We prove that the action of the raising operators would reduce a state of hight-weight representation to a linear combination of states of highest-weight representation, with the level decreased by one.
  Then we propose an iterative algorithm for calculating the inner products of sates efficiently, revealing the intricate structure of the representation.
  As applications, we discuss the unitarity of the highest-weight representation and propose a conjecture. We determine the norm of a special class of states. And we completely determine the inner products of states of the minuscule representations. The algorithm proposed is applicable to the highest-weight representation of affine Lie algebra without modifications. These findings can be used to study the construction of solutions to Kapustin-Witten equations which are based on the fundamental solutions of Toda systems.</description>

      <title>Spectral density of complex eigenvalues and associated mean eigenvector self-overlaps at the edge of elliptic Ginibre ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the density of complex eigenvalues, $\rho(z)$, and the associated mean eigenvector self-overlaps, $\mathcal{O}(z)$, at the spectral edge of $N \times N$ real and complex elliptic Ginibre matrices, as $N \to \infty$. Two different regimes of ellipticity are studied: strong non-Hermiticity, keeping the ellipticity parameter $\tau$ fixed and weak non-Hermiticity with $\tau \rightarrow 1 $ as $N \rightarrow \infty$. At strong non-Hermiticity, we find that both $\rho(z)$ and $\mathcal{O}(z)$ have the same leading order behaviour across the elliptic Ginibre ensembles, establishing the expected universality. In the limit of weak non-Hermiticity, we find different results for $\rho(z)$ and $\mathcal{O}(z)$ across the two ensembles. This paper is the final of three papers that we have presented addressing the mean self-overlap of eigenvectors in these ensembles.</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness of the strictly convex quadrilateral central configuration with a fixed angle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conjecture of the existence and the uniqueness of the strictly convex quadrilateral central configuration for the Newtonian 4-body problem is one of the most-talked open problems in the study of the classical n-body problems in celestial mechanics. MacMillan and Bartky first gave its general existence in the 1930s and a particular case for its uniqueness. Still, the general case has yet to be solved perfectly since it was considered by Sim'{o} and Yoccoz in the 1980s and was first mentioned by Albouy and Fu in 2008 in the formal publication. Using coordinates of mutual distances and Morse's critical point theory, we give the (at most) uniqueness of the planar strictly convex 4-body central configuration when the angle of one pair of the opposite sides is given.</description>

      <title>Pole-skipping of gravitational waves in the backgrounds of four-dimensional massive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15921v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pole-skipping is a property of gravitational waves dictated by their behaviour at horizons of black holes. It stems from the inability to unambiguously impose ingoing boundary conditions at the horizon at an infinite discrete set of Fourier modes. The phenomenon has been best understood, when such a description exists, in terms of dual holographic (AdS/CFT) correlation function that take the value of '0/0' at these special points. In this work, we investigate details of pole-skipping purely from the point of view of classical gravity in 4d massive black hole geometries with flat, spherical and hyperbolic horizons, and with an arbitrary cosmological constant. We show that pole-skipping points naturally fall into two categories: the algebraically special points and a set of pole-skipping points that is common to the even and odd channels of perturbations. Our analysis utilises and generalises (to arbitrary maximally symmetric horizon topology and cosmological constant) the 'integrable' structure of the Darboux transformations, which relate the master field equations that describe the evolution of gravitational perturbations in the two channels. Finally, we provide new insights into a number of special cases: spherical black holes, asymptotically Anti-de Sitter black branes and pole-skipping at the cosmological horizon in de Sitter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models for open quantum systems, which play important roles in electron transport problems and quantum computing, must take into account the interaction of the quantum system with the surrounding environment. Although such models can be derived in some special cases, in most practical situations, the exact models are unknown and have to be calibrated. This paper presents a learning method to infer parameters in Markovian open quantum systems from measurement data. One important ingredient in the method is a direct simulation technique of the quantum master equation, which is designed to preserve the completely-positive property with guaranteed accuracy. The method is particularly helpful in the situation where the time intervals between measurements are large. The approach is validated with error estimates and numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate long time asymptotics of the modified Camassa-Holm equation in three transition zones under a nonzero background. The first transition zone lies between the soliton region and the first oscillatory region, the second one lies between the second oscillatory region and the fast decay region, and possibly, the third one, namely, the collisionless shock region, that bridges the first transition region and the first oscillatory region. Under a low regularity condition on the initial data, we obtain Painlev\'e-type asymptotic formulas in the first two transition regions, while the transient asymptotics in the third region involves the Jacobi theta function. We establish our results by performing a $\bar{\partial}$ nonlinear steepest descent analysis to the associated Riemann-Hilbert problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define natural volume forms on $n$-dimensional oriented pseudo-Finslerian manifolds with non-degenerate $m$-th root metrics. Our definitions of the natural volume forms depend on the parity of the positive integer $m&gt;1$. The advantage of the stated definitions is their algebraic structure. The natural volume forms are expressed in terms of Cayley hyperdeterminants. In particular, the computation of the natural volume form does not require the difficult integration over the domain within the indicatrix in the tangent space $T_x M^n$ of the pseudo-Finslerian manifold at a point $x$.</description>

      <title>Substructures of the Weyl group and their physical applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study substructures of the Weyl group of conformal transformations of the metric of (pseudo)Riemannian manifolds. These substructures are identified by differential constraints on the conformal factors of the transformations which are chosen such that their composition is associative. Mathematically, apart from rare exceptions, they are partial associative groupoids, not groups, so they do not have an algebra of infinitesimal transformations, but this limitation can be partially circumvented using some of their properties cleverly. We classify and discuss the substructures with two-derivatives differential constraints, the most famous of which being known as the harmonic or restricted Weyl group in the physics literature, but we also show the existence of a lightcone constraint which realizes a proper subgroup of the Weyl group. We then show the physical implications that come from invariance under the two most important substructures, concentrating on classical properties of the energy-momentum tensor and a generalization of the quantum trace anomaly. We also elaborate further on the harmonic substructure, which can be interpreted as partial gauge fixing of full Weyl invariance using BRST methods. Finally, we discuss how to construct differential constraints of arbitrary higher-derivative order and present, as examples, generalizations involving scalar constraints with four and six derivatives.</description>
