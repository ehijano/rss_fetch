      <title>Koszul duality and Calabi-Yau structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Koszul duality between differential graded categories and pointed curved coalgebras interchanges smooth and proper (also known as left and right) Calabi-Yau structures. We discuss the following two applications. For a finite-dimensional Lie algebra a smooth Calabi-Yau structure on the universal enveloping algebra is equivalent to a proper Calabi-Yau structure on the Chevalley- Eilenberg chain coalgebra, which exists if and only if Poincare duality is satisfied. For any topological space X having the homotopy type of a finite complex we show an oriented Poincare duality structure (with local coefficients) on X is equivalent to a proper Calabi-Yau structure on the dg coalgebra of chains on X and to a smooth Calabi-Yau structure on the dg algebra of singular chains of the based loop space of X.</description>

      <title>How Category Theory Works: The Elements &amp; Distinctions Analysis of the Morphisms, Duality, and Universal Constructions in Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.05733v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to show that the dual notions of elements &amp; distinctions are the basic analytical concepts needed to unpack and analyze morphisms, duality, and universal constructions in the Sets, the category of sets and functions. The analysis extends directly to other concrete categories (groups, rings, vector spaces, etc.) where the objects are sets with a certain type of structure and the morphisms are functions that preserve that structure. Then the elements &amp; distinctions-based definitions can be abstracted in purely arrow-theoretic way for abstract category theory. In short, the language of elements &amp; distinctions is the conceptual language in which the category of sets is written, and abstract category theory gives the abstract arrows version of those definitions.</description>

      <title>The Logical Theory of Canonical Maps: The Elements &amp; Distinctions Analysis of the Morphisms, Duality, Canonicity, and Universal Constructions in Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.08583v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Category theory gives a mathematical characterization of naturality but not of canonicity. The purpose of this paper is to develop the logical theory of canonical maps based on the broader demonstration that the dual notions of elements &amp; distinctions are the basic analytical concepts needed to unpack and analyze morphisms, duality, canonicity, and universal constructions in Set, the category of sets and functions. The analysis extends directly to other Set-based concrete categories (groups, rings, vector spaces, etc.). Elements and distinctions are the building blocks of the two dual logics, the Boolean logic of subsets and the logic of partitions. The partial orders (inclusion and refinement) in the lattices for the dual logics define the canonical morphisms (where `canonical' is always relative to the given data, not an absolute property of a morphism). The thesis is that the maps that are canonical in Set are the ones that are defined (given the data of the situation) by these two logical partial orders and by the compositions of those maps.</description>

      <title>The higher algebra of weighted colimits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of weighted colimits in the framework of weakly bienriched $\infty$-categories, an extension of Lurie's notion of enriched $\infty$-categories. We prove an existence result for weighted colimits, study weighted colimits of diagrams of enriched functors, express weighted colimits via enriched coends, characterize the enriched $\infty$-category of enriched presheaves as the free cocompletion under weighted colimits, prove a Bousfield-Kan formula for weighted colimits and an enriched adjoint functor theorem and develop a theory of universally adjoining weighted colimits to an enriched $\infty$-category. Via the latter we construct for every presentably $\mathbb{E}_{k+1}$-monoidal $\infty$-category $\mathcal{V}$ for $1 \leq k \leq \infty$ and set $\mathcal{H}$ of weights a presentably $\mathbb{E}_k$-monoidal structure on the $\infty$-category of $\mathcal{V}$-enriched $\infty$-categories that admit $\mathcal{H}$-weighted colimits. Varying $\mathcal{H}$ this $\mathbb{E}_k$-monoidal structure interpolates between the tensor product for $\mathcal{V}$-enriched $\infty$-categories and the relative tensor product for $\infty$-categories presentably left tensored over $\mathcal{V}$. Studying functoriality in $\mathcal{H}$ we deduce that taking $\mathcal{V}$-enriched presheaves is $\mathbb{E}_k$-monoidal with respect to the tensor product on small $\mathcal{V}$-enriched $\infty$-categories and the relative tensor product on $\infty$-categories presentably left tensored over $\mathcal{V}.$ As key applications we construct for every $n \geq 1 $ and set $\mathcal{K}$ of $(\infty, n)$-categories a tensor product for $(\infty,n)$-categories that admit $\mathcal{K}$-indexed (op)lax colimits, a tensor product for Cauchy-complete $\mathcal{V}$-enriched $\infty$-categories and tensor products for (Cauchy complete) $n$-stable, $n$-additive and $n$-preadditive $(\infty,n)$-categories.</description>

      <title>The category of topological spaces and open maps does not have products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13951v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the category of topological spaces and open maps does not have binary products, thus resolving the Esakia problem in the negative. We also prove that the categories of complete Heyting algebras and complete closure algebras do not have binary coproducts.</description>
