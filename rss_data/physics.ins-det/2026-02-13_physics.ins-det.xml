      <title>High-level hadronic tau lepton triggers of the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trigger system of the CMS detector is pivotal in the acquisition of data for physics measurements and searches. Studies of final states characterized by hadronic decays of tau leptons require the reconstruction and the identification of genuine tau leptons against quark- and gluon-initiated jets at the trigger level. This is a difficult task, particularly as improvements to the LHC have resulted in an increased number of interactions per bunch crossing in recent years. To address this challenge, a series of machine-learning algorithms with high identification efficiency and low computational cost have been incorporated into the high-level trigger for hadronically decaying tau leptons. In this paper, these developments and the trigger performance are summarized using data collected by the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV in 2022$-$2023, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 62 fb$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Using a 4-megapixel hybrid photon counting detector for fast, lab-based nanoscale x-ray tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid photon counting detectors (HPCDs) have unlocked new capabilities for x-ray-based measurements at synchrotrons around the world in the last 30 years. By leveraging independently optimized sensor and readout layers, they offer high quantum efficiency ($&gt; 80 \%$), ultra-low dark counts, sub-pixel point-spread function, and high count rates ($&gt; 10^{6}$ counts per pixel per second). Furthermore, their small pixel size and large active area endow them with excellent coverage and resolution for both real-space and reciprocal space imaging. Here, we demonstrate that HPCDs are also well-suited for laboratory-based nanoscale x-ray tomography (nano-xCT). We perform nano-xCT on an integrated circuit fabricated at the 130-nm node and produce a 3D reconstruction with 40 times more photons collected 20 times faster than in this group's previous work, for an overall speedup of 800$\times$. We review the technical considerations of using an HPCD for tabletop tomography. We quantify our reconstruction image quality using well-established metrics, including the modulation transfer function (MTF), Fourier shell correlation (FSC), and contrast-to-noise (CNR), to validate our choice of experimental parameters that provide sufficient resolution and imaging speed. Using these metrics, we determine that even under current experimental conditions, 160 nm wiring features are reconstructed at 75-80 nm spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Performance and pulse shape discrimination of glass scintillator SG101 for neutron detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed characterization of the thermal neutron sensitive transparent glass scintillator SG101, benchmarked against the conventional LiF ZnS(Ag)based scintillator EJ426. The detection efficiency, energy resolution, and pulse shape discrimination (PSD) performance ofSG101 were evaluated under AmBe neutron irradiation. When coupled with organic scintillators(EJ200 or EJ276),the SG101 EJ200 system achieves a figure of merit (FOM) of 3.81 for thermal neutron/gamma separation, while the SG101 EJ276 configuration resolves three distinct particle populations gamma rays, fast neutrons, and thermal neutrons with FOM values of 3.46 and2.21, respectively. Correlation analysis reveals that the number of fast thermal neutron coincidence events significantly exceeds the accidental background, and the count of gamma fast thermal neutron triple-coincidence events is also far higher than the expected accidental rate, confirming significant physical correlations for both event types within a 100 us time window. These results demonstrate that SG101 is a promising candidate for applications requiring high-efficiency thermal neutron detection and precise event tagging coupling with a scintillator with PSD approach</description>

      <title>GPU-Accelerated Analytic Simulation of Sparse Signals in Pixelated Time Projection Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a GPU-accelerated simulation package,
  TRED, for next-generation neutrino detectors with pixelated
  charge readout, leveraging community-driven software ecosystems to
  ensure sustainability and extensibility. We introduce two generic
  contributions: (i) an effective-charge calculation based on Gaussian
  quadrature rules for numerical integration, and (ii) a sparse,
  block-binned tensor representation that enables efficient FFT-based
  computation of induced signals on readout electrodes for sparsely
  activated detector volumes. The former captures sub-grid structure
  without requiring dense sampling, while the latter achieves low
  memory usage and scalable runtime, as demonstrated in benchmark
  studies. The underlying data representation is applicable to
  large-scale detectors and to other computational problems involving
  sparse activity.</description>

      <title>Beyond One-Thousandth Energy Resolution with an AlMn TES Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superconducting Transition-Edge Sensor (TES) is a critical technology for next-generation X-ray spectrometers, known for its exceptional energy resolution. In the last decade, TESs based on AlMn alloy films have been extensively used in several cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. The advantages of simple fabrication process and easily tunable critical temperature make them an alternative to bilayer TESs. However, they have rarely been applied to X-ray detection until now. We developed an annular AlMn TES for X-ray detection and tested it in a dilution refrigerator with a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) amplifier, achieving an Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of 12.1 +- 0.3 eV at 17.48 keV. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an AlMn TES achieving an energy resolution below 0.1%, highlighting its potential for high-resolution X-ray detection.</description>

      <title>Solvothermal vapor annealing and environmental control setup with adjustable magnetic field module for GISAXS studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A compact, modular environmental control and solvothermal vapor annealing chamber designed for maintaining a controlled atmosphere with regard to solvent humidity and temperature is presented. The setup allows ex situ and in situ grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) investigations of thin film self-assembly and reorganization. Its modular slotting system enables stable reconfiguration, including the integration of an adjustable magnetic field module. The temperature is maintained via a water-based heating and cooling loop supplemented by resistive elements, and the solvent vapor environment is regulated using a commercial controlled mixing and evaporation unit. The performance of the setup is validated through measurements of fill and quench times together with magnetic field mapping with Gauss meter measurements and finite element simulations. Further, the versatility of the setup is demonstrated with four research examples using the chamber for solvothermal vapor annealing of block copolymer thin films together with lab-based ex situ and in situ GISAXS measurements. The portable new design offers robust environmental control and flexibility for advanced thin film investigations both in the lab and at large scale facilities. The design can be adapted for grazing incidence small-angle neutron scattering, GISANS.</description>

      <title>Unconditional full vector magnetometry using spin selectivity in Nitrogen Vacancy centers in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensors based on nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have been a central topic in the sensing community for more than a decade. The extraordinary properties at room temperature of the spin system in diamond have made it one of the most prominent quantum platforms for the development of commercial quantum sensors. In particular, the sensitivity of the electronic spin in NV centers has made diamond-based magnetic sensors of special interest for their potential application in medical, industrial or navigation solutions. However, the use of these sensors for universal vector magnetometry was constrained by the need for previous knowledge on the field being measured to fully exploit their benefits. In this work, we show a method to perform unconditional vector magnetometry without the need of external information on the magnetic field, based only on the spatial arrangement of the diamond and the microwave antenna combination. While previous NV-based vector magnetometry methods require partial knowledge of the magnetic field (e.g. a calibrated bias field), we exploit the possibilities of selecting particular directions of the spins in the diamond with elliptically polarized microwave fields. We prove that our method allows to estimate both magnitude and direction of external magnetic fields without further assumptions or constraints.</description>

      <title>Magnetic dipole-dipole transition for scintillation quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11361v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A magnetic dipole-dipole interaction is proposed as a scintillation quenching mechanism. The interaction rate follows $R^{-6}$ as the electric dipole-dipole interaction in F$\mathrm{\ddot{o}}$ster resonance energy transfer theory. The proposed mechanism causes a long-range resonance energy transfer, and the resonance condition is that the spins of donor and acceptor electrons both flip, and the energy level differences are the same. The new mechanism is distinct to the known spin-orbit coupling induced intersystem crossing, and it can enhance the overall intersystem crossing rate. When oxygen or organic molecules including heavy elements are dissolved in a liquid scintillator, these requirements are possible to be satisfied. The proposal in the paper adds a new approach for scintillation quenching in liquid scintillators.</description>

      <title>Improving terahertz-detection sensitivity of 8x8 FET arrays through liquid-nitrogen cooling in a compact low-noise cryostat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the sensitivity of antenna-coupled field-effect transistors (FETs) to terahertz (THz) radiation improves continuously with decreasing temperature. The noise-equivalent power (NEP) of 540 GHz patch-antenna-coupled FETs decreases as temperature reduces to 20 K. We project NEP values approaching 1 to 2 pW/sqrt(Hz) under efficient power coupling conditions (e.g., using a superstrate Si-lens), which is comparable to superconducting niobium transition-edge sensors (TESs) at 4 K. Building on these findings, a compact, low-noise, liquid-nitrogen-cooled (77 K) FET-based direct (incoherent) THz-power sensing system} for spectroscopy applications was realized. Here, an 8x8 pixel-binned detector array fabricated in a commercial 65-nm Si-CMOS process, was optimized for operation in the 2.85 to 3.4 THz band. Characterization was performed in the focal plane of a 2.85-THz quantum-cascade laser delivering approx. 2~mW of THz power. A linear dynamic range exceeding 67 dB was achieved without saturation (for 1~Hz-detection bandwidth). The system provides a -3 dB readout bandwidth of 5 MHz, exceeding that of conventional thermal detectors (typically 1 kHz). Combined with its broad temperature operability 20 K to 300 K and compact design, the system is particularly well suited for space- and payload-constrained platforms such as balloon- and satellite-based missions, where deep cryogenic cooling is impractical.</description>
