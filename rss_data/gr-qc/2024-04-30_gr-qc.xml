      <title>Hawking radiation as a manifestation of spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the black hole evaporation can be modelled as a process where one symmetry of the system is spontaneously broken continuously. We then identify three free-parameters of the system. The sign of one of the free-parameters, governs whether the particles emitted by the black-hole are fermions or bosons. The present model explains why the Black Hole evaporation process is so universal. Interestingly, this universality emerges naturally inside certain modifications of gravity.</description>

      <title>Behaviours of rip cosmological models in $f(Q,C)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the Universe's rip cosmology theories have been provided for the $f(Q,C)$ gravity theory, where $Q$ and $C$ stand for the non-metricity scalar and boundary term. We assumed $f(Q,C)=\alpha Q^{n}+\beta C$ and analyzed the nature of the physical parameters for the Little Rip, Big Rip and Pseudo Rip models. In the LR and PR models, the EoS parameter exhibits phantom characteristics but remains closely aligned with the $\Lambda$CDM line. After investigating the energy conditions, we recognised that our model violates the strong energy constraint. Avoiding singularity situations has been noted in all of these accelerated models. The characteristics of the jerk and snap parameters have been investigated. Our model provides an effective description of the Universe's evolutionary history and fits well with contemporary cosmic data.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions, critical behavior and microstructure of the FRW universe in the framework of higher order GUP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the the phase transition, critical behavior and microstructure of the FRW in the framework of a new higher order generalized uncertainty principle. Our initial step involves deriving the equation of state by defining the work density $W$ from GUP-corrected Friedmann equations as the thermodynamic pressure $P$. Based on the modified equation of state, we conduct an analysis of the $P-V$ phase transition in the FRW universe. Subsequently, we obtain the critical exponents and coexistence curves for the small and large phases of the FRW universe around the critical point. Finally, employing Ruppeiner geometry, we derive the thermodynamic curvature scalar $R_N$, investigating its sign-changing curve and spinodal curve. The results reveal distinctive thermodynamic properties for FRW universes with positive and negative GUP parameters $\beta$. In the case of $\beta&gt;0$, the phase transition, critical behavior and microstructure of FRW universe are consistent with those of Van der Waals fluids. Conversely, for $\beta&lt;0$, the results resemble those obtained through effective scalar field theory. These findings underscore the capacity of quantum gravity to induce phase transitions in the universe, warranting further in-depth exploration.</description>

      <title>Torsion and Chern-Simons gravity in 4D space-times from a Geometrodynamical four-form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Hermann Minkowski's pioneering formulation of special relativity, the space-time geometry in any inertial frame is described by the line-element $ds^2= \eta_{\mu \nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu$. It is interesting to note that not only the Minkowski metric $\eta_{\mu \nu} $ is invariant under proper Lorentz transformations, the totally antisymmetric Levi-Civita tensor $e_{\mu \nu \alpha \beta} $ too is. In general relativity (GR), $\eta_{\mu \nu} $ of the flat space-time gets generalized to a dynamical, space-time dependent metric tensor $ g_{\mu \nu} $ that characterizes a curved space-time geometry. In the present study, it is put forward that the flat space-time Levi-Civita tensor gets elevated to a dynamical four-form field $\tilde {w} $ in curved space-time manifolds, i.e. $e_{\mu \nu \alpha \beta} \rightarrow w_{\mu \nu \alpha \beta} (x) = \phi (x) \ e_{\mu \nu \alpha \beta} $ so that $\tilde {w} = {1\over {4!}} \ w_{\mu \nu \rho \sigma} \ \tilde{d} x^\mu \wedge \tilde{d} x^\nu \wedge \tilde{d} x^\rho \wedge \tilde{d} x^\sigma$. It is shown that this geometrodynamical four-form field, extends GR by leading naturally to a torsion in the theory as well as to a Chern-Simons gravity. In order to subject the hypothesized four-form field $\tilde {w}$ to observational evidence, we first argue that the associated scalar-density $\phi (x)$ corresponds to an axion-like pseudo-scalar field in the Minkowski space-time, and that it can also masquerade as dark matter. Thereafter, we provide a simple semi-classical analysis in which a self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensate of such ultra-light pseudo-scalars leads to the formation of a supermassive black hole.</description>

      <title>Spherically Symmetric Wormhole Solutions admitting Karmarkar Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigated the viable traversable wormhole solutions through Karmarkar condition in the context of $f(\mathcal{G},T)$ theory. A static spherical spacetime with anisotropic matter configuration is used to study the wormhole geometry. Karmarkar condition is used to develop a viable shape function for a static wormhole structure. A wormhole geometry is constructed using the resulting shape function that satisfies all the required conditions and connects the asymptotically flat regions of the spacetime. To assess the viability of traversable wormhole geometries, the energy conditions are analyzed by various models of this theory. Further, their stable state is investigated through sound speed and adiabatic index. This investigation demonstrates the presence of viable traversable wormhole solutions in the modified theory.</description>

      <title>Kramer's Escape Rate and Phase Transition Dynamics in AdS Black Holes with Dark Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore free energy landscapes for black holes influenced by 'dark' structure, assessing how additional parameters affect escape and transition rates during phase transitions. In our dual-perspective analysis, we first consider the Kramers' rate as a function of the black hole radius. From this viewpoint, the escape rate from smaller to larger black holes will consistently be greater than the reverse. From the second perspective, we consider the escape rate as a function of temperature (pressure). In both models under study, initially, the behavior of the probability diagrams is akin to the radius-based behavior. However, with an increase in temperature (and corresponding pressure), we reach a specific and distinct point, where the systems will move towards either smaller or larger black holes with the same probability. Beyond this temperature (pressure), the behavior of the models diverges. In the nonlinear model, an inversion occurs where the escape rate from larger black holes to smaller ones becomes predominant. This inversion area seems to be significantly reduced compared to the charged black hole model, although it is still discernible in the temperature-based escape rate diagram. In other words, within the temperature range studied, where the likelihood of radiative conditions and movement from a large black hole to a small black hole is less, It seems that the addition of dark parameters minimizes the occurrence of this transition, indicating the subtle influence of dark structures on the phase transition dynamics between black holes. In the string model, although the trend of increasing pressure in the transition from a large black hole to a smaller one is greater than the reverse, it seems that the transition process from a small black hole to a larger one, with decreasing pressure, completely prevents the 'low probable' transition from a large black hole to a smaller one.</description>

      <title>Imprints of dark energy models on structural properties of charged gravastars in extended teleparallel gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A gravastar comprises three distinct sections: the interior zone, the middle shell, and its outer region. By considering a specific extended teleparallel gravity model that incorporates conformal Killing vectors and provides the field equations. We observe that the interior part exhibits a repellent force acting on the shell. This is based on the assumption that pressure is analogous to negative energy density. The middle shell consists of ultrarelativistic plasma and pressure, which is directly proportional to the matter density and counteracts the repellent force exerted by the inner zone. In the outer zone, we compute the precise solution in a vacuum and then connect these spacetimes using junction conditions to investigate stability limits. We aim to investigate the influence of dark energy models on the stable characteristics of gravastar configurations. It is worth noting that the phantom field exhibits the highest stable configurations for all physically viable selections of physical parameters. We additionally investigate the influence of physical parameters on the correct length, entropy, and energy of the gravastar.</description>

      <title>Variable Brane Tension and Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we show that in a particular braneworld scenario with variable brane tension, we obtain matter acting as dark energy while the gravitational constant $G$ promoted to a scalar field on the brane plays the role of matter (both in the sense they have an 'effective' Equation of State equivalent to that of dark energy and matter respectively). This result is interpreted from the Friedmann equation obtained from our model that exactly matches the standard Friedmann equation of General Relativity with a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ in terms of the aforementioned quantities. The universe is assumed to consist of only matter and dark energy in this model which is a good approximation for our universe.</description>

      <title>Overtones of black holes via time-domain integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that first several overtones could calculated by the time-domain integration method for asymptotically de Sitter black holes already at the lowest multipole numbers of gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations. This is not possible for asymptotically flat black holes, for which extraction of frequencies with the Prony method is usually possible with reasonable accuracy only for the fundamental mode. The reason for much better efficiency in the de Sitter case is absence of power-law tails: the quasinormal modes dominate the signal not only at the intermediate stage, but also at asymptotically late times.</description>

Abstract: We study azimuthal geodesics in closed Friedmann-Lem\^aitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmological models and give the angular distance travelled by a test particle moving along such a geodesic during one cycle of expansion and re-collapse of the universe. We extend previous results regarding the path followed by light rays to the two-fluid case, also including a cosmological constant, as well as to massive test particles.</description>

      <title>Universality of the thermodynamics of a quantum-mechanically radiating black hole departing from thermality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathur and Mehta won the third prize in the 2023 Gravity Research Foundation Essay Competition for proving the universality of black hole (BH) thermodynamics. Specifically, they demonstrated that any Extremely Compact Object (ECO) must have the same BH thermodynamic properties regardless of whether or not the ECO possesses an event horizon. The result is remarkable, but it was obtained under the approximation according to which the BH emission spectrum has an exactly thermal character. In fact, strong arguments based on energy conservation and BH back reaction imply that the spectrum of the Hawking radiation cannot be exactly thermal. In this work the result of Mathur and Mehta will be extended to the case where the radiation spectrum is not exactly thermal using the concept of BH dynamical state.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological Impact of Brane-Chern-Simons Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel extension of massive gravity theory; the Brane-Chern-Simons massive gravity theory. We explore the cosmological implications of this theory by deriving the background equations and demonstrating the existence of self-accelerating solutions. Interestingly, our theory suggests the existence of self-accelerating mechanisms that originate from an effective cosmological constant, leading to intriguing possibilities for understanding the nature of cosmic acceleration. Furthermore, we perform a tensor perturbation analysis to investigate the propagation of gravitational waves in this framework. We derive the dispersion relation for gravitational waves and study their behavior in the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Roberson-Waker cosmology within the context of Brane-Chen-Simons massive gravity. Utilizing the latest Union2 type Ia supernova dataset comprising $557$ SNIa events, we provide observational support for our theoretical framework, indicating that the Brane-Chern-Simons massive gravity theory is consistent with cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Symmetry reduction, gauge reduction, backreaction and consistent higher order perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For interacting classical field theories such as general relativity exact solutions typically can only be found by imposing physically motivated (Killing) {\it symmetry} assumptions. Such highly symmetric solutions are then often used as {\it backgrounds} in a {\it perturbative} approach to more general non-symmetric solutions.
  If the theory is in addition a {\it gauge} theory such as general relativity, the issue arises how to consistently combine the perturbative expansion with the gauge reduction. For instance it is not granted that the corresponding constraints expanded to a given order still close under Poisson brackets with respect to the non-symmetric degrees of freedom up to higher order.
  If one is interested in the problem of {\it backreaction} between symmetric and non-symmetric dgrees of freedom, then one also must consider the symmetric degrees of freedom as dynamical variables which supply additional terms in Poisson brackets with respect to the symmetric degrees of freedom and the just mentioned consistency problem becomes even more complicated.
  In this paper we show for a general theory how to consistently combine all of these notions. The idea is to {\it first} perform the {\it exact} gauge reduction on the {\it full} phase space which results in the reduced phase space of observables and physical Hamiltonian respectively and {\it secondly} expand that physical Hamiltonian perturbatively. Surprisingly, this strategy is not only practically feasible but also avoids the above mentioned tensions.
  We also show how to perform the partial reduction with respect to only the asymmetric constraints but that theory is not quantisable at finite orders unless there is only one symmetric constraint.</description>

      <title>Matrix method and the suppression of Runge's phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-degree polynomial interpolations carried out on uniformly distributed nodes are often plagued by {\it overfitting}, known as Runge's phenomenon. This work investigates Runge's phenomenon and its suppression in various versions of the matrix method for black hole quasinormal modes. It is shown that an appropriate choice of boundary conditions gives rise to desirable suppression of oscillations associated with the increasing Lebesgue constant. For the case of discontinuous effective potentials, where the application of the above boundary condition is not feasible, the recently proposed scheme with delimited expansion domain also leads to satisfactory results. The onset of Runge's phenomenon and its effective suppression are demonstrated by evaluating the relevant waveforms. Furthermore, we argue that both scenarios are either closely related to or practical imitations of the Chebyshev grid. The implications of the present study are also addressed.</description>

      <title>Well-defined $f(Q)$ Gravity, Reconstruction of FLRW Spacetime and Unification of Inflation with Dark Energy Epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate the convenient and mimetic $f(Q)$ gravities in terms of the metric and four scalar fields with the $Q$ being the non-metricity scalar. As a result, it is shown that the obtained field equations are well-defined. By using the field equations, we show how the $f(Q)$ models which realise any given FLRW spacetime may be reconstructed. We construct convenient $f(Q)$ gravity and mimetic $f(Q)$ gravity, which describe the inflation and dark energy epochs and even unify the inflation and dark energy. Moreover, a radiation-dominated epoch and early dark energy may be easily included in the above theories as is explicitly shown. It is shown that the inflationary spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ are consistent with Planck data for some models of $f(Q)$ gravity. Corresponding asymptotic forms of $f(Q)$ and mimetic $f(Q)$ are given. Finally, some remarks on possible reconstruction for spherically symmetric spacetime are given.</description>

      <title>Self-Similar Collapse in Painleve-Gullstrand Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a family of self-similar exact solutions in General Relativity. The solutions are found in a Painleve-Gullstrand coordinate system but can also be transformed smoothly into a diagonal form. The solutions represent a gravitational collapse leading to three possible outcomes, depending on the parameter space : (i) a collapse followed by a bounce and dispersal of the clustered matter distribution, (ii) a rapid collapse followed by a bounce and an eventual re-collapse, and (iii) a standard collapse leading to zero proper volume. Profiles of the energy conditions are studied for all of the scenarios, and it is noted that a bounce is usually associated with a violation of the Null Energy Condition. It is found that more than one null surfaces (apparent horizons) can develop during the collapse. We also discuss that for a general metric tensor having a conformal symmetry, some regions of the parameter space allows a formation of null throat, much like a wormhole. Matching the metric with a Schwarzschild metric in Painleve-Gullstrand form leads to the geodesic equation for a zero energy falling particle in the exterior.</description>

      <title>General Approach on Shadow Radius and Photon Spheres in Asymptotically Flat Spacetimes and the Impact of Mass-Dependent Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of black hole shadows have revolutionized our ability to probe gravity in extreme environments. This manuscript presents a novel analytic method to calculate, in leading-order terms, the key parameters of photon sphere and shadow radius. This method offers advantages for complex metrics where traditional approaches are cumbersome. We further explore the impact of black hole mass on the photon sphere radius, providing insights into black hole interactions with their surroundings. Our findings contribute significantly to black hole physics and gravity under extreme conditions. By leveraging future advancements in observations, such as the next-generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT), this work paves the way for even more precise tests of gravity near black holes.</description>

      <title>On the duality in constant-roll inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a duality in the observables $n_s$, $r$ and the inflaton potential between large and small $\eta_H$ for the constant-roll inflation if the slow-roll parameter $\epsilon_H$ is negligible. In general, the duality between $\eta_H$ and $\bar{\eta}_H$ does not hold for the background evolution of the inflation. For some particular solutions for the constant-roll inflation with $\eta_H$ being a constant, we find that in the small field approximation, the potential takes the quadratic form and it remains the same when the parameter $\eta_H$ changes to $\bar{\eta}_H=3-\eta_H$. If the scalar field is small and the contribution of $\epsilon_H$ is negligible, we find that there exists the logarithmic duality and the duality between large and small $\eta_H$ for the primordial curvature perturbation in inflationary models with the quadratic potential.</description>

      <title>A new framework to follow up candidates from continuous gravitational-wave searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searches for continuous gravitational waves from unknown neutron stars are limited in sensitivity due to their high computational cost. For this reason, developing new methods or improving existing ones can increase the probability of making a detection. In this paper we present a new framework that uses MCMC or nested sampling methods to follow-up candidates of continuous gravitational-wave searches. This framework aims to go beyond the capabilities of PYFSTAT (which is limited to the PTEMCEE sampler), by allowing a flexible choice of sampling algorithm (using BILBY as a wrapper) and multi-dimensional correlated prior distributions. We show that MCMC and nested sampling methods can recover the maximum posterior point for much bigger parameter-space regions than previously thought (including for sources in binary systems), and we present tests that examine the capabilities of the new framework: a comparison between the DYNESTY, NESSAI, and PTEMCEE samplers, the usage of correlated priors, and its improved computational cost.</description>

      <title>No smooth spacetime: Exploring primordial perturbations in Lorentzian quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent analysis of quantum cosmology has focused on the Lorentzian path integral formulations of both the no-boundary and tunneling proposals. However, it has been criticized that the wave function for linearized perturbations around a homogeneous and isotropic background leads to an inverse Gaussian distribution. This results in divergent correlation functions and cosmological inconsistencies. In this paper we explore these perturbation problems in Lorentzian quantum cosmology, focusing in particular on the quantum creation of closed, flat, and open universes from no spacetime and the beginning of primordial inflation. We show that most quantum cosmological scenarios have serious perturbation problems. We also study the effects of trans-Planckian physics on quantum cosmology, using the generalized Corley-Jacobson dispersion as a case study of modified dispersion relations. Our findings indicate that resolving perturbation problems in Lorentzian quantum cosmology with modified dispersion relations remains a challenge. However, the perturbations can be Gaussian in the quantum creation of the flat or open universe within the confines of the saddle-point approximation and the generalized Corley-Jacobson dispersion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of two dimensional gravity models using ideas motivated by the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity. This leads to a rather natural formulation of a theory that has close links with Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. After introducing the theory and discussing its vacuum solutions, we present the Hamiltonian analysis. This implies the presence of a single dynamical degree of freedom, which is in sharp contrast to General Relativity, where there are no degrees of freedom in two spacetime dimensions. Our approach can be extended to various other lower-dimensional gravity theories and thus could be of wider interest.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider, in Minkowski spacetime, higher-order Maxwell Lagrangians with terms quadratic in the derivatives of the field strength tensor, and study their degrees of freedom. Using a 3+1 decomposition of these Lagrangians, we extract the kinetic matrix for the components of the electric field, corresponding to second time derivatives of the gauge field. If the kinetic matrix is invertible, the theory admits five degrees of freedom, namely the usual two polarisations of a photon plus three extra degrees of freedom which are shown to be Ostrogradski ghosts. We also classify the cases where the kinetic matrix is non-invertible and, using analogous simple models, we argue that, even though the degeneracy conditions reduce the number of degrees of freedom, it does not seem possible to fully eliminate all potential Ostrogradski ghosts.</description>

      <title>Torsion-induced axions in string theory, quantum gravity and the cosmological tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the role of torsion in string theory on inducing pseudoscalar degrees of freedom (axions), which in turn couple to (gravitational) Chern-Simons (CS) anomalous terms. Such interactions can induce inflation, of running vacuum type, not requiring external inflaton fields, through condensation of the anomalous terms as a consequence of primordial chiral gravitational-wave (GW) tensor perturbations in a weak-quantum gravity setting. The presence of an UV cutoff for the GW quantum graviton modes opens up the system, leading to a dissipative behaviour realised via the presence of non trivial imaginary parts of the gravitational CS terms. The naive estimate of the life time of inflation based on such imaginary parts, which afflict the pertinent GW Hamiltonian, is quite consistent with the estimates of the duration of inflation based on an analysis of the condensate-induced linear-axion-potential by means of dynamical systems. Such quantum-gravity effects can also contribute positively to the alleviation of cosmological tensions if they survive today. In the talk we discuss the conditions under which such a result may be achieved. We also discuss the potential role of other axions in string theory, coming from compactification, in inducing enhanced densities of primordial black holes during RVM inflation, thereby contributing to significantly increased percentages of these black holes that can play the role of dark matter components. Moreover, under certain circumstances, that we shall discuss in some detail, it is also possible that the initially massless torsion-induced axions can acquire a non-trivial mass during the radiation era, thereby providing additional dark matter components in the Universe. With regards to this aspect, we also emphasise the role of massive right-handed neutrinos, provided that such excitations exist in the relevant spectra.</description>

      <title>Wavelet-based tools to analyze, filter, and reconstruct transient gravitational-wave signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of gravitational-wave (GW) signals is one of the most challenging application areas of signal processing. Wavelet transforms are specially helpful in detecting and analyzing GW transients and several analysis pipelines are based on these transforms, both continuous and discrete. While discrete wavelet transforms have distinct advantages in terms of computing efficiency, continuous wavelet transforms (CWT) produce smooth and visually stunning time-frequency maps. In addition to wavelets the Q-transform is also used, which is a Morlet wavelet-like transform where the width of the Gaussian envelope is parameterized by a parameter denoted by Q. To date, the use of CWTs in GW data analysis has been limited by the higher computational load when compared with discrete wavelets, and also by the lack of an inversion formula for wavelet families that do not satisfy the admissibility condition. In this paper we consider Morlet wavelets parameterized in the same way as the Q-transform (hence the name wavelet Q-transform) which have all the advantages of the Morlet wavelets and where the wavelet transform can be inverted with a computationally efficient specialization of the non-standard inversion formula of Lebedeva and Postnikov [Lebedeva and Postnikov, Royal Society Open Science, 1 (2014) 140124]. We also introduce a two-parameter extension (the wavelet Qp-transform) which is well-adapted to chirping signals like those originating from compact binary coalescences (CBC), and show that it is also invertible just like the wavelet Q-transform. The inversion formulas of both transforms allow for effective noise filtering and produce very clean reconstructions of GW signals. Our preliminary results indicate that the method could be well suited to perform accurate tests of General Relativity by comparing modeled and unmodeled reconstructions of CBC GW signals.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the quantum Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss some thermodynamic properties as well as the stability of a quantum Schwarzschild black hole, comparing the results with those obtained within a bumblebee gravity model. In particular, the Hawking temperature, $T_H$, the entropy, $S$, the heat capacity, $C$, and the Gibbs free energy, $G$, are computed for both cases. In addition to that, we compute the Brown-York quasilocal energy and compare the solution with the Schwarzschild case. We find that in both cases (quantum Schwarzschild and bumblebee gravity model) the temperature, the entropy, and the heat capacity show the same functional form, under the replacement $\lambda^2 \rightarrow \ell$ and vice versa. Specifically, the temperature is found to be lower compared to the classical (Schwarzschild) solution, whereas the entropy is computed to be larger. Moreover, the heat capacity becomes more negative. Notably, a distinct contrast emerges in obtaining the Gibbs free energy between these two cases, and this distinction appears to stem from the ADM mass.</description>

      <title>Weak equivalence principle and nonrelativistic limit of general dispersion relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the weak equivalence principle in the context of modified dispersion relations, a prevalent approach to quantum gravity phenomenology. We find that generic modified dispersion relations violate the weak equivalence principle. The acceleration in general depends on the mass of the test body, unless the Hamiltonian is either two-homogeneous in the test particles' 4-momenta or the corresponding Lagrangian differs from the homogeneous case by a total derivative only. The key ingredient of this calculation is a $3+1$ decomposition of the parametrization invariant relativistic test particle action derived from the dispersion relation. Additionally, we apply a perturbative expansion in the test particle's spatial velocity and the inverse speed of light. To quantify our result, we provide a general formula for the E\"otv\'os factor of modified dispersion relations. As a specific example, we study the $\kappa$-Poincar\'e dispersion relation. Comparing the ensuing non-vanishing E\"otv\'os factor to recent data from the MICROSCOPE experiment, we obtain a bound of $\kappa^{-1}\geq10^{15}{\rm GeV}/c^2.$.</description>

      <title>Mapping eccentricity evolutions between numerical relativity and effective-one-body gravitational waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital eccentricity in compact binaries is considered to be a key tracer of their astrophysical origin, and can be inferred from gravitational-wave observations due to its imprint on the emitted signal. For a robust measurement, accurate waveform models are needed. However, ambiguities in the definition of eccentricity can obfuscate the physical meaning and result in seemingly discrepant measurements. In this work we present a suite of 28 new numerical relativity simulations of eccentric, aligned-spin binary black holes with mass ratios between 1 and 6 and initial post-Newtonian eccentricities between 0.05 and 0.3. We then develop a robust pipeline for measuring the eccentricity evolution as a function of frequency from gravitational-wave observables that is applicable even to signals that span at least $\gtrsim 7$ orbits. We assess the reliability of our procedure and quantify its robustness under different assumptions on the data. Using the eccentricity measured at the first apastron, we initialise effective-one-body waveforms and quantify how the precision in the eccentricity measurement, and therefore the choice of the initial conditions, impacts the agreement with the numerical data. We find that even small deviations in the initial eccentricity can lead to non-negligible differences in the phase and amplitude of the waveforms. However, we demonstrate that we can reliably map the eccentricities between the simulation data and analytic models, which is crucial for robustly building eccentric hybrid waveforms, and to improve the accuracy of eccentric waveform models in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05722v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent result of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) in combination with other cosmological data shows evidence of the evolving dark energy parameterized by $w_0w_a$CDM model. We interpret this result in terms of a quintessential scalar field and demonstrate that it can explain the DESI result even though it becomes eventually phantom in the past. Relaxing the assumption on the functional form of the equation-of-state parameter $w=w(a)$, we also discuss a more realistic quintessential model. The implications of the DESI result for Swampland conjectures, cosmic birefringence, and the fate of the Universe are discussed as well.</description>

      <title>Enhancing dark siren cosmology through multi-band gravitational wave synergetic observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-band gravitational-wave (GW) standard siren observations are poised to herald a new era in the study of cosmic evolution. These observations offer higher signal-to-noise ratios and improved localizations compared to those achieved with single-band GW detection, which are crucial for the cosmological applications of dark sirens. In this work, we explore the role multi-band GW synergetic observations will play in measuring cosmological parameters, particularly in comparison with single GW observatory data. We used mock multi-band dark siren data from third-generation GW detectors and the baseline Decihertz Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory to infer cosmological parameters. Our analysis was conservative, involving only the 89 actual GW events from the current Gravitational Wave Transient Catalogs in our data simulation, facilitating a direct comparison with existing dark siren results. Multi-band GW observations significantly improve sky localization accuracy by two to three orders of magnitude over single-band observations, although their impact on luminosity distance error remains limited. This results in a substantial improvement in the constraints on matter density and the Hubble constant, enhancing them by $75\%$ to $85\%$ and $65\%$ to $82\%$, respectively. We conclude that the significant potential of multi-band GW synergistic observations for detecting GW signals and resolving the Hubble tension is highly promising and warrants anticipation.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Stability Versus Chaos Bound Violation in D-dimensional RN Black Holes: Angular Momentum Effects and Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the Lyapunov exponents for test particles orbiting in unstable circular trajectories around D-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black holes, scrutinizing instances of the chaos bound violation. Notably, we discover that an increase in particle angular momentum exacerbates the breach of the chaos bound. Our research centrally investigates the correlation between black hole thermodynamic phase transitions and the breaking of the chaos limit. Findings suggest that the chaos bound can only be transgressed within thermodynamically stable phases of black holes. Specifically, in the four-dimensional scenario, the critical point of the thermodynamic phase transition aligns with the threshold condition that delineates the onset of chaos bound violation. These outcomes underscore a deep-rooted link between the thermodynamic stability of black holes and the constraints imposed by the chaos bound on particle dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The canonical (CQG) and asymptotically safe (ASQG) approach to quantum gravity share to be both non-perturbative programmes. However, apart from that they seem to differ in several aspects such as: 1. Signature: CQG is Lorentzian while ASQG is mostly Euclidian. 2. Background Independence (BI): CQG is manifesly BI while ASQG is apparently not. 3. Truncations: CQG is apparently free of truncations while ASQG makes heavy use of them.
  The purpose of the present work is to either overcome actual differences or to explain why apparent differences are actually absent. Thereby we intend to enhance the contact and communication between the two communities. The focus of this contribution is on conceptual issues rather than deep technical details such has high order truncations. On the other hand the paper tries to be self-contained in order to be useful to researchers from both communities.
  The point of contact is the path integral formulation of Lorentzian CQG in its reduced phase space formulation which yields the formal generating functional of physical (i.e. gauge invariant) either Schwinger or Feynman N-point functions for (relational) observables. The corresponding effective actions of these generating functionals can then be subjected to the ASQG Wetterich type flow equations which serve in particular to find the rigorous generating fuctionals via the inverse Legendre transform of the fixed pointed effective action.</description>

      <title>Relational Lorentzian Asymptotically Safe Quantum Gravity: Showcase model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent contribution we identified possible points of contact between the asymptotically safe and canonical approach to quantum gravity. The idea is to start from the reduced phase space (often called relational) formulation of canonical quantum gravity which provides a reduced (or physical) Hamiltonian for the true (observable) degrees of freedom. The resulting reduced phase space is then canonically quantised and one can construct the generating functional of time ordered Wightman (i.e. Feynman) or Schwinger distributions respectively from the corresponding time translation unitary group or contraction semigroup respectively as a path integral. For the unitary choice that path integral can be rewritten in terms of the Lorentzian Einstein Hilbert action plus observable matter action and a ghost action. The ghost action depends on the Hilbert space representation chosen for the canonical quantisation and a reduction term that encodes the reduction of the full phase space to the phase space of observavbles. This path integral can then be treated with the methods of asymptically safe quantum gravity in its {\it Lorentzian} version.
  We also exemplified the procedure using a concrete, minimalistic example namely Einstein-Klein-Gordon theory with as many neutral and massless scalar fields as there are spacetime dimensions. However, no explicit calculations were performed. In this paper we fill in the missing steps. Particular care is needed due to the necessary switch to Lorentzian signature which has strong impact on the convergence of ``heat'' kernel time integrals in the heat kernel expansion of the trace involved in the Wetterich equation and which requires different cut-off functions than in the Euclidian version. As usual we truncate at relatively low order and derive and solve the resulting flow equations in that approximation.</description>

      <title>Electrophilic scalar hair from rotating magnetized stars and effects of cosmic neutrino background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight electrophilic scalar field can mediate a long-range force or radiate from a pulsar or a magnetar if the scalar field has a coupling with the Goldreich-Julian charge density or the net electron charge density of the star. The interaction of the electron with the long-range scalar profile results in a spatial variation of the electron mass. A scalar induced magnetic field is created due to such interaction. The mass of the scalar in such cases is constrained by the radius of the star. The scalar field can also radiate from a binary system or an isolated star if the mass of the scalar is less than the orbital frequency and the spin frequency respectively. The electrophilic scalar radiation can contribute to the orbital period loss of binary systems and pulsar spin-down. Comparing with existing and projected experimental sensitivities, we obtain constraints on scalar coupling with ultralight mass. Some of these bounds are stronger than the existing fifth force constraints. The constraints on the scalar coupling can be significantly screened if the scalar has a coupling with the ubiquitous cosmic neutrino background. Improvements in experimental sensitivity and observations of compact objects with stronger magnetic fields and higher angular velocities could further refine these bounds.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Tsallis cosmology using recent low redshift measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently Tsallis cosmology has been presented as a novel proposal for alleviating both $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ tensions. Hence a universe filled with matter and radiation as perfect fluids and considering the Tsallis entropy is confronted using recent cosmological measurements coming from cosmic chronometers, type Ia supernovae, hydrogen II galaxies, quasars, and baryon acoustic oscillations. Following a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis and combining the samples, we constrain the main characteristic parameters $\alpha = 1.031^{+0.054}_{-0.051}$ and $\delta = 1.005^{+0.001}_{-0.001}$ where the uncertainties are $1\sigma$ confidence level. Additionally, we estimate the today deceleration parameter $q_0=-0.530^{+0.018}_{-0.017}$, the deceleration-acceleration transition redshift $z_T=0.632^{+0.028}_{-0.028}$ and the age of the universe $\tau_U = 12.637^{+0.067}_{-0.066}\,\rm{Gyrs}$ which are in agreement with the standard cosmology ($\Lambda$CDM) within $1.5\sigma$. Furthermore, we find that the dark energy equation of state is consistent with both phantom and quintessence behaviors within $1\sigma$ in the past and converging to $\Lambda$CDM in the future. Finally, Tsallis cosmology is preferred over $\Lambda$CDM by the combined data, suggesting further studies at the perturbation level.</description>

      <title>Robust $\mu$-distortion constraints on primordial supermassive black holes from non-Gaussian perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explaining the origin of supermassive black holes via a primordial origin is severely challenged by the tight spectral distortion constraints on the amplitude of the primordial perturbations. Following the first calculation of how the $\mu$ constraints are modified by non-Gaussianity in a companion paper, we here make the first robust constraints on primordial black hole formation under large non-Gaussianity. Even the infinite $f_{\rm NL}$ limit is insufficiently non-Gaussian but much higher-order non-Gaussianity of the form ${\cal R}={\cal R}_{\rm G}^5$ may allow the formation of any mass primordial black hole without conflicting with distortion constraints. We caution that such extreme models face other challenges.</description>

Abstract: A popular science article designed to introduce people familiar with basic cosmological nomenclature with models alternative to cosmological inflation. The paper briefly discusses the modern view of the Big Bang model, inflation (both its advantages and potential deficiencies). This is followed by a discussion of historical alternative models and modern approaches such as matter bounce, ekpyrotic Universe, Conformal Cyclic Cosmology, Hartle-Hawking state and loop quantum cosmology. The final aspect of the paper is to present the advantages and potential problems associated with alternative models and to present the conceptual challenges associated with the uniqueness of cosmology as a specific domain of physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It might be necessary to access the impact of recent released Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) data on the state equation of dark energy in the Hubble-tension-free cosmologies. In this paper, we report the MCMC analysis for the $w_0w_a$CDM model with pre-recombination early dark energy (EDE) using Planck+DESI+Pantheon+SH0ES dataset. The results reveal that $H_0=72.43\pm 0.75$, $w_0=-0.971\pm0.035$, $w_a=-0.347\pm0.120$ for axion-like EDE, while $H_0=73.32\pm 0.64$, $w_0=-0.923\pm0.054$, $w_a=-0.435\pm0.132$ for AdS-EDE, and also not surprisingly the spectral index of primordial scalar perturbation moves towards $n_s=1$. It looks like that in corresponding models the bestfit $H_0$ are higher than those with pre-DESI BAO data, but without the further exacerbation of $S_8$ tension.</description>

      <title>Higher-spin self-dual General Relativity: 6d and 4d pictures, covariant vs. lightcone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the higher-spin extension of self-dual General Relativity (GR) with cosmological constant, proposed by Krasnov, Skvortsov and Tran. We show that this theory is actually a gauge-fixing of a 6d diffeomorphism-invariant Abelian theory, living on (4d spacetime)x(2d spinor space) modulo a finite group. On the other hand, we point out that the theory respects the 4d geometry of a self-dual GR solution, with no backreaction from the higher-spin fields. We also present a lightcone ansatz that reduces the covariant fields to one scalar field for each helicity. The field equations governing these scalars have only cubic vertices. We compare our lightcone ansatz to Metsaev's lightcone formalism. We conclude with a new perspective on the lightcone formalism in (A)dS spacetime: not merely a complication of its Minkowski-space cousin, it has a built-in Lorentz covariance, and is closely related to Vasiliev's concept of unfolding.</description>

      <title>Dynamical ejecta from binary neutron star mergers: Impact of residual eccentricity and equation of state implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the properties of the matter ejected during and after a neutron star merger is crucial to our ability to use electromagnetic observations of these mergers to constrain the masses of the neutron stars, the equation of state of dense matter, and the role of neutron star mergers in the enrichment of the Universe in heavy elements. Our ability to reliably provide such predictions is however limited by a broad range of factors, including the finite resolution of numerical simulations, their treatment of magnetic fields, neutrinos, and neutrino-matter interactions, and the approximate modeling of the equation of state of dense matter. In this manuscript, we study specifically the role that a small residual eccentricity and different implementations of the same equation of state have on the matter ejected during the merger of a $1.3M_\odot-1.4M_\odot$ binary neutron star system. We find that a residual eccentricity $e\sim 0.01$, as measured $\sim 4-6$ orbits before merger, causes $O(25\%-30\%)$ changes in the amount of ejected mass, mainly due to changes in the amount of matter ejected as a result of core bounces during merger. We note that $O(1\%)$ residual eccentricities have regularly been used in binary neutron star merger simulations as proxy for circular binaries, potentially creating an additional source of error in predictions for the mass of the dynamical ejecta.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the merger of black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) binaries in numerical relativity, focusing on the properties of the remnant disk and the ejecta, varying the mass of compactness of the NS and the mass and spin of the BH. We find that within the precision of our numerical simulations, the remnant disk mass and ejecta mass normalized by the NS baryon mass ($\hat{M}_{\rm{rem}}$ and $\hat{M}_{\rm{eje}}$, respectively), and the cutoff frequency $f_{\rm{cut}}$ normalized by the initial total gravitational mass of the system at infinite separation approximately agree among the models with the same NS compactness $C_{\rm{NS}}=M_{\rm{NS}}/R_{\rm{NS}}$, mass ratio $Q=M_{\rm{BH}}/M_{\rm{NS}}$, and dimensionless BH spin $\chi_{\rm{BH}}$ irrespective of the NS mass $M_{\rm{NS}}$ in the range of $1.092$--$1.691\,M_\odot$. This result shows that the merger outcome depends sensitively on $Q$, $\chi_{\rm BH}$, and $C_{\rm{NS}}$ but only weekly on $M_{\rm{NS}}$. This justifies the approach of studying the dependence of NS tidal disruptions on the NS compactness by fixing the NS mass but changing the EOS. We further perform simulations with massive NSs of $M_{\rm{NS}}=1.8M_{\odot}$, and compare our results of $\hat{M}_{\rm{rem}}$ and $\hat{M}_{\rm{eje}}$ with those given by existing fitting formulas to test their robustness for more compact NSs. We find that the fitting formulas obtained in the previous studies are accurate within the numerical errors assumed, while our results also suggest that further improvement is possible by systematically performing more precise numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Dynamical friction in the quasi-linear formulation of MOND</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. We explore the dynamical friction on a test mass in gravitational systems in the Quasi linear formulation of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (QuMOND). Methods. Exploiting the quasi linearity of QuMOND we derive a simple expression for the dynamical friction in akin to its Newtonian counterpart in the standard Chandrasekhar derivation. Moreover, adopting a mean field approach based on the Liouville equation we obtain a more rigorous (though in integral form) dynamical friction formula that can be evaluated numerically for a given choice of the QuMOND interpolation function. Results. Consistently with previous work, we observe that dynamical friction is stronger in MOND with respect to a baryon only Newtonian system with the same mass distribution. This amounts to a correction of the Coulomb logarithmic factor via extra terms proportional to the MOND radius of the system. Moreover, with the aid of simple numerical experiments we confirm our theoretical predictions and those of previous work on MOND.</description>

      <title>Phantom matter: a challenging solution to the cosmological tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The idea of composite dark energy (DE) is quite natural since on general grounds we expect that the vacuum energy (associated to the cosmological term $\Lambda$) may appear in combination with other effective forms of DE, collectively denoted $X$. This was indeed the old proposal from 2006, (cf. Ref.[41]) called the `$\Lambda$XCDM model', which was primordially designed to explain the cosmic coincidence problem. We now find that it can also have far reaching consequences on the current cosmological tensions on $H_0$ and the growth of large scale structure (LSS). The $\Lambda$XCDM may involve both a phantom-like component $X$ and a constant cosmological term $\Lambda$ (positive or negative) or even a running one, $\Lambda=\Lambda(H)$. In the current work, we deal with a simplified version of the model and exploit the possibility that $X$ behaves as `phantom matter' (PM). The latter appears in stringy versions of the running vacuum model (RVM). Unlike phantom DE, it satisfies the strong energy condition like usual matter, hence bringing to bear positive pressure at the expense of negative energy. Bubbles of PM may appear in the manner of a transitory `phantom vacuum' tunneled into the late universe before it heads towards a new de Sitter era, thereby offering a crop field for the growing of structures earlier than expected. Using SNIa, cosmic chronometers, transversal BAO, LSS data and the full CMB likelihood from Planck 2018, we find that the tensions virtually disappear in this stringy RVM scenario characterized by axionic dark matter. The value of $H_0$ emerging from our analysis proves compatible with SH0ES to within less than $0.25\sigma$ and the LSS growth tension is nonexistent. The statistical information criteria point to very strong evidence in favor of the PM solution.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider some metric-affine Myrzakulov gravity (MG) theories with Gauss-Bonnet scalars. Also we consider the MG theories with the boundary term scalars. Note that these MG theories with the Gauss-Bonnet and boundary term scalars were proposed in [arXiv:1205.5266]. Some examples of Metric-Affine Gravity (MAG) theories are reviewed in the context of the $F(R,T,Q,{\cal T}, {\cal D})$ type models. Then the generalized MAG theory with the curvature, torsion and nonmetricity (the so-called MG-VIII) was studied. For the FRW spacetime case, in particular, the Lagrangian, Hamilatonian and gravitational equations are obtained. The particular case $F(R,T)=\alpha R+\beta T+\mu Q+\nu{\cal T}$ is investigated in detail. In quantum case, the corresponding Wheeler-DeWitt equation is obtained. Finally, some gravity theories with the curvature, torsion and nonmetricity are presented.</description>

      <title>The Case Against Smooth Null Infinity III: Early-Time Asymptotics for Higher $\ell$-Modes of Linear Waves on a Schwarzschild Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.00035v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the early-time asymptotics for fixed-frequency solutions $\phi_\ell$ to the wave equation $\Box_g \phi_\ell=0$ on a fixed Schwarzschild background ($M&gt;0$) arising from the no incoming radiation condition on $\mathcal I^-$ and polynomially decaying data, $r\phi_\ell\sim t^{-1}$ as $t\to-\infty$, on either a timelike boundary of constant area radius (I) or an ingoing null hypersurface (II). In case (I), we show that the asymptotic expansion of $\partial_v(r\phi_\ell)$ along outgoing null hypersurfaces near spacelike infinity $i^0$ contains logarithmic terms at order $r^{-3-\ell}\log r$. In contrast, in case (II), we obtain that the asymptotic expansion of $\partial_v(r\phi_\ell)$ near spacelike infinity $i^0$ contains logarithmic terms already at order $r^{-3}\log r$ (unless $\ell=1$).
  These results suggest an alternative approach to the study of late-time asymptotics near future timelike infinity $i^+$ that does not assume conformally smooth or compactly supported Cauchy data: In case (I), our results indicate logarithmic modifications to Price's law for each $\ell$-mode. On the other hand, the data of case (II) lead to much stronger deviations from Price's law. In particular, we conjecture that compactly supported scattering data on $\mathcal H^-$ and $\mathcal I^-$ lead to solutions that exhibit the same late-time asymptotics on $\mathcal I^+$ for each $\ell$: $r\phi_\ell|_{\mathcal I^+}\sim u^{-2}$ as $u\to\infty$.</description>

Abstract: Black holes exert quantum pressure coming from the nonlocal gravity correction. We investigate this nonlocal correction for black holes in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime and its dual boundary field theory. We show that the second order curvature and the nonlocal actions do not backreact on the AdS black hole metric. Thus, the interpretation of quantum pressure holds in the bulk for AdS black hole, generalizing the previous result for the asymptotically flat black hole. We then show that the leading geometric correction comes from the third order in curvature and explicitly calculate the corrections to the metric and to the horizon. For applications to AdS/CFT, we conjectured a nonlocal Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term along with the necessary counter terms to cancel the ultraviolet divergence of the bulk action. We then calculate the thermodynamic quantities in the bulk and discuss their properties.</description>

      <title>Outlook for detecting the gravitational wave displacement and spin memory effects with current and future gravitational wave detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.16266v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave memory effects arise from non-oscillatory components of gravitational wave signals, and they are predictions of general relativity in the nonlinear regime that have close connections to the asymptotic properties of isolated gravitating systems. There are many types of memory effects that have been studied in the literature. In this paper we focus on the "displacement" and "spin" memories, which are expected to be the largest of these effects from sources such as the binary black hole mergers which have already been detected by LIGO and Virgo. The displacement memory is a change in the relative separation of two initially comoving observers due to a burst of gravitational waves, whereas the spin memory is a portion of the change in relative separation of observers with initial relative velocity. As both of these effects are small, LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA can only detect memory effects from individual events that are much louder (and thus rarer) than those that have been detected so far. By combining data from multiple events, however, these effects could be detected in a population of binary mergers. In this paper, we present new forecasts for how long current and future detectors will need to operate in order to measure these effects from populations of binary black hole systems that are consistent with the populations inferred from the detections from LIGO and Virgo's first three observing runs. We find that a second-generation detector network of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA operating at the O4 ("design") sensitivity for 1.5 years and then operating at the O5 ("plus") sensitivity for an additional year can detect the displacement memory. For Cosmic Explorer, we find that displacement memory could be detected for individual loud events, and that the spin memory could be detected in a population within 2 years of observation time.</description>

Abstract: The nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) is an excellent early universe laboratory for testing the fundamental properties of gravity. In this letter, we elucidate on the full potential of pulsar timing array (PTA) by utilizing cosmic variance-limited, or rather experimental noise-free, correlation measurements to understand the SGWB and by extension gravity. We show that measurements of the angular power spectrum play a pivotal role in the PTA precision era for scientific inferencing. In particular, we illustrate that cosmic variance-limited measurements of the first few power spectrum multipoles enable us to clearly set apart general relativity from alternative theories of gravity. This ultimately conveys that PTAs can be most ambitious for testing gravity in the nanohertz GW regime by zeroing in on the power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Neutron Stars In $f(R,T)$ Theory: Slow Rotation Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13758v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the slowly rotating neutron stars in $f(R, T)$ gravity based on Hartle-Thorne formalism. We first consider the simplest matter-geometry coupled modified gravity, namely $f(R, T)=R+2\chi T$. We compute the mass, radius, moment of inertia, change in radius, and binding energy due to rotation, eccentricity, quadrupole moment, and the tidal love number. The quantities, which are of the second order in angular velocity, like change in radius and binding energy due to rotation, eccentricity, and quadrupole moment, deviate more from their corresponding general relativistic counterparts in lighter neutron stars than heavier ones. Whereas the moment of inertia, which is of the first order in angular velocity, in $f(R, T)=R+2\chi T$ modified gravity, barely diverges from the general relativistic one. The Equation of state-independent I-Love-Q relation retains in this $f(R, T) $ modified gravity, and it coincides with the general relativistic ones within less than one percent even for the maximum allowed coupling parameters. We also study the slowly rotating neutron star in $f(R, T)=R+\alpha R^{2}+2\chi T$ up to first order their angular velocity. We calculate the mass, radius, and moment of inertia of neutron stars in this modified gravity. The results show that the impact of the matter-geometric coupling parameter is greater on lighter neutron stars in both of these modified gravity models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13832v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the analytical solutions for the trajectories of particles that spiral and plunge inward the event horizon along the timelike geodesics following general non-equatorial paths within Kerr-Newman spacetimes. Our studies encompass both bound and unbound motions. The solutions can be written in terms of the elliptical integrals and the Jacobian elliptic functions of manifestly real functions of the Mino time. They can respectively reduce to the Kerr, Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m, and Schwarzschild black holes in certain limits of the spin and charge of the black holes, and can be compared with the known ones restricted in equatorial motion. These explicit solutions may have some implications for the gravitational wave emission from extreme mass-ratio inspirals.</description>

      <title>Algebraic classification of 2+1 geometries: a new approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a convenient method of algebraic classification of 2+1 spacetimes into the types I, II, D, III, N and O, without using any field equations. It is based on the 2+1 analogue of the Newman-Penrose curvature scalars $\Psi_A$ of distinct boost weights, which are specific projections of the Cotton tensor onto a suitable null triad. The algebraic types are then simply determined by the gradual vanishing of such Cotton scalars, starting with those of the highest boost weight. This classification is directly related to the specific multiplicity of the Cotton-aligned null directions (CANDs) and to the corresponding Bel-Debever criteria. Using a bivector (that is 2-form) decomposition, we demonstrate that our method is fully equivalent to the usual Petrov-type classification of 2+1 spacetimes based on the eigenvalue problem and determining the respective canonical Jordan form of the Cotton-York tensor. We also derive a simple synoptic algorithm of algebraic classification based on the key polynomial curvature invariants. To show the practical usefulness of our approach, we perform the classification of several explicit examples, namely the general class of Robinson-Trautman spacetimes with an aligned electromagnetic field and a cosmological constant, and other metrics of various algebraic types.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study four well-known inflationary scenarios that are reported by the most recent Planck observations: Natural inflation, Hilltop quartic inflation, Starobinsky inflationary model, and Large field power-law potentials $V(\phi)\sim \phi^{p}$, considering $p=\sfrac{2}{3}, \sfrac{4}{3}$. The analysis is done using both the slow-roll approximation and the numerical solution to the background and perturbation equations. We show that the numerical solution improved the precision of these models with respect to the contour plot $r$ vs. $n_\sca$, having a lower $r$ in each model compared to the value calculated from the slow-roll approximation.</description>

      <title>EDSFD parametrization in $ f(R,T) $ gravity with linear curvature terms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the flat Friedmann-Lema$\hat{\imath}$tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmological model using a suitable parameterization represented as a differential equation concerning the energy density of the scalar field, $\rho_{\phi}$, in the context of $f(R,T)$ gravity theory. This parameterization is known as the Energy Density Scalar Field Differential Equation (EDSFD) parametrization. It results in a solution of the Hubble parameter containing four model parameters, namely, $\Omega_{m0},\Omega_{\phi 0}, H_0,$ and $\alpha$. To constrain the model parameters, $77$ data points from the Hubble dataset, $1048$ points from the Pantheon dataset, and $6$ data points from BAO are used. Using the constrained values, we analyze and compare our model with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. The evolution of the physical parameters, which includes the deceleration parameter, density parameter, Equation of State (EoS) for Dark Energy, and $Om(z)$ diagnostic, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Cost of inferred nuclear parameters towards the f-mode dynamical tide in binary neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational Wave (GW) observations from Neutron Stars (NS) in a binary system provide an excellent scenario to constrain the nuclear parameters. The investigation of Pratten et al. (2022) has shown that the ignorance of f-mode dynamical tidal correction in the GW waveform model of the binary neutron star (BNS) system can lead to substantial bias in the measurement of NS properties and NS equations of state (EOS). In this work, we investigate the bias in the nuclear parameters resulting from the ignorance of dynamical tidal correction. In addition, this work demonstrates the sensitivity of the nuclear parameters and the estimated constraints on them from future GW observations. We infer the nuclear parameters from GW observations by describing the NS matter within the relativistic mean field model. For a population of GW events, we notice that the ignorance of dynamical tide predicts a lower median for nucleon effective mass ($m^*$) by $\sim6\%$ compared to the scenario when dynamical tidal correction is considered. Whereas at a 90\% credible interval(CI), $m^*$ gets constrained up to $\sim 5\%$ and $\sim 3\%$ in A+ (the LIGO-Virgo detectors with a sensitivity of 5th observing run) and Cosmic Explorer (CE) respectively. We also discuss the resulting constraints on all other nuclear parameters, including compressibility, symmetry energy, and slope of symmetry energy, considering an ensemble of GW events. We do not notice any significant impact in analyzing nuclear parameters other than $m^*$ due to the ignorance of f-mode dynamical tides.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the number of propagating degrees of freedom in metric-affine theories of gravity requires the use of Hamiltonian constraint analysis, except in some subclasses of theories. We develop the technicalities necessary for such analyses and apply them to the Weyl-invariant and projective-invariant case of metric-affine-$R^2$ theory that is known to propagate just the graviton. This serves as a check of the formalism and a case study where we introduce appropriate ADM variables for the distortion 3-tensor tensor and its time derivatives, that will be useful when analyzing more general metric-affine theories where the physical spectrum is not known.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Brans-Dicke gravity from neutron star-black hole merger events using higher harmonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07017v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a 90\% credible lower bound on the modified parameter of scalar-tensor theories as $\varphi_{-2}&gt;-7.94\times10^{-4}$ by using dominant-mode correction. Specific to BD theory, we have the constraint $\omega_{\rm BD}&gt;4.75$. Asymmetric binary systems usually have a significant mass ratio; in such cases, higher harmonic modes cannot be neglected. Our work considers higher harmonic corrections from scalar-tensor theories and provides a tighter constraint of $\varphi_{-2}&gt;-7.59\times10^{-4}$. Transitioning to the BD theory, the constraint is $\omega_{\rm BD}&gt;5.06$, with a 6.5\% improvement. We also consider a plausible NSBH event, GW190814, which is a highly unequal mass ratio source and exhibits strong evidence for higher-order multipoles. We obtain poorly converged results when using the dominant mode while getting a constraint of $\varphi_{-2}&gt;-6.60\times10^{-4}$ on scalar-tensor theories when including the higher harmonic modes. This suggests that the difference between the dominant mode and higher modes has a significant impact on our analysis. Furthermore, treating this suspected event as an NSBH event, we find $\omega_{\rm BD}&gt;6.12$ when including the higher harmonic modes. Combining GW200115 and GW190814 and including higher modes, the constraint is improved to $\omega_{\rm BD}&gt;110.55$. This is currently the strongest constraint utilizing GWs, contingent upon GW190814 being an NSBH event. Additionally, we take into account a BD-like theory, known as screened modified gravity (SMG), and investigate the coupling constant constraints, both with and without higher-mode corrections, by using data from both GW200115 and GW190814.</description>

      <title>The Case Against Smooth Null Infinity IV: Linearised Gravity Around Schwarzschild -- An Overview</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is the fourth in a series dedicated to the mathematically rigorous asymptotic analysis of gravitational radiation under astrophysically realistic setups. It provides an overview of the physical ideas involved in setting up the mathematical problem, the mathematical challenges that need to be overcome once the problem is posed, as well as the main new results we obtain in the companion paper [KM24].
  From the physical perspective, this includes a discussion of how Post-Newtonian theory provides a prediction on the gravitational radiation emitted by $N$ infalling masses from the infinite past in the intermediate zone, i.e. up to some finite advanced time.
  From the mathematical perspective, we then take this prediction, together with the condition that there be no incoming radiation from $\mathcal{I}^-$, as a starting point to set up a scattering problem for the linearised Einstein vacuum equations around Schwarzschild and near spacelike infinity, and we outline how to solve this scattering problem and obtain the asymptotic properties of the scattering solution near $i^0$ and $\mathcal{I}^+$.
  The full mathematical details are presented in the companion paper [KM24].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the entropy-area relation from Nouicer's generalised uncertainty principle (GUP), we derive the GUP modified Friedmann equations from the first law of thermodynamics at apparent horizon. We find a minimum apparent horizon due to the minimal length notion of GUP. We show that the energy density of universe has a maximum and finite value at the minimum apparent horizon. Both minimum apparent horizon and maximum energy density imply the absence of the Big Bang singularity. Moreover, we investigate the GUP effects on the deceleration parameter for flat case. Finally, we examine the validity of generalised second law (GSL) of thermodynamics. We show that GSL always holds in a region enclosed by apparent horizon for the GUP effects. We also investigate the GSL in $\Lambda CDM$ cosmology and find that the total entropy change of universe has a maximum value in the presence of GUP effects. To better grasp the effects of Nouicer's GUP on cosmology, we compare our results with those obtained from quadratic GUP (QGUP).</description>

      <title>The excitation of quadratic quasinormal modes for Kerr black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The excitation of quadratic quasinormal modes is an important nonlinear phenomenon for a Kerr black hole ringing at a specific linear mode. The amplitude of this second-order effect is proportional to the square of the linear mode amplitude, with the ratio being linked to the nature of the Kerr black hole. Focusing on the linear $(l=m=2,n=0)$ mode, we compute the dependency of the ratio on the dimensionless spin of the black hole, ranging up to 0.99, with the method applicable for more general mode couplings. Our calculation makes use of the frequency-domain, second-order Teukolsky equation, which involves two essential steps (a) analytically reconstructing the metric through the Chrzanowski-Cohen-Kegeles approach and (b) numerically solving the second-order Teukolsky equation using the shooting method along a complex contour. We find that the spin dependence of the ratio shows a strong correlation with the angular overlap between parent and child modes, providing qualitative insights into the origin of the dependence. Depending on the nature of the angular overlap, the ratio decreases with spin in scenarios such as the channel $(l=m=2,n=0)\times(l=m=2,n=0)\to(l=m=4)$ or increases in situations like $(l=m=2,n=0)\times(l=m=2,n=0)\to(l=5,m=4)$. For both cases, the ratios do not vanish in the extremal limit. As a byproduct, we find that the Weyl scalars can be concisely expressed with the Hertz potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Expanding the work of arXiv:1504.08040, we show that black holes obey a second law for linear perturbations to bifurcate Killing horizons, in any covariant higher curvature gravity coupled to scalar and vector fields. The vector fields do not need to be gauged, and (like the scalars) can have arbitrary non-minimal couplings to the metric. The increasing entropy has a natural expression in covariant phase space language, which makes it manifestly invariant under JKM ambiguities. An explicit entropy formula is given for f(Riemann) gravity coupled to vectors, where at most one derivative acts on each vector. Besides the previously known curvature terms, there are three extra terms involving differentiating the Lagrangian by the symmetric vector derivative (which therefore vanish for gauge fields).</description>

Abstract: We study a cosmological model in Rastall's theory of gravity in the framework of the flat FLRW metric. We formulate the value of the Hubble parameter, which contains two model parameters, $ \alpha $ and $ j $. Employing the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling technique, we determine the values of these model parameters along with their uncertainties. Moreover, we derive the equation of state (EoS) parameter, which converges around the quintessence region. We perform a dynamical system analysis using the linearization technique to validate the results independently. Also, we discuss various physical attributes of the model, highlighting the transition to acceleration and the violation of the strong energy condition (SEC) in the late stages of evolution. In conclusion, our model mimics the behavior of a dark matter fluid during the past epoch and transitions into a quintessence dark energy model in the future epoch.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study rigidity aspects of Penrose's singularity theorem. Specifically, we aim to answer the following question: if a spacetime satisfies the hypotheses of Penrose's singularity theorem except with weakly trapped surfaces instead of trapped surfaces, then what can be said about the global spacetime structure if the spacetime is null geodesically complete? In this setting, we show that we obtain a foliation of MOTS which generate totally geodesic null hypersurfaces. Depending on our starting assumptions, we obtain either local or global rigidity results. We apply our arguments to cosmological spacetimes (i.e., spacetimes with compact Cauchy surfaces) and scenarios involving topological censorship.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Comisso and Asenjo proposed a novel mechanism for harnessing energy from black holes through magnetic reconnection. Our study focuses on exploring the utilization of this mechanism on Konoplya-Rezzolla-Zhidenko (KRZ) parametrized black holes to assess the impact of deformation parameters on energy extraction. Among the various parameters, $\{\delta_1, \delta_2\}$ are identified as the most important factors affecting the physics under consideration. The influence of these two parameters on the ergoregion, circular geodesics in the equatorial plane, and energy extraction from the KRZ black holes through magnetic reconnection is carefully analyzed. Results indicate that deviations from the Kerr metric have a notable influence on the energy extraction process. Particularly, energy extraction is enhanced with more negative ${\delta_1}$ or more positive ${\delta_2}$ within the range constrained by current astronomical observations, resulting in significantly higher maximum power and efficiency compared to the Kerr model. Moreover, when ${\delta_2}$ is sufficiently negative, extracting energy through this mechanism becomes increasingly challenging, necessitating an exceptionally high black hole spin.</description>

      <title>Tidal heating as a discriminator for horizons in equatorial eccentric extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tidal heating in a binary black hole system is driven by the absorption of energy and angular momentum by the black hole's horizon. Previous works have shown that this phenomenon becomes particularly significant during the late stages of an extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) into a rapidly spinning massive black hole, a key focus for future low-frequency gravitational-wave observations by (for instance) the LISA mission. Past analyses have largely focused on quasi-circular inspiral geometry, with some of the most detailed studies looking at equatorial cases. Though useful for illustrating the physical principles, this limit is not very realistic astrophysically, since the population of EMRI events is expected to arise from compact objects scattered onto relativistic orbits in galactic centers through many-body events. In this work, we extend those results by studying the importance of tidal heating in equatorial EMRIs with generic eccentricities. Our results suggest that accurate modeling of tidal heating is crucial to prevent significant dephasing and systematic errors in EMRI parameter estimation. We examine a phenomenological model for EMRIs around exotic compact objects by parameterizing deviations from the black hole picture in terms of the fraction of radiation absorbed compared to the BH case. Based on a mismatch calculation we find that reflectivities as small as $|\mathcal{R}|^2 \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$ are distinguishable from the BH case, irrespective of the value of the eccentricity. We stress, however, that this finding should be corroborated by future parameter estimation studies.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Timing Array Harmonic Analysis and Source Angular Correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) influence the arrival times of radio signals coming from pulsars. Here, we investigate the harmonic space approach to describing a pulsar's response to GWs. We derive and discuss the "diagonalized form" of the response, which is a sum of spin-2-weighted spherical harmonics of the GW direction multiplied by normal (spin-weight 0) spherical harmonics of the pulsar direction. We show how this allows many useful objects, for example, the Hellings and Downs two-point function, to be easily calculated. The approach also provides a clear description of the gauge dependence. We then employ this harmonic approach to model the effects of angular correlations in the sky locations of GW sources (sometimes called "statistical isotropy"). To do this, we construct rotationally invariant ensembles made up of many Gaussian subensembles, each of which breaks rotational invariance. Using harmonic techniques, we compute the cosmic covariance and the total covariance of the Hellings and Downs correlation in these models. The results may be used to assess the impact of angular source correlations on the Hellings and Downs correlation, and for optimal reconstruction of the Hellings and Downs curve in models where GW sources have correlated sky locations.</description>

      <title>Wormhole Formation with Gravitational Particle Creation Mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the possibility of the formation of a traversable wormhole geometry in General Relativity sustained by particle creation mechanism. Gravitational particle creation mechanism is a thermodynamic approach to generate repulsive back-reaction gravitational effects through the thermodynamic creation of particles. This repulsive back-reaction pressure can be thought of as a source of sustaining a traversable wormhole. In the first part of this paper, we systematically model a wormhole geometry through the process of particle creation by assuming an inverse square variation law of particle creation pressure within the wormhole geometry, and the shape function for the wormhole is obtained, assuming the redshift function as constant and finite. The obtained shape function is found to adhere to the feasibility conditions (flaring out condition and asymptotic flatness condition) of a viable wormhole geometry. In the second part of the paper, again by assuming a constant and finite redshift function, we studied the radial evolutionary behaviour of the particle creation pressures for three commonly utilized toy shape-functions. The examination of the energy conditions namely the Null Energy Condition (NEC) and the Dominant Energy Condition (DEC) for all these models reveal that the NEC is violated for the shape-function derived from the first principles of particle creation mechanism, as well as for the toy shape functions. The DEC is however found to be satisfied for all the aforementioned cases. In essence, NEC violation occurs through the particle creation phenomena inside the wormhole structure in spite of the existence of non-exotic matter.</description>

      <title>Spherical orbits around Kerr-Newman and Ghosh black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive study on spherical orbits around two types of black holes: Kerr-Newman black holes, which are charged, and Ghosh black holes, which are nonsingular. In this work, we consider both null and timelike cases of orbits. Utilizing the Mino formalism, all analytical solutions for the geodesics governing these orbits can be obtained. It turns out that all spherical photon orbits outside the black hole horizons are unstable. In the extremal cases of both models, we obtain the {\it photon boomerangs}. The existence of charge in the Kerr-Newman allows the orbits to transition between retrograde and prograde motions, and its increase tends to force the orbits to be more equatorial. On the other hand, the Ghosh black hole, characterized by a regular core and a lack of horizons in certain conditions, presents the possibility of observable stable spherical orbits in the so-called {\it no-horizon} condition. As the Ghosh parameter $k$ increases, trajectories tend to exhibit larger latitudinal oscillation amplitudes. We observe that as the Ghosh parameter $k$ increases the trajectories tend to have larger latitudinal oscillation amplitudes. Finally, we investigate the existence of {\it innermost stable spherical orbits} (ISSOs). Both black holes demonstrate the appearance of two branches of ISSO radii as a function of the Carter constant C. However, there are notable differences in their behavior: in the case of the Kerr-Newman black hole, the branches merge at a critical value, beyond which no ISSO exists, while for the Ghosh black hole, the transcendental nature of the metric function causes the branches to become complex at some finite distance.</description>

      <title>Aspects of Holography in Conical $AdS_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.02256v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Feynman propagator of free scalar fields in $AdS_3$ with a conical defect. The propagator is built by solving the bulk equation of motion, summing over the modes of the field, and taking the boundary limit. We then perform several consistency checks. In the dual CFT, the operator responsible for the defect creates a highly excited state. We consider the exchange of the Virasoro identity block in the heavy-light limit to obtain an expression for the propagator sensitive to the mass of the defect. In $AdS_3/\mathbb{Z}_n$, we treat the propagator by the method of images and in the geodesic approximation. More generally, we argue that long-range correlations of the scalar are suppressed as the defect becomes more massive: we find a continuous phase transition in the correlator at the BTZ threshold and examine its critical behavior. Finally, we apply our results to holographic entanglement entropy using an analogy between our scalars and replica twist fields.</description>

      <title>Time Travel Paradoxes and Entangled Timelines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For time travel to be consistent with the known laws of physics, the resulting paradoxes must be resolved. It has been suggested that parallel timelines (a.k.a. multiple histories) may provide a resolution. However, so far, a concrete mechanism by which parallel timelines can be created has never been satisfactorily formulated. In this paper we propose such a mechanism within the framework of unmodified quantum mechanics, also known as the Everett or "many-worlds" interpretation. The timelines in our model are emergent, like the "worlds" of the Everett interpretation; they are created by quantum entanglement between the time machine and the environment. Therefore, we call them "entangled timelines" or E-CTCs. As the entanglement gradually spreads out to additional systems, the timelines spread out as well, providing a local and well-defined alternative to the naive "branching timelines" picture often presented in the literature. The E-CTC model is similar to Deutsch's familiar D-CTC model, but differs from it mainly by making the entanglement explicit, which allows us to create a clearer practical definition of the resulting parallel timelines.</description>

      <title>Field theory in Rindler frame and more on the correspondence with thermal field theory formalisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considering two accelerated observers with same acceleration in two timelike wedges of Rindler frame we calculate the Feynman-{\it like} propagators for a real scalar field in a thermal bath with respect to the Minkowski vacuum. Only the same wedge correlators are symmetric under the exchange of the {\it real} thermal bath and Unruh thermal bath, while the cross-wedge ones are not. Interestingly, they contain a cross term which is a collective effects of acceleration and thermal nature of field. Particularly the zero temperature description along with {\it no analytic continuation} between coordinates in right and left Rindler wedges, as expected, corresponds to usual thermofield-double formalism. However, unlike in later formulation, the two fields are now parts of the original system. Moreover it bears the features of a spacial case of closed-time formalism (CTP) where the Keldysh contour is along the increasing Rindler time in the respective Rindler wedges. Interestingly, we observe a new feature that the analytic continuation between the wedges provides the two more spacial cases of CTP. Hence Rindler-frame-field theory seems to be a viable candidate to deal thermal theory of fields and may illuminate the search for a bridge between the usual existing formalisms.</description>

      <title>Propagation and Fluxes of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays in f(R) Gravity Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16678v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of diffusion of ultra-high energy cosmic ray (UHECR) protons in the presence of turbulent magnetic fields in the light of the $f(R)$ theory of gravity. The $f(R)$ theory of gravity is a successful modified theory of gravity in explaining the various aspects of the observable Universe including its current state of expansion. Here, we consider the two most studied $f(R)$ gravity models, viz., the power-law model and the Starobinsky model. For these two models, the diffusive character of the propagation of UHECR protons is explored in terms of their density enhancement (a measure of how the density of UHECRs changes due to their diffusion and interactions in the intergalactic medium). Ankle, instep, and Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff are spectral characteristics that extragalactic UHECRs acquire when they propagate through the cosmic microwave background. All these characteristics are analysed through the diffusive flux as well as its modification factor. We compare the UHECR protons spectra calculated for the considered $f(R)$ gravity models with the available data of the Telescope Array and Pierre Auger Observatory. Both models of $f(R)$ gravity predict energy spectra of UHECRs with all experimentally observed features, which lay well within the range of combined data of both experiments. However, this work is only to investigate the possible effects of $f(R)$ gravity theory on the UHECRs propagation, using pure proton composition as a simplified case study. At this stage, our results cannot be used to favour or disfavour the $f(R)$ cosmology over the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and Selection Rules: Optimising Axion Haloscopes for Gravitational Wave Searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03125v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the presence of electromagnetic fields, both axions and gravitational waves (GWs) induce oscillating magnetic fields: a potentially detectable fingerprint of their presence. We demonstrate that the response is largely dictated by the symmetries of the instruments used to search for it. Focussing on low mass axion haloscopes, we derive selection rules that determine the parametric sensitivity of different detector geometries to axions and GWs, and which further reveal how to optimise the experimental geometry to maximise both signals. The formalism allows us to forecast the optimal sensitivity to GWs in the range of 100 kHz to 100 MHz for instruments such as ABRACADABRA, BASE, ADMX SLIC, SHAFT, WISPLC, and DMRadio.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part IIa. Eigenmodes, correlation matrices, and detectability of orientable Euclidean manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17112v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If the Universe has non-trivial spatial topology, observables depend on both the parameters of the spatial manifold and the position and orientation of the observer. In infinite Euclidean space, most cosmological observables arise from the amplitudes of Fourier modes of primordial scalar curvature perturbations. Topological boundary conditions replace the full set of Fourier modes with specific linear combinations of selected Fourier modes as the eigenmodes of the scalar Laplacian. We present formulas for eigenmodes in orientable Euclidean manifolds with the topologies $E_{1}-E_{6}$, $E_{11}$, $E_{12}$, $E_{16}$, and $E_{18}$ that encompass the full range of manifold parameters and observer positions, generalizing previous treatments. Under the assumption that the amplitudes of primordial scalar curvature eigenmodes are independent random variables, for each topology we obtain the correlation matrices of Fourier-mode amplitudes (of scalar fields linearly related to the scalar curvature) and the correlation matrices of spherical-harmonic coefficients of such fields sampled on a sphere, such as the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We evaluate the detectability of these correlations given the cosmic variance of the observed CMB sky. We find that topologies where the distance to our nearest clone is less than about 1.2 times the diameter of the last scattering surface of the CMB give a correlation signal that is larger than cosmic variance noise in the CMB. This implies that if cosmic topology is the explanation of large-angle anomalies in the CMB, then the distance to our nearest clone is not much larger than the diameter of the last scattering surface. We argue that the topological information is likely to be better preserved in three-dimensional data, such as will eventually be available from large-scale structure surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider thermodynamics of the Universe within a quasiparticle approach where the collective dynamics of a system is governed by the thermal mass of the constituents. The spacetime dependence of this thermal mass leads to a negative contribution to the pressure and a positive contribution to the energy density, similar to the effect due to dark energy. We propose a mechanism based on thermodynamic arguments to quantify this contribution from the thermal vacuum of the system. For a sufficiently large spacetime variation of the thermal mass, the effective pressure can become negative and could mimic a dark energy equation of state. We validate our framework using results from renormalizable interacting scalar field theory and demonstrate an application on QCD axion.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Neutron Star $f-$mode Oscillations in General Relativity with Spectral Representation of Nuclear Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quasinormal $f-$mode oscillations in neutron star(NS) interiors within the linearized General Relativistic formalism. We utilize approximately 9000 nuclear Equations of State (EOS) using spectral representation techniques, incorporating constraints on nuclear saturation properties, chiral Effective Field Theory ($\chi$EFT) for pure neutron matter, and perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) for densities pertinent to NS cores. The median values of f-mode frequency, $\nu_f$ (damping time, $\tau_f$) for NS with masses ranging from 1.4 - 2.0 $M_\odot$ lie between 1.80 - 2.20 kHz (0.13 - 0.22 s) for our entire EOS set. Our study reveals a weak correlation between $f-$mode frequencies and individual nuclear saturation properties, prompting the necessity for more intricate methodologies to unveil multi-parameter relationships. We observe a robust linear relationship between the radii and $f-$mode frequencies for different NS masses. Leveraging this correlation alongside NICER observations of PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0030+0451, we establish constraints that exhibit partial and minimal overlap for observational data from Riley et al. and Miller et al. respectively with our nucleonic EOS dataset. Moreover, NICER data aligns closely with radius and frequency values for a few hadron-quark hybrid EOS models. This indicates the need to consider additional exotic particles such as deconfined quarks at suprasaturation densities. We conclude that future observations of the radius or $f-$mode frequency for more than one NS mass, particularly at the extremes of viable NS mass scale, would either rule out nucleon-only EOS or provide definitive evidence in its favour.</description>

      <title>Revisiting kink-like parametrization and constraints using OHD/Pantheon+/BAO samples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06464v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reexamine the kink-like parameterization of the deceleration parameter to derive constraints on the transition redshift from cosmic deceleration to acceleration. This is achieved using observational Hubble data, Type Ia Supernovae Pantheon+ samples and Baryon acoustic oscillations. In this parametrization, the value of the initial $q$ parameter is $q_{i}$, the final value is $q_f$, the present value is denoted by $q_{0}$, and the transition duration is given by $\alpha$. We perform our calculations using the Monte Carlo Markov Chain method, utilizing the emcee package. Under the assumption of a flat geometry, we constrain the range of possible values for three scenarios: when $q_{f}$ is unrestricted, when $q_{f}$ is equal to $-1$, and when $\alpha$ is $1/3$. This is done assuming that $q_{i}=1/2$. Here, we achieve that the $SN$ data fixes the free parameters tightly as in the flat $\Lambda$CDM for unrestricted $q_{f}$. In addition, if we fix $q_{f}=-1$, the model behaves well as the $\Lambda$CDM for the combined dataset. We also acquire the current value of the deceleration parameter, which is consistent with the latest results that assume the $\Lambda$CDM model. Furthermore, we observe a deviation from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model in the current model based on the evolution of $j(z)$, and it is evident that the universe transitions from deceleration to acceleration and will eventually reach the $\Lambda$CDM model in the near future.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15782v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the possibility of global anisotropy of the universe. We consider an altered Friedmann Lemaitre Robertson Walker metric in which there are different scale factors along the three different axes of space. We construct the corresponding altered Friedmann equations. We show that any initial anisotropies decrease into the future. At late times, the difference in Hubble parameters changes as $1/\sqrt{t}$ in a radiation dominated era and as $1/t$ in a matter dominated era. We use constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background to constrain the level of anisotropies at early times. We also examine how the approach back in time to the singularity is radically altered; happening much more abruptly, as a function of density, in an anisotropic universe. We also mention improved bounds that can arise from measurements of primordial gravitons, Weakly interacting massive particles, and neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Pauli-Villars regularization of Kaluza-Klein Casimir energy with Lorentz symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Pauli-Villars regularization is appropriate to discuss the UV sensitivity of low-energy observables because it mimics how the contributions of new particles at high energies cancel large quantum corrections from the light particles in the effective field theory. We discuss the UV sensitivity of the Casimir energy density and pressure in an extra-dimensional model in this regularization scheme, and clarify the condition on the regulator fields to preserve the Lorentz symmetry of the vacuum state. Some of the conditions are automatically satisfied in spontaneously-broken supersymmetric models, but supersymmetry is not enough to ensure the Lorentz symmetry. We show that the necessary regulators can be introduced as bulk fields. We also evaluate the Casimir energy density with such regulators, and its deviation from the result obtained in the analytic regularization.</description>

      <title>Comments Concerning a Hypothetical Mesoscopic Dark Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12899v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by string-theoretic swampland conjectures, the existence of a dark fifth dimension, whose size is roughly 1 -- 10 microns, has been proposed. A great deal of supporting evidence has been presented, and definitive experimental tests are likely to be carried out. The basic idea is that the four-dimensional spacetime that we observe lives on a brane that is localized in the dark dimension. This short note points out that there are two distinct ways to realize such a scenario in string theory/M-theory. In the one considered previously the dark dimension is topologically a circle and our observable 4d spacetime is confined to a brane that is localized in a GUT-scale region of the circle. An alternative possibility is that the dark dimension is a line interval with branes attached at each end. This option would imply the existence of a parallel 4d spacetime microns away from us!</description>

      <title>Nontrivial Black Hole Horizon at the Critical Point in Einstein-$R^2$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a family of new black holes with a nontrivial horizon in Einstein-$R^2$ gravity with a negative cosmological constant. The solutions are found at the critical point where the coefficient of the $R^2$ term is fixed and the phase structure of AdS black holes of the theory is reversed. These solutions possess vanishing entropy. We also analyze the case in general $F(R)$ gravity, of which the Einstein-$R^2$ gravity is a special case. We arrive at the conclustion that the solutions with arbitrary horizons mentioned above should have $0$ entropy.</description>

      <title>Interpreting DESI's evidence for evolving dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The latest results on baryon acoustic oscillations from DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument), when combined with cosmic microwave background and supernova data, show indications of a deviation from a cosmological constant in favour of evolving dark energy. Use of a pivot scale for the equation of state $w$ shows that this evidence is concentrated in the derivative of $w$ rather than its mean offset from $-1$, indicating a new cosmic coincidence where the mean equation of state matches that of the $\Lambda$CDM model precisely in the region probed by the observations. An equivalent way to express this is to say that the dark energy hits the maximum value that it will ever achieve within the observed window. We argue that conclusions on dark energy evolution are strongly driven by the assumed parameter priors and that this coincidence, which we are naming the PhantomX coincidence (where X stands for crossing), may be a signature of this.</description>

      <title>Does DESI 2024 Confirm $\Lambda$CDM?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a $\sim 2 \sigma$ discrepancy with the Planck-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology in DESI Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) data at $z_{\textrm{eff}} = 0.51$ translates into an unexpectedly large $\Omega_m$ value, $\Omega_m = 0.668^{+0.180}_{-0.169}$. We independently confirm that this anomaly drives the preference for $w_0 &gt; -1$ in DESI data confronted to the $w_0 w_a$CDM model. We show that redshift bins of DESI constraints allow $\Omega_m$ to wiggle at the $\sim 2 \sigma$ level with increasing effective redshift in the $\Lambda$CDM model. Given that LRG data at $z_{\textrm{eff}} = 0.51$ is at odds with Type Ia supernovae in overlapping redshifts, we expect that this anomaly will decrease in statistical significance with future DESI data releases leaving an increasing $\Omega_m$ trend with effective redshift at higher redshifts. We estimate the significance of the latter in DESI data at $\sim 1.8 \sigma$ and comment on how it dovetails with independent observations. It is imperative to understand what makes DESI LRG data at $z_{\textrm{eff}} = 0.51$ an outlier when it comes to $\Omega_m$ determinations.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Gravity, Dark Energy and Conformal Symmetry: Testing the Hierarchies of Anomaly-Induced Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal back-reaction generates cosmological models where the trace anomaly reflects the breaking of Weyl invariance. Analyzing these actions yields a dynamic approach to dark energy through anomaly-induced actions (AIAs), that are variational solutions of the trace anomaly functional constraint. Expanded around Minkowski space, they produce semiclassical correlators subject to hierarchical anomalous Ward identities, tied to conformal symmetry and diffeomorphism invariance. We focus on comparing the hierarchy of a specific 4-point function, particularly the 2-gravitons-2-photons correlator $(TTJJ)$, generated by AIAs, to free field theory realizations of the same correlator. We observe that the free field theory original hierarchy splits into one ordinary and one anomalous hierarchy, both satisfying the conservation Ward identities from diffeomorphism invariance. However, we find that the anomalous hierarchy derived from ordinary AIAs in both the Riegert or Fradkin-Vilkovisky gauges, are either affected by double poles or violate the hierarchy of the trace Ward identity, respectively. We show that correct forms of the anomalous hierarchies of 4-point functions (for the $TTTT$ and $TTJJ$), identified in a perturbative free field theory expansion around flat space, are characterised by anomaly poles, corresponding to a curvature expansion in $R\Box^{-1}$, together with Weyl invariant terms. We derive the effective action that generates the correct form of the hierarchy for the $TTJJ$.</description>

      <title>Generalized Entanglement Capacity of de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13684v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Near horizons, quantum fields of low spin exhibit densities of states that behave asymptotically like 1+1 dimensional conformal field theories. In effective field theory, imposing some short-distance cutoff, one can compute thermodynamic quantities associated with the horizon, and the leading cutoff sensitivity of the heat capacity is found to equal to the leading cutoff sensitivity of the entropy. One can also compute contributions to the thermodynamic quantities from the gravitational path integral. For the cosmological horizon of the static patch of de Sitter space, a natural conjecture for the relevant heat capacity is shown to equal the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. These observations allow us to extend the well-known notion of the generalized entropy to a generalized heat capacity for the static patch of dS. The finiteness of the entropy and the nonvanishing of the generalized heat capacity suggests it is useful to think about dS as a state in a finite dimensional quantum gravity model that is not maximally uncertain.</description>

      <title>Invariant tensions from holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of defining an invariant notion of tension in gravity. For spacetimes whose asymptotics are those of a Defect CFT we propose two independent definitions : Gravitational tension given by the one-point function of the dilatation current, and inertial tension, or stiffness, given by the norm of the displacement operator. We show that both reduce to the tension of the Nambu-Goto action in the limit of classical thin probe branes. Subtle normalisations of the relevant Witten diagrams are fixed by the Weyl and diffeomorphism Ward identities of the boundary DCFT. The gravitational tension is not defined for domain walls, whereas stiffness is not defined for point particles. When they both exist these two tensions are in general different, but the examples of line and surface BPS defects in $d=4$ show that superconformal invariance can identify them.</description>

      <title>Trust but verify: The case for astrophysical black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0511217</link>
      <description>arXiv:hep-ph/0511217v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article is based on a pair of lectures given at the 2005 SLAC Summer Institute. Our goal is to motivate why most physicists and astrophysicists accept the hypothesis that the most massive, compact objects seen in many astrophysical systems are described by the black hole solutions of general relativity. We describe the nature of the most important black hole solutions, the Schwarzschild and the Kerr solutions. We discuss gravitational collapse and stability in order to motivate why such objects are the most likely outcome of realistic astrophysical collapse processes. Finally, we discuss some of the observations which -- so far at least -- are totally consistent with this viewpoint, and describe planned tests and observations which have the potential to falsify the black hole hypothesis, or sharpen still further the consistency of data with theory.</description>
