      <title>Proton induced reaction on $^{108}$Cd for astrophysical p-process studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proton capture cross-section of the least abundant proton-rich stable isotope of cadmium, $^{108}$Cd (abundance 0.89\%), has been measured near the Gamow window corresponding to a temperature range of 3-4 GK. The measurement of the $^{108}$Cd(p,$\gamma$)$^{109}$In reaction was carried out using the activation technique. The cross-section at the lowest energy point of 3T$_9$, E$_p$$^{lab}$= 2.28 MeV, has been reported for the first time. The astrophysical S-factor was measured in the energy range relevant to the astrophysical p-process, between E$_p$$^{cm}$= 2.29 and 6.79 MeV. The experimental results have been compared with theoretical predictions of Hauser-Feshbach statistical model calculations using TALYS-1.96. A calculated proton-optical potential was implemented to achieve better fitting, with different combinations of available nuclear level densities (NLDs) and $\gamma$-ray strength functions in TALYS-1.96. The calculations provided satisfactory agreement with the experimental results. The reaction rate was calculated using the calculated potential in TALYS-1.96 and compared with the values provided in the REACLIB database.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the E_p = 416.9 keV resonance strength in the 29Si(p,gamma)30P reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon isotopic ratios measured in meteoritic presolar grains can provide useful information about the nucleosynthesis origin of these isotopes if the rates of nuclear reactions responsible for their production are known. One of the key reactions determining the Si isotopic abundances is 29Si(p,gamma)30P. Its reaction rate is not known with sufficient precision due in part to some ambiguous resonance strength values. In the present work, the strength of the E_p = 416.9 keV resonance has been measured with high precision using the activation technique. The new strength of omega_gamma = 219 +- 16 meV can be used in updated reaction rate estimations and astrophysical models.</description>

      <title>Unlocking "imprints" of conserved charges in the initial state of heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic approaches to modeling relativistic high-energy heavy-ion collisions are based on the conservation of energy and momentum. However, the medium formed in these collisions also carries additional conserved quantities, including baryon number (B), strangeness (S), and electric charge (Q). In this Letter, we propose a new set of anisotropic flow observables designed to be exclusively sensitive to the effects of conserved BSQ charge fluctuations, providing insight into the initial state. Using the recently developed hydrodynamic framework \iccing{}+\ccake{}, we show that these new observables provide a measurable effect of initial BSQ charge fluctuations (ranging up to $\sim $10\%), which can be tested by experiments.</description>

      <title>Role of octupole shape degree of freedom in neutron-rich odd-mass xenon isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Influences of the octupole shape degree of freedom on low-energy spectra of neutron-rich odd-mass xenon isotopes are studied within the interacting boson-fermion model that is based on the nuclear density functional theory. The interacting-boson Hamiltonian describing low-energy quadrupole and octupole collective states of the even-even nuclei $^{140,142,144}$Xe, single-particle energies and occupation probabilities for an unpaired neutron in the odd-mass nuclei $^{141,143,145}$Xe, are determined based on the axially-symmetric quadrupole-octupole deformation-constrained self-consistent mean-field calculations with a choice of the energy density functional and pairing interaction. Strength parameters of the boson-fermion interactions are empirically determined to reproduce a few low-lying levels of each odd-mass nucleus. The mean-field calculation predicts for $^{142}$Xe a potential energy surface that is notably soft in the octupole deformation with a non-zero octupole global minimum. The octupole correlations are shown to be relevant in positive-parity excited states of $^{143,145}$Xe.</description>

      <title>Cosmogenic Muon Background Characterization for the Colorado Underground Research Institute (CURIE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the characterization of cosmogenic muon backgrounds for the Colorado Underground Research Institute (CURIE), located in the Edgar Experimental Mine (EEM) in Idaho Springs, Colorado. The CURIE facility at the EEM offers a versatile shallow underground environment, with accessible horizontal tunnel access and stable rock formations ideal for low-background physics experiments. We have measured the total underground muon flux in two locations, Site 0 and Site 1, yielding values of $\phi$ = 0.246 $\pm$ 0.020$_{sys.}$ $\pm$ 0.012$_{stat.}$ and 0.239 $\pm$ 0.025$_{sys.}$ $\pm$ 0.010$_{stat.}$ $\mu\text{/}m^{2}\text{/}s$, respectively. We have utilized GEANT4 and PROPOSAL Monte Carlo simulations with Daemonflux and MUTE to model the muon flux at both sites, as well as an additional future location. We find good agreement between measurement and simulations, demonstrating the first instance of this computational framework being successfully used for depths $&lt;$ 1 km.w.e. The measured underground flux corresponds to a factor of 700 reduction compared to the sea level flux. Additionally, we present a new depth-intensity relationship to normalize the mountain overburden to an equivalent flat depth, enabling direct comparison with other underground facilities. We report an average equivalent vertical depth of 0.415 $\pm$ 0.027 km.w.e. Based on our measurements, this work highlights the facility's capability for hosting low-background experiments, addressing the demand for shallow underground research spaces.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Bayesian parameter estimation by adapting to multiple energy scales in RHIC and LHC heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improved constraints on current model parameters in a heavy-ion collision model are established using the latest measurements from three distinct collision systems. Various observables are utilized from Au--Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=200$~GeV and Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=5.02$~TeV and $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=2.76$~TeV. Additionally, the calibration of centrality is now carried out separately for all parametrizations. The inclusion of an Au--Au collision system with an order of magnitude lower beam energy, along with separate centrality calibration, suggests a preference for smaller values of nucleon width, minimum volume per nucleon, and free-streaming time. The results with the acquired \textit{maximum a posteriori} parameters show improved agreement with the data for the second-order flow coefficient, identified particle yields, and mean transverse momenta. This work contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of heavy-ion collision dynamics and sets the stage for future improvements in theoretical modeling and experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Radiopurity screening of materials for rare event searches by neutron activation at the TRIGA reactor of Pavia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of physics experiments searching for rare events, the selection of extremely radiopure materials is a challenging task, as the signal of interest is often hidden by instrumental background. Neutron activation is a powerful technique to measure trace contaminants with high sensitivity but, to be properly applied, it requires a good characterization of neutron irradiation and $\gamma$-spectroscopy facilities. This paper presents the state-of-the-art workflow adopted by the Radioactivity Laboratory of the University of Milano-Bicocca for radiopurity screening of materials by neutron activation performed at the TRIGA reactor in Pavia. The ultimate sensitivity of the described workflow, in the absence of interfering activation products and without the application of radiochemical and/or active background rejection techniques, is $&lt;10^{-14}$ g/g for $^{40}$K, $&lt;10^{-12}$ g/g for $^{238}$U and of the order of $10^{-12}$ g/g for $^{232}$Th contaminations. Further details are here provided to address systematic uncertainties related to neutron irradiation that may bias results. To this aim, a dedicated neutron activation campaign was performed and the data were analyzed exploiting a Monte Carlo simulation model of the reactor and applying an unfolding technique to obtain a comprehensive characterization of the neutron flux in typical irradiation configurations. The results of this work provide a valuable benchmark for the application of neutron activation in future radiopurity screening campaigns.</description>

      <title>First simultaneous measurement of the gamma-ray and neutron emission probabilities in inverse kinematics at a heavy-ion storage ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The probabilities for gamma-ray and particle emission as a function of the excitation energy of a decaying nucleus are valuable observables for constraining the ingredients of the models that describe the de-excitation of nuclei near the particle emission threshold. These models are essential in nuclear astrophysics and applications. In this work, we have for the first time simultaneously measured the gamma-ray and neutron emission probabilities of 208Pb. The measurement was performed in inverse kinematics at the Experimental Storage Ring (ESR) of the GSI/FAIR facility, where a 208Pb beam interacted through the 208Pb(p,p') reaction with a hydrogen gas jet target. Instead of detecting the gamma-rays and neutrons emitted by 208Pb, we detected the heavy beam-like residues produced after gamma and neutron emission. These heavy residues were fully separated by a dipole magnet of the ESR and were detected with outstanding efficiencies. The comparison of the measured probabilities with model calculations has allowed us to test and select different descriptions of the gamma-ray strength function and the nuclear level density available in the literature.</description>

      <title>Development of a real-time beam profile monitor for GeV photons and its application in accelerator facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A real-time beam profile monitoring system is proposed for GeV photon beams at the BM4 beamline of the Mikamine site, Research Center for Accelerator and Radioisotope Science (RARiS; previously known as ELPH) at Tohoku University. This monitoring system enhances the capability to monitor the entire beamline by incorporating newly developed beam profile monitors (BPMs) for upstream and midstream sections, in addition to the existing high-speed BPM used for downstream monitoring. This paper reports on the detection mechanisms of the newly developed BPMs and the actual measurement results obtained using the integrated beam monitoring system. The new BPMs are composed of plastic scintillation fibers and silicon photomultipliers, enabling high-precision, real-time measurements. Data acquisition utilizes streaming TDC, a firmware commonly employed in the J-PARC Hadron-hall, allowing real-time detection of high-intensity photon beams with count rates reaching several tens of MHz. With sufficient statistical data, the BPM achieved a 1-s beam-profiling accuracy of 10 {\mu}m. The proposed BPM system serves as a valuable resource for future physics experiments at the BM4 photon beamline and will significantly contribute to ongoing accelerator research endeavors.</description>

      <title>High precision measurements of alpha_s at the future EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a projection study for the first moments of the inclusive spin structure function for the proton and neutron from simulated doubly-polarized e+p and e+3He collision data expected from the Electron-Ion collider. For detection and extraction of the neutron spin asymmetries from e+3He collisions, we used the double-tagging method which significantly reduces the uncertainty over the traditional inclusive method. Using the Bjorken sum rule, the projected results allow us to determine that the QCD coupling at the Z-pole alpha_s can be measured with a relative precision of 1.3%. This underscores the significance of the EIC for achieving precision determinations of alpha_s.</description>
