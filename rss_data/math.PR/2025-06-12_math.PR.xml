      <title>SDEs with critical general distributional drifts: sharp solvability and blow ups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish weak well-posedness for SDEs having discontinuous diffusion coefficients and general distributional drifts that may introduce blow up effects. Our drifts satisfy minimal assumptions, i.e.\,we assume only that the Cauchy problem for the Kolmogorov backward equation is well-posed in the standard Hilbert triple $W^{1,2} \hookrightarrow L^2 \hookrightarrow W^{-1,2}$. By a result of Mazya and Verbitsky, these assumptions are precisely those drifts that can be represented as the sum of a form-bounded component (encompassing, for example, Morrey or Chang-Wilson-Wolff drifts) and a divergence-free distributional component in the ${\rm BMO}^{-1}$ space of Koch and Tataru.
  We apply our results to finite particle systems with strong attracting interactions immersed in a turbulent flow. This includes particle systems of Keller-Segel type. Crucially, in dimensions $d \geq 3$, we cover almost the entire admissible range of attraction strengths, reaching nearly to the blow-up threshold.
  As a further application of our results for SDEs and of the theory of Bessel processes, we obtain an improved upper bound on the constant in the many-particle Hardy inequality. Consequently, the lower bound previously derived by Hoffmann-Ostenhof, Hoffmann-Ostenhof, Laptev, and Tidblom is shown to be close to optimal.</description>

      <title>The bunkbed conjecture still holds for cactus graphs and for graphs with certain biconnected components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the bunkbed conjecture has been shown to be false, which naturally prompts questions on how to classify the graphs that still satisfy the conjecture. We distinguish between a weak version of the bunkbed conjecture where all the horizontal edges of the bunkbed graph are present with the same probability and a strong version of the conjecture where the edge weights on the underlying graph may be assigned individually. We show that any given graph satisfies either version of the conjecture if and only if all of its biconnected components do. Moreover, we show that all cactus graphs satisfy the strong version, and by combining previous results of other authors, any graph $G$ such that every biconnected component of $G$ is either a cycle, complete, complete bipartite, symmetric complete $k$-partite or an edge difference of a complete graph and a complete subgraph satisfies the weak version. Furthermore, we apply the aforementioned results to show that any counterexample to the strong version of the bunkbed conjecture contains a non-trivial subdivision of the diamond graph as a minor and demonstrate how this result might be strengthened in the future.</description>

Abstract: We provide a simpler proof of a sharp concentration inequality for subgaussian simple tensors obtained recently by Ghattas, Chen, and Alonso. Our approach uses a matrix deviation inequality for $\ell^p$ norms and a basic chaining argument.</description>

      <title>A collection of results relating the geometry of plane domains and the exit time of planar Brownian motion, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the sequel to another with the same name (Buttigieg et al., Comput. Methods Funct. Theory, 2023), and is concerned with results of the same type. We deduce a result on the moments of the exit time of Brownian motion from domains whose boundary curve is replaced by a dashed line, and from domains arising from a periodic tiling of the plane. We also give a construction of a type of domain which is similar to a wedge domain, but the behaviour of whose exit time moments answer several questions that had been speculated upon.</description>

      <title>A theoretical basis for model collapse in recursive training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that recursive training from generative models can lead to the so called `collapse' of the simulated probability distribution. This note shows that one in fact gets two different asymptotic behaviours depending on whether an external source, howsoever minor, is also contributing samples.</description>

      <title>Transition Path Theory For L\'{e}vy-Type Processes: SDE Representation and Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a Transition Path Theory (TPT) for L\'{e}vy-type processes, addressing a critical gap in the study of the transition mechanism between meta-stabile states in non-Gaussian stochastic systems. A key contribution is the rigorous derivation of the stochastic differential equation (SDE) representation for transition path processes, which share the same distributional properties as transition trajectories, along with a proof of its well-posedness. This result provides a solid theoretical foundation for sampling transition trajectories. The paper also investigates the statistical properties of transition trajectories, including their probability distribution, probability current, and rate of occurrence.</description>

      <title>Extremal process of the local time of simple random walk on a regular tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a continuous-time simple random walk on a regular rooted tree of depth $n$ in two settings: either the walk is started from a leaf vertex and run until the tree root is first hit or it is started from the root and run until it has spent a prescribed amount of time there. In both cases we show that the extremal process associated with centered square-root local time on the leaves tends, as $n\to\infty$, to a decorated Poisson point process with a random intensity measure. While the intensity measure is specific to the local-time problem at hand, the decorations are exactly those for the tree-indexed Markov chain (a.k.a. Branching Random Walk or Gaussian Free Field) with normal step distribution. The proof demonstrates the latter by way of a Lindeberg-type swap of the decorations of the two processes which itself relies on a well-known isomorphism theorem.</description>

      <title>Schramm-Loewner evolution contains a topological Sierpi\'nski carpet when $\kappa$ is close to 8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE$_\kappa$) for $\kappa \in (4,8)$, which is the regime where the curve is self-intersecting but not space-filling. We show that there exists $\delta_0&gt;0$ such that for $\kappa \in (8 - \delta_0,8)$, the range of an SLE$_\kappa$ curve almost surely contains a topological Sierpi\'nski carpet. Combined with a result of Ntalampekos (2021), this implies that in this parameter range, SLE$_\kappa$ is almost surely conformally non-removable, and the conformal welding problem for SLE$_\kappa$ does not have a unique solution. Our result also implies that for $\kappa \in (8 - \delta_0,8)$, the adjacency graph of the complementary connected components of the SLE$_\kappa$ curve is disconnected.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Stochastic Filtering with Volterra Gaussian noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a nonlinear filtering problem for a signal-observation system driven by a Volterra-type Gaussian rough path, whose sample paths may exhibit greater roughness than those of Brownian motion. The observation process includes a Volterra-type drift, introducing both memory effects and low regularity in the dynamics. We prove well-posedness of the associated rough differential equations and the Kallianpur-Striebel. We then establish robustenss properties of the filter and study the existence, smoothness, and time regularity of its density using partial Malliavin calculus. Finally, we show that, in the one-dimensional case, the density of the unnormalized filter solves a rough partial differential equation, providing a rough-path analogue of the Zakai equation.</description>

      <title>Stability of Stochastically Driven Couette Flow in 2D with Navier Boundary Conditions at high Reynolds number via Averaging Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the behavior of stochastic Navier-Stokes on $\mathbb{T} \times [-1,1]$ with Navier boundary conditions at high Reynolds number when initialized near Couette flow subject to small additive stochastic forcing. We take additive noise of strength $\nu^{1/2+} \Phi dV_t + \nu^{2/3+\alpha} \Psi dW_t$, where $\Phi dV_t$ has spatial correlation in $H_0^3$ and acts only on $x$-independent modes of the vorticity, while $\Psi dW_t$ has spatial correlation in a lower order, anisotropic, Sobolev space $\mathcal{H}$ and acts on $x$-dependent-modes. We take the initial $x$-independent modes in the perturbation to be small in $H_0^3$ in a $\nu$-independent sense, while the non-zero $x$-modes are taken to be $O(\nu^{1/2 + \alpha})$ in $\mathcal{H}$. Letting $\omega$ solve the resulting perturbation equation, we split $\omega$ into the zero $x$-modes $\omega_0$ and the non-zero $x$-modes $\omega_{\neq}$. We demonstrate an averaging principle holds wherein $\omega_{\neq}$ is the fast variable and $\omega_0$ is the slow variable, deriving a closed nonlinear evolution equation on $\omega_0$ that holds over long time-scales (while the fast $\omega_{\neq}$ modes solve a `pseudo-linearized' equation to leading order with dynamics dominated by inviscid damping and enhanced dissipation). This work can also be considered the stochastic analogue of the stability threshold problem for shear flows.</description>

      <title>Spiking Neural Models for Decision-Making Tasks with Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cognition, response times and choices in decision-making tasks are commonly modeled using Drift Diffusion Models (DDMs), which describe the accumulation of evidence for a decision as a stochastic process, specifically a Brownian motion, with the drift rate reflecting the strength of the evidence. In the same vein, the Poisson counter model describes the accumulation of evidence as discrete events whose counts over time are modeled as Poisson processes, and has a spiking neurons interpretation as these processes are used to model neuronal activities. However, these models lack a learning mechanism and are limited to tasks where participants have prior knowledge of the categories. To bridge the gap between cognitive and biological models, we propose a biologically plausible Spiking Neural Network (SNN) model for decision-making that incorporates a learning mechanism and whose neurons activities are modeled by a multivariate Hawkes process. First, we show a coupling result between the DDM and the Poisson counter model, establishing that these two models provide similar categorizations and reaction times and that the DDM can be approximated by spiking Poisson neurons. To go further, we show that a particular DDM with correlated noise can be derived from a Hawkes network of spiking neurons governed by a local learning rule. In addition, we designed an online categorization task to evaluate the model predictions. This work provides a significant step toward integrating biologically relevant neural mechanisms into cognitive models, fostering a deeper understanding of the relationship between neural activity and behavior.</description>

      <title>Sufficient digits and density estimation: A Bayesian nonparametric approach using generalized finite P\'olya trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for statistical modelling of a continuous random variable $X$ on $[0, 1)$, based on its digit representation $X=.X_1X_2\ldots$. In general, $X$ can be coupled with a random variable $N$ so that if a prior of $N$ is imposed, $(X_1,\ldots,X_N)$ becomes a sufficient statistics and $.X_{N+1}X_{N+2}\ldots$ is uniformly distributed. In line with this fact, and focusing on binary digits for simplicity, we propose a family of generalized finite P{\'o}lya trees that induces a random density for a sample, which becomes a flexible tool for density estimation. Here, the digit system may be random and learned from the data. We provide a detailed Bayesian analysis, including closed form expression for the posterior distribution which sidesteps the need of MCMC methods for posterior inference. We analyse the frequentist properties as the sample size increases, and provide sufficient conditions for consistency of the posterior distributions of the random density and $N$. We consider an extension to data spanning multiple orders of magnitude, and propose a prior distribution that encodes the so-called extended Newcomb-Benford law. Such a model shows promising results for density estimation of human-activity data. Our methodology is illustrated on several synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Mathematical proof of errors in Capasso's excess noise factor formula for an n-step staircase multiplier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state devices such as multistep staircase avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are analogues to the photomultiplier tubes and are considered as a cascade-amplifier. The major source of internal noise in these APDs is due to the randomness in their stepwise impact ionization. Recent literature on staircase APDs by research groups such as Campbell and co-workers have reported the theoretical estimates of total excess noise factors using Capasso's excess noise factor formula. This formula is based on Friis' total noise factor formula for cascade networks. This article proves that Capasso's formula for a staircase APD, erroneously considers the power gains in Friis' total noise factor formula as the gains.</description>

Abstract: We prove a convergence result for a large class of random models that encompasses the case of the BPHZ models used in the study of singular stochastic PDEs. We introduce for that purpose a useful variation on the notion of regularity structure called a regularity-integrability structure. It allows to deal in a single elementary setting with models on a usual regularity structure and their first order Malliavin derivative.</description>

      <title>On the rate of convergence in the Hall-Janson coverage theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16461v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a spherical Poisson Boolean model $Z$ in Euclidean $d$-space with $d \geq 2$, with Poisson intensity $t$ and radii distributed like $rY$ with $r \geq 0$ a scaling parameter and $Y$ a fixed nonnegative random variable with finite $(2d-2)$-nd moment (or if $d=2$, a finite $(2 + \varepsilon)$-moment condition for some $\varepsilon &gt;0$). Let $A \subset {\bf R}^d$ be compact with a nice boundary. Let $\alpha $ be the expected volume of a ball of radius $Y$, and suppose $r=r(t)$ is chosen so that $\alpha t r^d - \log t - (d-1) \log \log t$ is a constant independent of $t$. A classical result of Hall and of Janson determines the (non-trivial) large-$t$ limit of the probability that $A$ is fully covered by $Z$. In this paper we provide an $O((\log \log t)/\log t)$ bound on the rate of convergence in that result. With a slight adjustment to $r(t)$, this can be improved to $O(1/\log t)$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of mean-field reflected backward stochastic differential equations (MF-RBSDEs) driven by a marked point process and also analyze MF-RBSDEs driven by a Poisson process. Based on a $g$-expectation representation lemma, we give the existence and uniqueness of the particle system of MF-RBSDEs driven by a marked point process under Lipschitz generator conditions and obtain a convergence result of this system. We also establish the well-posedness of the MF-RBSDEs driven by a Poisson process and the convergence rate of the corresponding particle system towards the solution to the MF-RBSDEs driven by a Poisson process under bounded terminal, bounded obstacle conditions.</description>

      <title>Harmonic analysis of Mandelbrot cascades -- in the context of vector-valued martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13164v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve a long-standing open problem of determining the Fourier dimension of the Mandelbrot canonical cascade measure (MCCM). This problem of significant interest was raised by Mandelbrot in 1976 and reiterated by Kahane in 1993. Specifically, we derive the exact formula for the Fourier dimension of the MCCM for random weights $W$ satisfying the condition $\mathbb{E}[W^t]&lt;\infty$ for all $t&gt;0$. As a corollary, we prove that the MCCM is Salem if and only if the random weight has a specific two-point distribution. In addition, we show that the MCCM is Rajchman with polynomial Fourier decay whenever the random weight satisfies $\mathbb{E}[W^{1+\delta}]&lt;\infty$ for some $\delta&gt;0$. As a consequence, we discover that, in the Biggins-Kyprianou's boundary case, the Fourier dimension of the MCCM exhibits a second order phase transition at the inverse temperature $\beta = 1/2$; we establish the upper Frostman regularity for MCCM; and we obtain a Fourier restriction estimate for MCCM.
  The major novelty of this paper is the discovery of putting the fine analysis of Fourier decay for multiplicative chaos measures into the theory of vector-valued martingales. This new viewpoint is of fundamental importance in the study of Fourier decay of multiplicative chaos measures. Indeed, in the sequel to this paper, combining the vector-valued martingale methods and ideas from Littlewood-Paley theory, the precise Fourier dimensions will be established for various classical models of multiplicative chaos measures including GMC of all dimensions, microcanonical Mandelbrot cascades, Mandelbrot random coverings, as well as Fourier-Walsh analysis of these models.</description>

      <title>Stochastic block models with many communities and the Kesten--Stigum bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the inference of communities in stochastic block models with a growing number of communities. For block models with $n$ vertices and a fixed number of communities $q$, it was predicted in Decelle et al. (2011) that there are computationally efficient algorithms for recovering the communities above the Kesten--Stigum (KS) bound and that efficient recovery is impossible below the KS bound. This conjecture has since stimulated a lot of interest, with the achievability side proven in a line of research that culminated in the work of Abbe and Sandon (2018). Conversely, recent work by Sohn and Wein (2025) provides evidence for the hardness part using the low-degree paradigm.
  In this paper we investigate community recovery in the regime $q=q_n \to \infty$ as $n\to\infty$ where no such predictions exist. We show that efficient inference of communities remains possible above the KS bound. Furthermore, we show that recovery of block models is low-degree hard below the KS bound when the number of communities satisfies $q\ll \sqrt{n}$. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that when $q \gg \sqrt{n}$, there is an efficient algorithm based on non-backtracking walks for recovery even below the KS bound. We identify a new threshold and ask if it is the threshold for efficient recovery in this regime. Finally, we show that detection is easy and identify (up to a constant) the information-theoretic threshold for community recovery as the number of communities $q$ diverges.
  Our low-degree hardness results also naturally have consequences for graphon estimation, improving results of Luo and Gao (2024).</description>

Abstract: We consider the Wigner matrix $W_{n}$ of dimension $n \times n$ as $n \to \infty$. The objective of this paper is two folds: first we construct an operator $\mathcal{W}$ on a suitable Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ and then define a suitable notion of convergence such that the matrices $W_{n}$ converge in that notion of convergence to $\mathcal{W}$. We further investigate some properties of $\mathcal{W}$ and $\mathcal{H}$. We show that $\mathcal{H}$ is a nontrivial extension of $L^{2}[0,1]$ with respect to the Lebesgue measure and the spectral measure of $\mathcal{W}$ at any function $f \in L^{2}[0,1]$ is almost surely the semicircular law.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03298v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a unified approach for studying the polynomial Fourier decay of classical multiplicative chaos measures. As consequences, we obtain the precise Fourier dimensions for multiplicative chaos measures arising from the following key models: the sub-critical 1D and 2D GMC (which in particular resolves the Garban-Vargas conjecture); the sub-critical $d$-dimensional GMC with $d \ge 3$ when the parameter $\gamma$ is near the critical value; the canonical Mandelbrot random coverings; the canonical Mandelbrot cascades. For various other models, we establish the non-trivial lower bounds of the Fourier dimensions and in various cases we conjecture that they are all optimal and provide the exact values of Fourier dimensions.</description>

      <title>Invertible Complex Measures on Euclidean Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1971 Taylor characterised all complex measures on $\mathbb{R}$ that are invertible with respect to convolution as those which can be written in the form $\delta_\gamma \ast \sigma^{\ast m} \ast \exp(\nu)$ for some $\gamma\in \mathbb{R}$, some complex measure $\nu$, some $m\in \mathbb{Z}$ and a given fixed invertible finite signed measure $\sigma$ (which has characteristic function $\mathbb{R} \ni z \mapsto (1+i z)/(1-i z)$). We extend Taylor's result to complex measures on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Somewhat surprisingly, the structure of invertible complex measures on $\mathbb{R}^n$ is not much more complicated than that of complex measures on $\mathbb{R}$, in the sense that they can be represented as $\delta_\gamma \ast \sigma_1^{\ast m_1} \ast \ldots \ast \sigma_p^{\ast m_p} \ast \exp(\nu)$ for some $\gamma \in \mathbb{R}^n$, some complex measure $\nu$ and $m_1,\ldots, m_p\in \mathbb{Z}$, where the $\sigma_i$ correspond to $\sigma$ in the one-dimensional case and actually live on $1$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Our proof relies on a general result of Taylor for invertible complex measures on locally compact abelian groups. To apply Taylor's result, we extend some existing results for $\mathbb{C}$-valued functions to functions with values in a semisimple commutative unital Banach algebra with connected Gelfand space. The study of invertible complex measures on $\mathbb{R}^n$ has some impact on the theory of quasi-infinitely divisible probability distributions on $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>

      <title>Poisson boundary of group extensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.11111v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a finitely generated group, the well-known Stability Problem asks whether the non-triviality of the Poisson-Furstenberg boundary (which is equivalent to the existence of non-constant bounded harmonic functions) depends on the choice of simple random walk on the group. This question was far from being understood even in the class of linear groups. Given an amenable group, e.g. a solvable group, there is no known characterisation, even a conjectural one, of when it admits a simple random walk with non-trivial boundary. We provide a characterisation of groups with non-trivial boundary for finitely generated linear groups of characteristic $p$. We prove in particular that the Stability Problem has a positive answer in this class of groups. For linear groups of characteristic $0$, we prove a sufficient condition for the triviality of the boundary which does not depend on the choice of a simple random walk. We conjecture that our sufficient condition is also necessary. Our arguments are based on a new comparison criterion for group extensions, on new $\Delta$-restriction entropy estimates and a criterion for boundary non-triviality, and on a new "cautiousness" criterion for triviality of the boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03038v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The envelope of an elliptical Gaussian complex vector, or equivalently, the amplitude or norm of a bivariate normal random vector has application in many weather and signal processing contexts. We explicitly characterize its distribution in the general case through its probability density, cumulative distribution and moment generating function. Moments and limiting distributions are also derived. These derivations are exploited to also characterize the special cases where the bivariate Gaussian mean vector and covariance matrix have a simpler structure, providing new additional insights in many cases. Simulations illustrate the benefits of using our formulae over Monte Carlo methods. We also use our derivations to get a better initial characterization of the distribution of the observed values in structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging datasets, and of wind speed.</description>

We establish the local existence and uniqueness of mild solutions under appropriate conditions on the parameters of the equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bethe-Hessian matrix, introduced by Saade, Krzakala, and Zdeborov\'a (2014), is a Hermitian matrix designed for applying spectral clustering algorithms to sparse networks. Rather than employing a non-symmetric and high-dimensional non-backtracking operator, a spectral method based on the Bethe-Hessian matrix is conjectured to also reach the Kesten-Stigum detection threshold in the sparse stochastic block model (SBM). We provide the first rigorous analysis of the Bethe-Hessian spectral method in the SBM under both the bounded expected degree and the growing degree regimes. Specifically, we demonstrate that: (i) When the expected degree $d\geq 2$, the number of negative outliers of the Bethe-Hessian matrix can consistently estimate the number of blocks above the Kesten-Stigum threshold, thus confirming a conjecture from Saade, Krzakala, and Zdeborov\'a (2014) for $d\geq 2$. (ii) For sufficiently large $d$, its eigenvectors can be used to achieve weak recovery. (iii) As $d\to\infty$, we establish the concentration of the locations of its negative outlier eigenvalues, and weak consistency can be achieved via a spectral method based on the Bethe-Hessian matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we make a survey on the so called randomization method, a recent methodology to study stochastic optimization problems. It allows to represent the value function of an optimal control problem by a suitable backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE), by means of an auxiliary optimization problem having the same value as the starting one. This method works for a large class of control problems and provides a BSDE representation to many related PDEs of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman type, even in the fully non linear case. After a general informal introduction we explain the method giving full details in a basic case. Then we try to give a complete picture of the existing applications and we present some related open problems.</description>

      <title>Entropic Isoperimetric and Cram\'er--Rao Inequalities for R\'enyi--Fisher Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The de Bruijn identity states that Fisher information is equal to a half of the time-derivative of Shannon differential entropy along heat flow. In the same spirit, a generalized version of Fisher information, which we term the R\'enyi--Fisher information, is defined as a half of the time-derivative of R\'enyi differential entropy along heat flow. Based on this R\'enyi--Fisher information, we establish several sharp R\'enyi-entropic isoperimetric inequalities, which generalize the classic entropic isoperimetric inequality to the R\'enyi setting. Utilizing these isoperimetric inequalities, we extend the classical Cram\'er--Rao inequality from Fisher information to R\'enyi--Fisher information. We then use these generalized Cram\'er--Rao inequalities to determine the signs of derivatives of R\'enyi entropy along heat flow, strengthening existing results on the complete monotonicity of R\'enyi entropy. We lastly explore the implications of our R\'enyi-entropic isoperimetric inequalities for entropy power inequalities. We demonstrate that, unlike in the Shannon entropy case, the classic entropy power inequality does not admit a direct extension to R\'enyi entropy without introducing additional exponents or scaling factors. Furthermore, we establish a sharp R\'enyi entropy power inequality involving a scaling factor under the assumption that one of two independent random vectors is Gaussian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a versatile scheme for optimizing the arrival rates of quasi-reversible queueing systems. We first propose an alternative definition of quasi-reversibility that encompasses reversibility and highlights the importance of the definition of customer classes. In a second time, we introduce balanced arrival control policies, which generalize the notion of balanced arrival rates introduced in the context of Whittle networks, to the much broader class of quasi-reversible queueing systems. We prove that supplementing a quasi-reversible queueing system with a balanced arrival-control policy preserves the quasi-reversibility, and we specify the form of the stationary measures. We revisit two canonical examples of quasi-reversible queueing systems, Whittle networks and order-independent queues. Lastly, we focus on the problem of admission control and leverage our results in the frameworks of optimization and reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>The Kirkwood closure point process: A solution of the Kirkwood-Salsburg equations for negative activities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kirkwood superposition is a well-known tool in statistical physics to approximate the $n$-point correlation functions for $n\geq 3$ in terms of the density $\rho $ and the radial distribution function $g$ of the underlying system. However, it is unclear whether these approximations are themselves the correlation functions of some point process. If they are, this process is called the Kirkwood closure process. For the case that $g$ is the negative exponential of some nonnegative and regular pair potential $u$ existence of the the Kirkwood closure process was proved by Ambartzumian and Sukiasian. This result was generalized to the case that $u$ is a locally stable and regular pair potential by Kuna, Lebowitz and Speer, provided that $\rho$ is sufficiently small. In this work, it is shown that it suffices for $u$ to be stable and regular to ensure the existence of the Kirkwood closure process. Furthermore, for locally stable $u$ it is proved that the Kirkwood closure process is Gibbs and that the kernel of the GNZ-equation satisfies a Kirkwood-Salsburg type equation.</description>
