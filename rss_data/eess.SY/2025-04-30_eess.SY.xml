      <title>A novel real-time aeroelastic hybrid simulation system of section model wind tunnel testing based on adaptive extended Kalman filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastically-supported section model tests are the most basic experimental technique in wind engineering, where helical springs are commonly employed to simulate the two-degree-of-freedom low-order modal motions of flexible structures. However, the traditional technique has intrinsic limitations in accurately modeling nonlinear structural behaviors and accurate adjustments of nonlinear structural damping. This study proposes a novel Real-Time Aeroelastic Hybrid Simulation system for section model wind tunnel tests by integrating an active control algorithm of adaptive Kalman filter. The proposed system enables the simulation of nonlinear heave-transverse-torsion coupled vibrations of a section model under the action of the oncoming wind. The structural properties, i.g. mass, damping and stiffness, are numerically simulated via an active control system, and the aerodynamic forces are physically modelled via the model-wind interaction in the wind tunnel. To validate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed RTAHS system, a MATLAB/Simulink-FLUENT/UDF co-simulation framework is developed. Numerical verification results indicate that the proposed algorithm effectively estimates the motion responses in both linear and nonlinear scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Novel Parameter-Tying Theorem in Multi-Model Adaptive Systems: Systematic Approach for Efficient Model Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel theoretical framework for reducing the computational complexity of multi-model adaptive control/estimation systems through systematic transformation to controllable canonical form. While traditional multi-model approaches face exponential growth in computational demands with increasing system dimension, we introduce a parameter-tying theorem that enables significant dimension reduction through careful analysis of system characteristics in canonical form. The approach leverages monotonicity properties and coordinated parameter relationships to establish minimal sets of identification models while preserving system stability and performance. We develop rigorous criteria for verifying plant inclusion within the convex hull of identification models and derive weight transformation relationships that maintain system properties across coordinate transformations. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through application to coupled lateral-roll vehicle dynamics, where the dimension reduction enables real-time implementation while maintaining estimation accuracy. The results show that the proposed transformation approach can achieve comparable performance to conventional methods while requiring substantially fewer identification models, enabling practical deployment in high-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Fault Detection and Human Intervention in Vehicle Platooning: A Multi-Model Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicle platooning has been a promising solution for improving traffic efficiency and throughput. However, a failure in a single vehicle, including communication loss with neighboring vehicles, can significantly disrupt platoon performance and potentially trigger cascading effects. Similar to modern autonomous vehicles, platoon systems require human drivers to take control during failures, leading to scenarios where vehicles are operated by drivers with diverse driving styles. This paper presents a novel multi-model approach for simultaneously identifying signal drop locations and driver attitudes in vehicular platoons using only tail vehicle measurements. The proposed method distinguishes between attentive and distracted driver behaviors by analyzing the propagation patterns of disturbances through the platoon system. Beyond its application in platooning, our methodology for detecting driver behavior using a multi-model approach provides a novel framework for human driver identification. To enhance computational efficiency for real-time applications, we introduce a blending-based identification method utilizing chosen models and weighted interpolation, significantly reducing the number of required models while maintaining detection accuracy. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through high-fidelity CarSim/Simulink environment simulations. Results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately identify both the location of signal drops and the corresponding driver behavior. This approach minimizes the complexity and cost of fault detection while ensuring accuracy and reliability.</description>

      <title>A state reduction approach for learning-based model predictive control for train rescheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a state reduction method for learning-based model predictive control (MPC) for train rescheduling in urban rail transit systems. The state reduction integrates into a control framework where the discrete decision variables are determined by a learning-based classifier and the continuous decision variables are computed by MPC. Herein, the state representation is designed separately for each component of the control framework. While a reduced state is employed for learning, a full state is used in MPC. Simulations on a large-scale train network highlight the effectiveness of the state reduction mechanism in improving the performance and reducing the memory usage.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Grid-Forming Extreme of Inverters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What are the theoretical and physical limits of a grid-forming inverter? This letter proposes that the extreme grid-forming ability of inverters is limited by their dc-side, ac-side, circuit topology dynamics, but not control. While many papers focus on how to improve grid-forming inverters stability, power sharing, inertia emulation, fault response, few, if any, formally define the fundamental theoretical limits or extremes of grid-forming behavior. It seems that the grid-forming can be improved endlessly. No physical system can support a grid indefinitely without limitations, especially under increasing levels of disturbance or uncertainty. Therefore, this boundary is explicitly shown by a mathematical expression in this letter. Consequently, the results show that relatively low dc-side voltage and high active power injection could damage the grid-forming ability. Poor consideration of dc-side, ac-side, and circuit topology dynamics in real practice will cause jeopardizing oscillation even by the theoretical best grid-forming control strategy.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Tissue Deformation and Interactive Force in Robotic Surgery through Vision-based Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Goal: A limitation in robotic surgery is the lack of force feedback, due to challenges in suitable sensing techniques. To enhance the perception of the surgeons and precise force rendering, estimation of these forces along with tissue deformation level is presented here. Methods: An experimental test bed is built for studying the interaction, and the forces are estimated from the raw data. Since tissue deformation and stiffness are non-linearly related, they are independently computed for enhanced reliability. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based vision model is deployed, and both classification and regression models are developed. Results: The forces applied on the tissue are estimated, and the tissue is classified based on its deformation. The exact deformation of the tissue is also computed. Conclusions: The surgeons can render precise forces and detect tumors using the proposed method. The rarely discussed efficacy of computing the deformation level is also demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Safe Bottom-Up Flexibility Provision from Distributed Energy Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern renewables-based power systems need to tap on the flexibility of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) connected to distribution networks. It is important, however, that DER owners/users remain in control of their assets, decisions, and objectives. At the same time, the dynamic landscape of DER-penetrated distribution networks calls for agile, data-driven flexibility management frameworks. In the face of these developments, the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) paradigm is gaining significant attention, as a distributed and data-driven decision-making policy. This paper addresses the need for bottom-up DER management decisions to account for the distribution network's safety-related constraints. While the related literature on safe MARL typically assumes that network characteristics are available and incorporated into the policy's safety layer, which implies active DSO engagement, this paper ensures that self-organized DER communities are enabled to provide distribution-network-safe flexibility services without relying on the aspirational and problematic requirement of bringing the DSO in the decision-making loop.</description>

      <title>A Decentralized Local Flexibility Market for Local Energy Communities to Mitigate Grid Congestion: A Case Study in Sweden</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a preventive congestion management framework with joint Local Flexibility Capacity Market (LFCM) and Local Energy Markets (LEMs). The framework enables Local Energy Communities (LECs) to optimize their flexibility potential across the LEM, LFCM, and heat markets. The LECs utilize their heat and electricity resources to offer flexibility services to Distribution System Operators (DSOs) for congestion relief. In this framework, energy and flexibility are treated as separate variables, each subject to different pricing scheme. Flexibility prices are market-driven, dynamically reflecting the location and severity of congestion. A case study conducted at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, shows that the proposed framework can effectively mitigate congestion by trading the LECs flexibility in the LFCM. The study also highlights up to 40% financial benefits for LECs, promoting the LFCM as a viable solution for congestion management in future decentralized energy systems.</description>

      <title>An Online Cross-layered Defense Strategy with Bandwidth Allocation for Multi-channel Systems under DoS Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an online cross-layered defense strategy for multi-channel systems with switched dynamics under DoS attacks. The enabling condition of a channel under attacks is formulated with respect to attack flow and channel bandwidth, then a new networked control system model bridging the gap between system dynamics and network deployment is built. Based on this, the cross-layered defense strategy is proposed. It jointly optimizes the controller gain and bandwidth allocation of channels according to the real-time attack flow and system dynamics, by solving a mixed-integer semidefinite programming online. A smart enumeration algorithm for non-convex bi-level optimization is proposed to analyze the stability under the strategy. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the high resilience from the cross-layered feature.</description>

      <title>Periodic Proprioceptive Stimuli Learning and Internal Model Development for Avian-inspired Flapping-wing Flight State Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel learning-based approach for online state estimation in flapping wing aerial vehicles (FWAVs). Leveraging low-cost Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity (MARG) sensors, the proposed method effectively mitigates the adverse effects of flapping-induced oscillations that challenge conventional estimation techniques. By employing a divide-and-conquer strategy grounded in cycle-averaged aerodynamics, the framework decouples the slow-varying components from the high-frequency oscillatory components, thereby preserving critical transient behaviors while delivering an smooth internal state representation. The complete oscillatory state of FWAV can be reconstructed based on above two components, leading to substantial improvements in accurate state prediction. Experimental validations on an avian-inspired FWAV demonstrate that the estimator enhances accuracy and smoothness, even under complex aerodynamic disturbances. These encouraging results highlight the potential of learning algorithms to overcome issues of flapping-wing induced oscillation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Non-Linear Modeling and Analysis of Amplifier-Less Potentiostat Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, a previously published amplifier-less potentiostat architecture is further examined. Starting with a linearized model, the impact of the most important parameters is studied taking in account the electrodes-solution electrochemical interface. A detailed model is obtained and thoroughly verified, and recommended operating conditions are given for certain limit load conditions. Then, a more complete non-linear model is developed to take in account the measurement uncertainty introduced by the circuit non-linear components. This non-linear model is compared to a time domain description of the circuit and it is verified that it can predict the non-linear behavior with a precision better than 20%. This result enables the circuit designers to compensate for these effects and ultimately reduce the overall measurement uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Exploiting inter-agent coupling information for efficient reinforcement learning of cooperative LQR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing scalable and efficient reinforcement learning algorithms for cooperative multi-agent control has received significant attention over the past years. Existing literature has proposed inexact decompositions of local Q-functions based on empirical information structures between the agents. In this paper, we exploit inter-agent coupling information and propose a systematic approach to exactly decompose the local Q-function of each agent. We develop an approximate least square policy iteration algorithm based on the proposed decomposition and identify two architectures to learn the local Q-function for each agent. We establish that the worst-case sample complexity of the decomposition is equal to the centralized case and derive necessary and sufficient graphical conditions on the inter-agent couplings to achieve better sample efficiency. We demonstrate the improved sample efficiency and computational efficiency on numerical examples.</description>

Abstract: Local Energy Communities (LECs) facilitate consumer involvement in local electricity generation and distribution, offering a significant opportunity for society to participate in the energy transition. This paper presents the optimization of a renewable energy community in Spain, consisting of four office buildings, a collectively owned centralized photovoltaic system, and a Li-ion battery storage system.

      <title>Tempo: Application-aware LLM Serving with Mixed SLO Requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into diverse applications, ranging from interactive chatbots and cloud AIOps to intelligent agents, has introduced a wide spectrum of Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for responsiveness. These workloads include latency-sensitive requests focused on per-token latency in streaming chat, throughput-intensive requests that require rapid full responses to invoke tools, and collective requests with dynamic dependencies arising from self-reflection or agent-based reasoning. This workload diversity, amplified by unpredictable request information such as response lengths and runtime dependencies, makes existing schedulers inadequate even within their design envelopes.
  In this paper, we define service gain as the useful service delivered by completing requests. We observe that as SLO directly reflects the actual performance needs of requests, completing a request much faster than its SLO (e.g., deadline) yields limited additional service gain. Based on this insight, we introduce Tempo, the first systematic SLO-aware scheduler designed to maximize service gain across diverse LLM workloads. Tempo allocates just enough serving bandwidth to meet each SLO, maximizing residual capacity for others best-effort workloads. Instead of assuming request information or none at all, it adopts a hybrid scheduling strategy: using quantile-based response upper bounds and dependency-graph matching for conservative initial estimates, prioritizing requests by service gain density, and refining decisions online as generation progresses. Our evaluation across diverse workloads, including chat, reasoning, and agentic pipelines, shows that Tempo improves end-to-end service gain by up to 8.3$\times$ and achieves up to 10.3$\times$ SLO goodput compared to state-of-the-art designs</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an adherence-aware reinforcement learning (RL) approach aimed at seeking optimal lane-changing recommendations within a semi-autonomous driving environment to enhance a single vehicle's travel efficiency. The problem is framed within a Markov decision process setting and is addressed through an adherence-aware deep Q network, which takes into account the partial compliance of human drivers with the recommended actions. This approach is evaluated within CARLA's driving environment under realistic scenarios.</description>

      <title>System Identification of Thrust and Torque Characteristics for a Bipedal Robot with Integrated Propulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bipedal robots represent a remarkable and sophisticated class of robotics, designed to emulate human form and movement. Their development marks a significant milestone in the field. However, even the most advanced bipedal robots face challenges related to terrain variation, obstacle negotiation, payload management, weight distribution, and recovering from stumbles. These challenges can be mitigated by incorporating thrusters, which enhance stability on uneven terrain, facilitate obstacle avoidance, and improve recovery after stumbling. Harpy is a bipedal robot equipped with six joints and two thrusters, serving as a hardware platform for implementing and testing advanced control algorithms. This thesis focuses on characterizing Harpy's hardware to improve the system's overall robustness, controllability, and predictability. It also examines simulation results for predicting thrust in propeller-based mechanisms, the integration of thrusters into the Harpy platform and associated testing, as well as an exploration of motor torque characterization methods and their application to hardware in relation to closed-loop force-based impedance control.</description>

      <title>NMPC-based Unified Posture Manipulation and Thrust Vectoring for Agile and Fault-Tolerant Flight of a Morphing Aerial Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis presents a unified control framework for agile and fault-tolerant flight of the Multi-Modal Mobility Morphobot (M4) in aerial mode. The M4 robot is capable of transitioning between ground and aerial locomotion. The articulated legs enable more dynamic maneuvers than a standard quadrotor platform. A nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) approach is developed to simultaneously plan posture manipulation and thrust vectoring actions, allowing the robot to execute sharp turns and dynamic flight trajectories. The framework integrates an agile and fault-tolerant control logic that enables precise tracking under aggressive maneuvers while compensating for actuator failures, ensuring continued operation without significant performance degradation. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating accurate trajectory tracking and robust recovery from faults, contributing to resilient autonomous flight in complex environments.</description>

      <title>CarbonCall: Sustainability-Aware Function Calling for Large Language Models on Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable real-time function calling in edge AI systems but introduce significant computational overhead, leading to high power consumption and carbon emissions. Existing methods optimize for performance while neglecting sustainability, making them inefficient for energy-constrained environments. We introduce CarbonCall, a sustainability-aware function-calling framework that integrates dynamic tool selection, carbon-aware execution, and quantized LLM adaptation. CarbonCall adjusts power thresholds based on real-time carbon intensity forecasts and switches between model variants to sustain high tokens-per-second throughput under power constraints. Experiments on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin show that CarbonCall reduces carbon emissions by up to 52%, power consumption by 30%, and execution time by 30%, while maintaining high efficiency.</description>

      <title>Safe and Optimal N-Spacecraft Swarm Reconfiguration in Non-Keplerian Cislunar Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel fuel-optimal guidance and control methodology for spacecraft swarm reconfiguration in Restricted Multi-Body Problems (RMBPs) with a guarantee of passive safety, maintaining miss distance even under abrupt loss of control authority. A new set of constraints exploits a quasi-periodic structure of RMBPs to guarantee passive safety. Particularly, this can be expressed as simple geometric constraints by solving optimal control in Local Toroidal Coordinates, which is based on a local eigenspace of a quasi-periodic motion around the corresponding periodic orbit. The proposed formulation enables a significant simplification of problem structure, which is highly applicable to large-scale swarm reconfiguration in cislunar orbits. The method is demonstrated in various models of RMBPs (Elliptical Restricted Three-Body Problem and Bi-Circular Restricted Four-Body Problem) and also validated in the full-ephemeris dynamics. By extending and generalizing well-known concepts from the two- to the three- and four-body problems, this paper lays the foundation for the practical control schemes of relative motion in cislunar space.</description>

      <title>ComplexVCoder: An LLM-Driven Framework for Systematic Generation of Complex Verilog Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances have demonstrated the promising capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in generating register-transfer level (RTL) code, such as Verilog. However, existing LLM-based frameworks still face significant challenges in accurately handling the complexity of real-world RTL designs, particularly those that are large-scale and involve multi-level module instantiations. To address this issue, we present ComplexVCoder, an open-source LLM-driven framework that enhances both the generation quality and efficiency of complex Verilog code. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage generation mechanism, which leverages an intermediate representation to enable a more accurate and structured transition from natural language descriptions to intricate Verilog designs. In addition, we introduce a rule-based alignment method and a domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to further improve the correctness of the synthesized code by incorporating relevant design knowledge during generation. To evaluate our approach, we construct a comprehensive dataset comprising 55 complex Verilog designs derived from real-world implementations. We also release an open-source benchmark suite for systematically assessing the quality of auto-generated RTL code together with the ComplexVCoder framework. Experimental results show that ComplexVCoder outperforms SOTA frameworks such as CodeV and RTLCoder by 14.6% and 22.2%, respectively, in terms of function correctness on complex Verilog benchmarks. Furthermore, ComplexVcoder achieves comparable generation performances in terms of functionality correctness using a lightweight 32B model (Qwen2.5), rivaling larger-scale models such as GPT-3.5 and DeepSeek-V3.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the stability of general nonlinear discrete-time stochastic systems controlled by optimal inputs that minimize an infinite-horizon discounted cost. Under a novel stochastic formulation of cost-controllability and detectability assumptions inspired by the related literature on deterministic systems, we prove that uniform semi-global practical recurrence holds for the closed-loop system, where the adjustable parameter is the discount factor. Under additional continuity assumptions, we further prove that this property is robust.</description>

      <title>Offline and Online Use of Interval and Set-Based Approaches for Control and State Estimation: A Selection of Methodological Approaches and Their Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control and state estimation procedures need to be robust against imprecisely known parameters, uncertainty in initial conditions, and external disturbances. Interval methods and other set-based techniques form the basis for the implementation of powerful approaches that can be used to identify parameters of dynamic system models in the presence of the aforementioned types of uncertainty. Moreover, they are applicable to a verified feasibility and stability analysis of controllers and state estimators. In addition to these approaches which are typically used offline for analysis of system models designed with classical floating point procedures, interval and set-based methods have also been developed in recent years, which allow to directly solve the associated design tasks and to implement reliable techniques that are applicable online, i.e., during system operation. The latter approaches include set-based model predictive control, online parameter adaptation techniques for nonlinear variable-structure and backstepping controllers, interval observers, and fault diagnosis techniques. This paper provides an overview of the methodological background and reviews numerous practical applications for which interval and other set-valued approaches have been employed successfully.</description>

      <title>Trading off regional and overall energy system design flexibility in the net-zero transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition to net-zero emissions in Europe is determined by a patchwork of country-level and EU-wide policy, creating coordination challenges in an interconnected system. We use an optimisation model to map out near-optimal energy system designs for 2050, focussing on the planning flexibility of individual regions while maintaining overall system robustness against different weather years, cost assumptions, and land use limitations. Our results reveal extensive flexibility at a regional level, where only few technologies (solar around the Adriatic and wind on the British Isles and in Germany) cannot be substituted. National policymakers can influence renewable energy export and hydrogen strategies significantly, provided they coordinate this with the remaining European system. However, stronger commitment to solar in Southern Europe and Germany unlocks more design options for Europe overall. These results on regional trade-offs facilitate more meaningful policy discussions which are crucial in the transition to a sustainable energy system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter addresses the challenge of enhancing the task-space capabilities of commercial underactuated systems through the integration of auxiliary actuators, while preserving their internal control architecture. We propose a method where additional actuators are combined with a feedback-linearizing outer loop controller, enabling full-pose tracking without modifying the platform's certified low-level controller. The key contribution is a theoretical framework establishing conditions under which legacy high-level commands and new actuator inputs can be cohesively coordinated to achieve decoupled control of all degrees of freedom. These conditions are validated through numerical simulations on a quadrotor retrofitted with two additional propellers. The results demonstrate stable 6D trajectory tracking, highlighting the method's ability to reconcile enhanced dexterity with industrial constraints such as certification and safety.</description>

      <title>On the Scientific Method: The Role of Hypotheses and Involved Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper investigates the role of data, hypotheses and mathematical methods that can be used in the discovery of a law y=fo(u), relating variables u and y of a physical phenomenon, making use of experimental measurements of such variables. Since the exact knowledge of the function fo cannot be expected, the problem of deriving approximate functions giving a small approximation error, measured by some function norm, is discussed. The main contributions of the paper are summarized as follows. At first, it is proven that deriving a reliable approximation, i.e., having a finite error, is not possible using measured data only. Thus, for deriving a reliable approximation, hypotheses on the function fo and on the disturbances corrupting the measurements must be introduced. Second, necessary and sufficient conditions for deriving a reliable approximation are provided. If such conditions are satisfied, suitable accuracy properties of the approximation can be defined, called theoretical properties. Third, it is shown that it is not possible to verify the conditions necessary for deriving a reliable approximation, but it is possible to verify that hypotheses on fo and on the disturbances are falsified by experimental measurements, showing that no function and disturbances satisfying the given hypotheses exist, able to reproduce the measurements (this is called falsification property). The above properties are then discussed for hypotheses belonging to the following classes: Parametric Probabilistic, where fo is assumed to be a function depending on a vector p and the disturbances are assumed to be stochastic variables; Set Membership class, where fo is assumed to be a bounded smooth function and the disturbances are assumed to be bounded variables; Parametric Set Membership class, able to integrate Parametric Probabilistic hypotheses with Set Membership hypotheses.</description>

      <title>A New 8/14 Two-Phase Switched Reluctance Motor with Improved Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06161v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite their simple and robust structure, low cost, and simple cooling system, switched reluctance motors (SRMs) face the challenge of low mean torque. A possible solution is to change the structure of SRMs. This article introduces an innovative combination of the number of rotor teeth and stator teeth of a two-phase switch reluctance motor (TPSRM) with eight teeth for the stator and fourteen teeth for the rotor. As a result of its unique design, which has a short path for passing the main flux, it requires less magnetomotive force. This leads to less core and copper loss, resulting in increased efficiency. Each tooth of the stator in a phase develops a positive torque during the rotation of the rotor, which increases the torque and consequently increases the mean torque of the proposed TPSRM. A current hysteresis control (CHC) is simulated by 2D FEM for the proposed 8/14 TPSRM and the conventional 8/12 TPSRM under the same mechanical load on the shaft to get a current hysteresis reference of 15A at the nominal speed of 600 rpm. To verify the novelty and advantages of the suggested TPSRM, it is compared with the conventional 8/12 TPSRM in terms of mean and peak torque, torque density, and core and copper losses were compared. Lastly, the proposed 8/14 TPSRM is shown to have better performance than the conventional 8/12 TPSRM.</description>

Abstract: Condition monitoring plays a significant role in the safety and reliability of modern industrial systems. Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are gaining attention from academia and industry as a growing subject in industrial applications and as a powerful way of identifying faults. This paper provides an overview of intelligent condition monitoring and fault detection and diagnosis methods for industrial plants with a focus on the open-source benchmark Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP). In this survey, the most popular and state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) algorithms for industrial plant condition monitoring, fault detection, and diagnosis are summarized and the advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm are studied. Challenges like imbalanced data, unlabelled samples and how deep learning models can handle them are also covered. Finally, a comparison of the accuracies and specifications of different algorithms utilizing the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) is conducted. This research will be beneficial for both researchers who are new to the field and experts, as it covers the literature on condition monitoring and state-of-the-art methods alongside the challenges and possible solutions to them.</description>

      <title>Scalable Surrogate Verification of Image-based Neural Network Control Systems using Composition and Unrolling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18554v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Verifying safety of neural network control systems that use images as input is a difficult problem because, from a given system state, there is no known way to mathematically model what images are possible in the real-world. We build on recent work that considers a surrogate verification approach, training a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) as an image generator in place of the real world. This enables set-based formal analysis of the closed-loop system, providing analysis beyond simulation and testing. While existing work is effective on small examples, excessive overapproximation both within a single control period and across multiple control periods limits its scalability. We propose approaches to overcome these two sources of error. First, we overcome one-step error by composing the system's dynamics along with the cGAN and neural network controller, without losing the dependencies between input states and the control outputs as in the monotonic analysis of the system dynamics. Second, we reduce multi-step error by repeating the single-step composition, essentially unrolling multiple steps of the control loop into a large neural network. We then leverage existing network verification tools to compute accurate reachable sets for multiple steps, avoiding the accumulation of abstraction error at each step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of both accuracy and scalability using two case studies: an autonomous aircraft taxiing system and an advanced emergency braking system. On the aircraft taxiing system, the converged reachable set is 175% larger using the prior baseline method compared with our proposed approach. On the emergency braking system, with 24x the number of image output variables from the cGAN, the baseline method fails to prove any states are safe, whereas our improvements enable set-based safety analysis.</description>

      <title>Courteous MPC for Autonomous Driving with CBF-inspired Risk Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With more autonomous vehicles (AVs) sharing roadways with human-driven vehicles (HVs), ensuring safe and courteous maneuvers that respect HVs' behavior becomes increasingly important. To promote both safety and courtesy in AV's behavior, an extension of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs)-inspired risk evaluation framework is proposed in this paper by considering both noisy observed positions and velocities of surrounding vehicles. The perceived risk by the ego vehicle can be visualized as a risk map that reflects the understanding of the surrounding environment and thus shows the potential for facilitating safe and courteous driving. By incorporating the risk evaluation framework into the Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme, we propose a Courteous MPC for ego AV to generate courteous behaviors that 1) reduce the overall risk imposed on other vehicles and 2) respect the hard safety constraints and the original objective for efficiency. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed Courteous MPC via theoretical analysis and simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Hook-Based Aerial Payload Grasping from a Moving Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates payload grasping from a moving platform using a hook-equipped aerial manipulator. First, a computationally efficient trajectory optimization based on complementarity constraints is proposed to determine the optimal grasping time. To enable application in complex, dynamically changing environments, the future motion of the payload is predicted using a physics simulator-based model. The success of payload grasping under model uncertainties and external disturbances is formally verified through a robustness analysis method based on integral quadratic constraints. The proposed algorithms are evaluated in a high-fidelity physical simulator, and in real flight experiments using a custom-designed aerial manipulator platform.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Safe Online Reinforcement Learning in the Linear Quadratic Regulator: Generalized Baselines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many practical applications of online reinforcement learning require the satisfaction of safety constraints while learning about the unknown environment. In this work, we establish theoretical foundations for reinforcement learning with safety constraints by studying the canonical problem of Linear Quadratic Regulator learning with unknown dynamics, but with the additional constraint that the position must stay within a safe region for the entire trajectory with high probability. Our primary contribution is a general framework for studying stronger baselines of nonlinear controllers that are better suited for constrained problems than linear controllers. Due to the difficulty of analyzing non-linear controllers in a constrained problem, we focus on 1-dimensional state- and action- spaces, however we also discuss how we expect the high-level takeaways can generalize to higher dimensions. Using our framework, we show that for \emph{any} non-linear baseline satisfying natural assumptions, $\tilde{O}_T(\sqrt{T})$-regret is possible when the noise distribution has sufficiently large support, and $\tilde{O}_T(T^{2/3})$-regret is possible for \emph{any} subgaussian noise distribution. In proving these results, we introduce a new uncertainty estimation bound for nonlinear controls which shows that enforcing safety in the presence of sufficient noise can provide ``free exploration'' that compensates for the added cost of uncertainty in safety-constrained control.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control with Visibility Graphs for Humanoid Path Planning and Tracking Against Adversarial Opponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we detail the methods used for obstacle avoidance, path planning, and trajectory tracking that helped us win the adult-sized, autonomous humanoid soccer league in RoboCup 2024. Our team was undefeated for all seated matches and scored 45 goals over 6 games, winning the championship game 6 to 1. During the competition, a major challenge for collision avoidance was the measurement noise coming from bipedal locomotion and a limited field of view (FOV). Furthermore, obstacles would sporadically jump in and out of our planned trajectory. At times our estimator would place our robot inside a hard constraint. Any planner in this competition must also be be computationally efficient enough to re-plan and react in real time. This motivated our approach to trajectory generation and tracking. In many scenarios long-term and short-term planning is needed. To efficiently find a long-term general path that avoids all obstacles we developed DAVG (Dynamic Augmented Visibility Graphs). DAVG focuses on essential path planning by setting certain regions to be active based on obstacles and the desired goal pose. By augmenting the states in the graph, turning angles are considered, which is crucial for a large soccer playing robot as turning may be more costly. A trajectory is formed by linearly interpolating between discrete points generated by DAVG. A modified version of model predictive control (MPC) is used to then track this trajectory called cf-MPC (Collision-Free MPC). This ensures short-term planning. Without having to switch formulations cf-MPC takes into account the robot dynamics and collision free constraints. Without a hard switch the control input can smoothly transition in cases where the noise places our robot inside a constraint boundary. The nonlinear formulation runs at approximately 120 Hz, while the quadratic version achieves around 400 Hz.</description>

      <title>Imperative MPC: An End-to-End Self-Supervised Learning with Differentiable MPC for UAV Attitude Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling and control of nonlinear dynamics are critical in robotics, especially in scenarios with unpredictable external influences and complex dynamics. Traditional cascaded modular control pipelines often yield suboptimal performance due to conservative assumptions and tedious parameter tuning. Pure data-driven approaches promise robust performance but suffer from low sample efficiency, sim-to-real gaps, and reliance on extensive datasets. Hybrid methods combining learning-based and traditional model-based control in an end-to-end manner offer a promising alternative. This work presents a self-supervised learning framework combining learning-based inertial odometry (IO) module and differentiable model predictive control (d-MPC) for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) attitude control. The IO denoises raw IMU measurements and predicts UAV attitudes, which are then optimized by MPC for control actions in a bi-level optimization (BLO) setup, where the inner MPC optimizes control actions and the upper level minimizes discrepancy between real-world and predicted performance. The framework is thus end-to-end and can be trained in a self-supervised manner. This approach combines the strength of learning-based perception with the interpretable model-based control. Results show the effectiveness even under strong wind. It can simultaneously enhance both the MPC parameter learning and IMU prediction performance.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Discrete-time Control Barrier Functions for Polynomial Systems Based on Sum-of-Squares Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete-time Control Barrier Functions (DTCBFs) are commonly utilized in the literature as a powerful tool for synthesizing control policies that guarantee safety of discrete-time dynamical systems. However, the systematic synthesis of DTCBFs in a computationally efficient way is at present an important open problem. This article first proposes a novel alternating-descent approach based on Sum-of-Squares programming to synthesize quadratic DTCBFs and corresponding polynomial control policies for discrete-time control-affine polynomial systems with input constraints and semi-algebraic safe sets. Subsequently, two distinct approaches are introduced to extend the proposed method to the synthesis of higher-degree polynomial DTCBFs. To demonstrate its efficacy, we apply the proposed method to numerical case studies.</description>

      <title>Feelbert: A Feedback Linearization-based Embedded Real-Time Quadrupedal Locomotion Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quadruped robots have become quite popular for their ability to adapt their locomotion to generic uneven terrains. For this reason, over time, several frameworks for quadrupedal locomotion have been proposed, but with little attention to ensuring a predictable timing behavior of the controller.
  To address this issue, this work presents Feelbert, a modular control framework for quadrupedal locomotion suitable for execution on an embedded system under hard real-time execution constraints. It leverages the feedback linearization control technique to obtain a closed-form control law for the body, valid for all configurations of the robot. The control law was derived after defining an appropriate rigid body model that uses the accelerations of the feet as control variables, instead of the estimated contact forces. This work also provides a novel algorithm to compute footholds and gait temporal parameters using the concept of imaginary wheels, and a heuristic algorithm to select the best gait schedule for the current velocity commands.
  The proposed framework is developed entirely in C++, with no dependencies on third-party libraries and no dynamic memory allocation, to ensure predictability and real-time performance. Its implementation allows Feelbert to be both compiled and executed on an embedded system for critical applications, as well as integrated into larger systems such as Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2). For this reason, Feelbert has been tested in both scenarios, demonstrating satisfactory results both in terms of reference tracking and temporal predictability, whether integrated into ROS 2 or compiled as a standalone application on a Raspberry Pi 5.</description>
