      <title>Mineral and cross-linking in collagen fibrils: The mechanical behavior of bone tissue at the nano-scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mineralized collagen fibril is the main building block of hard tissues and it directly affects the macroscopic mechanics of biological tissues such as bone. The mechanical behavior of the fibril itself is determined by its structure: the content of collagen molecules, minerals, and cross-links, and the mechanical interactions and properties of these components. Advanced-Glycation-Endproducts (AGEs) cross-linking between tropocollagen molecules within the collagen fibril is one important factor that is believed to have a major influence on the tissue. For instance, it has been shown that brittleness in bone correlates with increased AGEs densities. However, the underlying nano-scale mechanisms within the mineralized collagen fibril remain unknown. Here, we study the effect of mineral and AGEs cross-linking on fibril deformation and fracture behavior by performing destructive tensile tests using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. Our results demonstrate that after exceeding a critical content of mineral, it induces stiffening of the collagen fibril at high strain levels. We show that mineral morphology and location affect collagen fibril mechanics: The mineral content at which this stiffening occurs depends on the mineral's location and morphology. Further, both, increasing AGEs density and mineral content lead to stiffening and increased peak stresses. At low mineral contents, the mechanical response of the fibril is dominated by the AGEs, while at high mineral contents, the mineral itself determines fibril mechanics.</description>

      <title>Nonwoven Reinforced Photocurable Poly(glycerol sebacate)-Based Hydrogels</title>

Abstract: Implantable hydrogels should ideally possess mechanical properties matched to the surrounding tissues to enable adequate mechanical function while regeneration occurs. This can be challenging, especially when degradable systems with high water content and hydrolysable chemical bonds are required in anatomical sites under constant mechanical stimulation, e.g. a foot ulcer cavity. In these circumstances, the design of hydrogel composites is a promising strategy to provide controlled structural features and macroscopic properties over time. To explore this strategy, the synthesis of a new photocurable elastomeric polymer, poly(glycerol-co-sebacic acid-co-lactic acid-co-polyethylene glycol) acrylate (PGSLPA), is investigated, along with its processing into UV-cured hydrogels, electrospun nonwovens and fibre-reinforced variants, without the need for a high temperature curing step or use of hazardous solvents. The mechanical properties of bioresorbable PGSLPA hydrogels were studied with and without electrospun nonwoven reinforcement and with varied layered configurations, aiming to determine the effects of microstructure on bulk compressive strength and elasticity. The nonwoven reinforced PGSLPA hydrogels exhibited a 60 % increase in compressive strength and an 80 % increase in elastic moduli compared to fibre-free PGSLPA samples. Mechanical properties of the fibre-reinforced hydrogels could also be modulated by altering the layering arrangement of the nonwoven and hydrogel phase. The nanofibre reinforced PGSLPA hydrogels also exhibited good elastic recovery, as evidenced by hysteresis in compression fatigue stress-strain evaluations showing a return to original dimensions.</description>

      <title>Morphological stability for in silico models of avascular tumors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The landscape of computational modeling in cancer systems biology is diverse, offering a spectrum of models and frameworks, each with its own trade-offs and advantages. Ideally, models are meant to be useful in refining hypotheses, to sharpen experimental procedures and, in the longer run, even for applications in personalized medicine. One of the greatest challenges is to balance model realism and detail with experimental data to eventually produce useful data-driven models. We contribute to this quest by developing a transparent, highly parsimonious, first principles silico model of a growing avascular tumor. We initially formulate the physiological considerations and the specific model within a stochastic cell-based framework. We next formulate a corresponding mean-field model using partial differential equations which is amenable to mathematical analysis. Despite a few notable differences between the two models, we are in this way able to successfully detail the impact of all parameters in the stability of the growth process and on the eventual tumor fate of the stochastic model. This facilitates the deduction of Bayesian priors for a given situation, but also provides important insights into the underlying mechanism of tumor growth and progression. Although the resulting model framework is relatively simple and transparent, it can still reproduce the full range of known emergent behavior. We identify a novel model instability arising from nutrient starvation and we also discuss additional insight concerning possible model additions and the effects of those. Thanks to the framework's flexibility, such additions can be readily included whenever the relevant data become available.</description>
