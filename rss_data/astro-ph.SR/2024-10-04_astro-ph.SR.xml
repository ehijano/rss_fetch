      <title>Searching for new physics using high precision absorption spectroscopy; continuum placement uncertainties and the fine structure constant in strong gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searches for variations of fundamental constants require a comprehensive understanding of measurement errors. This paper examines a source of error that is usually overlooked: the impact of continuum placement error. We investigate the problem using a high resolution, high signal to noise spectrum of the white dwarf G191$-$B2B. Narrow photospheric absorption lines allow us to search for new physics in the presence of a gravitational field approximately $10^4$ times that on Earth. Modelling photospheric lines requires knowing the underlying spectral continuum level. We describe the development of a fully automated, objective, and reproducible continuum estimation method. Measurements of the fine structure constant are produced using several continuum models. The results show that continuum placement variations result in small systematic shifts in the centroids of narrow photospheric absorption lines which impact significantly on fine structure constant measurements. This effect should therefore be included in the error budgets of future measurements. Our results suggest that continuum placement variations should be investigated in other contexts, including fine structure constant measurements in stars other than white dwarfs. The analysis presented here is based on NiV absorption lines in the photosphere of G191$-$B2B. Curiously, the inferred measurement of the fine structure constant obtained in this paper using NiV (the least negative of our measurements is $\Delta\alpha/\alpha = -1.462 \pm 1.121 \times 10^{-5}$) is inconsistent with the most recent previous G191$-$B2B photospheric measurement using FeV ($\Delta\alpha/\alpha = 6.36 \pm 0.35_{stat} \pm 1.84_{sys} \times 10^{-5}$). Given both measurements are derived from the same spectrum, we presume (but in this work are unable to check) that this 3.2$\sigma$ difference results from unknown laboratory wavelength systematics.</description>

      <title>Radial Evolution of ICME-Associated Particle Acceleration Observed by Solar Orbiter and ACE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On 2022 March 10, a coronal mass ejection (CME) erupted from the Sun, resulting in Solar Orbiter observations at 0.45 au of both dispersive solar energetic particles arriving prior to the interplanetary CME (ICME) and locally accelerated particles near the ICME-associated shock structure as it passed the spacecraft on 2022 March 11. This shock was later detected on 2022 March 14 by the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE), which was radially aligned with Solar Orbiter, at 1 au. Ion composition data from both spacecraft -- via the Solar Orbiter Energetic Particle Detector/ Suprathermal Ion Spectrograph (EPD/SIS) and the Ultra Low Energy Isotope Spectrometer (ULEIS) on ACE -- allows for in-depth analysis of the radial evolution of species-dependent ICME shock-associated acceleration processes for this event. We present a study of the ion spectra observed at 0.45 and 1 au during both the gradual solar energetic particle (SEP) and energetic storm particle (ESP) phases of the event. We find that the shapes of the spectra seen at each spacecraft have significant differences that were likely caused by varying shock geometry: Solar Orbiter spectra tend to lack spectral breaks, and the higher energy portions of the ACE spectra have comparable average flux to the Solar Orbiter spectra. Through an analysis of rigidity effects on the spectral breaks observed by ACE, we conclude that the 1 au observations were largely influenced by a suprathermal pool of $\mathrm{He}^{+}$ ions that were enhanced due to propagation along a stream interaction region (SIR) that was interacting with the ICME at times of observation.</description>

      <title>Time Variation of the Solar Tachocline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have used solar oscillation frequencies and frequency splittings obtained over solar cycles 23, 24 and the rising phase of solar cycle 25 to investigate whether the tachocline properties (jump i.e., the change in the rotation rate across the tachocline, width and position) show any time variation. We confirm that the change in rotation rate across the tachocline changes substantially, however, the change does not show a simple correlation with solar cycle unlike, for instance, changes in mode frequencies. The change during the ascending phase of solar cycle 25 is almost a mirror image of the change during the descending part of solar cycle 24, tempting us to speculate that the tachocline has a much longer period than either the sunspot or the magnetic cycle. We also find that the position of the tachocline, defined as the mid-point of the change in rotation rate, showed significant changes during solar cycle 24. The width of the tachocline, on the other hand, has showed significant changes during solar cycle 23, but not later. The change in the tachocline becomes more visible if we look at the upper and lower extents of the tachocline, defined as (position +/- width). We find that for epochs around solar maxima and minima, the extent decreases before increasing again - a few more years of data should clarify this trend. Our results reinforce the need to continue helioseismic monitoring of the Sun to understand solar activity and its evolution.</description>

      <title>The Components of Cepheid Systems: The FN Vel System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cepheid masses continue to be important tests of evolutionary tracks for intermediate mass stars as well as important predictors of their future fate. For systems where the secondary is a B star, {\it Hubble Space Telescope} ultraviolet spectra have been obtained. From these spectra a temperature can be derived, and from this a mass of the companion M$_2$. Once {\it Gaia} DR4 is available, proper motions can be used to determine the inclination of the orbit.
Combining mass of the companion, M$_2$, the mass function from the ground-based orbit of the Cepheid and the inclination produces the mass of the Cepheid, M$_1$. The Cepheid system FN Vel is used here to demonstrate this approach and what limits can be put on the Cepheid mass for inclination between 50 and 130$^o$.</description>

      <title>TESS Asteroseismic Masses and Radii of Red Giants with (and without) Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of asteroseismically derived surface gravities, masses, and radii of a sample of red giant stars both with and without confirmed planetary companions using TESS photometric light curves. These red giants were drawn from radial velocity surveys, and their reported properties in the literature rely on more traditional methods using spectroscopy and isochrone fitting. Our asteroseismically derived surface gravities achieved a precision of $\sim$0.01 dex; however, they were on average $\sim$0.1~dex smaller than the literature. The systematic larger gravities of the literature could plausibly present as a systematic overestimation of stellar masses, which would in turn lead to overestimated planetary masses of the companions. We find that the fractional discrepancies between our asteroseismically-determined parameters and those previously found are typically larger for stellar radii ($\sim$10% discrepancy) than for stellar masses ($&lt;5$% discrepancy). However, no evidence of a systematic difference between methods was found for either fundamental parameter. Two stars, HD~100065 and HD~18742, showed significant disagreement with the literature in both mass and radii. We explore the impacts on updated stellar properties on inferred planetary properties and caution that red giant radii may be more poorly constrained than uncertainties suggest.</description>

      <title>Magnetogram-matching Biot-Savart Law and Decomposition of Vector Magnetograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize a magnetogram-matching Biot-Savart law (BSL) from planar to spherical geometry. For a given coronal current density $\bf{J}$, this law determines the corresponding magnetic field $\tilde{\bf B}$ under the condition that its radial component vanishes at the surface. The superposition of $\tilde{\bf B}$ with a potential magnetic field defined by the given surface radial field, $B_r$, provides the entire magnetic configuration, in which $B_r$ remains unchanged by the currents. Using this approach, we (1) upgrade our regularized BSLs for constructing coronal magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) and (2) propose a new method for decomposing a measured photospheric magnetic field as ${\bf B} = {\bf B}_{\mathrm{pot}} + {\bf B}_T + {\bf B}_{\tilde{S}}$, where the potential, ${\bf B}_{\mathrm{pot}}$, toroidal, ${\bf B}_T$, and tangential poloidal, ${\bf B}_{\tilde{S}}$, fields are determined by $B_r$, $J_r$, and the surface divergence of ${\bf B} - {\bf B}_{\mathrm{pot}}$, respectively, all derived from magnetic data. Our ${\bf B}_T$ is identical to the one in the alternative decomposition by Schuck et al. (2022), while ${\bf B}_{\mathrm{pot}}$ and ${\bf B}_{\tilde{S}}$ are very different from their poloidal fields ${\bf B}_{\mathrm{P}&lt;}$ and ${\bf B}_{\mathrm{P}&gt;}$, which are {\it potential} and refer to {\it different} surface sides. In contrast, our ${\bf B}_{\tilde{S}}$ is generally {\it nonpotential} and, as ${\bf B}_{\mathrm{pot}}$ and ${\bf B}_T$, refers to the {\it same} upper side of the surface, rendering our decomposition more complete and consistent. We demonstrate that it allows one to identify the footprints and projected surface-location of MFRs, as well as the direction and connectivity of their currents, especially for weak or complex configurations, which is very important for modeling and analyzing observed pre-eruptive configurations and their eruptions.</description>

      <title>Formation of Stripped Stars From Stellar Collisions in Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are an important way to probe the properties of stellar populations surrounding supermassive black holes. Observed spectra of several TDEs, such as ASASSN-14li, show high nitrogen to carbon abundance ratios, leading to questions about their progenitors. Disrupting an intermediate- or high-mass star that has undergone CNO processing, increasing the nitrogen in its core, could lead to an enhanced nitrogen TDE. Galactic nuclei present a conducive environment for high-velocity stellar collisions that can lead to high mass loss, stripping the carbon- and hydrogen-rich envelopes of the stars and leaving behind the enhanced nitrogen cores. TDEs of these stripped stars may therefore exhibit even more extreme nitrogen enhancement. Using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code StarSmasher, we provide a parameter space study of high-velocity stellar collisions involving intermediate-mass stars, analyzing the composition of the collision products. We conclude that high-velocity stellar collisions can form products that have abundance ratios similar to those observed in the motivating TDEs. Furthermore, we show that stars that have not experienced high CNO processing can yield low-mass collision products that retain even higher nitrogen to carbon abundance ratios. We analytically estimate the mass fallback for a typical TDE of several collision products to demonstrate consistency between our models and TDE observations. Lastly, we discuss how the extended collision products, with high central to average density ratios, can be related to repeated partial TDEs like ASASSN-14ko and G objects in the Galactic Center.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismology of the mild Am $\delta$ Sct star HD 118660 : TESS photometry and modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of an asteroseismic study of HD 118660 (TIC 171729860), being a chemically peculiar (mild Am) star exhibiting $\delta$ Scuti ($\delta$ Sct) pulsations. It is based on the analysis of two sectors of time-series photometry from the space mission TESS and seismic modelling. It yielded the detection of 15 and 16 frequencies for TESS sectors 23 and 50, respectively. The identified pulsation modes include four radial ($\ell=0$) and five dipolar ($\ell=1$) ones. The radial modes are overtones with order $n$ ranging from $3$ and $6$. Such high values of $n$ are theoretically not expected for stars with the effective temperature of HD 118660 ($\rm T_{\rm eff}\approx 7550 \rm K$ ) located near the red edge of the $\delta$ Sct instability strip. To estimate the asteroseismic parameters, we have generated a grid of stellar models assuming a solar metallicity ($Z=0.014$) and different values for the convective overshooting parameter ($0.1\leq \alpha_{\rm ov}\leq 0.3$). We conclude that the analysis of the radial modes is insufficient to constrain $\alpha_{\rm ov}$ and $Z$ for $\delta$ Sct stars. The value for the equatorial velocity of HD 118660 derived from the seismic radius and the rotational frequency is consistent with values found in the literature.</description>

      <title>A solar rotation signature in cosmic dust: frequency analysis of dust particle impacts on the Wind spacecraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust particle impacts on the Wind spacecraft were detected with its plasma wave instrument Wind/WAVES. Frequency analysis on this dust impact time series revealed spectral peaks indicative of a solar rotation signature. We investigated whether this solar rotation signature is embedded in the interplanetary or interstellar dust (ISD) and whether it is caused by co-rotating interaction regions (CIRs), by the sector structure of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), or by external effects. We performed frequency analysis on subsets of the data to investigate the origin of these spectral peaks, comparing segments of Wind's orbit when the spacecraft moved against or with the ISD inflow direction and comparing the time periods of the ISD focusing and defocusing phases of the solar magnetic cycle. A superposed epoch analysis of the number of dust impacts during CIRs was used to investigate the systematic effect of CIRs. Case studies of time periods with frequent or infrequent occurrences of CIRs were compared to synthetic data of dust impacts affected by CIRs. We performed similar case studies for time periods with a stable or chaotic IMF sector structure. The superposed epoch analysis was repeated for a time series of the spacecraft floating potential. Spectral peaks were found at the solar rotation period of ~27d and its harmonics at 13.5d and 9d. This solar rotation signature may affect both interplanetary and ISD. The appearance of this signature correlates with the occurrence of CIRs but not with the stability of the IMF sector structure. The CIRs cause, on average, a reduction in the number of dust impact detections. Periodic changes of the spacecraft's floating potential were found to partially counteract this reduction by enhancing the instrument's sensitivity to dust impacts; these changes of the floating potential are thus unlikely to be the cause of the solar rotation signature.</description>

Abstract: SDO-FM is a foundation model using data from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) spacecraft; integrating three separate instruments to encapsulate the Sun's complex physical interactions into a multi-modal embedding space. This model can be used to streamline scientific investigations involving SDO by making the enormous datasets more computationally accessible for heliophysics research and enable investigations that require instrument fusion. We discuss four key components: an ingestion pipeline to create machine learning ready datasets, the model architecture and training approach, resultant embeddings and fine-tunable models, and finally downstream fine-tuned applications. A key component of this effort has been to include subject matter specialists at each stage of development; reviewing the scientific value and providing guidance for model architecture, dataset, and training paradigm decisions. This paper marks release of our pretrained models and embedding datasets, available to the community on Hugging Face and sdofm.org.</description>

      <title>Numerical experiments on granulation-generated two-fluid waves and flows in a solar magnetic carpet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the effects of granulation with a complex geometry of a magnetic carpet on the genesis of waves and plasma flows in a quiet-region of the solar atmosphere. Our aim is to perform numerical experiments on the self-generated and self-evolving solar granulation in a magnetic carpet representing the parts of the large-scale magnetized solar atmosphere, where waves and flows are basic inherent physical processes occurring continuously. We perform numerical experiments with the use of the JOANNA code which solves non-ideal and non-adiabatic two-fluid equations for ions+electrons and neutrals treated as two separate fluids. In these experiments, we assume that the plasma is hydrogen, and initially described by magnetohydrostatic equilibrium which is accompanied with a magnetic carpet. Parametric studies with different values of magnetic field show that its higher values result in larger magnitudes of ion-neutral velocity drift, thus ensuring larger heating and plasma flows. The present model addresses that in the highly dynamic solar chromosphere, waves, heating and plasma flows may collectively couple different layers of the solar atmosphere, and this entire process crucially depends on the local plasma and magnetic field properties. We suggest that waves and flows are the natural response of the granulation process in the quiet-Sun.</description>

      <title>Recovery of coronal dimmings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal dimmings are regions of reduced emission in the lower corona, observed after coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and representing their footprints. In order to investigate the long-term evolution of coronal dimming and its recovery, we propose two approaches that focus on both the global and the local evolution of dimming regions: the fixed mask approach and the pixel boxes approach. We present four case studies (September 6, 2011; March 7, 2012; June 14, 2012; and March 8, 2019) in which a coronal dimming is associated with a flare/CME eruption. We identified the dimming region by image segmentation, then restricted the analysis to a specific portion of the dimming and tracked the time evolution of the dimming brightness and area. In addition, we studied the behavior of small subregions inside the dimming area, of about 3x3 pixels, to compare the recovery in different regions of the dimming. Three out of the four cases show a complete recovery 24 hours after the flare/CME eruption. The recovery of the brightness follows a two-step trend, with a steeper and quicker segment followed by a slower one. In addition, some parts of the dimming, which may be core dimmings, are still present at the end of the analysis time and do not recover within 3 days, whereas the peripheral regions (secondary dimmings) show a full recovery. We demonstrate that the primary mechanism for recovery identified in the observations is the expansion of coronal loops into the dimming region, which gradually increase their intensity. Our developed approaches enable the analysis of dimmings alongside these bright structures, revealing different timescales of recovery for core and secondary/twin dimming regions. Combined with magnetic field modeling, these methods lay the foundation for further systematic analysis of dimming recovery and enhance the knowledge gained from already-analyzed events.</description>

      <title>Chemo-dynamical abundance analysis of the very metal-poor halo star HE 2315-4240</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02586</link>

Abstract: Learning about the chemical evolution of the universe is crucial to understanding the formation of the first stars and structure formation in the early universe. To find out how elements are produced via nucleosynthesis and how their relative amounts have evolved with time, abundance trends of stars with different metallicities can be established and compared. In this study, we present a spectrum of a very metal-poor star, HE 2315$-$4240, with [Fe/H] = $-$2.89 based on a Magellan/MIKE high-resolution visual light spectrum. The star has a radial velocity of +41.9 km s$^{-1}$, an effective temperature of 5181 K, a surface gravity of 2.24 dex, and a microturbulence of 1.61 km s$^{-1}$. The $\alpha$-elements and the iron peak elements agree well with the abundance trend. The low abundance of [Sr/Ba] and [C/Fe] suggests that HE 2315$-$4240 is accreted and formed in a dwarf galaxy. The value of [Ba/Eu] suggests the operation of a limited r-process. The abundance pattern of [Mg/Fe] and [Si/Fe] in HE 2315$-$4240 and its metallicity indicated that the star is formed from the gas enriched by a Type II supernova of a massive Pop III star. The abundance pattern fits Population III supernova yields moderately. The star's kinematic behavior shows that the star has a retrograde orbit and is moving away from the galactic center and out of the galactic disk to the south, and although the star is located in the halo of the Milky Way, it didn't form in the Milky Way but was rather formed in a small dwarf galaxy that was later absorbed by the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Modelling Stellar Irradiances I: the transition regions of FGKM stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employed advanced ionisation equilibrium models that we developed in Dufresne et. al. (2024), which include charge transfer and density effects, to model UV stellar irradiances for a sample of stars. Our sample includes $\epsilon$ Eridani (K2 V), $\alpha$ Centauri A (G2 V), Procyon (F5 V) and Proxima Centauri (M5.5 Ve). We measured line fluxes from STIS datasets and used O IV and O V as density diagnostics to find the formation pressure of ions in the transition region (TR) and adopted a simple Differential Emission Measure (DEM) modelling. Our findings indicate significant improvements in modelling spectral lines from anomalous ions such as Si IV, C IV and N V of the Li- and Na-like sequences, which produce the strongest lines in the UV. For example, the Si IV lines were under-predicted by a factor of five and now are within 40% the observed fluxes. The improved models allow us to obtain for the first time reliable estimates of some stellar chemical abundances in the TR. We compared our results with available photospheric abundances in the literature and found no evidence for the First Ionisation Potential (FIP) effect in the TR of our stellar sample. Finally, we compared our results with the solar TR that can also be described by photospheric abundances.</description>

      <title>Magnetic evolution of active regions: formation and eruption of magnetic flux ropes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic flux ropes (FRs) are twisted structures appearing on the sun, predominantly in the magnetically concentrated regions. These structures appear as coronal features known as filaments or prominences in H$\alpha$ observations, and as sigmoids in X-ray, EUV observations. Using the continuous vector magnetic field observations from \textit{Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager} onboard \textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory}, we study the evolution of the magnetic fields in the active regions (ARs) to understand the conditions of twisted flux formation. While ARs emerge and evolve further, flux motions such as shearing and rotation are efficient mechanisms to form twisted flux ropes. Magnetic helicity quantifies the twisted magnetic fields and helicity injection through photosphere leads to its accumulation in the corona. Therefore, coronal helicity accumulation leads to twisted FR formation and its eruption. The magnetic helicity injection is seen to evolve distinctly in the regions of flux rope formation and eruption. The ARs that are associated with eruptive activity are observed with helicity injection predominantly with one sign over a period of a few days. The ARs that inject helicity with a changing sign are unlikely to form twisted FRs because coronal helicity during the period of one sign of injected helicity gets cancelled by the opposite sign of injection in the later period. As a result, the coronal field reconfigures from shared to potential structure. For a given AR, the upper limit of helicity that could cause a CME eruption is not yet understood, which can be the subject of future studies of ARs. Magnetic reconnection plays a crucial role in both the initiation and driving of FR eruptions after their formation. Data-driven simulations of the AR evolution provide more insights on the flux rope formation and its onset of eruption.</description>

      <title>Discovery of three magnetic He-sdOs with SALT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields with strengths ranging from 300 to 500 kG have recently been discovered in a group of four extremely similar helium-enriched hot subdwarf (He-sdO) stars. Besides their strong magnetic fields, these He-sdO stars are characterised by common atmospheric parameters, clustering around $T_\mathrm{eff}$ = 46500K, $\log g$ close to 6, and intermediate helium abundances. Here we present the discovery of three additional magnetic hot subdwarfs, J123359.44-674929.11, J125611.42-575333.45, and J144405.79-674400.93. These stars are again almost identical in terms of atmospheric parameters but, at $B \approx$ 200kG, their magnetic fields are somewhat weaker than those previously known. The close similarity of all known He-sdOs implies a finely-tuned origin. We propose the merging of an He white dwarf with a H+He white dwarf. A differential rotation at the merge interface may initiate a toroidal magnetic field that evolves by a magnetic dynamo to produce a poloidal field. This field is either directly visible at the surface or may diffuse towards the surface if initially buried. We further discuss a broad absorption line centred at about 4630\r{A} that is common to all magnetic He-sdOs. This feature may not be related to the magnetic field but instead to the intermediate helium abundances in these He-sdO stars, allowing the strong He II 4686\r{A} line to be perturbed by collisions with hydrogen atoms.</description>

      <title>Structure formation with primordial black holes: collisional dynamics, binaries, and gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) could compose the dark matter content of the Universe. We present the first simulations of cosmological structure formation with PBH dark matter that consistently include collisional few-body effects, post-Newtonian orbit corrections, orbital decay due to gravitational wave emission, and black-hole mergers. We carefully construct initial conditions by considering the evolution during radiation domination as well as early-forming binary systems. We identify numerous dynamical effects due to the collisional nature of PBH dark matter, including evolution of the internal structures of PBH halos and the formation of a hot component of PBHs. We also study the properties of the emergent population of PBH binary systems, distinguishing those that form at primordial times from those that form during the nonlinear structure formation process. These results will be crucial to sharpen constraints on the PBH scenario derived from observational constraints on the gravitational wave background. Even under conservative assumptions, the gravitational radiation emitted over the course of the simulation appears to exceed current limits from ground-based experiments, but this depends on the evolution of the gravitational wave spectrum and PBH merger rate toward lower redshifts.</description>

      <title>Evolution of lithium in the disc of the Galaxy and the role of novae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium plays a crucial role in probing stellar physics and stellar and primordial nucleosynthesis, as well as the chemical evolution of our Galaxy. Stars are considered to be the main source of Li, still the identity of its primary stellar producer has long been a matter of debate. In light of recent theoretical and observational results, we investigate in this study the role of two candidate sources of Li enrichment in the Milky Way, namely AGB stars and, in particular, novae. We utilize a one-zone Galactic chemical evolution model to assess the viability of AGB stars and novae as stellar sources of Li. We use recent theoretical Li yields for AGB stars, while for novae we adopt observationally inferred Li yields and recently derived Delay Time Distributions (DTDs). Subsequently, we extend our analysis using a multi-zone model with radial migration to investigate spatial variations in the evolution of Li across the Milky Way disc and compare the results with observational data for field stars and open clusters. Our analysis shows that AGB stars fail by far to reproduce the meteoritic Li abundance. In contrast, novae appear as promising candidates within the adopted framework, allowing us to quantify the contribution of each Li source at Sun's formation and today. Our multi-zone model reveals the role of the differences in the DTDs of SN Ia and novae in shaping the evolution of Li in the various galactic zones. Its results are in fair agreement with the observational data for most open clusters, but small discrepancies appear in the outer disc.</description>

      <title>The mass distribution of stellar mergers: A new scenario for several FS CMa stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (Abreviated) FS CMa stars belong to a diverse group of stars exhibiting the B[e] phenomenon, which is manifested mainly by the presence of forbidden emission lines and a~strong infrared (IR) excess in their spectra. Recently, a strong magnetic field has been discovered in the FS CMa star IRAS 17449+2320. Its strength and an unusually high space velocity point to a post-merger nature. Stellar mergers may provide an explanation for the complex and sometimes chaotic behaviour of some of the FS CMa stars. We did a statistical study of numerical simulations using Aarseth's NBODY6 code. We show the importance of stellar mergers of low- to intermediate-mass stars (from $\approx$ 1.4 to $\approx$ 8 $\text{M}_{\odot}$) and for B-type stars in particular. We analysed two sets of N-body simulations with different initial orbital period distributions. In the simulations, more massive binaries are treated differently than less massive binaries and the mass limit usually used is 5 $\text{M}_{\odot}$. We also used the value of 2 $\text{M}_{\odot}$ to test the influence of this ambiguous limit on the results. Looking at mass, distance from their birth cluster, and velocity distributions, we investigated the statistical significance of individual spectral types in terms of merger dynamics and how merger events affect the stellar evolution. We found that around 50 \% of stars in the simulated open clusters involved in the formation of mergers are B-type stars. As a result, more than 50 \% of the merger products end up as a B-type star as well. Between 12.54 \% and 23.24 \% of all B-type stars are mergers. These results are a natural consequence of the initial mass function, initial distribution of the binary star parameters, and large range of masses for B-type stars. We present a comparison of the W component and the space velocity of the simulated mergers with a sample of observed FS CMa stars.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Persistent Quasi-Periodic Oscillations in Accreting White Dwarfs: A New Link to X-ray Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Almost all accreting black hole and neutron star X-ray binary systems (XRBs) exhibit prominent brightness variations on a few characteristic time-scales and their harmonics. These quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are thought to be associated with the precession of a warped accretion disc, but the physical mechanism that generates the precessing warp remains uncertain. Relativistic frame dragging (Lense-Thirring precession) is one promising candidate, but a misaligned magnetic field is an alternative, especially for neutron star XRBs. Here, we report the discovery of 5 accreting white dwarf systems (AWDs) that display strong optical QPOs with characteristic frequencies and harmonic structures that suggest they are the counterpart of the QPOs seen in XRBs. Since AWDs are firmly in the classical (non-relativistic) regime, Lense-Thirring precession cannot account for these QPOs. By contrast, a weak magnetic field associated with the white dwarf can drive disc warping and precession in these systems, similar to what has been proposed for neutron star XRBs. Our observations confirm that magnetically driven warping is a viable mechanism for generating QPOs in disc-accreting astrophysical systems, certainly in AWDs and possibly also in (neutron star) XRBs. Additionally, they establish a new way to estimate magnetic field strengths, even in relatively weak-field systems where other methods are not available.</description>

      <title>Diffusive interactions between photons and electrons: an application to cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gradient force is the conservative component of many types of forces exerted by light on particles. When it is derived from a potential, there is no heat transferred to the particle interacting with the light field. However, most theoretical descriptions of the gradient force use simplified configurations of the light field and particle interactions which overlook small amounts of heating. It is known that quantum fluctuations contribute to a very small but measurable momentum diffusion of atoms and a corresponding increase in their temperature. This paper examines the contribution to momentum diffusion from a gradient force described as a quantum interaction between electron wave packets and a classical electromagnetic field. Stimulated transfers of photons between interfering light beams produce a small amount of heating that is difficult to detect in laboratory experiments. However the solar corona, with its thermal electrons irradiated by an intense electromagnetic field, provides ideal conditions for such a measurement. Heating from stimulated transfers is calculated to contribute a large fraction of the observed coronal heating. Furthermore, the energy removed from the light field produces a wavelength shift of its spectrum as it travels through free electrons. Theory predicts a stimulated transfer redshift comparable to the redshift of distant objects observed in astronomy.</description>

      <title>Study of magnetic reconnection at low-$\beta$ using laser-powered capacitor coils</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a ubiquitous fundamental process in space and astrophysical plasmas that rapidly converts magnetic energy into some combination of flow energy, thermal energy, and non-thermal energetic particles. Over the past decade, a new experimental platform has been developed to study magnetic reconnection using strong coil currents powered by high power lasers at low plasma beta, typical conditions under which reconnection is energetically important in astrophysics. KJ-class lasers were used to drive parallel currents to reconnect MG-level magnetic fields in a quasi-axisymmetric geometry, similar to the Magnetic Reconnection Experiment or MRX, and thus this platform is named micro-MRX. This presentation summarizes two major findings from micro-MRX: direct measurement of accelerated electrons and observation of ion acoustic waves during anti-parallel reconnection. The angular dependence of the measured electron energy spectrum and the resulting accelerated energies, supported by particle-in-cell simulations, indicate that direct acceleration by the out-of-plane reconnection electric field is at work. Furthermore, a sudden onset of ion acoustic bursts has been measured by collective Thomson scattering in the exhaust of magnetic reconnection, followed by electron acoustic bursts with electron heating and bulk acceleration. These results demonstrate that the micro-MRX platform offers a novel and unique approach to study magnetic reconnection in the laboratory in addition to the capabilities provided by traditional magnetized plasma experiments such as MRX and the upcoming FLARE (Facility for Laboratory Reconnection experiments). Future approaches to study other particle acceleration mechanisms and ion acoustic waves from magnetic reconnection are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Spin-Polarized Electrons from Magnetically Aligned Grains and Chiral Symmetry Breaking: Effects of Cosmic Rays in Protostellar Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-energy spin-polarized electrons (SPEs) are thought to cause symmetry breaking and could explain the origin of homochirality of prebiotic molecules such as amino acids and sugars. Here we study the effect of cosmic rays (CRs) on the emission of SPEs from aligned grains in dense protostellar environments and explore the SPE effects on chiral asymmetry of prebiotic molecules. We first show that icy grains in protostellar environments can align with magnetic fields due to magnetically enhanced radiative torque mechanism. We then study the production of thermal electrons by CR ionization of the H$_2$ gas and the CR-induced UV radiation using the attenuated CR spectra in dense cores obtained from a continous slowing down model. Next, we show that thermal electrons with initial random spins captured by aligned grains will quickly become spin-polarized due to the Barnett effect, converting unpolarized incident electrons into SPEs. We calculate the rate of photoemission of such SPEs by CRs-induced UV radiation and secondary electron emission from aligned grains and find that the photoemission by CRs-induced UV radiation is dominant. Finally, we calculate the total production rate of SPEs inside aligned dust grains by CRs. Low-energy secondary SPEs from aligned grains induced by CRs would cause the chiral asymmetry of chiral prebiotic molecules formed in the ice mantle of aligned grains, in analogous to UV circularly polarized light. We propose that amino acids and sugars of chiral assymmetry detected in meteorite/asteroids/comets might be formed in the ice mantle of grains under the irradiation of SPEs released from aligned grains by CRs in protostellar environments.</description>

      <title>Innovative Dynamics: Utilizing Perelman's Entropy and Ricci Flow for Settler Position Models on Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores a novel approach to modeling the positional dynamics of stars using discrete dynamical systems. We define star evolution through discrete-time update rules based on right ascension, declination, and distance, incorporating chaotic behavior via nonlinear functions and external perturbations. By applying Ricci flow and Riemannian metrics, we provide new insights into the positional dynamics of stars. Theoretical computations of Perelman entropy are used to assess system complexity, with high-precision Runge-Kutta methods ensuring accurate solutions for our chaotic model. We quantify chaos using Lyapunov exponents and perform bifurcation analysis to study how parameter variations affect the dynamics. Comparing our model to the Lorenz attractor reveals both similarities and unique characteristics in stellar dynamics. Our results show that entropy increases exponentially, indicating that predicting star positions with precision becomes increasingly challenging over time. This study advances the understanding of chaos in celestial systems and contributes to dynamical systems theory by integrating chaos theory with astronomical modeling.</description>

      <title>BEBOP VI. Enabling the detection of circumbinary planets orbiting double-lined binaries with the DOLBY method of radial-velocity extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circumbinary planets - planets that orbit both stars in a binary system - offer the opportunity to study planet formation and orbital migration in a different environment compare to single stars. However, despite the fact that &gt; 90% of binary systems in the solar neighbourhood are spectrally resolved double-lined binaries, there has been only one detection of a circumbinary planet orbitting a double-lined binary using the radial velocity method so far. Spectrally disentangling both components of a binary system is hard to do accurately. Weak spectral lines blend with one another in a time-varying way, and inaccuracy in spectral modelling can lead to an inaccurate estimation of the radial-velocity of each component. This inaccuracy adds scatter to the measurements that can hide the weak radial-velocity signature of circumbinary exoplanets. We have obtained new high signal-to-noise and high-resolution spectra with the SOPHIE spectrograph, mounted on the 193cm telescope at Observatoire de Haute-Provence (OHP) for six, bright, double-lined binaries for which a circumbinary exoplanet detection has been attempted in the past. To extract radial-velocities we use the DOLBY code, a recent method of spectral disentangling using Gaussian processes to model the time-varying components. We analyse the resulting radial-velocities with a diffusive nested sampler to seek planets, and compute sensitivity limits.
  We do not detect any new circumbinary planet. However, we show that the combination of new data, new radial-velocity extraction methods, and new statistical methods to determine a dataset's sensitivity to planets leads to an approximately one order of magnitude improvement compared to previous results. This improvement brings us into the range of known circumbinary exoplanets and paves the way for new campaigns of observations targeting double-lined binaries.</description>

      <title>Leaning Sideways: VHS 1256-1257 b is a Super-Jupiter with a Uranus-like Obliquity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We constrain the angular momentum architecture of VHS J125601.92-125723.9, a 140 $\pm$ 20 Myr old hierarchical triple system composed of a low-mass binary and a widely-separated planetary-mass companion VHS 1256 b. VHS 1256 b has been a prime target for multiple characterization efforts, revealing the highest measured substellar photometric variability to date and the presence of silicate clouds and disequilibrium chemistry. Here we add a key piece to the characterization of this super-Jupiter on a Tatooine-like orbit; we measure its spin-axis tilt relative to its orbit, i.e. the obliquity of VHS 1256 b. We accomplish this by combining three measurements. We find a projected rotation rate $v \sin{i_p} = 8.7 \pm 0.1 \,\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ for VHS 1256 b using near-IR high-resolution spectra from Gemini/IGRINS. Combining this with a published photometric rotation period indicates that the companion is viewed edge-on, with a line-of-sight spin axis inclination of $i_{\rm p} = 90^\circ \pm 18^\circ$. We refit available astrometry measurements to confirm an orbital inclination of $i_{\rm o} = 23 \substack{+10 \\ -13}^\circ$. Taken together, VHS 1256 b has a large planetary obliquity of $\psi = 90^\circ \pm 25^\circ$. In total, we have three measured angular momentum vectors for the system: the binary orbit normal, companion orbit normal, and companion spin axis. All three are misaligned with respect to each other. Although VHS 1256 b is tilted like Uranus, their origins are distinct. We rule out planet-like scenarios including collisions and spin-orbit resonances, and suggest that top-down formation via core/filament fragmentation is promising.</description>

      <title>Extinction of Taurus, Orion, Perseus and California Molecular Clouds Based on the LAMOST, 2MASS, and Gaia Surveys II: The Extinction Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extinction law from ultraviolet (UV) to infrared (IR) (0.2-24 $\mu$m) is determined by relying on the blue-edge method and color excess ratios for some nearby molecular clouds, from low mass star forming region to massive star forming region. The observational data are collected from nine photometric surveys, along with stellar parameters from the APOGEE and LAMOST spectroscopic surveys. Within the uncertainties, the optical ratio of selective to total extinction ($R_{G_{BP}}$) does not vary substantially across the clouds, irrespective of the density, specifically $R_{G_{BP}} =2.302\pm0.027$, where $R_{G_{BP}} \equiv A_{G_{BP}}/E_{G_{BP},G_{RP}}$. The IR extinction law is consistent with \citet{Wang19_law}. The extinction law in the UV band is compromised by the shallow depth with $A_{V} \leq 2$ mag and is hard to describe by one parameter $R$. In addition, the extinction in the WISE/W1 band is significantly larger than in the Spitzer/IRAC1 band in the dense regions, which is attributed to the ice water absorption.</description>

      <title>Short-Period Variables in TESS Full-Frame Image Light Curves Identified via Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission measured light from stars in ~85% of the sky throughout its two-year primary mission, resulting in millions of TESS 30-minute cadence light curves to analyze in the search for transiting exoplanets. To search this vast dataset, we aim to provide an approach that is both computationally efficient, produces highly performant predictions, and minimizes the required human search effort. We present a convolutional neural network that we train to identify short period variables. To make a prediction for a given light curve, our network requires no prior target parameters identified using other methods. Our network performs inference on a TESS 30-minute cadence light curve in ~5ms on a single GPU, enabling large scale archival searches. We present a collection of 14156 short-period variables identified by our network. The majority of our identified variables fall into two prominent populations, one of short-period main sequence binaries and another of Delta Scuti stars. Our neural network model and related code is additionally provided as open-source code for public use and extension.</description>

      <title>Spectropolarimetric Inversion in Four Dimensions with Deep Learning (SPIn4D): I. Overview, Magnetohydrodynamic Modeling, and Stokes Profile Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The National Science Foundation's Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) will provide high-resolution, multi-line spectropolarimetric observations that are poised to revolutionize our understanding of the Sun. Given the massive data volume, novel inference techniques are required to unlock its full potential. Here, we provide an overview of our "SPIn4D" project, which aims to develop deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for estimating the physical properties of the solar photosphere from DKIST spectropolarimetric observations. We describe the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling and the Stokes profile synthesis pipeline that produce the simulated output and input data, respectively. These data will be used to train a set of CNNs that can rapidly infer the four-dimensional MHD state vectors by exploiting the spatiotemporally coherent patterns in the Stokes profile time series. Specifically, our radiative MHD model simulates the small-scale dynamo actions that are prevalent in quiet-Sun and plage regions. Six cases with different mean magnetic fields have been conducted; each case covers six solar-hours, totaling 109 TB in data volume. The simulation domain covers at least $25\times25\times8$ Mm with $16\times16\times12$ km spatial resolution, extending from the upper convection zone up to the temperature minimum region. The outputs are stored at a 40 s cadence. We forward model the Stokes profile of two sets of Fe I lines at 630 and 1565 nm, which will be simultaneously observed by DKIST and can better constrain the parameter variations along the line of sight. The MHD model output and the synthetic Stokes profiles are publicly available, with 13.7 TB in the initial release.</description>

      <title>The R-Process Alliance: Fifth Data Release from the Search for R-Process-Enhanced Metal-poor Stars in the Galactic Halo with the GTC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03731v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the abundance pattern of metal-poor stars and the production of heavy elements through various nucleosynthesis processes offers crucial insights into the chemical evolution of the Milky Way, revealing primary sites and major sources of rapid neutron-capture process ($r$-process) material in the Universe. In this fifth data release from the $R$-Process Alliance, we present the detailed chemical abundances of 41 faint (down to V = 15.8) and extremely metal-poor (down to [Fe/H] = -3.3) halo stars selected from the R-Process Alliance (RPA). We obtained high-resolution spectra for these objects with the HORuS spectrograph on the Gran Telescopio Canarias. We measure the abundances of light, alpha, Fe-peak, and neutron-capture elements. We report the discovery of five CEMP, one limited-$r$, three $r$-I, and four $r$-II stars, and six Mg-poor stars. We also identify one star of a possible globular cluster origin at an extremely low metallicity at [Fe/H] = -3.0. This adds to the growing evidence of a lower limit metallicity floor for globular cluster abundances. We use the abundances of Fe-peak elements and the alpha-elements to investigate the contributions from different nucleosynthesis channels in the progenitor supernovae. We find the distribution of [Mg/Eu] as a function of [Fe/H] to have different enrichment levels, indicating different possible pathways and sites of their production. We also reveal differences in the trends of the neutron-capture element abundances of Sr, Ba, and Eu of various $r$-I and $r$-II stars from the RPA data releases, which provide constraints on their nucleosynthesis sites and subsequent evolution.</description>

      <title>High-resolution spectroscopy of detached eclipsing binaries during total eclipses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results of high-resolution spectroscopic observations of detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs) with total eclipses, for which UVES spectra were obtained during the phase of totality. With the additional, independent information on effective temperature and metallicity of one of the components, we aimed at estimating the precise ages of the studied binaries, and show the usefulness of totality spectra. We also provide precise orbital and physical stellar parameters of the components of systems in question. Using the VLT/UVES we obtained high-resolution spectra of 11 DEBs during their total eclipse phase. Atmospheric parameters of then-visible (larger) components were obtained with iSpec. With additional spectroscopy from the CR\'EME project, public archives, and literature, we obtained radial velocity (RV) measurements, from which orbital parameters were calculated. Photometric time-series observations from TESS and ASAS were modelled with the JKTEBOP code, and, combined with RV-based results, allowed us to obtain physical parameters for nine double-lined systems from our sample. All the available data were used to constrain the ages with our own approach, utilising MESA isochrones. Reddening-free, isochrone-based distances were also estimated, and confronted with Gaia DR3. We show that single spectroscopic observations taken during a total eclipse can break the age-metallicity degeneracy, and allow for precise determination of the age of a DEB, down to 5-10% level of uncertainty. Even for single-lined DEBs, where absolute masses are not possible to obtain, the spectroscopic analysis of one of the components allows one to put strong constraints on the properties of both stars. For some cases we noted inconsistencies between isochrone-based and GDR3 distances. For one binary, which could not be fitted with a single isochrone (RZ Eri) we suggest a new explanation.</description>

Abstract: Understanding solar wind flows is crucial for unraveling the dynamics of the Sun's corona and improving space weather forecasting. However, the complex nature of the solar wind and the absence of reliable ground-truth data present significant challenges to current tracking methods. To address this, the Flow Tracking Challenge was established, providing a platform for testing and refining flow tracking algorithms using synthetic images generated by the Synthetic Coronal Outflow Model (SynCOM). The challenge is divided into two phases: a preliminary phase focusing on simpler flow scenarios and a main phase featuring more complex synthetic images that mimic solar outflows. These phases allow researchers to evaluate their methods under various simulated conditions. SynCOM's synthetic data benchmark improves accuracy in velocity estimations. This paper presents the preliminary results of the Flow Tracking Challenge, where the synthetic images from SynCOM are used to test solar wind velocity tracking methods. Initial findings demonstrate SynCOM's value as a benchmark, guiding improvements for upcoming missions like PUNCH.</description>

Abstract: We present a new supergiant-rich stellar cluster hidden by extinction and christen it as Barb\'a 2, in honor of its discoverer Rodolfo Barb\'a. The cluster is at a distance of $7.39^{+0.65}_{-0.55}$ kpc and contains several supergiants, of which we provide spectral classifications for one blue, one yellow, and five red ones. The cluster extinction indicates an above-average grain-size ($R_{5495} \sim 3.7$), its age has a minimum value of 10 Ma, and its core radius is $0.84\pm0.19$ pc.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Semi-convective Staircases in Rotating Flows: Consequences for Fuzzy Cores in Giant Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10833v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observational constraints on the internal structure of Jupiter and Saturn suggest that these planets have ``fuzzy" cores, i.e., gradients of the concentration of heavy elements that might span a large fraction of the planet's radius. These cores could be composed of a semi-convective staircase, i.e., multiple convective layers separated by diffusive interfaces arising from double-diffusive instabilities. However, to date, no study has demonstrated how such staircases can avoid layer mergers and persist over evolutionary time scales. In fact, previous work has found that these mergers occur rapidly, leading to only a single convective layer. Using 3D simulations, we demonstrate that rotation prolongs the lifetime of a convective staircase by increasing the timescale for both layer merger and erosion of the interface between the final two layers. We present an analytic model for the erosion phase, predicting that rotation increases the erosion time by a factor of approximately $\mathrm{Ro}^{-1/2}$, where $\mathrm{Ro}$ is the Rossby number of the convective flows (the ratio of the rotation period to the convective turnover time). For Jovian conditions at early times after formation (when convection is vigorous enough to mix a large fraction of the planet), we find the erosion time to be roughly $10^{9}~\mathrm{yrs}$ in the non-rotating case and $10^{11}~\mathrm{yrs}$ in the rotating case. If these timescales are confirmed with a larger suite of numerical simulations, the existence of convective staircases within the deep interiors of giant planets is a strong possibility, and rotation could be an important factor in the preservation of their fuzzy cores.</description>
