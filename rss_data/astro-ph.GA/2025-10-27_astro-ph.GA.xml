      <title>Direct Measurement of Galaxy Assembly Bias using DESI DR1 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first direct measurement of galaxy assembly bias, a critical systematic in cosmology, from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Bright Galaxy Survey. We introduce a novel, cosmology-independent method to measure the halo occupation distribution (HOD) by combining a state-of-the-art group catalog with weak gravitational lensing. For groups binned by total luminosity, we determine the galaxy occupation number $N_{\rm gal}$ from group-galaxy cross-correlations, while weak lensing constrains the average halo mass $M_h$. Applying this to a volume-limited sample at $z{\in}[0.05,0.2]$, we measure the dependence of HOD, $N_{\rm gal}(M_h)$, on large-scale overdensity $\delta_{g}$. Focusing on the satellite galaxies, we find an assembly bias parameter of $Q_{\rm sat}{=}0.05{\pm}0.14$, a result consistent with zero and in tension with many empirical galaxy formation models. Our method provides a robust approach for characterizing galaxy assembly bias to achieve precision cosmology with DESI and future Stage-V surveys.</description>

      <title>Positive AGN Feedback Enhances Star Formation in Starburst Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback in dwarf galaxies remains poorly understood, with conventional wisdom suggesting it primarily suppresses star formation. Using high-resolution MACER3D simulations that directly resolve the Bondi radius, we demonstrate that AGN feedback can significantly enhance rather than suppress star formation in starburst dwarf galaxies. Our simulations reveal that AGN feedback increases global star formation rates by approximately 25% when comparing our models with both AGN and supernova feedback to those with only supernova feedback. This enhancement occurs through AGN-driven outflows creating compressed gas regions where efficient cooling preserves the high density while quickly radiating away thermal energy, creating ideal conditions for star formation. This positive feedback mechanism operates in gas-rich starburst environments with efficient cooling and moderate AGN energy input that compresses gas without expelling it from the galaxy. Critically, it requires both AGN and supernova feedback working in concert: without SN feedback to regulate black hole activity, AGN outflows become too powerful and expel gas rather than compress it. Our results closely match observations of the starburst dwarf galaxy Henize 2-10, where similar shock-compressed regions of enhanced star formation have been observed. These findings challenge conventional understanding of AGN feedback and suggest that AGN may play a previously unrecognized role in accelerating star formation during active phases of dwarf galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Magnetic clumping of charged dust in the dense interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Dust grains undergo significant growth in star-forming environments, especially in dense regions prone to gravitational collapse. Although dust is generally assumed to represent $1 \%$ of the gas mass, dust density variations are expected on small scales due to differential dynamics with the gas, leading to enhanced coagulation rates in regions of dust enrichment. Aims: We aim to investigate the clumping of charged dust in the turbulent magnetized dense regions of the interstellar medium. Methods: We develop a dusty model that goes beyond the standard non-ideal MHD and use the code {\ttfamily shark} to perform multifluid 1D simulations of a single size charged dust species and neutral gas with large scale driven turbulence and including ion-neutral friction. Results: We identify a mechanism similar to the parametric instability that efficiently forms dust clumps even in presence of dissipative processes. Such strong clumping survives and is sustained when driving turbulence, and thus high levels of dust concentration are produced due to compressive magnetic effects in regions of shocks. Dust density enhancements are favored by a high transverse-to-longitudinal magnetic ratio which is controlled by: transverse Mach number and plasma parameter. We find that a substantial fraction of dust experiences a density increase of more than a factor of 10 under reasonable conditions, thus promoting dust growth. Conclusion: Our novel dusty non-ideal MHD model shows that dust grains (main charge carriers) are subject to small-scale compressive magnetic effects driven by a parametric instability - like mechanism in regions of shocks, and consequently experience high density enhancements in turbulent environments that go beyond those permitted by pure hydrodynamical processes, making in-situ formation of large grains (sub-mm) in protostellar envelopes a plausible scenario.</description>

      <title>Chemical modeling of aminoketene, ethanolamine, and glycine production in interstellar ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Icy interstellar dust grains are a source of complex organic molecule (COM) production, although their formation mechanisms are debated. Laboratory experiments show that atomic C deposited onto interstellar ice analogs can react with solid-phase NH3 to form a CHNH2 radical, a possible precursor to COMs, including aminoketene (NH2CHCO). We used astrochemical kinetics models to explore the role of the reaction of atomic C with NH3 and subsequent reaction with CO in the formation of NH2CHCO and other COMs. We applied the three-phase chemical model MAGICKAL to hot molecular core conditions from the cold-collapse through to the hot-core stage. The chemical network was extended to include NH2CHCO and a range of associated gas-phase, grain-surface, and bulk-ice products and reactions. We also approximated conditions in a shocked cloud, including sputtering of ice mantles. NH2CHCO is formed on grains at low temperatures (~10 K) with a peak solid-phase abundance of ~2x10^-10 nH. Its formation is driven by nondiffusive reactions, in particular the Eley-Rideal reaction of C with surface NH3, followed by immediate reaction with CO. Surface hydrogenation of NH2CHCO produces ethanolamine with a significant abundance of ~8x10^-8 nH. In the gas-phase, although ethanolamine reaches a modest abundance peak immediately following its desorption from grains under hot-core conditions, it is destroyed more rapidly due to its high proton affinity. Molecular survival is much higher in the shocked regions, where these species seem most likely to be detected. NH2CHCO is produced efficiently on simulated interstellar grain surfaces, acting subsequently as an important precursor to more complex organics, including ethanolamine and glycine. Ion-molecule gas-phase destruction of NH3-bearing COMs is less efficient in shocked lower-density regions, in contrast to hot cores, enhancing their abundances and lifetimes.</description>

      <title>SPHEREx: Aromatics, Aliphatics and PAH Size across the Iris Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations by the SpectroPhotometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx) are combined with Spitzer spectral map data to study the aromatic, aliphatic, and PAH size evolution across the northwest photo-dissociation region (PDR) of the Iris Nebula (NGC7023). The 3.3-3.4 $\mu$m complex (I$_{3.3}$) and 11.2 $\mu$m (I$_{11.2}$) PAH band strength are determined through direct integration. In addition, the former is decomposed into a 3.3 (I'$_{3.3}$) and 3.4 $\mu$m (I'$_{3.4}$) sub-feature by fitting SPHEREx bandpass-integrated photometry using a modeled, highly sampled, multi-component spectrum. I$_{3.3}$, I$_{11.2}$, I'$_{3.3}$, and I'$_{3.4}$ all peak at the PDR. The NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database is used to obtain the average number of carbon atoms ($\overline{\rm N_{C}}$) and small PAH fraction ($f_{\rm small}$) by fitting the isolated PAH component of the Spitzer segment; $70\lesssim\overline{N_{C}}\lesssim76$ and $0.24\lesssim\text{f}_{\rm small}\lesssim0.36$. I'$_{3.4}$/I'$_{3.4}$, I$_{11.2}$/I$_{3.3}$, $\overline{\rm N_{C}}$, and $f_{\rm small}$ all show a demarcation that matches the large-scale morphology of the region. For I'$_{3.3}$ and I'$_{3.4}$ this is reflected by two distinct trends when plotted against each other, one associated with the dense, the other with the diffuse medium; $[N_{\rm H,ali}/N_{\rm H,aro}]_{\rm dense}$ = 0.49$\pm$0.01 and $[N_{\rm H,ali}/N_{\rm H,aro}]_{\rm diffuse}$ = 0.090$\pm$0.005. $\overline{\rm N_{C}}$ and $f_{\rm small}$ are tentatively correlated with I$_{11.2}$/I$_{3.3}$ (R=0.53$\pm$0.04 and -0.45$\pm$0.04, respectively). A wider variety of large(r) extended interstellar medium objects is required to tighten the correlations, turn them into quantitative calibrators for PAH size, and pin down the discrepancy of correlations with I'$_{3.3}$ involved.</description>

      <title>The Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS). XL. The Morphological Classification of Virgo Cluster Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of morphologies, based on deep $u^{*}g^{\prime}i^{\prime}z^{\prime}$ imaging of the Virgo Cluster from the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS), for 3689 Virgo cluster members spanning a mass range of $\sim$$10^{11}M_{\odot}$ to $\sim$$10^5~M_{\odot}$. Our analysis introduces a new, two-component visual classification scheme developed to capture the morphological diversity of galaxies over more than six orders of magnitude in stellar mass. Our morphological classifications use two parameters to describe the global structure and star formation activity of each galaxy. Structural sub-codes denote features such as spiral arms, bars, disks, shells, streams, while star formation sub-codes indicate the form and location of the current star formation activity (e.g., in cores, clumps, filaments, etc). These visual classifications rely on deep $g^\prime$-band images, supplemented by $u^{*}g^{\prime}i^{\prime}$ color images, as well as unsharp-masked images for a subset of objects. We compare our classifications to previous results for bright member galaxies that used more established schemes, finding good agreement. We also measure quantitative classification statistics (e.g., CASGM$_{20}$) for a subset of the brighter galaxies, and present catalogs for some galaxy types of special interest, including structurally compact galaxies, ultra-diffuse galaxies, candidate ultra-compact dwarf transition objects, as well as candidate post-merger systems. These morphological classifications may be useful as a training set in the application of machine learning tools to the next generation of wide-field imaging surveys.</description>

      <title>Supernovae Driven Winds Impede Lyman Continuum Escape from Dwarf Galaxies in First 10 Myr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations suggest that UV-bright, compact star-forming galaxies produce enough ionizing (Lyman continuum; LyC) photons to reionize the Universe. Yet, the efficiency of LyC escape and the roles of radiation, stellar winds, and supernovae remain uncertain. Using medium-resolution spectra of six nearly identical local star-forming galaxies, we directly trace, for the first time, the evolution of a multiphase wind through individual spectral lines alongside measurements of the LyC escape fraction. We find that LyC escape peaks early, during a period dominated by intense radiation and stellar winds but lacking a fast galactic wind. As the starbursts age, supernovae drive and accelerate the wind, progressively suppressing LyC escape. These results highlight the need for cosmological simulations to incorporate early feedback as a key driver of reionization.</description>

      <title>Modelling the scattering by porous aggregate dust grains in the Far-Ultraviolet halos of Spica and Achernar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Far-Ultraviolet (FUV) halos have been detected around six bright stars by Murthy and Henry (2011) using GALEX observations. These halos are thought to be caused by forward scattering of the starlight by dust grains present in thin foreground clouds. The optical constants of grains producing such halos have been constrained earlier by using a single scattering model, that considered the Henyey-Greenstein empirical phase function instead of theoretical phase functions for the scattering grains. In this work, we have modelled the FUV halos for two stars, Spica and Achernar, by considering the realistic porous aggregates of different sizes and compositions. As the Henyey-Greenstein phase function is known to deviate from theoretical predictions, we have utilized theoretical scattering phase functions for modelling. The dust is placed in a double-layered plane-parallel sheet with its distance and optical depth varied to get the best fit. We find that the halo intensities are dominated by scattering due to 0.05 {\mu}m sized porous dust aggregates made of amorphous silicate and carbonaceous aggregates for Spica and Achernar, respectively. We find that the medium in front of Achernar has a lower optical depth ({\tau}) of 0.032 compared to Spica which has a value of {\tau} = 0.1. This low value is close to the optical depth of the local ISM (0.01) within 40 pc of the Sun. This study demonstrates an effective method to constrain the dust grain properties in the local interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>AGN STORM 2. XI. Spectroscopic reverberation mapping of the hot dust in Mrk 817</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AGN Space Telescope and Optical Reverberation Mapping 2 (STORM 2) campaign targeted Mrk 817 with intensive multi-wavelength monitoring and found its soft X-ray emission to be strongly absorbed. We present results from 157 near-IR spectra with an average cadence of a few days. Whereas the hot dust reverberation signal as tracked by the continuum flux does not have a clear response, we recover a dust reverberation radius of $\sim 90$ light-days from the blackbody dust temperature light-curve. This radius is consistent with previous photometric reverberation mapping results when Mrk 817 was in an unobscured state. The heating/cooling process we observe indicates that the inner limit of the dusty torus is set by a process other than sublimation, rendering it a luminosity-invariant `dusty wall' of a carbonaceous composition. Assuming thermal equilibrium for dust optically thick to the incident radiation, we derive a luminosity of $\sim 6 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for the source heating it. This luminosity is similar to that of the obscured spectral energy distribution, assuming a disk with an Eddington accretion rate of $\dot{m} \sim 0.2$. Alternatively, the dust is illuminated by an unobscured lower luminosity disk with $\dot{m} \sim 0.1$, which permits the UV/optical continuum lags in the high-obscuration state to be dominated by diffuse emission from the broad-line region. Finally, we find hot dust extended on scales $&gt; 140-350$ pc, associated with the rotating disk of ionised gas we observe in spatially-resolved [SIII] $\lambda 9531$ images. Its likely origin is in the compact bulge of the barred spiral host galaxy, where it is heated by a nuclear starburst.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a giant radio outburst of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy SDSS J110546.07+145202.4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have identified a high-amplitude radio outburst in the course of a large-sample study of the radio properties of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies. We have analysed previous radio data and obtained new radio observations with the Effelsberg 100 m telescope, in order to measure the properties and understand the nature of the high-amplitude radio variability. We have also searched for signs of variability in the infrared and optical bands using archival data. We report the discovery of a rare high-amplitude radio outburst of a NLS1 galaxy, SDSS J110546.07+145202.4, with an amplitude of a factor of &gt;20 at centimetre wavelengths within 18 yr, and remaining at high-state for at least 7.6 yr. Thus, the object transitioned to a radio-loud state with a radio-loudness parameter exceeding 150. The radio spectrum measured at gigahertz frequencies during the 2020s is flat. We did not find indications of a similar increase in brightness in optical surveys or in the infrared measurements of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. The variability characteristics are inconsistent with tidal disruption events, and hard to reconcile with blazar variability.</description>

      <title>Exploring the statistical properties of double radio relics in the TNG-Cluster and TNG300 simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double radio relics, pairs of diffuse radio features located on opposite sides of merging galaxy clusters, are a rare subclass of radio relics that are believed to trace merger shocks and provide valuable constraints on plasma acceleration models and merger history. With the number of known double relics growing in recent and upcoming radio surveys, statistical analyses of their properties are becoming feasible. In this study, we utilize the cosmological magnetohydrodynamics zoom-in simulations TNG-Cluster, in combination with TNG300-1, to examine the statistical properties of double radio relics. The simulated double relic pairs exhibit a wide range of luminosity ratios, broadly consistent with the observations. We find that the two relics in a given double system often differ significantly in their shock properties and magnetic field strengths. This diversity implies that the observed brightness asymmetry in the pair cannot be explained by a single factor alone, but instead reflects an interplay of multiple physical parameters. Nevertheless, double radio relics tend to align with the collision axis within $\sim30^{\circ}$ and their separation ($d_{\rm drr}$) correlates tightly with the time since collision (TSC) as ${\rm TSC~[Gyr]} = 0.52 d_{\rm drr}/R_{500\rm c} - 0.24$, allowing it to be inferred with an accuracy of $\sim0.2~\rm Gyr$. With the statistical samples of simulated radio relics, we predict that low-mass clusters will constitute the dominant population of double radio relic systems detected with upcoming surveys such as SKA. These results demonstrate that double radio relics can serve as robust probes of merger dynamics and plasma acceleration, and that simulations provide critical guidance for interpreting the large samples expected from next-generation radio surveys.</description>

      <title>To Survive or to Shatter: The Impact of Cosmic Rays on the Fate of Stripped Cold Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Does cosmic ray (CR) pressure matter for the circumgalactic medium (CGM)? Despite growing interest, this remains a debated question, complicated by limited observational constraints and differing implementations of CR physics in simulations. While prior studies suggest that CRs influence the thermal and dynamical state of the CGM, their role in shaping cold gas structures remains underexplored. This paper investigates how CRs affect ram-pressure stripped cold gas clouds originating from satellite galaxies in a Milky Way-like halo. Using high-resolution simulations with varying CR energy densities, we find that CRs can significantly modify the size and survival of stripped clouds. Specifically, CR pressure puffs up the cold clouds, increasing their surface area and enabling more efficient mixing-layer cooling, allowing them to grow in mass. This enhanced growth results in higher cold gas inflow rates into the central galaxy, leading to an increase in the star formation rate compared to the no-CR case at a later time. Moreover, CRs can boost the total cold gas mass in the CGM by up to a factor of four. These effects are most pronounced in simulations where the CR energy density is in equipartition with the thermal gas. Our results demonstrate that CRs can play a critical role in regulating the cold phase of the CGM contributed by satellites and therefore their ability to feed galaxies.</description>

      <title>Connecting Chemical Enrichment with Resolved Star Formation Histories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new framework for modeling the chemical enrichment histories of galaxies by integrating the chemical evolution with resolved star formation histories (SFHs) derived from color-magnitude diagrams. This novel approach links the time evolution of the metallicity of the star-forming ISM to the cumulative stellar mass formed in the galaxy, enabling a physically motivated, self-consistent description of chemical evolution. We apply this methodology to four isolated, gas-rich Local Group dwarf galaxies -- WLM, Aquarius, Leo A, and Leo P -- using deep HST and JWST imaging. For WLM, Aquarius, and Leo A, we independently validate our metallicity evolution results using ages and metallicities of individual red giant stars with spectroscopic measurements, finding good agreement. We quantify systematic uncertainties by repeating our analysis with multiple stellar evolution and bolometric correction libraries. We then compare the observed chemical enrichment histories to predictions from the TNG50 and FIREbox cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and the Galacticus semi-analytic model. We find that the enrichment history of WLM is best reproduced by the FIREbox simulation, while TNG50 and Galacticus predict higher metallicities at early times. Our results suggest that differences in stellar feedback and metal recycling prescriptions drive significant variation in the predicted chemical enrichment of dwarf galaxies, particularly at early times. This work demonstrates the power of combining resolved SFHs with physically motivated chemical evolution models to constrain galaxy formation physics and highlights the need for further observational and theoretical studies of metal retention and recycling in low-mass dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>Illuminating gravitational wave sources with Sgr A* flares</title>

Abstract: Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, exhibits daily energetic flares characterized by non-thermal emission in the infrared and X-ray bands. While the underlying accretion flow is a Radiatively Inefficient Accretion Flow (RIAF) peaking at radio frequencies, the mechanism powering these non-thermal transients remains debated. Stellar dynamics predict a population of faint brown dwarfs orbiting Sgr A*. These objects are progenitors of Extremely Large Mass Ratio Inspirals (XMRIs), crucial sources of low-frequency gravitational waves for the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. We investigate whether the tidal stripping of brown dwarfs provides a viable fueling mechanism for the observed flares. Here we present high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of grazing tidal interactions coupled with a parameterized non-thermal radiation model. We demonstrate that the dynamics of the tidal fallback and subsequent viscous evolution naturally reproduce the fundamental temporal characteristics of observed flares: the peak luminosity and the characteristic 1-hour duration. We show that this fueling mechanism is dynamically viable and energetically consistent, placing strong constraints on the required efficiency of the non-thermal emission process, suggesting extreme radiative inefficiency. These findings provide compelling evidence for a hidden population of brown dwarfs in the Galactic Center. Crucially, the observed high flare frequency implies tight orbits characteristic of advanced inspirals. This establishes a direct link between electromagnetic transients and active gravitational wave sources, alerting the LISA consortium years in advance to the presence of specific XMRI systems promising exceptionally high signal-to-noise ratios for precision tests of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Classification of Extragalactic Transients from CRTS</title>

Abstract: The Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS) carried out a public survey for optical transients between 2007 and 2019, discovering more than 16,000 transient candidates. Here we present the spectra and highlight the results of the spectroscopic follow-up of CRTS extragalactic transients. As expected, we find that the bulk of these transients are normal supernovae. However, as we prioritised transients exhibiting unusual features or environments during our spectroscopic follow-up, we focus on the rarer types of transients. These objects include more than a dozen type-I superluminous supernovae and dozens of type-I and II supernovae that underwent circumstellar medium interactions. We highlight several specific supernovae, including a new analysis of SN 2008iy, a type-IIn which exhibited a bright pre-supernova outburst event similar to SN 2009ip and lasted more than 1800 days; CSS111225:140122+161705, a type-I supernova that showed an extreme 2.5 magnitude rebrightening event more than 200 days after its initial outburst; and SN 2009ny, a type-Ibn supernova that exhibited strong helium emission lines similar to SN 2002ao. We confirm our previous finding that numerous CRTS transients are associated with galaxies of extremely low luminosity. We discuss the difficulty in determining the origin of transients associated with outbursts in active galactic nuclei (AGN), tidal disruption events, and type-IIn supernovae. As an example, we present CSS150120:110008+385352, a CRTS transient similar to CSS100217:102913+404220 that occurred within a quiescent AGN and peaked at Mv = -23.6.</description>

      <title>The relation between the optical variability timescale, magnetic field of jets and black hole spin in active galactic nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship among the jet magnetic field, black hole spin, black hole mass, Eddington ratio, and optical variability timescales in jetted active galactic nuclei (AGNs). By fitting a damped random walk (DRW) model to the g-band light curves, we obtain the characteristic variability timescale ($\tau_{\rm DRW}$) for 41 jetted AGNs with precise supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass measurements. Our main results are as follows: (i) Our analysis reveals a significant correlation between the jet magnetic field ($B_{\rm 1pc}$), black hole spin ($j$) and the characteristic variability timescale within our sample. These findings suggest that the optical variability of jetted AGNs is influenced by the jet magnetic field and black hole spin. Furthermore, the characteristic variability timescale aligns with the electron escape timescale, as evidenced by the relationship between the characteristic variability timescale and jet magnetic field ($\tau_{\rm DRW}\propto B_{\rm 1pc}^{0.76\pm0.22}$). (ii) We confirm a significant correlation between the characteristic variability timescale and SMBH mass, expressed as: $\log \rm \tau_{\rm DRW} = 0.52(\pm0.21)\log M _{\rm BH}/M_{\rm \odot}-3.12(\pm1.90)$, with an intrinsic scatter of 0.08 dex. The slope of this relationship is consistent with that between the thermal timescale and black hole mass. Our results support the hypothesis that magnetorotational instability (MRI) fluctuations drive the intrinsic variability observed in the light curves emitted by the AGNs accretion disk.</description>

      <title>Luminosity-Dependent Assembly Bias of Central Galaxies from Weak Lensing and Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assembly bias, which is the variation in halo clustering at fixed mass driven by formation history, has long been predicted by numerical simulations but remains difficult to confirm observationally. In this work, we present one of the first direct observational tests of luminosity-dependent assembly bias using a large sample of galaxy clusters with spectroscopically confirmed brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). Combining galaxy-galaxy lensing and clustering measurements, we find evidence for assembly bias: brighter BCGs reside in more concentrated halos yet are less strongly clustered on large scales, yielding a relative bias ratio deviating from the unity at about the $3\sigma$ level. Our findings are further supported by the FLAMINGO and MillenniumTNG hydrodynamical simulations, in which we directly detect assembly bias signals consistent with the observations, thereby confirming the connection between galaxy luminosity and halo formation history.</description>

      <title>Exploring potential astrophysical applications of black holes in nonlinear electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spacetimes arising from nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) are a good laboratory for studying both the nature of regular black holes (RBH) solutions and the imprints of nonlinear electromagnetic fields within this context. Over the past few decades, NED-sourced black hole (BH) spacetimes have attracted considerable attention, but electrically charged RBHs obtained in the so-called $F$ framework have been less addressed in the literature. We consider two members of the h-family of electrically charged, fully RBHs that are solutions to general relativity minimally coupled to NED. Because of their potential astrophysical and astronomical applications, we mainly focus our investigation on the motion of photons and its implications in the shadow radius and gravitational and kinematic redshift, considering the effective geometry followed by photons in NED. For a BH charge-to-mass ratio below some moderate value, there is almost no way to distinguish these members (and likely all members) of the h-family from the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) BH. In its turn, for a BH charge-to-mass ratio above some moderate value, we observe discrepancies in their physical and geometric properties in comparison to those of the RN BH. Furthermore, we also consider observational data for Sagittarius A$^{*}$ and Messier 87$^{*}$ BHs to impose some constraints on the charge-to-mass ratio of the fully RBHs.</description>

      <title>An observational study of rotation and binarity of Galactic O-type runaway stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaia DR3 data have revealed new massive runaway stars, while spectroscopic surveys enable detailed characterization. The relative contributions of binary supernova (BSS) and dynamical ejection (DES) scenarios to explain their runaway origin remain poorly constrained, particularly in the Milky Way. We aim to characterize the largest sample of Galactic O-type runaway stars ever investigated through their kinematics, rotation, and binarity to shed light into their origins. We use the GOSC-Gaia DR3 catalog, and IACOB spectroscopic information to build a sample with 214 O-type stars with projected rotational velocities ($v \sin{i}$), and a subsample of 168 O-type stars with additional information about their likely single (LS) or single-lined (SB1) spectroscopic binary nature. We also consider an additional sample of 65 double-lined (SB2) spectroscopic binaries. We find that among our sample of Galactic O-type runaways, most (74%) have $v \sin{i}&lt;200$ km/s, whereas for normal stars this fraction is slightly higher (82%). There are no fast-moving runaways being fast rotators, except for HD 124 979. Runaways show lower SB1 fractions than normal stars, with no runaway SB1 fast-rotating systems; on average, runaways rotate faster than normal stars; and their runaway fraction is higher among fast rotators (44%) vs. the slow rotators (34%). This is consistent with BSS dominance for fast rotators. We also found that SB2 systems hardly reach runaway velocities with a low runaway fraction (10%). Runaways with 2D velocities &gt; 60 km/s are mostly single and interpreted as DES products, while runaways with 2D velocities &gt; 85 km/s are also interpreted as two-step products. Three of 12 runaway SB1 systems are HMXBs. Our study reveals that most Galactic O-type runaways are slow rotators, suggests a dominance of BSS among fast-rotating runaways, and of DES and two-step among the high-velocity ones.

      <description>arXiv:2510.21709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Little Red Dots, discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope, are hypothesized to be active galactic nuclei containing a supermassive black hole, possibly surrounded by a dense stellar cluster, large amounts of gas, and likely by a population of stellar-mass black holes. We develop a simple nuclear star cluster model to evolve the rapid mass growth of black hole seeds into the supermassive regime. The combined processes of tidal disruption events, black hole captures, and gas accretion are accounted for self-consistently in our model. Given the observed number density of Little Red Dots, and under reasonable assumptions, we predict at least a few tens of tidal disruption events and at least a few black hole captures at $z=4$-$6$, with a tidal disruption event rate an order of magnitude larger than the black hole capture rate. We also estimate the uncertainties in these estimates. Finally, we comment on the low x-ray luminosity of Little Red Dots.</description>

Abstract: JWST is discovering increasing numbers of quiescent galaxies 1--2 billion years after the Big Bang, whose redshift, high mass, and old stellar ages indicate that their formation and quenching were surprisingly rapid. This fast-paced evolution seems to require that feedback from AGN (active galactic nuclei) be faster and/or more efficient than previously expected \citep{Xie24}. We present deep ALMA observations of cold molecular gas (the fuel for star formation) in a massive, fast-rotating, post-starburst galaxy at $z=3.064$. This galaxy hosts an AGN, driving neutral-gas outflows with a mass-outflow rate of $60\pm20$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, and has a star-formation rate of $&lt;5.6$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. Our data reveal this system to be the most distant gas-poor galaxy confirmed with direct CO observations (molecular-gas mass $&lt; 10^{9.1}$ M$_{\odot}$; &lt;0.8 % of its stellar mass). Combining ALMA and JWST observations, we estimate the gas-consumption history of this galaxy, showing that it evolved with net zero gas inflow, i.e., gas consumption by star formation matches the amount of gas this galaxy is missing relative to star-forming galaxies. This could arise both from preventive feedback stopping further gas inflow, which would otherwise refuel star formation or, alternatively, from fine-tuned ejective feedback matching precisely gas inflows. Our methods, applied to a larger sample, promise to disentangle ejective vs preventive feedback.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation at $\sim10^{10}$ Solar masses, using forthcoming space-based imaging of galaxy-galaxy strong lenses</title>

Abstract: The stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) is central to understanding the co-evolution of galaxies and their host dark matter haloes, yet it remains weakly constrained for dwarf galaxies owing to their faintness, especially beyond the Local Group. Strong gravitational lensing offers a unique probe of the SHMR at sub-galactic scales and cosmological distances, as the masses of subhalos within the main lens can be inferred from the perturbations they imprint on lensed images. Anticipating the discovery of $\sim10^5$ galaxy--galaxy strong lenses by forthcoming facilities such as \textit{Euclid}, we perform an end-to-end simulation to forecast \textit{Euclid}'s constraints on the SHMR at the halo mass scale of $\sim10^{10}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. We generate mock \textit{Euclid} VIS images of lens systems hosting a fiducial $3\times10^{10}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ subhalo and vary its properties to assess the robustness of mass inference. We find that \textit{Euclid}'s angular resolution cannot break the intrinsic mass--concentration degeneracy of subhaloes, nor deblend the light of satellite galaxies (when present) associated with them, leading to biased inferred halo masses. These limitations are overcome with high-resolution follow-up imaging from facilities such as the \textit{Hubble Space Telescope}, enabling accurate halo-mass measurements. We forecast that a statistical sample of $\sim100$ such systems, combining lensing-derived halo masses with stellar masses from photometric SED fitting, can constrain the SHMR at dwarf-galaxy scales with a precision of $\sim0.05$~dex in halo mass and $\sim0.03$~dex in stellar mass, enabling powerful tests of galaxy formation theories.</description>

Abstract: We re-analysed ALMA observations of the [OIII]$\lambda$88$\mu$m emission line in JADES-GS-z14.0, so far the most distant spectroscopically confirmed galaxy at z=14.18. Our analysis shows a tentative detection of a velocity gradient of [OIII]$\lambda$88$\mu$m using three independent tests: 1) construction of moment maps; 2) extraction of integrated spectra from a grid of apertures; and 3) spectro-astrometry in both the image and uv planes. We performed kinematical fitting using the KinMS code and estimated a dynamical mass of log$_{10}$(M$_{\rm dyn}$/$\rm M_\odot$)= 9.4$^{+0.8}_{-0.4}$, with the bulk of the uncertainties due to the degeneracy between dynamical mass and inclination. We measure an upper limit on the velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{v}$) of $&lt;40~$ km/s~which results in an estimate of V$_{\rm rot}/\sigma&gt;$ 2.5. This result, if confirmed with higher-resolution observations, would imply that kinematically cold discs are already in place at $z\sim14$. Comparison with mock observations from the SERRA cosmological simulations confirms that even low-resolution observations are capable of detecting a velocity gradient in $z&gt;10$ galaxies as compact as JADES-GS-z14.0. This work shows that deeper ALMA or JWST/NIRSpec IFS observations with high spatial resolution will be able to estimate an accurate dynamical mass for JADES-GS-z14.0, providing an upper limit to the stellar mass of this over-luminous galaxy.</description>

Abstract: Investigating what drives the quenching of star formation in galaxies is key to understanding their evolution. The Euclid mission will provide rich data from optical to infrared wavelengths for millions of galaxies, and enable precise measurements of their star formation histories. Using the first Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1), we developed a probabilistic classification framework that combines the average specific star-formation rate inferred over two timescales ($10^8,10^9$ yr) to categorise galaxies as `ageing' (secularly evolving), `quenched' (recently halted star formation), or `retired' (dominated by old stars). Two classification methods were employed: a probabilistic approach, which integrates posterior distributions, and a model-driven method, which optimises sample purity and completeness using IllustrisTNG. At $z&lt;0.1$ and $M_\ast \gtrsim 3\times10^{8}\,M_\odot$, we obtain Euclid class fractions of 68-72\%, 8-17\%, and 14-19\% for ageing, quenched, and retired populations, respectively. Ageing and retired galaxies dominate at the low- and high-mass end, respectively, while quenched galaxies surpass the retired fraction for $M_\ast \lesssim 10^{10}\,\rm M_\odot$. The evolution with redshift shows increasing and decreasing fractions of ageing and retired galaxies, respectively. More massive galaxies usually undergo quenching episodes at earlier times than to their low-mass counterparts. In terms of the mass-size-metallicity relation, ageing galaxies generally exhibit disc morphologies and low metallicities. Retired galaxies show compact structures and enhanced chemical enrichment, while quenched galaxies form an intermediate population that is more compact and chemically evolved than ageing systems. This work demonstrates Euclid's great potential for elucidating the physical nature of the quenching mechanisms that govern galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>JADES: Carbon-enhanced, Nitrogen-normal compact galaxy at z=11.2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past few years \textit{JWST} has been a major workhorse in detecting and constraining the metal enrichment of the first galaxies in the early Universe and finding the source of the ionisation of their interstellar medium. In this work, we present new deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of GS-z11-1, a galaxy at z = 11.28, in which we report the detection of multiple rest-frame UV and optical emission lines: CIII]$\lambda\lambda$1907,09, CIV]$\lambda\lambda$1548,51, [OII]$\lambda\lambda$3726,29, [NeIII]$\lambda$3869, H$\gamma$ and tentative evidence for HeII$\lambda$1640. The ionisation properties of GS-z11-1 are consistent with star formation, with potential contribution from an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We estimate a galaxy stellar mass of log(M$_{*}$/M$_{\odot}$) = 7.8$\pm$0.2 and log(SFR/(M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$))= 0.32$\pm$0.11 for the fiducial SF-only models. We measured C/O from the SED modelling of C/O = 1.20$\pm0.15 \times$ solar. This is one of the highest C/O abundances at z$&gt;$10, and it is consistent with either PopII and PopIII enrichment paths. Despite this source being extremely compact, with a half-light radius of 73$\pm$10 pc, we see no increased equivalent width of NIV] and NIII] emission lines as seen in some other compact sources at similar redshifts, a potential signature of second-generation stars in GCs. Overall, this galaxy exhibits low metallicity and high ionisation parameter consistent with intense star-formation or AGN activity in the early Universe, possibly observed before the enrichment by the second generation of stars in proto-globular clusters in the core of the galaxy.</description>

      <title>A Metal-Free Galaxy at $z = 3.19$? Evidence of Late Population III Star Formation at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17820v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Star formation from metal-free gas, the hallmark of the first generation of Population III stars, was long assumed to occur only in the very early Universe. We report the discovery of MPG-CR3 (Metal-Pristine Galaxy COSMOS Redshift 3; hereafter CR3), an extremely metal-poor galaxy at redshift $z= 3.193\pm0.016$. From JWST, VLT, and Subaru observations, CR3 exhibits exceptionally strong Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$, and He I $\lambda$10830 emission. We measure rest-frame equivalent widths of EW$_0$(Ly$\alpha$) $=822\pm101$ Angstrom and EW$_0$(H$\alpha$) $=2814\pm327$ Angstrom, among the highest seen in star-forming systems. No metal lines, e.g. [O III] $\lambda\lambda4959,5007$, C IV $\lambda\lambda1548,1550$, have statistically significant detections, placing a 2-$\sigma$ upper limit on the gas-phase metallicity of 12+log(O/H) &lt; 6.52 ($Z &lt; 7\times10^{-3}\ Z_\odot$) with strong-line calibration established by JWST, making it the most metal-poor galaxy known at cosmic noon. Considering systematic uncertainties of $\gtrsim 0.3$ dex in the calibrations, the most conservative 2-$\sigma$ upper limit is set to 12+log(O/H) &lt; 6.95. The observed Ly$\alpha$/H$\alpha$ flux ratio is $13.9\pm2.5$, indicating negligible dust attenuation. Spectral energy distribution modeling with Pop III stellar templates indicates a very young ($\sim2$ Myr), low-mass ($M_* \approx 6.1\times 10^5 M_\odot$) stellar population. Further, the photometric redshifts reveal that CR3 could reside in a slightly underdense environment ($\delta \approx -0.12$). CR3 provides evidence that first-generation star formation could persist well after the epoch of reionization, challenging the conventional view that pristine star formation ended by $z\gtrsim6$.</description>

      <title>Kinematic analysis of an Ultra-Strong MgII absorber at z~1.13 linking to Circumgalactic Gas Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a spectroscopic and imaging analysis of the $z_{gal} \approx 1.1334$ ultra-strong MgII absorption system identified in the $VLT$/UVES spectrum of a background quasar located at $\rho \approx 18$ kpc from a star-forming galaxy. Low ionization metal lines like MgI, FeII, and CaII are also detected for this absorber. The HI lines are outside of the wavelength coverage. The MgII has a rest-frame equivalent width of $W_r(2796) =3.185 +/- 0.032 A^{\circ} $, with the absorption spread across $\Delta v \approx 460$ km~s$^{-1}$ in several components. A component-by-component ionization modeling shows several of these components having solar and higher metallicities. The models also predict a total HI column density of $log[N(HI)/cm^{-2}] \approx 22.5$, consistent with ultra-strong MgII absorbers being sub-Damped Lyman Alpha and Damped Lyman Alpha systems. The absorber is well within the virial radius of the nearest galaxy which has a stellar mass $M_* = 4.7 \times 10^{10}$~M$_\odot$, and a star formation rate of $\approx 8.3$~M$_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$. The absorption is along the projected major axis of the galaxy with a velocity spread that is wider than the galaxy's disk rotation. From the kinematic analysis of the absorber and the galaxy, the origin of the absorption can be attributed to a combination of circumgalactic gas structures, some corotating with the disk and the rest at line-of-sight velocities outside of the disk rotation.</description>

      <title>Linking Electron Density with Elevated Star Formation Activity from $z=0$ to $z=10$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interstellar medium (ISM) in high-redshift galaxies exhibits significantly higher electron densities ($n_{\rm e}$) than in the local universe. To investigate the origin of this trend, we analyze a sample of 9590 centrally star-forming galaxies with stellar masses greater than $10^9\,M_\odot$ at redshifts $0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.04$, selected from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1. We derive electron densities from the [S II] $\lambda\lambda6716,6731$ doublet, measuring values of $n_{\rm e} = 30$-$400~{\rm cm^{-3}}$ at $z \approx 0$. We find a tight correlation between $n_{\rm e}$ and the star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$), which is well described by a broken power law. Above a threshold of $\log(\Sigma_{\rm SFR} / M_\odot\,{\rm yr^{-1}\,kpc^{-2}}) \ge -1.46$, the relation follows $n_{\rm e} = (233 \pm 13)\,\Sigma_{\rm SFR}^{0.49 \pm 0.02}$. Below this threshold, $n_{\rm e}$ remains approximately constant at $44 \pm 3~{\rm cm^{-3}}$. Remarkably, this relation remains consistent with measurements of galaxies at $z = 0.9$-$10.2$. By converting the observed redshift evolution of $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ into $n_{\rm e}$ evolution through our $n_{\rm e}$-$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ relation, we obtain $n_{\rm e} = 40(1+z)^{1.4}~{\rm cm^{-3}}$, consistent with previous direct observations. The $n_{\rm e}$-$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ relation likely arises because the high $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, fueled by dense cold gas or elevated efficiency, enhances radiative and mechanical feedback and produces dense ionized gas whose electron densities are further regulated by ambient pressure. We conclude that the redshift evolution of $n_{\rm e}$ primarily reflects the evolution of cold gas density and star formation activity over cosmic time.</description>

      <title>The effect of triaxiality on the dynamics of triple supermassive black holes in a cosmological context</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hierarchical nature of galaxy formation in the $\Lambda$CDM framework often leads to multiple supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the galactic nuclei. The timescale over which galaxies merge, plays a crucial role in shaping the dynamical evolution and the merger dynamics of their central SMBHs. While binary SMBH evolution is well studied, the long-term dynamics of triple SMBH systems, particularly in non-spherical potentials, remain less understood. We investigate the role of triaxiality in the evolution and dynamics of triple SMBHs with initial conditions drawn from the ROMULUS25 cosmological simulation, using high-resolution gravitodynamical N-body simulations. We explore different orbital configurations and host shapes, tracking the evolution from galactic inspiral to hard binary formation at sub-parsec scales. In all cases, the two most massive SMBHs form a rapidly hardening binary that coalesces within a fraction of a Hubble time, while the third forms a stable hierarchical triple system with the heavier binary, or remains on a wide orbit.</description>

      <title>Accurately simulating core-collapse self-interacting dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06269v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The properties of satellite halos provide a promising probe for dark matter (DM) physics. Observations have motivated current efforts to explain surprisingly compact DM halos. If DM is not collisionless, but has strong self-interactions, halos can undergo gravothermal collapse, leading to higher densities in the central region of the halo. However, it is challenging to model this collapse phase from first principles. To improve on this, we sought to better understand the numerical challenges and convergence properties of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) N-body simulations in the collapse phase. Especially, our aim was to better understand the evolution of satellite halos. To do so, we ran SIDM N-body simulations of a low-mass halo in isolation and within an external gravitational potential. The simulation set-up was motivated by the perturber of the stellar stream GD-1. We find that the halo evolution is very sensitive to energy conservation errors, and a SIDM kernel size that is too large can artificially speed up the collapse. Moreover, we demonstrate that the King model can describe the density profile at small radii for the late stages that we have simulated. Furthermore, for our most highly resolved simulation (N = 5x10^7) we have made the data public. It can serve as a benchmark. Overall, we find that the current numerical methods do not suffer from convergence problems in the late collapse phase and provide guidance on how to choose numerical parameters, for example that the energy conservation error is better kept well below 1%. This allows simulations to be run of halos that become concentrated enough to explain observations of GD-1-like stellar streams or strong gravitational lensing systems.</description>

      <title>Predictions of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Galactic Exoplanet Survey. IV. Lens Mass and Distance Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As part of the Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS), the Nancy Grace Roman Galactic Exoplanet Survey (RGES) will use microlensing to discover cold outer planets and free-floating planets unbound to stars. NASA has established several science requirements for the GBTDS to ensure RGES success. A key advantage of RGES is Roman's high angular resolution, which will allow detection of flux from many host stars. One requirement specifies that Roman must measure the masses and distances of 40% of detected planet hosts with 20% precision or better. To test this, we simulated microlensing events toward the GBTDS fields and used Fisher matrix analysis to estimate light curve parameter uncertainties. Combining these with Roman imaging observables (lens flux, relative lens-source proper motion), we estimated the achievable precision of lens mass and distance measurements. Using pyLIMASS, a publicly available code for estimating lens properties, we applied this analysis to 3,000 simulated events. Assuming the Cassan et al. (2012) exoplanet mass function, we find that &gt;40% of host stars meet the required 20% precision threshold, confirming that the GBTDS can satisfy the mission requirement. We validated our approach by comparing our inferred lens masses and distances to empirical measurements from detailed image-constrained light curve modeling of historical microlensing events with Hubble and Keck follow-up imaging. Our results agree within roughly 1 sigma, demonstrating that both approaches yield consistent and reliable mass and distance estimates, and confirming the robustness of our simulations for Roman-era microlensing science.</description>
