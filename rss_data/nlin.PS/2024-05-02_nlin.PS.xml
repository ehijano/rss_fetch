      <title>Evidence of 1+1D photorefractive stripe solitons deep in the Kerr limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kerr nonlinearity allows for exact analytic soliton solutions in 1+1D. While nothing excludes that these solitons form in naturally-occurring real-world 3D settings as solitary walls or stripes, their observation has previously been considered unfeasible because of the strong transverse instability intrinsic to the extended nonlinear perturbation. We report the observation of solitons that are fully compatible with the 1+1D Kerr paradigm limit hosted in a 2+1D system. The waves are stripe spatial solitons in bulk copper doped potassium-lithium-tantalate-niobate (KLTN) supported by the unsaturated photorefractive screening nonlinearity. The parameters of the stripe solitons fit well, in the whole existence domain, with the 1+1D existence curve that we derive for the first time in closed form starting from the saturable model of propagation. Transverse instability, that accompanies the solitons embedded in the 3D system, is found to have a gain length much longer than the crystal. Findings establish our system as a versatile platform for investigating exact soliton solutions in bulk settings and in exploring the role of dimensionality at the transition from integrable to non-integrable regimes of propagation.</description>

      <title>Remote Nucleation and Stationary Domain Walls via Transition Waves in Tristable Magnetoelastic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a tunable magnetoelastic lattice with a multistable onsite potential, focusing on a tristable potential. Through experimental and numerical analysis, we verify the existence of three types of transition waves with distinct amplitudes and velocities. Additionally, we establish the presence of a scaling law that elucidates various characteristics of these transition waves. By manipulating the onsite potential, we investigate the collision dynamics of two transition waves within the system. In chains featuring an asymmetric potential well, the collision of similar transition waves leads to the remote nucleation of a new phase. In chains with a symmetric potential well, the collision of dissimilar transition waves results in the formation of a stationary domain wall</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity on Mars: Pebbles scattered on sand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Gale Crater near Mars' equator, dunes and ripples of sand stand out from the general orderless, rocky terrain. In addition, images from Curiosity, the Mars Science Laboratory rover, reveal more subtle orderly forms: widespread, meter-scale domains of evenly spaced, pebble-size rocks (termed clasts) on wind-blown sand in scattered locations. Here, we examine quantitatively several clast domains on both Mars and Earth, and compare their geometry with that of random points. The clast distributions are more orderly than expected by chance; they differ significantlty from those associated with uniform (Poisson) random processes. Moreover, they are hyperuniform, a self-organized state recently recognized in diverse active materials and biological systems but that appears novel for planetary surfaces. These patches are often surrounded by recent wind-borne ripples, suggesting an interplay between sand transport, ripple activity and clasts. Using numerical simulations, we show that clast displacements induced by gravity, combined with the evolution of the sand surface caused by aeolian sand transport and ripple migration, can produce realistic hyperuniform and random clast distributions, as well as distinct clast alignements. Our findings highlight the existence of easily overlooked disordered hyperuniform states on ground surfaces, suggesting novel self-organized states beyond distinct geometric patterns.</description>
