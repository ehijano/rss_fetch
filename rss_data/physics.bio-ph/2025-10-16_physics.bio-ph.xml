      <title>Agency cannot be a purely quantum phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What are the physical requirements for agency? We investigate whether a purely quantum system (one evolving unitarily in a coherent regime without decoherence or collapse) can satisfy three minimal conditions for agency: an agent must be able to create a world-model, use it to evaluate the likely consequences of alternative actions, and reliably perform the action that maximizes expected utility. We show that the first two conditions conflict with the no-cloning theorem, which forbids copying unknown quantum states: world-model construction requires copying information from the environment, and deliberation requires copying the world-model to assess multiple actions. Approximate cloning strategies do not permit sufficient fidelity or generality for agency to be viable in purely quantum systems. The third agency condition also fails due to the linearity of quantum dynamics. These results imply four key consequences. First, agency requires significant classical resources, placing clear constraints on its physical basis. Second, they provide insight into how classical agents emerge within a quantum universe. Third, they show that quantum computers cannot straightforwardly simulate agential behavior without significant classical components. Finally, they challenge quantum theories of agency, free will, and consciousness.</description>

      <title>Physical models of embryonic epithelial healing: A review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embryonic healing in epithelial tissues is distinct from adult wound healing, as it lacks inflammatory responses or immune cell recruitments, making it ideal to test models of wound healing driven primarily by epithelial dynamics. Many models have been developed to describe this process, ranging from simple mechanistic models to more elaborate multiscale simulations. We review different classes of physical models, from discrete to continuum models, and how they address key questions about the mechanics, signaling, and coordination of cells during wound closure. We highlight tensions between model complexity and interpretability and discuss recent efforts to bridge gaps across scales. Finally, we identify directions for hybrid modeling and model-experiment integration that could push forward our understanding of epithelial repair in development and disease.</description>

      <title>Predicting Resistive Pulse Signatures in Nanopores by Accurately Modeling Access Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resistive pulse sensing is used to characterize and count single particles in solution moving through channels under an electric bias, with nanoscale pores providing enough spatial resolution for single-molecule identification and sequencing. This technique relies on measuring the ionic current drop produced by the passage of a molecule and, through conductance models, translating the blockage signal into molecular dimensions. However, no generalized model exists that considers the resistive contributions of the pore exterior, i.e. the access regions, when obstructed by a molecule. This is becoming increasingly important with the advent of 2D materials and ultrathin membranes featuring low aspect ratio pores. In this work, a general method by which to model the resistance of access regions in the presence of an insulating obstruction is presented. Thin oblate spheroidal slices are used to partition access regions and infer their conductance when blocked by differently shaped objects. We show that our model accurately estimates the blocked-state conductance of 2D and finite-length pores in the presence of simple or complex structures positioned at varying distances from the pore opening. The model is shown to capture off-axis effects by predicting deeper blockages for obstructions offset from the pore's central axis. A model-based web app was created to predict the electrical signatures of a wide range of molecule geometries translocating through differently shaped pores. The introduced model and accompanying tool will help guide future experimental designs and thus present a straightforward way to extend the quantification of the resistive pulse technique at the nanoscale.</description>
