      <title>Counting Colored Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the enumeration of plane trees (rooted ordered trees) whose vertices are colored according to a specific coloring rule that prescribes which possible pairs of colors can occur as the colors of a parent vertex and its child. This general construction covers many different examples that have been studied in the literature. Some general necessary and sufficient conditions for two different coloring rules to result in the same counting sequence are established. We also provide exhaustive lists of counting sequences arising from coloring rules with two or three colors, and we find formulas and closed form expressions for many of these sequences. The famous Fibonacci, Catalan, Narayana, and Schr\"oder sequences appear in several cases. Some of these coloring rules are extended to families of coloring rules with arbitrarily many colors.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Skew-Hadamard Matrix of Order 1252 via Cyclotomic Unions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a skew-Hadamard matrix of order 1252 = 2(5^4 + 1) using a bordered skew-Hadamard difference family over GF(5^4), with blocks given as unions of cyclotomic classes of order N = 16. This order has been reported as missing in some widely used open-source computational tables; we provide an explicit instance together with verification artifacts. We prove the structural prerequisites for the bordered construction (skew-symmetry of one block and the constant autocorrelation-sum condition), and we compute algebraic invariants to facilitate classification: the associated tournament adjacency matrix has full rank over GF(2), and the matrix has full rank over GF(3) and GF(5). We also exhibit an explicit affine subgroup of the automorphism group of size 24 375. All claims are supported by a reproducible artifact bundle including the explicit matrix and verification logs.</description>

      <title>On the discrete Heine-Shephard problem for four lattice polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the set of square-free parts of volume polynomials associated with four planar lattice polytopes. This is motivated by the problem of describing possible pairwise intersection numbers of four curves in $(\mathbb{C}^*)^2$ with prescribed Newton polytopes and generic coefficients. It is known that for arbitrary convex bodies in $\mathbb{R}^2$, the corresponding square-free polynomials are characterized by the Pl\"ucker-type inequalities. We show that this characterization fails in the lattice setting: the interior of the space defined by the Pl\"ucker-type inequalities contains integer polynomials that are and are not realizable by lattice polytopes. This phenomenon arises from additional arithmetic constraints on the mixed areas of lattice polytopes. These constraints become apparent when we study a "discrete diagram", which maps a pair of planar lattice polytopes to their mixed area together with their lattice widths in a given direction.</description>

      <title>Godel Implication on Finite Chains: Truth Tables and Catalan-Bracketing Enumerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully bracketed implication terms on $n$ variables are evaluated in G\"odel $m$-valued logic on a finite chain, and we enumerate truth-table rows by output value across all Catalan bracketings. Using the Catalan decomposition, we derive a finite system of generating functions for these value counts and introduce a root-split refinement that records the ordered pair of truth values at the top implication, yielding $m^2$ pair classes. We prove that the associated generating functions share a common dominant square-root singularity, which implies a universal $n^{-3/2}$ asymptotic form with exponential growth rate $(4m)^n$ and a limiting output distribution as $n\to\infty$. The root-split refinement yields matching uniform asymptotics for the pair classes and gives a transparent factorization of the original counts.</description>

      <title>The Smallest String Attractors of Fibonacci and Period-Doubling Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A string attractor of a string $T[1..|T|]$ is a set of positions $\Gamma$ of $T$ such that any substring $w$ of $T$ has an occurrence that crosses a position in $\Gamma$, i.e., there is a position $i$ such that $w = T[i..i+|w|-1]$ and the intersection $[i,i+|w|-1]\cap \Gamma$ is nonempty. The size of the smallest string attractor of Fibonacci words is known to be $2$. We completely characterize the set of all smallest string attractors of Fibonacci words, and show a recursive formula describing the $2^{n-4} + 2^{\lceil n/2 \rceil - 2}$ distinct position pairs that are the smallest string attractors of the $n$th Fibonacci word for $n \geq 7$. Similarly, the size of the smallest string attractor of period-doubling words is known to be $2$. We also completely characterize the set of all smallest string attractors of period-doubling words, and show a formula describing the two distinct position pairs that are the smallest string attractors of the $n$th period-doubling word for $n\geq 2$. Our results show that strings with the same smallest attractor size can have a drastically different number of distinct smallest attractors.</description>

      <title>Nordhaus-Gaddum inequalities for the number of 1-nearly independent vertex subsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, a vertex subset is called \emph{$1$-nearly independent} if the subgraph it induces contains exactly one edge. Let $\sigma_1(G)$ denote the number of such subsets in $G$. In this paper, we study Nordhaus-Gaddum type inequalities for $\sigma_1$, that is, bounds on the sum $\sigma_1(G)+\sigma_1(\overline{G})$, where $\overline{G}$ denotes the complement of $G$.
  We establish that, for any $n$-vertex graph $G$, we have $\sigma_1(G)+\sigma_1(\overline{G})\geq n(n-1)/2,$ with equality if and only if $G$ is either complete or edgeless. We further obtain that among all trees of order $n$, the star $K_{1,n-1}$ uniquely minimises $\sigma_1(T)+\sigma_1(\overline{T})$. Finally, we prove that for all graphs of order $n \ge 6$, \[ \sigma_1(G)+\sigma_1(\overline{G}) \le \frac{27}{64}\,2^{n} + \frac{1}{2}(n+2)(n-3), \] with equality if and only if $G$ or $\overline{G}$ is isomorphic to $3K_2 \cup \overline{K_{n-6}}$.</description>

      <title>Randomized Zero Forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce randomized zero forcing (RZF), a stochastic color-change process on directed graphs in which a white vertex turns blue with probability equal to the fraction of its incoming neighbors that are blue. Unlike probabilistic zero forcing, RZF is governed by in-neighborhood structure and can fail to propagate globally due to directionality. The model extends naturally to weighted directed graphs by replacing neighbor counts with incoming weight proportions. We study the expected propagation time of RZF, establishing monotonicity properties with respect to enlarging the initial blue set and increasing weights on edges out of initially blue vertices, as well as invariances that relate weighted and unweighted dynamics. Exact values and sharp asymptotics are obtained for several families of directed graphs, including arborescences, stars, paths, cycles, and spiders, and we derive tight extremal bounds for unweighted directed graphs in terms of basic parameters such as order, degree, and radius. We conclude with an application to an empirical input-output network, illustrating how expected propagation time under RZF yields a dynamic, process-based notion of centrality in directed weighted systems.</description>

      <title>One-factorizations of complete multipartite graphs with distance constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper considers multipartite graphs from the perspective of design theory and coding theory. A one-factor $F$ of the complete multipartite graph $K_{n\times g}$ (with $n$ parts of size $g$) gives rise to a $(g+1)$-ary code ${\cal C}$ of length $n$ and constant weight two. Furthermore, if the one-factor $F$ meets a certain constraint, then ${\cal C}$ becomes an optimal code with minimum distance three. We initiate the study of one-factorizations of complete multipartite graphs subject to distance constraints. The problem of decomposing $K_{n\times g}$ into the largest subgraphs with minimum distance three is investigated. It is proved that, for $n\le g$, the complete multipartite graph $K_{n\times g}$ can be decomposed into $g^2$ copies of the largest subgraphs with minimum distance three. For even $gn$ with $n&gt;g$, it is proved that the complete multipartite graph $K_{n\times g}$ can be decomposed into $g(n-1)$ one-factors with minimum distance three, leaving a small gap of $n$ (in terms of $g$) to be resolved (If $gn$ is odd when $n&gt;g$, no such decomposition of $K_{n\times g}$ exists).</description>

      <title>Long cycles in vertex transitive digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most well-known conjectures concerning Hamiltonicity in graphs asserts that any sufficiently large connected vertex transitive graph contains a Hamilton cycle. In this form, it was first written down by Thomassen in 1978, inspired by a closely related conjecture due to Lov\'asz from 1969. It has been attributed to several other authors in a survey on the topic by Witte and Gallian in 1984.
  The analogous question for vertex transitive digraphs has an even longer history, having been first considered by Rankin in 1946. It is arguably more natural from the group-theoretic perspective underlying this problem in both settings. Trotter and Erd\H{o}s proved in 1978 that there are infinitely many connected vertex transitive digraphs which are not Hamiltonian. This left open the very natural question of how long a directed cycle one can guarantee in a connected vertex transitive digraph on $n$ vertices.
  In 1981, Alspach asked if the maximum perimeter gap (the gap between the circumference and the order of the digraph) is a growing function in $n$. We answer this question in the affirmative, showing that it grows at least as fast as $(1-o(1)) \ln n$. On the other hand, we prove that one can always find a directed cycle of length at least $\Omega(n^{1/3})$, establishing the first lower bound growing with $n$, providing a directed analogue of a famous result of Babai from 1979 in the undirected setting.</description>

      <title>A New Lower Bound for the Diagonal Poset Ramsey Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two finite posets $\mathcal P$ and $\mathcal Q$, their Ramsey number, denoted by $R(\mathcal P,\mathcal Q)$, is defined to be the smallest integer $N$ such that any blue/red colouring of the vertices of the hypercube $Q_N$ has either a blue induced copy of $\mathcal P$, or a red induced copy of $\mathcal Q$.
  Axenovich and Walzer showed that, for fixed $\mathcal P$, $R(\mathcal P, Q_n)$ grows linearly with $n$. However, for the diagonal question, we do not even come close to knowing the order of growth of $R(Q_n,Q_n)$. The current upper bound is $R(Q_n,Q_n)\leq n^2-(1-o(1))n\log n$, due to Axenovich and Winter.
  What about lower bounds? It is trivial to see that $2n\leq R(Q_n,Q_n)$, but surprisingly, even an incremental improvement required significant work. Recently, an elegant probabilistic argument of Winter gave that, for large enough $n$, $R(Q_n,Q_n)\geq 2.02n$.
  In this paper we show that $R(Q_n,Q_n)\geq 2.7n+k$, where $k$ is a constant. Our current techniques might in principle show that in fact, for every $\epsilon&gt;0$, for large enough $n$, $R(Q_n,Q_n)\geq (3-\epsilon)n$. Our methods exploit careful modifications of layered-colourings, for a large number of layers. These modifications are stronger than previous arguments as they are more constructive, rather than purely probabilistic.</description>

      <title>Comparability of random permutations in the strong Bruhat order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The (strong) Bruhat order for permutations provides a partial ordering defined as follows: two permutations are comparable if one can be obtained from the other by a sequence of adjacent transpositions that each increase the number of inversions by $1$. Given two random permutations, what is the probability that they are comparable in the Bruhat order? This problem was first considered in a 2006 work of Hammett and Pittel, which showed an exponential lower bound and a polynomial upper bound. The lower bound was very recently improved to the subexponential bound of $\exp(-n^{1/2 + o(1)})$ by Boretsky, Cornejo, Hodges, Horn, Lesnevich, and McAllister. Hammett and Pittel predicted that the probability should decrease polynomially. We show that the probability decreases faster than any polynomial and is on the order of $\exp(-\Theta(\log^2 n))$.</description>

      <title>Disjoint Correspondence Colorings for $K_5$-Minor-free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thomassen famously proved that every planar graph is 5-choosable. We explore variants of this result, focusing on finding disjoint correspondence colorings, in the more general class of $K_5$-minor-free graphs. Correspondence colorings generalize list colorings as follows. Given a graph $G$ and a positive integer $t$, a correspondence $t$-cover $\textbf{M}$ assigns to each $v\in V(G)$ a set of allowable colors $\{1_v,\ldots,t_v\}$ and to each edge $vw\in E(G)$ a matching between $\{1_v,\ldots,t_v\}$ and $\{1_w,\ldots,t_w\}$. An $\textbf{M}$-coloring $\varphi$ picks for each vertex $v$ a color $\varphi(v)$ (from the set $\{1_v,\ldots,t_v\}$) such that for each edge $vw\in E(G)$ the colors $\varphi(v),\varphi(w)$ are not matched to each other. Two $\textbf{M}$-colorings $\varphi_1,\varphi_2$ of $G$ are called disjoint if $\varphi_1(v)\ne\varphi_2(v)$ for all $v\in V(G)$. For every $K_5$-minor-free graph $G$ and every correspondence 6-cover $\textbf{M}$ of $G$, we construct 3 pairwise disjoint $\textbf{M}$-colorings $\varphi_1,\varphi_2,\varphi_3$. In contrast, we provide examples of $K_5$-minor-free graphs and correspondence 5-covers $\textbf{M}$ that do not admit 3 disjoint $\textbf{M}$-colorings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the binomial sum $S_{n}(q):=% \overset{n}{\underset{k=0}{\sum }}a_{k}\binom{n}{k}\left( 1-q\right) ^{k}q^{n-k}$ for a given sequence $\left( a_{n}\right) $ of real or complex numbers. We express $S_{n}(q)$ in function of the powers of $q,$ and, we explicit it when the sequence $\left( a_{n}\right) $ is the sequence of Fibonacci numbers, Laguerre Polynomials, Meixner Polynomials, binomial coefficients and the sequence $\left[ n\right] _{p}.$ We establish later some properties, relations, probabilistic interpretations and generating functions between $S_{n}(q)$ and $S_{n}(x+q-xq).$ Further identities related to Appell polynomials are also given in the last of the paper.</description>

      <title>On Toric Ideals Arising from the Chip-Firing Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study certain groups and ideals arising from the chip-firing game on a generalisation of graphs called pargraphs. Several well-known families of toric ideals, including those defining rational normal curves and binomial edge ideals of complete graphs, arise as toppling ideals of pargraphs. We provide sufficient conditions under which the toppling ideal of a pargraph to be toric. In addition, we construct a Gr\"obner basis for the toppling ideal, a minimal cellular free resolution for a distinguished initial ideal known as the $G$-parking function ideal, and establish Cohen-Macaulay property for these ideals. We also study the Picard group of a pargraph and provide sufficient conditions ensuring its freeness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study $6$-dimensional GKM manifolds with $4$ fixed points. We classify all possible GKM graphs, and for each type of graph we construct a manifold, proving the existence. We show that six types occur.
  (P1) complex projective space $\mathbb{C} P^3$ with standard complex structure
  (P2) blow up of $S^6$ at a fixed point, diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{C} P^3$
  (P3) $\mathbb{C} P^3$ as the homogeneous space $\mathrm{Sp}(2)/(\mathrm{U}(1) \times \mathrm{Sp}(1))$ with non-standard almost complex structure
  (Q1) complex quadric $Q_3$ with standard complex structure
  (Q2) blow up of $S^6$ along isotropy $2$-sphere, diffeomorphic to $Q_3$
  (S) $S^2 \times S^4$, obtained as equivariant gluing along orbits of two $S^6$'s</description>

      <title>On generating functions and automata associated to reflections in Coxeter systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study two combinatorial problems concerning the set of reflections of a Coxeter system. The first problem asks whether the language of palindromic reduced words for reflections is regular, and the second is about finding formulas for the Poincar\'e series of reflections, namely the generating function of reflection lengths. These two problems were inspired by a conjecture of Stembridge stating that the Poincar\'e series of reflections is rational and by the solution provided by de Man.
  To address the first problem, we introduce reflection-prefixes, arising naturally from palindromic reduced words. We study their connections with the root poset, dominance order on roots, and dihedral reflection subgroups. Using $m$-canonical automata associated with $m$-Shi arrangements, we prove that the language of reduced words for reflection-prefixes is regular. For the second problem, we focus on affine Coxeter groups. In this case, we derive a simple formula for the Poincar\'e series using symmetries of the Hasse diagram of the root poset.</description>

      <title>Positive Charts of Toric Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct affine charts of a smooth projective toric variety which contain its nonnegative points, and which admit a closed embedding into the total coordinate space of Cox's quotient construction. We show that such positive charts arise from smooth subcones of the nef cone. To each positive chart we associate an algebraic moment map, the fibers of which are the critical points of a monomial function in Cox coordinates. This work provides a toric framework for the theory of $u$-equations in positive geometry.</description>

      <title>Remarks on the inverse Littlewood conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Littlewood conjecture, proven by Konyagin and McGehee-Pigno-Smith in the 1980s, states that if $A\subset \mathbb{Z}$ is a finite set of integers with $\lvert A\rvert=N$ then $\| \widehat{1_A}\|_1\geq c\log N$ for some absolute constant $c &gt; 0$. We explore what structure $A$ must have if $\| \widehat{1_A}\|_1\leq K\log N$ for some constant $K$. Under such an assumption we prove, for instance, that $A$ contains a subset $A'\subseteq A$ with $\lvert A\rvert \geq N^{0.99}$ such that $\lvert A'+A'\rvert \ll K^{O(1)}\lvert A'\rvert$. As a consequence, for any $k\geq 3$, if $N$ is sufficiently large depending on $k$ and $K$, then $A$ must contain an arithmetic progression of length $k$. A byproduct of our analysis is a (slightly) improved bound for the constant $c$.</description>

      <title>Anticoncentration of Random Sums in $\mathbb{Z}_p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the probability distribution of the sum $Y$ of $\ell$ independent identically distributed random variables taking values in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Our main focus is the regime of small values of $\ell$, which is less explored compared to the asymptotic case $\ell \to \infty$.
  Starting with the case $\ell=3$, we prove that if the distributions of the $Y_i$ are uniformly bounded by $\lambda &lt; 1$ and $p &gt; 2/\lambda$, then there exists a constant $C_{3,\lambda} &lt; 1$ such that \[ \max_{x \in \mathbb{Z}_p} \mathbb{P}[Y = x] \leq C_{3,\lambda}\lambda. \] Moreover, when the distributions are uniformly separated from $1$, the constant $C_{3,\lambda}$ can be made explicit. By iterating this argument, we obtain effective anticoncentration bounds for larger values of $\ell$, yielding nontrivial estimates already in small and moderate regimes where asymptotic results do not apply.</description>

      <title>Fast Shortest Path in Graphs With Sparse Signed Tree Models and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A signed tree model of a graph $G$ is a compact binary structure consisting of a rooted binary tree whose leaves are bijectively mapped to the vertices of $G$, together with 2-colored edges $xy$, called transversal pairs, interpreted as bicliques or anti-bicliques whose sides are the leaves of the subtrees rooted at $x$ and at $y$. We design an algorithm that, given such a representation of an $n$-vertex graph $G$ with $p$ transversal pairs and a source $v \in V(G)$, computes a shortest-path tree rooted at $v$ in $G$ in time $O(p \log n)$. A wide variety of graph classes are such that for all $n$, their $n$-vertex graphs admit signed tree models with $O(n)$ transversal pairs: for instance, those of bounded symmetric difference, more generally of bounded sd-degeneracy, as well as interval graphs.
  As applications of our Single-Source Shortest Path algorithm and new techniques, we
  - improve the runtime of the fixed-parameter algorithm for first-order model checking on graphs given with a witness of low merge-width from cubic [Dreier and Toru\'nczyk, STOC '25] to quadratic;
  - give an $O(n^2 \log n)$-time algorithm for All-Pairs Shortest Path (APSP) on graphs given with a witness of low merge-width, generalizing a result known on twin-width [Twin-Width III, SICOMP '24];
  - extend and simplify an $O(n^2 \log n)$-time algorithm for multiplying two $n \times n$ matrices $A, B$ of bounded twin-width in [Twin-Width V, STACS '23]: now $A$ solely has to be an adjacency matrix of a graph of bounded twin-width and $B$ can be arbitrary;
  - give an $O(n^2 \log^2 n)$-time algorithm for APSP on graphs of bounded twin-width, bypassing the need for contraction sequences in [Twin-Width III, SICOMP '24; Bannach et al. STACS '24];
  - give an $O(n^{7/3} \log^2 n)$-time algorithm for APSP on graphs of symmetric difference $O(n^{1/3})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.12046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find an explicit $S_n$-equivariant bijection between the integral points in a certain zonotope in $\mathbb{R}^n$, combinatorially equivalent to the permutahedron, and the set of $m$-parking functions of length $n$. This bijection restricts to a bijection between the regular $S_n$-orbits and $(m,n)$-Dyck paths, the number of which is given by the Fuss-Catalan number $A_{n}(m,1)$. Our motivation came from studying tilting bundles on noncommutative Hilbert schemes. As a side result we use these tilting bundles to construct a semi-orthogonal decomposition of the derived category of noncommutative Hilbert schemes.</description>

Abstract: We study sets whose combinatorics are related to the combinatorics of posets.
  The language of operads provides us with tools to better understand the combinatorics of these objects. In this note we describe a non-trivial example of a suboperad, called the Wix\'arika posets, together with its associated algebras. This example is rich enough to showcase the particularities of the field, without delving into technicalities.</description>

      <title>Edge-disjoint linkage in infinite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1980, Thomassen stated his weak linkage conjecture: for an odd positive integer k, if a graph G is k-edge-connected, then, for any collection of k pairs of vertices {s_1,t_1}, ..., {s_k,t_k} in G, not necessarily distinct, there are pairwise edge-disjoint paths P_1,...,P_k in G, with P_i joining s_i and t_i. In 1991, Huck proved that the conclusion holds if G is finite and (k+1)-edge-connected. We prove that Huck's theorem holds also for all infinite graphs, extending and improving a result of Ok, Richter and Thomassen for 1-ended, locally finite graphs.
  A novel key tool in the proof is the Linking Fan Proposition proved in Section 3. To show the potential and usefulness of this proposition in other contexts, we apply it in the last section to prove a new result, similar to a result of Thomassen, on the existence of 2k-edge-connected finite immersions in (2k+1)-edge-connected infinite graphs. We then use this to prove that an edge-connectivity of 2k+1 is sufficient for infinite graphs to admit a k-arc-connected orientation. This is only within 1 of the longstanding conjecture of Nash-Williams from 1960 that an edge-connectivity of 2k should be enough.</description>

      <title>Paired 2-disjoint path covers of Bcube under the partitioned edge fault model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: BCube, as a popular server-centric data center network (DCN), offers significant advantages in low latency, load balancing, and high bandwidth. The many-to-many paired $m$-disjoint path cover ($m$-DPC), a generalization of Hamiltonian paths, enhances message transmission efficiency by constructing disjoint paths that connect $m$ source-destination pairs while covering all the nodes. However, with the continuous expansion of DCNs, link and service failures have grown increasingly common, necessitating robust fault-tolerant algorithms to guarantee reliable communication.This paper mainly investigates the fault-tolerant paired 2-DPC embedding in BCube. We prove that under the partitioned edge fault (PEF) model, BCube retains a paired 2-DPC even when exponentially many edge failures occur.</description>

Abstract: In 1934 L. R\'edei published his famous theorem that the number of Hamiltonian paths in a tournament is odd. In fact it is a corollary of a stronger theorem in his paper. Stronger theorems were also obtained in the early 1970s by G.A. Dirac in his lectures at Aarhus University and by C. Berge in his monographs on graphs and hypergraphs. We exhibit the stronger theorems of R\'edei, Dirac and Berge and explain connections between them. The stronger theorem of Dirac has two corollaries, one equivalent to R\'edei's stronger theorem and the other related to Berge's stronger theorem.</description>

Abstract: For fixed positive integers $n,m$, let $\mathrm{Mat}_{n\times m}(\mathbb{C})$ be the affine space consisting of all $n\times m$ complex matrices, and let $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n\times m}]$ be its coordinate ring. For $0\le r\le\min\{m,n\}$, we apply the orbit harmonics method to the finite matrix loci $\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r}$ of rook placements with exactly $r$ rooks, yielding a graded $\mathfrak{S}_n\times\mathfrak{S}_m$-module $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$. We find one signed and two sign-free graded character formulae for $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$. We also exhibit some applications of these formulae, such as proving a concise presentation of $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$, and proving some module injections and isomorphisms. Some of our techniques are still valid for involution matrix loci.</description>

Abstract: We study the probabilistic existence of point configurations satisfying the $(0, m, d)$-net property in base $b$ within a randomly generated point set of size $N$ in the $d$-dimensional unit cube. We first derive an upper bound on the number of geometric patterns for $(0, m, d)$-nets in base $b$. By applying the elementary probability bounds together with this counting result, we then give scaling conditions on $N$ as a function of $m$ such that this probability converges to $1$ and $0$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Columnar order in random packings of $2\times2$ squares on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.01276v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study random packings of $2\times2$ squares with centers on the square lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$, in which the probability of a packing is proportional to $\lambda$ to the number of squares. We prove that for large $\lambda$, typical packings exhibit columnar order, in which either the centers of most tiles agree on the parity of their $x$-coordinate or the centers of most tiles agree on the parity of their $y$-coordinate. This manifests in the existence of four extremal and periodic Gibbs measures in which the rotational symmetry of the lattice is broken while the translational symmetry is only broken along a single axis. We further quantify the decay of correlations in these measures, obtaining a slow rate of exponential decay in the direction of preserved translational symmetry and a fast rate in the direction of broken translational symmetry. Lastly, we prove that every periodic Gibbs measure is a mixture of these four measures.
  Additionally, our proof introduces an apparently novel extension of the chessboard estimate, from finite-volume torus measures to all infinite-volume periodic Gibbs measures.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Codes: Self-Correction from Small(er)-Set Expansion with Tunable Non-locality</title>

Abstract: Optimal constructions of classical LDPC codes can be obtained by choosing the Tanner graph uniformly at random among biregular graphs. We introduce a class of codes that we call ``diffusion codes'', defined by placing each edge connecting bits and checks on some graph, and acting on that graph with a random SWAP network. By tuning the depth of the SWAP network, we can tune a tradeoff between the amount of randomness -- and hence the optimality of code parameters -- and locality with respect to the underlying graph. For diffusion codes defined on the cycle graph, if the SWAP network has depth $\sim Tn$ with $T&gt; n^{2\beta}$ for arbitrary $\beta&gt;0$, then we prove that almost surely the Tanner graph is a lossless ``smaller set'' vertex expander for small sets up size $\delta \sim \sqrt T \sim n^{\beta}$, with bounded bit and check degree. At the same time, the geometric size of the largest stabilizer is bounded by $\sqrt T$ in graph distance. We argue, based on physical intuition, that this result should hold more generally on arbitrary graphs. By taking hypergraph products of these classical codes we obtain quantum LDPC codes defined on the torus with smaller-set boundary and co-boundary expansion and the same expansion/locality tradeoffs as for the classical codes. These codes are self-correcting and admit single-shot decoding, while having the geometric size of the stabilizer growing as an arbitrarily small power law. Our proof technique establishes mixing of a random SWAP network on small subsystems at times scaling with only the subsystem size, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Incomplete U-Statistics of Equireplicate Designs: Berry-Esseen Bound and Efficient Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20755v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: U-statistics are a fundamental class of estimators that generalize the sample mean and underpin much of nonparametric statistics. Although extensively studied in both statistics and probability, key challenges remain: their high computational cost - addressed partly through incomplete U-statistics - and their non-standard asymptotic behavior in the degenerate case, which typically requires resampling methods for hypothesis testing. This paper presents a novel perspective on U-statistics, grounded in hypergraph theory and combinatorial designs. Our approach bypasses the traditional Hoeffding decomposition, the main analytical tool in this literature but one that is highly sensitive to degeneracy. By characterizing the dependence structure of a U-statistic, we derive a Berry-Esseen bound valid for incomplete U-statistics of deterministic designs, yielding conditions under which Gaussian limiting distributions can be established even in degenerate cases and when the order diverges. We also introduce efficient algorithms to construct incomplete U-statistics based on equireplicate designs, a subclass of deterministic designs that, in certain cases, achieve minimum variance. Beyond its theoretical contributions, our framework provides a systematic way to construct permutation-free counterparts to tests based on degenerate U-statistics, as demonstrated in experiments with kernel-based tests using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy and the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion.</description>

      <title>Euler characteristics of the universal Picard stack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $\mathbb{S}_n$-equivariant weight-graded and topological Euler characteristics of the universal Picard stack $\mathrm{Pic}_{g, n}^d \to \mathcal{M}_{g, n}$ of degree-$d$ line bundles over $\mathcal{M}_{g, n}$. We prove that in the weight-zero and topological cases, the generating function for Euler characteristics of $\mathrm{Pic}_{g, n}^d$ is obtained from the corresponding one for $\mathcal{M}_{g, n}$ by an extremely simple combinatorial transformation. This lets us deduce closed formulas for the two generating functions, taking as input the Chan--Faber--Galatius--Payne formula in the weight-zero case and Gorsky's formula in the topological case. As an immediate corollary, we obtain closed formulas for the weight-zero and topological Euler characteristics of $\mathrm{Pic}^d_g$. Our weight-zero calculations follow from a general result passing from the weight-graded Euler characteristics of $\mathcal{M}_{g, n}$ to those of $\mathrm{Pic}_{g,n}^d$.</description>
