      <title>Automated dimensional analysis for PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical units are fundamental to scientific computing. However, many finite element frameworks lack built-in support for dimensional analysis. In this work, we present a systematic framework for integrating physical units into the Unified Form Language (UFL). We implement a symbolic Quantity class to track units within variational forms. The implementation exploits the abelian group structure of physical dimensions. We represent them as vectors in $\mathbb{Q}^n$ to simplify operations and improve performance. A graph-based visitor pattern traverses the expression tree to automate consistency checks and factorization. We demonstrate that this automated nondimensionalization functions as the simplest form of Full Operator Preconditioning. It acts as a physics-aware diagonal preconditioner that equilibrates linear systems prior to assembly. Numerical experiments with the Navier--Stokes equations show that this improves the condition number of the saddle-point matrix. Analysis of Neo-Hooke hyperelasticity highlights the detection of floating-point cancellation errors in small deformation regimes. Finally, the Poisson--Nernst--Planck system example illustrates the handling of coupled multiphysics problems with derived scaling parameters. Although the implementation targets the FEniCSx framework, the concepts are general and easily adaptable to other finite element libraries using UFL, such as Firedrake or DUNE.</description>

      <title>Tensor Algebra Processing Primitives (TAPP): Towards a Standard for Tensor Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the absence of a universal standard interface for tensor operations, we introduce the Tensor Algebra Processing Primitives (TAPP), a C-based interface designed to decouple the application layer from hardware-specific implementations. We provide a mathematical formulation of tensor contractions and a reference implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate the validation of optimized kernels. Developed through community consensus involving academic and industrial stakeholders, TAPP aims to enable performance portability and resolving dependency challenges. The viability of the standard is demonstrated through successful integrations with the TBLIS and cuTENSOR libraries, as well as the DIRAC quantum chemistry package.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{skwdro}$: a library for Wasserstein distributionally robust machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present skwdro, a Python library for training robust machine learning models. The library is based on distributionally robust optimization using Wasserstein distances, popular in optimal transport and machine learnings. The goal of the library is to make the training of robust models easier for a wide audience by proposing a wrapper for PyTorch modules, enabling model loss' robustification with minimal code changes. It comes along with scikit-learn compatible estimators for some popular objectives. The core of the implementation relies on an entropic smoothing of the original robust objective, in order to ensure maximal model flexibility. The library is available at https://github.com/iutzeler/skwdro and the documentation at https://skwdro.readthedocs.io.</description>
