      <title>Measuring Internet Routing from the Most Valuable Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the increasing number of Vantage Points (VPs) in RIPE RIS and RouteViews
  improves our understanding of the Internet, the quadratically increasing
  volume of collected data poses a challenge to the scientific and operational
  use of the data. The design and implementation of BGP and BGP data
  collection systems lead to data archives with enormous redundancy, as
  there is substantial overlap in announced routes across many different VPs.
  Researchers thus often resort to arbitrary sampling of the data,
  which we demonstrate
  comes at a cost to the accuracy and coverage of previous works. The continued
  growth of the Internet, and of these collection systems, exacerbates
  this cost. The community needs a better approach to managing
  and using these data archives.
  We propose MVP, a system that
  scores VPs according to their level of redundancy with other VPs,
  allowing more informed sampling of these data archives.
  Our challenge is that the degree of redundancy between two updates depends
  on how we define redundancy, which in turn depends on
  the analysis objective. Our key contribution is
  a general framework and associated algorithms to assess
  redundancy between VP observations.
  We quantify the benefit of our approach for four canonical BGP routing analyses: AS relationship inference, AS rank computation, hijack detection, and routing detour detection. MVP improves the coverage or accuracy (or both) of all these analyses while processing the same volume of data.</description>

      <title>Service Mesh: Architectures, Applications, and Implementations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scalability and flexibility of microservice architecture have led to major changes in cloud-native application architectures. However, the complexity of managing thousands of small services written in different languages and handling the exchange of data between them have caused significant management challenges. Service mesh is a promising solution that could mitigate these problems by introducing an overlay layer on top of the services. In this paper, we first study the architecture and components of service mesh architecture. Then, we review two important service mesh implementations and discuss how the service mesh could be helpful in other areas, including 5G.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Non-Terrestrial Networks for Boosting Terrestrial Network Performance in Dynamic Traffic Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to an ever-expansive network deployment, numerous questions are being raised regarding the energy consumption of the mobile network. Recently, Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) have proven to be a useful, and complementary solution to Terrestrial Networks (TN) to provide ubiquitous coverage. In this paper, we consider an integrated TN-NTN, and study how to maximize its resource usage in a dynamic traffic scenario. We introduce BLASTER, a framework designed to control User Equipment (UE) association, Base Station (BS) transmit power and activation, and bandwidth allocation between the terrestrial and non-terrestrial tiers. Our proposal is able to adapt to fluctuating daily traffic, focusing on reducing power consumption throughout the network during low traffic and distributing the load otherwise. Simulation results show an average daily decrease of total power consumption by 45% compared to a network model following 3GPP recommendation, as well as an average throughput increase of roughly 250%. Our paper underlines the central and dynamic role that the NTN plays in improving key areas of concern for network flexibility.</description>

      <title>QoE-Aware and Secure UAV-Aided Rate-Splitting Multiple Access Based Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the issue of quality of experience (QoE) in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aided multiuser rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) networks under secrecy constraints. The problem is formulated as maximization of sum mean opinion scores (MOSs) of the users. The problem is decomposed into two subproblems, beamforming and rate allocation and UAV trajectory subproblem. For, beamforming and rate allocation subproblem, we use the epigraph method, property of polynomials, and the norm-bounded error of channels, we linearize the objective function. Then, applying second-order conic (SOC) and first Taylor expansion, we convexify the remaining nonconvex constraints. For the highly nonconvex UAV trajectory, we unroll the constraints and we apply first Taylor expansion on the unrolled constraints. The simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>A Duty-Cycle-Efficient Synchronization Protocol for Slotted-Aloha in LoRaWAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current context of massive IoT, the Pure-Aloha scheme used in LoRaWAN is reaching its limit, and Slotted-Aloha is being considered as an alternative, as it offers twice Pure-Aloha's packet success rate. It however requires synchronization across the nodes. In this paper, we propose a new slot structure adapted to devices with low quality clock, and a duty-cycle efficient synchronization protocol for LoRaWAN class A devices with the lowest overhead to date. We discuss the conditions of its integration into LoRaWAN. The experimental results confirm that it succeeds in tracking each device's synchronization state, identifying the exact moment they desynchronize and resynchronizing them. The proposed protocol is also proven to be more duty-cycle efficient than existing fixed-rate synchronization solutions.</description>

      <title>A Privacy Measure Turned Upside Down? Investigating the Use of HTTP Client Hints on the Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HTTP client hints are a set of standardized HTTP request headers designed to modernize and potentially replace the traditional user agent string. While the user agent string exposes a wide range of information about the client's browser and device, client hints provide a controlled and structured approach for clients to selectively disclose their capabilities and preferences to servers. Essentially, client hints aim at more effective and privacy-friendly disclosure of browser or client properties than the user agent string.
  We present a first long-term study of the use of HTTP client hints in the wild. We found that despite being implemented in almost all web browsers, server-side usage of client hints remains generally low. However, in the context of third-party websites, which are often linked to trackers, the adoption rate is significantly higher. This is concerning because client hints allow the retrieval of more data from the client than the user agent string provides, and there are currently no mechanisms for users to detect or control this potential data leakage. Our work provides valuable insights for web users, browser vendors, and researchers by exposing potential privacy violations via client hints and providing help in developing remediation strategies as well as further research.</description>

      <title>A Reliable Target Evolved Node B Selection Scheme in LTE-Advanced Handover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of improving the handover performance in Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) networks has not been fully solved yet. Traditionally, the selection of the target Evolved Node B (TeNB) in the handover procedure is based on the signal strength measurements, which may not produce a reliable handover. A reliable handover method may reduce the instances of unstable or frequent handovers that otherwise waste network resources. The signal strength measurement process is inherently time consuming as the user equipment (UE) has to measure multiple neighboring eNB (NeNB) frequencies in each measurement period. An efficient handover method is required to improve the overall performance of such systems. In this paper we propose a reliable and fast TeNB selection scheme for LTE-A handover. The proposed scheme outperforms the existing LTE-A handover methods. The improved performance is achieved by selecting the TeNB based on some three independent parameters, namely orientation matching (OM), current load (CL), and the received signal strengths. An UE essentially measures only the NeNBs shortlisted based on OM and CL; thus measurement time is reduced considerably leading to a reduction of overall handover time. The performance of the proposed scheme is validated by simulation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity: Collaborative DNN Synthesis in the Cloud Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Researchers are exploring the integration of IoT and the cloud continuum, together with AI to enhance the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of critical infrastructure (CI) systems. This integration, however, increases susceptibility of CI systems to cyberattacks, potentially leading to disruptions like power outages, oil spills, or even a nuclear mishap. CI systems are inherently complex and generate vast amounts of heterogeneous and high-dimensional data, which crosses many trust boundaries in their journey across the IoT, edge, and cloud domains over the communication network interconnecting them. As a result, they face expanded attack surfaces. To ensure the security of these dataflows, researchers have used deep neural network models with encouraging results. Nevertheless, two important challenges that remain are tackling the computational complexity of these models to reduce convergence times and preserving the accuracy of detection of integrity-violating intrusions. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach that utilizes trained edge cloud models to synthesize central cloud models, effectively overcoming these challenges. We empirically validate the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with traditional centralized and distributed techniques, including a contemporary collaborative technique.</description>

      <title>PerLLM: Personalized Inference Scheduling with Edge-Cloud Collaboration for Diverse LLM Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid growth in the number of large language model (LLM) users, it is difficult for bandwidth-constrained cloud servers to simultaneously process massive LLM services in real-time. Recently, edge-cloud infrastructures have been used to improve the processing efficiency of large-scale LLM services. However, the diversity of task requirements and the dynamics of resources pose great challenges to inference scheduling, leading to the wastage of many resources. In this paper, we present PerLLM, a personalized inference scheduling framework with edge-cloud collaboration designed for diverse LLM services. For the complexity of multiple constraints and the decision-making process of edge-cloud collaboration, we integrate the upper confidence bound algorithm based on the constraint satisfaction mechanism in PerLLM. For diverse LLM services, PerLLM can optimize service scheduling and resource allocation solutions within the edge-cloud infrastructure to meet processing time requirements while minimizing energy costs. Experimental results from different model deployments show that PerLLM can effectively meet the processing time requirements of personalized services. Compared to other methods, PerLLM achieves 2.2x, 2.1x, and 1.6x throughput and reduces the energy cost by more than 50%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI) into fifth-generation (5G) networks has made evident the limitations of network intelligence with ever-increasing, strenuous requirements for current and next-generation devices. This transition to ubiquitous intelligence demands high connectivity, synchronicity, and end-to-end communication between users and network operators, and will pave the way towards full network automation without human intervention. Intent-based networking is a key factor in the reduction of human actions, roles, and responsibilities while shifting towards novel extraction and interpretation of automated network management. This paper presents the development of a custom Large Language Model (LLM) for 5G and next-generation intent-based networking and provides insights into future LLM developments and integrations to realize end-to-end intent-based networking for fully automated network intelligence.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Fault-Tolerant Robust Traffic Grooming in OTN-over-DWDM Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of next-generation networks is revolutionizing network operators' management and orchestration practices worldwide. The critical services supported by these networks require increasingly stringent performance requirements, especially when considering the aspect of network reliability. This increase in reliability, coupled with the mass generation and consumption of information stemming from the increasing complexity of the network and the integration of artificial intelligence agents, affects transport networks, which will be required to allow the feasibility of such services to materialize. To this end, traditional recovery schemes are inadequate to ensure the resilience requirements of next-generation critical services given the increasingly dynamic nature of the network. The work presented in this paper proposes a probabilistic and fault-tolerant robust traffic grooming model for OTN-over-DWDM networks. The model's parameterization gives network operators the ability to control the level of protection and reliability required to meet their quality of service and service level agreement guarantees. The results demonstrate that the robust solution can ensure fault tolerance even in the face of demand uncertainty without service disruptions and the need for reactive network maintenance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The trend for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is growing with prospective air taxis, parcel deliverers, and medical and industrial services. Safe and efficient UAM operation relies on timely communication and reliable data exchange. In this paper, we explore Cooperative Perception (CP) for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), considering the unique communication needs involving high dynamics and a large number of UAS. We propose a hybrid approach combining local broadcast with a central CP service, inspired by centrally managed U-space and broadcast mechanisms from automotive and aviation domains. In a simulation study, we show that our approach significantly enhances the environmental awareness for UAS compared to fully distributed approaches, with an increased communication channel load, which we also evaluate. These findings prompt a discussion on communication strategies for CP in UAM and the potential of a centralized CP service in future research.</description>

      <title>Exploring the sensing power of mixed vehicle fleets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15237v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vehicle-based mobile sensing, also known as drive-by sensing, efficiently surveys urban environments at low costs by leveraging the mobility of urban vehicles. While recent studies have focused on drive-by sensing for fleets of a single type, our work explores the sensing power and cost-effectiveness of a mixed fleet that consists of vehicles with distinct and complementary mobility patterns. We formulate the drive-by sensing coverage (DSC) problem, proposing a method to quantify sensing utility and an optimization procedure that determines fleet composition, sensor allocation, and vehicle routing for a given budget. Our air quality sensing case study in Longquanyi District (Chengdu, China) demonstrates that using a mixed fleet enhances sensing utilities and achieves close approximations to the target sensing distribution at a lower cost. Generalizing these insights to two additional real-world networks, our regression analysis uncovers key factors influencing the sensing power of mixed fleets. This research provides quantitative and managerial insights into drive-by sensing, showcasing a positive externality of urban transport activities.</description>
