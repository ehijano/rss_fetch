      <title>Heisenberg-limit spin squeezing with spin Bogoliubov Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well established that the optimal spin squeezing under a one-axis-twisting Hamiltonian follows a scaling law of $J^{-2/3}$ for $J$ interacting atoms after a quench dynamics. Here we prove analytically and numerically that the spin squeezing of the ground state of the one-axis-twisting Hamiltonian actually reaches the Heisenberg limit $J^{-1}$. By constructing a bilinear Bogoliubov Hamiltonian with the raising and lowering spin operators, we exactly diagonalize the spin Bogoliubov Hamiltonian, which includes the one-axis twisting Hamiltonian as a limiting case. The ground state of the spin Bogoliubov Hamiltonian exhibits wonderful spin squeezing, which approaches to the Heisenberg limit in the case of the one-axis twisting Hamiltonian. It is possible to realize experimentally the spin squeezed ground state of the one-axis-twisting Hamiltonian in dipolar spinor condensates, ultracold atoms in optical lattices, spins in a cavity, or alkali atoms in a vapor cell.</description>

      <title>Fully polarized Fermi systems at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple model of an interacting, fully spin--polarized Fermi gas in dimensions $d=2$ and $d=3$, and derive the approximate expression for the energy spectrum and the corresponding formula for the Helmholtz free energy. We analyze the thermodynamics of the system and find the lines of first--order phase transitions between the low and high density phases terminating at critical points. The properties of the corresponding phase diagrams are qualitatively different for $d=2$ and $3$, and sensitively depend on the interparticle attraction, which marks a departure from the standard van der Waals theory. The differences originate from the Pauli exclusion principle and are embeded in the fermionic nature of the system under study.</description>

      <title>Bounds on detection of Bell correlations with entangled ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices under occupation defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell non-locality stems from quantum correlations effectively identified using inequalities. Spin chains, simulated with ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices, Rydberg atoms in tweezer arrays, trapped ions, or molecules, allow single-spin control and measurement. Therefore, they are suitable for studying fundamental aspects of these correlations and non-locality. Occupation defects, such as vacancies or multiple atoms occupying a single site due to imperfect system preparation, limit the detection of Bell correlations. We investigate their impact using a simplified toy model parameterized by the probability of a site being singly occupied. We derive the corresponding Bell inequality and identify the smallest probability that establishes a lower bound for detecting Bell correlations. We relate the bound to two physical parameters leading to defects in occupations: non-zero temperature and filling factor, focusing on entangled ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices. Finally, we numerically validate the predictions of the toy model by full many-body simulations.</description>

      <title>Thermal density functional theory approach to quantum thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the thermodynamic properties of many-body quantum systems and their emergence from microscopic laws is a topic of great significance due to its profound fundamental implications and extensive practical applications. Recent advances in experimental techniques for controlling and preparing these systems have increased interest in this area, as they have the potential to drive the development of quantum technologies. In this study, we present a density-functional theory approach to extract detailed information about the statistics of work and the irreversible entropy associated with quantum quenches at finite temperature. Specifically, we demonstrate that these quantities can be expressed as functionals of thermal and out-of-equilibrium densities, which may serve as fundamental variables for understanding finite-temperature many-body processes. We, then, apply our method to the case of the inhomogeneous Hubbard model, showing that our density functional theory based approach can be usefully employed to unveil the distinctive roles of interaction and external potential on the thermodynamic properties of such a system.</description>

      <title>Efficient Simulation of 1D Long-Range Interacting Systems at Any Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method that ensures efficient computation of one-dimensional quantum systems with long-range interactions across all temperatures. Our algorithm operates within a quasi-polynomial runtime for inverse temperatures up to $\beta={\rm poly}(\ln(n))$. At the core of our approach is the Density Matrix Renormalization Group algorithm, which typically does not guarantee efficiency. We have created a new truncation scheme for the matrix product operator of the quantum Gibbs states, which allows us to control the error analytically. Additionally, our method is applied to simulate the time evolution of systems with long-range interactions, achieving significantly better precision than that offered by the Lieb-Robinson bound.</description>

      <title>Vector rogue waves in spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates with spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analytically and numerically study three-component rogue waves (RWs) in spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates with Raman-induced spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Using the multiscale perturbative method, we obtain approximate analytical solutions for RWs with positive and negative effective masses, determined by the effective dispersion of the system. The solutions include RWs with smooth and striped shapes, as well as higher-order RWs. The analytical solutions demonstrate that the RWs in the three components of the system exhibit different velocities and their maximum peaks appear at the same spatiotemporal position, which is caused by SOC and interactions. The accuracy of the approximate analytical solutions is corroborated by comparison with direct numerical simulations of the underlying system. Additionally, we systematically explore existence domains for the RWs determined by the baseband modulational instability (BMI). Numerical simulations corroborate that, under the action of BMI, plane waves with random initial perturbations excite RWs, as predicted by the approximate analytical solutions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Classical Shadow Tomography through Many-body Localization Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01258v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical shadow tomography serves as a potent tool for extracting numerous properties from quantum many-body systems with minimal measurements. Nevertheless, prevailing methods yielding optimal performance for few-body operators necessitate the application of random two-qubit gates, a task that can prove challenging on specific quantum simulators such as ultracold atomic gases. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach founded on the dynamics of many-body localization, a phenomenon extensively demonstrated in optical lattices. Through an exploration of the shadow norm -- both analytically, employing a phenomenological model, and numerically, utilizing the TEBD algorithm -- we demonstrate that our scheme achieves remarkable efficiency comparable to shallow circuits or measurement-induced criticality, resulting in a significant improvement in the exponential exponent compared to the previous classical shadow protocol. Our findings are corroborated through direct numerical simulations encompassing the entire sampling and reconstruction processes. Consequently, our results present a compelling methodology for analyzing the output states of quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hamiltonian Algorithms for Maximum Independent Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14546v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With qubits encoded into atomic ground and Rydberg states and situated on the vertexes of a graph, the conditional quantum dynamics of Rydberg blockade, which inhibits simultaneous excitation of nearby atoms, has been employed recently to find maximum independent sets following an adiabatic evolution algorithm hereafter denoted by HV [Science 376, 1209 (2022)]. An alternative algorithm, short named the PK algorithm, reveals that the independent sets diffuse over a media graph governed by a non-abelian gauge matrix of an emergent PXP model. This work shows the above two algorithms are mathematically equivalent, despite of their seemingly different physical implementations. More importantly, we demonstrated that although the two are mathematically equivalent, the PK algorithm exhibits more efficient and resource-saving performance. Within the same range of experimental parameters, our numerical studies suggest that the PK algorithm performs at least 25% better on average and saves at least $6\times10^6$ measurements ($\sim 900$ hours of continuous operation) for each graph when compared to the HV algorithm. We further consider the measurement error and point out that this may cause the oscillations in the performance of the HV's optimization process.</description>

      <title>Third-Quantized Master Equations as a classical Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Third quantization is used in open quantum systems to construct a superoperator basis in which quadratic Lindbladians can be turned into a normal form. From it follows the spectral properties of the Lindbladian, including eigenvalues and eigenvectors. However, the connection between third quantization and the semiclassical representations usually employed to obtain the dynamics of open quantum systems remains opaque. We introduce a new basis for third quantization that bridges this gap between third quantization and the $Q$ representation by projecting the master equation onto a superoperator coherent state basis. The equation of motion reduces to a multidimensional complex Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</description>

      <title>Seeding decay of the false vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theory of false vacuum decay induced by spherical nucleation seeds. The type of seed considered has a boundary characterised by surface energy terms. The theory applies to false vacuum decay at zero and finite temperatures. Seeded nucleation may be important for enabling future false vacuum decay experiments on analogue systems using Bose Einstein Condensates (BEC). We show that our theory of seeded nucleation at finite temperature applied to a potassium BEC in two spatial dimensions agrees with numerical, real-time, simulations.</description>
