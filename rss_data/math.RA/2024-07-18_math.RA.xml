      <title>Decomposition of matrices into product of idempotents and separativity of regular rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following O'Meara's result [Journal of Algebra and Its Applications Vol~\textbf{13}, No. 8 (2014)], it follows that the block matrix
  $A=\begin{pmatrix}
  B &amp; 0
  0 &amp; 0
  \end{pmatrix} \in M_{n+r}(R)$, $B\in M_n(R)$, $r\ge 1$,
  over a von Neumann regular separative ring $R$, is a product of idempotent matrices. Furthermore, this decomposition into idempotents of $A$ also holds when $B$ is an invertible matrix and $R$ is a GE ring (defined by Cohn [New mathematical monographs: {\bf 3}, Cambridge University Press (2006)]). As a consequence, it follows that if there exists an example of a von Neumann regular ring $R$ over which the matrix
  $
  A=\begin{pmatrix}
  B &amp; 0
  0 &amp; 0
  \end{pmatrix} \in M_{n+r}(R)
  $
  where $B\in M_n(R)$, $r\ge 1$ , cannot be expressed as a product of idempotents,  then $R$ is not separative, thus providing an answer to an open question whether there exists a von Neumann regular ring which is not separative.
  The paper concludes with an example of an open question whether every totally nonnegative matrix is a product of nonnegative idempotent matrices.</description>

      <title>Application of Hohle's Square Roots on Hoop Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Square root is a useful tool to study the properties of (ordered) algebraic structures. In this article, we are going to employ this tool to study hoop algebras. To do so, we define square root and make the first attempt to explore the significance properties of this concept in this setting. Then, due to the key role of square roots in obtaining new hoop algebras, we apply them on the filters of hoop algebras, and show that the formation of square roots on quotient structures of hoop algebras by their filters is well-behaved. In addition, a new class of hoop algebras having square roots, so called good hoop algebras, is introduced and its relationships with other classes of ordered algebras such as Boolean algebras and Godel algebras are explored. Several examples are provided as well. Ultimately, it is shown that the class of all bounded hoop algebras with square roots is a variety.</description>

      <title>S-J-Ideals: A Study in Commutative and Noncommutative Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of S-J-ideals in both commutative and noncommutative rings. For a commutative ring R and a multiplicatively closed subset S, we show that many properties of J-ideals apply to S-J-ideals and examine their characteristics in various ring constructions, such as homomorphic image rings, quotient rings, cartesian product rings, polynomial rings, power series rings, idealization rings, and amalgamation rings. In noncommutative rings, where S is an m-system, we define right S-J-ideals. We demonstrate the equivalence of S-J-ideals and right S-J-ideals in commutative rings with identity and provide examples to illustrate the connections between right S-prime ideals and J-ideals.</description>

      <title>Dual Complex Adjoint Matrix: Applications in Dual Quaternion Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual quaternions and dual quaternion matrices have garnered widespread applications in robotic research, and its spectral theory has been extensively studied in recent years. This paper introduces the novel concept of the dual complex adjoint matrices for dual quaternion matrices. We delve into exploring the properties of this matrix, utilizing it to study eigenvalues of dual quaternion matrices and defining the concept of standard right eigenvalues. Notably, we leverage the properties of the dual complex adjoint matrix to devise a direct solution to the Hand-Eye calibration problem. Additionally, we apply this matrix to solve dual quaternion linear equations systems, thereby advancing the Rayleigh quotient iteration method for computing eigenvalues of dual quaternion Hermitian matrices, enhancing its computational efficiency. Numerical experiments have validated the correctness of our proposed method in solving the Hand-Eye calibration problem and demonstrated the effectiveness in improving the Rayleigh quotient iteration method, underscoring the promising potential of dual complex adjoint matrices in tackling dual quaternion-related challenges.</description>

      <title>Noether's normalization in skew polynomial rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Noether's normalization lemma for finitely generated algebras over a division algebra. In its classical form, the lemma states that if $I$ is a proper ideal of the ring $R=F[t_1,\ldots,t_n]$ of polynomials over a field $F$, then the quotient ring $R/I$ is a finite extension of a polynomial ring over $F$. We prove that the lemma holds when $R=D[t_1,\ldots,t_n]$ is the ring of polynomials in $n$ central variables over a division algebra $D$. We provide examples demonstrating that Noether's normalization may fail for the skew polynomial ring $D[t_1,\ldots,t_n;\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_n]$ with respect to commuting automorphisms $\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_n$ of $D$. We give a sufficient condition for $\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_n$ under which the normalization lemma holds for such ring. In the case where $D=F$ is a field, this sufficient condition is proved to be necessary.</description>

      <title>SVD, joint-MVD, Berry phase, and generic loss of rank for a matrix valued function of 2 parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we consider generic losses of rank for complex valued matrix functions depending on two parameters. We give theoretical results that characterize parameter regions where these losses of rank occur. Our main results consist in showing how following an appropriate smooth SVD along a closed loop it is possible to monitor the Berry phases accrued by the singular vectors to decide if -- inside the loop -- there are parameter values where a loss of rank takes place. It will be needed to use a new construction of a smooth SVD, which we call the "joint-MVD" (minimum variation decomposition).</description>

      <title>Nilpotent symplectic alternating algebras II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper and its sequel we continue our study of nilpotent symplectic alternating algebras. In particular we give a full classification of such algebras of dimension $10$ over any field. It is known that symplectic alternating algebras over $\mbox{GF}(3)$ correspond to a special rich class $\mathcal{C}$ of $2$-Engel $3$-groups of exponent $27$ and under this correspondence we will see that the nilpotent algebras correspond to a subclass of $\mathcal{C}$ that are those groups in $\mathcal{C}$ that have an extra group theoretical property that we refer to as being powerfully nilpotent and can be described also in the context of $p$-groups where $p$ is an arbitrary prime.</description>
