      <title>PUMA: Layer-Pruned Language Model for Efficient Unified Multimodal Retrieval with Modality-Adaptive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As multimedia content expands, the demand for unified multimodal retrieval (UMR) in real-world applications increases. Recent work leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to tackle this task. However, their large parameter size results in high training costs and low inference efficiency. To address this, we propose PUMA: a Layer-Pruned Language Model for Efficient Unified Multimodal Retrieval with Modality-Adaptive Learning. Our approach improves UMR from both structural and learning perspectives. (1) Structurally, we propose Layer-Pruned Self-Distillation, which prunes MLLMs by keeping only shallow layers while distilling features from dropped deep layers as teacher signals. This reduces parameters and preserves representation capability. (2) On the learning side, we introduce Modality-Adaptive Contrastive Learning Loss (MAC-Loss), which separates in-batch negatives into harder intra-modality and easier inter-modality groups based on the target modality, assigning different temperature strategies to enhance learning efficiency. Experiments show our method significantly reduces resource usage while maintaining strong performance.</description>

      <title>VideoConviction: A Multimodal Benchmark for Human Conviction and Stock Market Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media has amplified the reach of financial influencers known as "finfluencers," who share stock recommendations on platforms like YouTube. Understanding their influence requires analyzing multimodal signals like tone, delivery style, and facial expressions, which extend beyond text-based financial analysis. We introduce VideoConviction, a multimodal dataset with 6,000+ expert annotations, produced through 457 hours of human effort, to benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and text-based large language models (LLMs) in financial discourse. Our results show that while multimodal inputs improve stock ticker extraction (e.g., extracting Apple's ticker AAPL), both MLLMs and LLMs struggle to distinguish investment actions and conviction--the strength of belief conveyed through confident delivery and detailed reasoning--often misclassifying general commentary as definitive recommendations. While high-conviction recommendations perform better than low-conviction ones, they still underperform the popular S\&amp;P 500 index fund. An inverse strategy--betting against finfluencer recommendations--outperforms the S\&amp;P 500 by 6.8\% in annual returns but carries greater risk (Sharpe ratio of 0.41 vs. 0.65). Our benchmark enables a diverse evaluation of multimodal tasks, comparing model performance on both full video and segmented video inputs. This enables deeper advancements in multimodal financial research. Our code, dataset, and evaluation leaderboard are available under the CC BY-NC 4.0 license.</description>

      <title>Visual Semantic Description Generation with MLLMs for Image-Text Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image-text matching (ITM) aims to address the fundamental challenge of aligning visual and textual modalities, which inherently differ in their representations, continuous, high-dimensional image features vs. discrete, structured text. We propose a novel framework that bridges the modality gap by leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as visual semantic parsers. By generating rich Visual Semantic Descriptions (VSD), MLLMs provide semantic anchor that facilitate cross-modal alignment. Our approach combines: (1) Instance-level alignment by fusing visual features with VSD to enhance the linguistic expressiveness of image representations, and (2) Prototype-level alignment through VSD clustering to ensure category-level consistency. These modules can be seamlessly integrated into existing ITM models. Extensive experiments on Flickr30K and MSCOCO demonstrate substantial performance improvements. The approach also exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to cross-domain tasks, including news and remote sensing ITM. The code and model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/Image-Text-Matching/VSD.</description>

      <title>PanMatch: Unleashing the Potential of Large Vision Models for Unified Matching Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents PanMatch, a versatile foundation model for robust correspondence matching. Unlike previous methods that rely on task-specific architectures and domain-specific fine-tuning to support tasks like stereo matching, optical flow or feature matching, our key insight is that any two-frame correspondence matching task can be addressed within a 2D displacement estimation framework using the same model weights. Such a formulation eliminates the need for designing specialized unified architectures or task-specific ensemble models. Instead, it achieves multi-task integration by endowing displacement estimation algorithms with unprecedented generalization capabilities. To this end, we highlight the importance of a robust feature extractor applicable across multiple domains and tasks, and propose the feature transformation pipeline that leverage all-purpose features from Large Vision Models to endow matching baselines with zero-shot cross-view matching capabilities. Furthermore, we assemble a cross-domain dataset with near 1.8 million samples from stereo matching, optical flow, and feature matching domains to pretrain PanMatch. We demonstrate the versatility of PanMatch across a wide range of domains and downstream tasks using the same model weights. Our model outperforms UniMatch and Flow-Anything on cross-task evaluations, and achieves comparable performance to most state-of-the-art task-specific algorithms on task-oriented benchmarks. Additionally, PanMatch presents unprecedented zero-shot performance in abnormal scenarios, such as rainy day and satellite imagery, where most existing robust algorithms fail to yield meaningful results.</description>

      <title>FreeAudio: Training-Free Timing Planning for Controllable Long-Form Text-to-Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-audio (T2A) generation has achieved promising results with the recent advances in generative models. However, because of the limited quality and quantity of temporally-aligned audio-text pairs, existing T2A methods struggle to handle the complex text prompts that contain precise timing control, e.g., "owl hooted at 2.4s-5.2s". Recent works have explored data augmentation techniques or introduced timing conditions as model inputs to enable timing-conditioned 10-second T2A generation, while their synthesis quality is still limited. In this work, we propose a novel training-free timing-controlled T2A framework, FreeAudio, making the first attempt to enable timing-controlled long-form T2A generation, e.g., "owl hooted at 2.4s-5.2s and crickets chirping at 0s-24s". Specifically, we first employ an LLM to plan non-overlapping time windows and recaption each with a refined natural language description, based on the input text and timing prompts. Then we introduce: 1) Decoupling and Aggregating Attention Control for precise timing control; 2) Contextual Latent Composition for local smoothness and Reference Guidance for global consistency. Extensive experiments show that: 1) FreeAudio achieves state-of-the-art timing-conditioned T2A synthesis quality among training-free methods and is comparable to leading training-based methods; 2) FreeAudio demonstrates comparable long-form generation quality with training-based Stable Audio and paves the way for timing-controlled long-form T2A synthesis.

      <title>Lumos-1: On Autoregressive Video Generation from a Unified Model Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have unified a vast range of language tasks, inspiring preliminary efforts in autoregressive video generation. Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from standard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur prohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality. Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal tube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on GenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V.

      <title>Using AI to Summarize US Presidential Campaign TV Advertisement Videos, 1952-2012</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the largest and most comprehensive dataset of US presidential campaign television advertisements, available in digital format. The dataset also includes machine-searchable transcripts and high-quality summaries designed to facilitate a variety of academic research. To date, there has been great interest in collecting and analyzing US presidential campaign advertisements, but the need for manual procurement and annotation led many to rely on smaller subsets. We design a large-scale parallelized, AI-based analysis pipeline that automates the laborious process of preparing, transcribing, and summarizing videos. We then apply this methodology to the 9,707 presidential ads from the Julian P. Kanter Political Commercial Archive. We conduct extensive human evaluations to show that these transcripts and summaries match the quality of manually generated alternatives. We illustrate the value of this data by including an application that tracks the genesis and evolution of current focal issue areas over seven decades of presidential elections. Our analysis pipeline and codebase also show how to use LLM-based tools to obtain high-quality summaries for other video datasets.</description>

      <title>Token Communications: A Unified Framework for Cross-modal Context-aware Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12096v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce token communications (TokCom), a large model-driven framework to leverage cross-modal context information in generative semantic communications (GenSC). TokCom is a new paradigm, motivated by the recent success of generative foundation models and multimodal large language models (GFM/MLLMs), where the communication units are tokens, enabling efficient transformer-based token processing at the transmitter and receiver. In this paper, we introduce the potential opportunities and challenges of leveraging context in GenSC, explore how to integrate GFM/MLLMs-based token processing into semantic communication systems to leverage cross-modal context effectively at affordable complexity, present the key principles for efficient TokCom at various layers in future wireless networks. In a typical image semantic communication setup, we demonstrate a significant improvement of the bandwidth efficiency, achieved by TokCom by leveraging the context information among tokens. Finally, the potential research directions are identified to facilitate adoption of TokCom in future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>T-GVC: Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding at Ultra-Low Bitrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging paradigm of generative video coding, aiming to achieve semantically accurate reconstructions in Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging strong generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or an excessive dependence on high-level text guidance, which often fails to capture motion details and results in unrealistic reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC employs a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic importance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a training-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms both traditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our approach achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided by geometric motion modeling.</description>
