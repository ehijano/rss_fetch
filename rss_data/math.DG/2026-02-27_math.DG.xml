      <title>A Boothby-Wang construction in generalized contact geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a generalized analogue of the Boothby-Wang theorem in generalized contact geometry, along with related results. We present a general method for constructing examples of generalized contact structures that are not of Poon-Wade type, and even examples that fail to be generalized contact structures. Using Courant reduction methods, we construct a generalized complex structure on a smooth leaf space and equip the generalized contact manifold with a principal bundle structure whose connection is defined by the generalized contact data. Under mild assumptions, we show that the curvature induces a symplectic foliation on the leaf space. Several examples are provided.</description>

      <title>On the first eigenvalue of the area Jacobi operator for complex curves in K\"ahler surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the first eigenvalue $\Lambda_1$ of the area Jacobi operator for complex curves in K\"ahler surfaces, establishing an extrinsic counterpart to the classical Lichnerowicz theorem for the Laplace-Beltrami operator. By analyzing the second variation of a conformally invariant Willmore-type functional, we derive the lower bound $\Lambda_1 \geq 2\,\mathfrak{Ric}$, where $\mathfrak{Ric}$ denotes the infimum of the ambient Ricci curvature. For K\"ahler-Einstein surfaces with positive Einstein constant $\mathfrak{c}&gt;0$, this bound reduces to $\Lambda_1 \geq 2\mathfrak{c}$. We then explore the equality case, computing the exact dimension of the corresponding first eigenspace in terms of the area, genus, and the dimension of a space of holomorphic sections. This analysis shows that the equality is achieved for all curves of genus $g \leq 1$.</description>

      <title>Calibrations for the Sasaki volume on odd spheres and the no-gap problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each odd sphere $S^{n}$ with $n=2m+1\ge 5$, we consider the Sasaki volume functional $\mathrm{Vol}^S(V)=\int_{S^{n}}\sqrt{\det(I+(\nabla V)^{\top}(\nabla V))}\,d\mathrm{vol}$ on smooth unit tangent vector fields $V$. Using the Brito--Chacon--Naveira calibration $\omega=a\wedge\Theta$ on the unit tangent bundle $E=UTS^{n}$, we establish the universal calibrated lower bound $\mathrm{Vol}^S(V)\ge c(m;1)\,\mathrm{vol}(S^{n})$, where $c(m;1)=4^{m}/\binom{2m}{m}$. In the relaxed (integral-current) setting, we show that the section-constrained stable mass in $E$ equals the calibration value and is attained by an $\omega$-calibrated mass-minimizing integral $n$-cycle in the section class.
  We also analyze the equality case on smooth graphs. If a smooth graph is $\omega$-calibrated on an open set, then it satisfies the rigidity system $\nabla_V V=0$ and $\nabla_X V=\lambda X$ for all $X\perp V$, hence is locally a radial distance-gradient field. In particular, for $m\ge 2$ there is no smooth unit field on $S^n$ whose graph is $\omega$-calibrated everywhere.
  Finally, we construct an explicit smooth recovery sequence (presented in detail for $S^5$ and then extended to all odd dimensions) and prove a uniform nonvanishing estimate for the polar-shell normalization in the patching construction. As a consequence, $\inf_{V}\,\mathrm{Vol}^S(V)=c(m;1)\,\mathrm{vol}(S^{n})$, so there is no Lavrentiev gap.</description>

Abstract: As a first step towards a refined description of the asymptotic of the Weil-Petersson metric on the moduli space of polarized Calabi-Yau manifolds we investigate the concrete case of abelian varieties by linking such asymptotic with the multi-scale collapsing limits of the parametrized flat tori, as explicitly classified by Odaka.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study boundary conditions for elliptic operators on non-compact manifolds with boundary via uniform K-homology, a version of K-homology sensitive to the large-scale geometry of the manifold. To that end, we develop the theory of relative uniform K-homology. We show that boundary conditions for uniformly elliptic differential operators define classes in the relative and non-relative uniform K-homology of the manifold, depending on the assumed regularity of the boundary condition. Moreover, we define and study a relative index map on relative uniform K-homology that combines uniform coarse information on the interior with secondary information on the boundary. As an application, we compute that on a spin manifold with product structure and uniformly positive scalar curvature on the boundary the image of the relative uniform K-homology class of the Dirac operator under this relative index map is closely connected to a uniform version of the higher $\rho$-invariant of the boundary. In particular, a delocalized APS-index theorem of Piazza and Schick is proved in the uniform setting.</description>

      <title>Generalization of lattice Dirac operator index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive lattice formulation of various types of the Dirac operator indices, employing $K$-theory to classify the Wilson Dirac operator via its spectral flow. In contrast to the index of the overlap Dirac operator defined through the Ginsparg-Wilson relation, which is restricted to flat tori in even dimensions, our formulation offers several key advantages: 1) It can be applied straightforwardly to the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index for manifolds with boundary. 2) The boundary can be curved, allowing for the inclusion of gravitational background effects. 3) The mod-2 index in both even and odd dimensions can be defined as a natural extension of the same formulation. In this talk, we present the mathematical proof and provide numerical evidence supporting the formulation.</description>

      <title>Coupling between Phase Separation and Geometry on a Closed Elastic Curve: Free Energy Minimization and Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the free energy and dynamics of a closed elastic filament (a one-dimensional curve in two dimensions) whose local internal state is specified by curvature, stretch, and a scalar density field representing, for example, the concentration of an absorbed species. The density variable has a tendency to phase-separate whereas the local spontaneous curvature is concentration-dependent. There is also a coupling between concentration and the stretching of the filament, although our main interest is in the nearly inextensible regime. We formulate and simulate the dynamics, comprising a coupled Willmore flow and Cahn-Hilliard gradient flow on the full differential geometry of a closed filament, addressing issues that previous work typically sidestepped by restricting to the Monge gauge. We use a numerical strategy for global free energy minimization, presenting the equilibrium shapes and density profiles across a wide range of model parameters. The phase diagram is dominated by a relatively small number of simple shapes that exhibit, as expected, strong coupling between local curvature and concentration. We also find regimes where curvature and/or stretching energies suppress phase separation altogether. For selected parameter values we present fully dynamical results, tracking the time evolution of the various contributions to the free energy. The dynamics often arrive at metastable minima rather than the equilibrium state - for example, at states with more than the minimum number of interfaces between coexisting phases. The metastability of these states is absent for phase separation on a rigid circular domain and thus a direct result of the coupling between geometry and density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider conformally flat Lipschitz viscosity solutions to the $\sigma_k$-Yamabe equation in the negative cone which admit smooth hypersurface singularities. Under natural regularity assumptions (that are satisfied by solutions to the $\sigma_k$-Loewner-Nirenberg problem on annuli, for example), we first prove that the trace and normal derivatives of such a solution along the hypersurface satisfy a certain PDE. For $k=2$, we also show that the hypersurface is minimal with respect to the Lipschitz solution and address some questions related to the formal expansion of the solution near the hypersurface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.04953v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the modified $J$-equation introduced by Li-Shi. We first show that, on compact K\"ahler manifolds, the solvability of the modified $J$-equation is equivalent to the coercivity of the modified $J$-functional. Motivated by this characterization, we formulate a Nakai-Moishezon type criterion for the existence of solutions to the modified $J$-equation on general compact K\"ahler manifolds. We then verify this conjectural criterion in the case of smooth projective toric varieties. This extends the work of Collins-Sz\'ekelyhidi and provides further evidence for the expected algebro-geometric nature of the modified $J$-equation. As a potential application, we combine our results with Delcroix-Jubert. Assuming our conjectural Nakai-Moishezon type criterion holds in general, we obtain a numerical sufficient condition for the existence of extremal K\"ahler metrics on arbitrary compact K\"ahler manifolds.</description>

Abstract: Let $N$ be a Riemannian, Lorentzian or neutral $4$-dimensional space form with constant sectional curvature $L_0$. In this paper, noticing the linearly dependent condition, we obtain characterizations of space-like surfaces in $N$ with flat normal connection and parallel normal vector fields. In addition, we obtain a generic characterization of space-like surfaces in $N$ with flat normal connection and $K\equiv L_0$ which do not admit any parallel normal vector fields. For time-like surfaces in $N$ with flat normal connection, we obtain analogous results.</description>

      <title>Regularized $\zeta_{\Delta}(1)$ for Polyhedra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03351v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact polyhedral surface (a compact Riemann surface with flat conformal metric $\mathfrak{T}$ having conical singularities). The $\zeta$-function $\zeta_\Delta(s)$ of the Friedrichs Laplacian on $X$ is meromorphic in ${\mathbb C}$ with a single simple pole at $s=1$. We define $\operatorname{reg}\zeta_\Delta(1)$ as $\lim\limits_{s\to 1} \bigl( \zeta_\Delta(s)-\frac{ {\rm Area}(X,\mathfrak{T}) }{4\pi(s-1)}\bigr)$. We derive an explicit expression for this spectral invariant through the holomorphic invariants of the Riemann surface $X$ and the (generalized) divisor of the conical points of the metric $\mathfrak{T}$. We study the asymptotics of $\operatorname{reg}\zeta_\Delta(1)$ for the polyhedron obtained by sewing two other polyhedra along segments of small length. In addition, we calculate $\operatorname{reg}\zeta(1)$ for a family of (non-Friedrichs) self-adjoint extensions of the Laplacian on the tetrahedron with all the conical angles equal to $\pi$.</description>

      <title>General Chen-Ricci inequalities for Riemannian submersions and Riemannian maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive general forms of the Chen-Ricci inequalities for Riemannian submersions between Riemannian manifolds. We also derive general forms of the Chen-Ricci and improved Chen-Ricci inequalities for Riemannian maps between Riemannian manifolds, involving relations between the curvatures of subspaces of the source and target spaces. Further, we illustrate equality cases for all these general forms with two examples. These general forms yield new, easy, and elegant techniques that are fruitful in obtaining the Chen-Ricci inequalities for such smooth mappings with various structured manifolds. As applications, utilizing these general forms, we explicitly establish Chen-Ricci inequalities when the source manifolds of Riemannian submersions and the target manifolds of Riemannian maps belong to broader classes, such as generalized complex and generalized Sasakian space forms, particularly including real, complex, real K\"ahler, Sasakian, Kenmotsu, cosymplectic, and almost $C(\alpha)$ space forms. We also validate our approach by imposing appropriate conditions toward various particular existing cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17240v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discover some very general configuration results for constructing area-minimizing cones. In particular, given any closed minimal submanifold in some Euclidean sphere, every cone over the minimal product of sufficiently many copies of the submanifold turns out to be area-minimizing; meanwhile every cone over the minimal product of the submanifold and a round sphere of sufficiently large dimension is also area-minimizing. Here no additional geometric assumption (e.g. on isometry group or second fundamental form) is required. Moreover, we establish that the category of regular area-minimizing cones in Euclidean spaces and that of closed minimal submanifolds in Euclidean spheres share the same cardinality.</description>

      <title>Real Bers embedding on the line: Fisher-Rao linearization, Schwarzian curvature, and scattering coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a real-analytic counterpart of the Bers embedding for the Fr\'echet Lie group $\Diff^{-\infty}(\R)$ of decay-controlled diffeomorphisms of the line, and establish its connection to $L^p$ Fisher-Rao geometry on densities. For $p\in[1,\infty)$, the $p$-root map $\varphi\mapsto p(\varphi'^{1/p}-1)$ isometrically linearizes the homogeneous $\dot W^{1,p}$ Finsler metric on $\Diff^{-\infty}(\R)$, yielding explicit geodesics and a canonical flat connection whose Eulerian geodesic equation is the generalized Hunter-Saxton equation; for $p=\infty$, logarithmic coordinates $\varphi\mapsto\log\varphi'$ provide a global isometry and the Schwarzian derivative emerges as the projective curvature. We construct a real Bers map $\beta^{-\infty}\colon\Diff^{-\infty}(\R)/\Aff(\R)\to W^{\infty,1}(\R)$ via this Schwarzian, prove it is a Fr\'echet-smooth injective immersion whose linearization admits a tame right inverse given by an explicit Volterra operator, and characterize its image through Sturm-Liouville spectral theory. We introduce an $L^p$-Schwarzian family $S_p$ that interpolates between affine and projective cocycles, establish full asymptotic expansions as $p\to\infty$ in Fr\'echet and Orlicz-Sobolev scales, and extend the Bers embedding to Orlicz diffeomorphism groups. Through the Jacobian correspondence, these structures transfer to a manifold of densities asymptotic to Lebesgue measure, where the nonlinear Eulerian transport reduces to a pointwise Riccati law and the Schwarzian becomes the score curvature governing Fisher information. The compact-manifold $L^p$ Fisher-Rao linearization of Bauer, Bruveris, Harms, and Michor is recalled as a guiding framework.</description>

      <title>Explicit Hamiltonian representations of meromorphic connections and duality from different perspectives: a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present an explicit study of $\hbar$-deformed meromorphic connections in $\mathfrak{gl}_3(\mathbb{C})$ with an unramified irregular pole at infinity of order $r_\infty=3$ and its spectral dual corresponding to the $\mathfrak{gl}_2(\mathbb{C})$ Painlev\'{e} IV Lax pair. Using the apparent singularities and their dual partners on the spectral curves as Darboux coordinates, we obtain the Hamiltonian evolutions, the reduction of these evolutions to a single non-trivial direction, the Jimbo-Miwa-Ueno tau-functions, the fundamental symplectic two-forms and the associated Hermitian matrix models on both sides. We then prove that the spectral duality connecting both sides extends to all these aspects, providing an explicit illustration of the generalized Harnad duality. We finally propose a conjecture relating the Jimbo-Miwa-Ueno differential as the $\hbar=0$ evaluation of the Hamiltonian differential in these Darboux coordinates that could provide insights on the geometric interpretation of the $\hbar$ formal parameter. As a byproduct we also obtain a rank $3$ Lax pair for the Painlev\'{e} IV equation.</description>

      <title>An alternative solvability criterion for the Dirichlet problem for the minimal surface equation and an application to the mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09806v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an alternative condition for the solvability of the Dirichlet problem for the minimal surface equation that applies to non-mean convex domains. We introduce a structural condition, obtained from a second-order ordinary differential equation, which allows the construction of explicit boundary barriers and it can also be applied to unbounded domains. In the setting of Hadamard manifolds, this condition relates the geometry of the domain to the admissible boundary data in a direct way.
  In Euclidean space, the condition leads to solvability under geometric hypotheses of a different nature from those in the classical Jenkins-Serrin theory, and in some configurations it applies where the Jenkins-Serrin method does not. A central point of the present approach is that the geometric restrictions and the boundary data enter independently.
  The same barrier construction can be used for graphical mean curvature flow. This yields short-time existence with prescribed boundary values even when the boundary of the domain is not mean convex. When mean convexity is present, one recovers the classical graphical setting.</description>

      <title>Gromov's Compactness Theorem for the Intrinsic Timed-Hausdorff Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13069v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic timed-Hausdorff distance between timed-metric spaces, first introduced by Sakovich--Sormani, yields a weak notion of convergence for space-times. In this paper we prove a compactness theorem for the intrinsic timed-Hausdorff convergence of timed-metric spaces using timed-Fr\'echet maps. Our proof introduces the notion of "addresses" and provides a new way of stating Gromov's original compactness theorem for Gromov--Hausdorff convergence of metric spaces. We also obtain a new Arzel\`a--Ascoli theorem for real valued uniformly bounded Lipschitz functions on Gromov--Hausdorff converging compact metric spaces. Moreover, we establish the triangle inequality for the intrinsic timed-Hausdorff distance.</description>

      <title>Nearly optimal spectral gaps for random Belyi surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that a random hyperbolic surface in the Brooks-Makover model has a spectral gap greater than $\left(\frac{1}{4}-\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{221}}\right)$, confirming the nearly optimal spectral gap conjecture in this model.</description>
