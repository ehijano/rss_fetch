      <title>Beyond Earthly Limits: Protection against Cosmic Radiation through Biological Response Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming phase of space exploration not only includes trips to Mars and beyond, but also holds great promise for human progress. However, the vulnerability of space habitats to cosmic radiation, which consists of Galactic Cosmic Rays and Solar Particle Events, raises important safety concerns for astronauts and other living things that will accompany them. Research exploring the biological effects of cosmic radiation consists of experiments conducted in space itself and in simulated space environments on Earth. Notably, NASA's Space Radiation Laboratory has taken significant steps forward in simulating cosmic radiation by using particle accelerators, marking a notable advancement in this field. Intriguingly, much of the research emphasis thus far has been on understanding how cosmic radiation impacts living organisms, instead of finding ways to help them resist the radiation. In this paper, we briefly talk about current research on the biological effects of cosmic radiation and propose possible protective measures through biological interventions. In our opinion, biological pathways responsible for coping with stressors on Earth offer potential solutions for protection against the stress caused by cosmic radiation. Additionally, we recommend assessing the effectiveness of these pathways through experiments using particle accelerators to simulate the effects of cosmic radiation.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of thermal active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active matter concerns many-body systems comprised of living or self-driven agents that collectively exhibit macroscopic phenomena distinct from conventional passive matter. Using Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theory, we develop a novel hydrodynamic framework for thermal active matter that accounts for local temperature variations and the ensuing stochastic effects. This framework provides a deeper understanding of energy balance, second law of thermodynamics, and thermostated steady states in active matter, while also addressing the systematic violations of fluctuation-dissipation theorem and detailed balance. We use our framework of active hydrodynamics to develop effective field theory actions for active superfluids and active nematics that offer a first-principle derivation of various active transport coefficients and feature activity-induced phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram and Coarsening dynamics in dry apolar Active Nematics with Reciprocal local alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Lebwohl-Lasher interaction for reciprocal local alignment, we present a comprehensive phase diagram for a dry, apolar, active nematic system using its stochastic dynamics. The nematic-isotropic transition in this system is first-order and fluctuation-dominated. Our phase diagram identifies three distinct regions based on activity and orientational noise relative to alignment strength: a homogeneous isotropic phase, a nematic phase with giant density fluctuations, and a coexistence region. Using mean-field analysis and hydrodynamic theory, we demonstrate that reciprocal interactions lead to a density fluctuation-induced first-order transition and derive a phase boundary consistent with numerical results. Quenching from the isotropic to nematic phase reveals coarsening dynamics with distinctive scaling behaviors for density and nematic fields, exhibiting exponents between 2 and 3, typical of non-conserved and conserved dynamics.</description>

      <title>Uni-Mol Docking V2: Towards Realistic and Accurate Binding Pose Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, machine learning (ML) methods have emerged as promising alternatives for molecular docking, offering the potential for high accuracy without incurring prohibitive computational costs. However, recent studies have indicated that these ML models may overfit to quantitative metrics while neglecting the physical constraints inherent in the problem. In this work, we present Uni-Mol Docking V2, which demonstrates a remarkable improvement in performance, accurately predicting the binding poses of 77+% of ligands in the PoseBusters benchmark with an RMSD value of less than 2.0 {\AA}, and 75+% passing all quality checks. This represents a significant increase from the 62% achieved by the previous Uni-Mol Docking model. Notably, our Uni-Mol Docking approach generates chemically accurate predictions, circumventing issues such as chirality inversions and steric clashes that have plagued previous ML models. Furthermore, we observe enhanced performance in terms of high-quality predictions (RMSD values of less than 1.0 {\AA} and 1.5 {\AA}) and physical soundness when Uni-Mol Docking is combined with more physics-based methods like Uni-Dock. Our results represent a significant advancement in the application of artificial intelligence for scientific research, adopting a holistic approach to ligand docking that is well-suited for industrial applications in virtual screening and drug design. The code, data and service for Uni-Mol Docking are publicly available for use and further development in https://github.com/dptech-corp/Uni-Mol.</description>

      <title>Gradient descent optimization of acoustic holograms for transcranial focused ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Acoustic holographic lenses, also known as acoustic holograms, can change the phase of a transmitted wavefront in order to shape and construct complex ultrasound pressure fields, often for focusing the acoustic energy on a target region. These lenses have been proposed for transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) to create diffraction-limited focal zones that target specific brain regions while compensating for skull aberration. Holograms for tFUS are currently designed using time-reversal approaches in full-wave time-domain numerical simulations. However, such simulations need time-consuming computations, which severely limits the adoption of iterative optimization strategies. Furthermore, in the time-reversal method, the number and distribution of virtual sources can significantly influence the final sound field. Because of the computational constraints, predicting these effects and determining the optimal arrangement is challenging. This study introduces an efficient method for designing acoustic holograms using a volumetric holographic technique to generate focused fields inside the skull. The proposed method combines a modified mixed-domain method for ultrasonic propagation with a gradient descent iterative optimization algorithm. This approach enables substantially faster holographic computation than previously reported techniques. The iterative process uses explicitly defined loss functions to bias the ultrasound field's optimization parameters to specific desired characteristics, such as axial resolution, transversal resolution, coverage, and focal region uniformity, while eliminating the uncertainty associated with virtual sources in time-reversal techniques. Numerical studies are conducted on four brain structures: the anterior insula, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, and amygdala. The findings are further validated in underwater experiments with a 3D-printed skull phantom.</description>

      <title>Optimal input reverberation and homeostatic self-organization towards the edge of synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transient or partial synchronization can be used to do computations, although a fully synchronized network is frequently related to epileptic seizures. Here, we propose a homeostatic mechanism that is capable of maintaining a neuronal network at the edge of a synchronization transition, thereby avoiding the harmful consequences of a fully synchronized network. We model neurons by maps since they are dynamically richer than integrate-and-fire models and more computationally efficient than conductance-based approaches. We first describe the synchronization phase transition of a dense network of neurons with different tonic spiking frequencies coupled by gap junctions. We show that at the transition critical point, inputs optimally reverberate through the network activity through transient synchronization. Then, we introduce a local homeostatic dynamic in the synaptic coupling and show that it produces a robust self-organization toward the edge of this phase transition. We discuss the potential biological consequences of this self-organization process, such as its relation to the Brain Criticality hypothesis, its input processing capacity, and how its malfunction could lead to pathological synchronization.</description>

      <title>A Compositional Approach to Higher-Order Structure in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relating microscopic interactions to macroscopic observables is a central challenge in the study of complex systems. Addressing this question requires understanding both pairwise and higher-order interactions, but the latter are less well understood. Here, we show that the M\"obius inversion theorem provides a general mathematical formalism for deriving higher-order interactions from macroscopic observables, relative to a chosen decomposition of the system into parts. Applying this framework to a diverse range of systems, we demonstrate that many existing notions of higher-order interactions, from epistasis in genetics and many-body couplings in physics, to synergy in game theory and artificial intelligence, naturally arise from an appropriate mereological decomposition. By revealing the common mathematical structure underlying seemingly disparate phenomena, our work highlights the fundamental role of decomposition choice in the definition and estimation of higher-order interactions. We discuss how this unifying perspective can facilitate the transfer of insights between domains, guide the selection of appropriate system decompositions, and motivate the search for novel interaction types through creative decomposition strategies. More broadly, our results suggest that the M\"obius inversion theorem provides a powerful lens for understanding the emergence of complex behaviour from the interplay of microscopic parts, with applications across a wide range of disciplines.</description>

      <title>Effects of skull properties on transcranial focused ultrasound transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08489v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transcranial focused ultrasound can deliver energy to the brain in a minimally invasive manner for a variety of clinical applications. However, acoustic inhomogeneities within the skull cause significant wave interactions, leading to difficulties in predicting the energy delivered to the target. We present a comprehensive examination of intracranial acoustic fields generated by focused ultrasound transducers and assess the characteristics of cranial bone that affect acoustic transmission. Acoustic field maps were generated at 88 regions of interest across 10 historical and 2 Thiel-embalmed human skull specimens with sonication at frequencies of 220 kHz, 650 kHz, and 1000 kHz. The average peak pressure attenuation was $3.1 \pm 1.4$ dB, $9.0 \pm 1.7$ dB, and $14.6 \pm 4.1$ dB, respectively. The average power attenuation was $5.0 \pm 2.4$ dB, $14.9 \pm 3.2$ dB, and $24.1 \pm 6.3$ dB, respectively. The effect of skull thickness, skull density ratio, and skull curvature on intracranial peak pressure and power was investigated and linear fits produced. Our results demonstrate that Thiel-embalmed samples fall within the confidence intervals of fits for historical samples. The effects of angulation and spacing between the transducer and the skull were also investigated. Results indicate that wave superposition resulting from skull and transducer spacing could lead to a 30-40% uncertainty in peak recorded intracranial pressure.</description>
