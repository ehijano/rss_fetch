      <title>ScenicProver: A Framework for Compositional Probabilistic Verification of Learning-Enabled Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full verification of learning-enabled cyber-physical systems (CPS) has long been intractable due to challenges including black-box components and complex real-world environments. Existing tools either provide formal guarantees for limited types of systems or test the system as a monolith, but no general framework exists for compositional analysis of learning-enabled CPS using varied verification techniques over complex real-world environments. This paper introduces ScenicProver, a verification framework that aims to fill this gap. Built upon the Scenic probabilistic programming language, the framework supports: (1) compositional system description with clear component interfaces, ranging from interpretable code to black boxes; (2) assume-guarantee contracts over those components using an extension of Linear Temporal Logic containing arbitrary Scenic expressions; (3) evidence generation through testing, formal proofs via Lean 4 integration, and importing external assumptions; (4) systematic combination of generated evidence using contract operators; and (5) automatic generation of assurance cases tracking the provenance of system-level guarantees. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through a case study on an autonomous vehicle's automatic emergency braking system with sensor fusion. By leveraging manufacturer guarantees for radar and laser sensors and focusing testing efforts on uncertain conditions, our approach enables stronger probabilistic guarantees than monolithic testing with the same computational budget.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative linear logic fragments with sub-context-free complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new descriptive complexity characterisations of classes REG (regular languages), LCFL (linear context-free languages) and CFL (context-free languages) as restrictions on inference rules, size of formulae and permitted connectives in the Lambek calculus; fragments of the intuitionistic non-commutative linear logic with direction-sensitive implication connectives. Our identification of the Lambek calculus fragments with proof complexity REG and LCFL is the first result of its kind. We further show the CFL complexity of one of the strictly `weakest' possible variants of the logic, admitting only a single inference rule. The proof thereof, moreover, is based on a direct translation between type-logical and formal grammar and structural induction on provable sequents; a simpler and more intuitive method than those employed in prior works. We thereby establish a clear conceptual utility of the Cut-elimination theorem for comparing formal grammar and sequent calculus, and identify the exact analogue of the Greibach Normal Form in Lambek grammar. We believe the result presented herein constitutes a first step toward a more extensive and richer characterisation of the interaction between computation and logic, as well as a finer-grained complexity separation of various sequent calculi.</description>

      <title>Large Lemma Miners: Can LLMs do Induction Proofs for Hardware?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential for solving mathematical tasks. We show that LLMs can be utilized to generate proofs by induction for hardware verification and thereby replace some of the manual work done by Formal Verification engineers and deliver industrial value. We present a neurosymbolic approach that includes two prompting frameworks to generate candidate invariants, which are checked using a formal, symbolic tool. Our results indicate that with sufficient reprompting, LLMs are able to generate inductive arguments for mid-size open-source RTL designs. For $87\%$ of our problem set, at least one of the prompt setups succeeded in producing a provably correct inductive argument.</description>

      <title>The Limit of Recursion in State-based Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that omega^2 strictly bounds the iterations required for modal definable functions to reach a fixed point across all countable structures. The result corrects and extends the previously claimed result by the first and third authors on closure ordinals of the alternation-free mu-calculus in [3]. The new approach sees a reincarnation of Kozen's well-annotations, devised for showing the finite model property for the modal mu-calculus. We develop a theory of 'conservative' well-annotations where minimality of annotations is guaranteed, and isolate parts of the structure that locally determine the closure ordinal of relevant formulas. This adoption of well-annotations enables a direct and clear pumping process that rules out closure ordinals between omega^2 and the limit of countability.

      <title>Nominal Algebraic-Coalgebraic Data Types, with Applications to Infinitary Lambda-Calculi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ten years ago, it was shown that nominal techniques can be used to design coalgebraic data types with variable binding, so that alpha-equivalence classes of infinitary terms are directly endowed with a corecursion principle. We introduce "mixed" binding signatures, as well as the corresponding type of mixed inductive-coinductive terms. We extend the aforementioned work to this setting. In particular, this allows for a nominal description of the sets Lambda_abc of abc-infinitary lambda-terms (for a, b, c in {0,1}) and of capture-avoiding substitution on alpha-equivalence classes of such terms.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Exponential-Space Hierarchy Via Partial Fixpoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characterization of PSPACE-queries over ordered structures as exactly those expressible in first-order logic with partial fixpoints (Vardi'82) is one of the classical results in the field of descriptive complexity. In this paper, we extend this result to characterizations of k-EXPSPACE-queries for arbitrary k, characterizing them as exactly those expressible in order-k+1-higher-order logic with partial fixpoints. For k&gt;1, the restriction to ordered structures is no longer necessary due to the high expressive power of higher-order logic.</description>

      <title>The mu-calculus' Alternation Hierarchy is Strict over Non-Trivial Fusion Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modal mu-calculus is obtained by adding least and greatest fixed-point operators to modal logic. Its alternation hierarchy classifies the mu-formulas by their alternation depth: a measure of the codependence of their least and greatest fixed-point operators. The mu-calculus' alternation hierarchy is strict over the class of all Kripke frames: for all n, there is a mu-formula with alternation depth n+1 which is not equivalent to any formula with alternation depth n. This does not always happen if we restrict the semantics. For example, every mu-formula is equivalent to a formula without fixed-point operators over S5 frames. We show that the multimodal mu-calculus' alternation hierarchy is strict over non-trivial fusions of modal logics. We also comment on two examples of multimodal logics where the mu-calculus collapses to modal logic.

      <title>Monadic Second-Order Logic of Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Permutations can be viewed as pairs of linear orders, or more formally as models over a signature consisting of two binary relation symbols. This approach was adopted by Albert, Bouvel and F\'eray, who studied the expressibility of first-order logic in this setting. We focus our attention on monadic second-order logic.
  Our results go in two directions. First, we investigate the expressive power of monadic second-order logic. We exhibit natural properties of permutations that can be expressed in monadic second-order logic but not in first-order logic. Additionally, we show that the property of having a fixed point is inexpressible even in monadic second-order logic.
  Secondly, we focus on the complexity of monadic second-order model checking. We show that there is an algorithm deciding if a permutation $\pi$ satisfies a given monadic second-order sentence $\varphi$ in time $f(|\varphi|, \operatorname{tw}(\pi)) \cdot n$ for some computable function $f$ where $n = |\pi|$ and $\operatorname{tw}(\pi)$ is the tree-width of $\pi$. On the other hand, we prove that the problem remains hard even when we restrict the permutation $\pi$ to a fixed hereditary class $\mathcal{C}$ with mild assumptions on $\mathcal{C}$.</description>

      <title>Ruitenburg's Theorem Mechanized and Contextualized</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1984, Wim Ruitenburg published a surprising result about periodic sequences in intuitionistic propositional calculus (IPC). The property established by Ruitenburg naturally generalizes local finiteness; recall that intuitionistic logic is not locally finite, even in a single variable. One of the two main goals of this note is to illustrate that most "natural" non-classical logics failing local finiteness also do not enjoy the periodic sequence property. IPC is quite unique in separating these properties. The other goal of this note is to present a Coq formalization of Ruitenburg's heavily syntactic proof. Apart from ensuring its correctness, the formalization allows extraction of a program providing a certified implementation of Ruitenburg's algorithm.</description>

Abstract: We consider modal logic extended with the well-known temporal operator 'eventually' and provide a cut-elimination procedure for a cyclic sequent calculus that captures this fragment. The work showcases an adaptation of the reductive cut-elimination method to cyclic calculi. Notably, the proposed algorithm applies to a cyclic proof and directly outputs a cyclic cut-free proof without appealing to intermediate machinery for regularising the end proof.</description>

      <title>A Proof-Theoretic Approach to the Semantics of Classical Linear Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear logic (LL) is a resource-aware, abstract logic programming language that refines both classical and intuitionistic logic. Linear logic semantics is typically presented in one of two ways: by associating each formula with the set of all contexts that can be used to prove it (e.g. phase semantics) or by assigning meaning directly to proofs (e.g. coherence spaces).
  This work proposes a different perspective on assigning meaning to proofs by adopting a proof-theoretic perspective. More specifically, we employ base-extension semantics (BeS) to characterise proofs through the notion of base support.
  Recent developments have shown that BeS is powerful enough to capture proof-theoretic notions in structurally rich logics such as intuitionistic linear logic. In this paper, we extend this framework to the classical case, presenting a proof-theoretic approach to the semantics of the multiplicative-additive fragment of linear logic (MALL).</description>

      <title>Cyclic Proofs for iGL via Corecursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cyclic proof theory studies proofs where cycles are allowed. This is useful for developing proof theory for logics with fixpoint operators: cycles can be used to represent the unfolding of a fixpoint. However, this cyclic character is not unique to such explicit fixpoints. For example, modal logics whose frames have a Noetherian (conversely wellfounded) condition, such as GL (Goedel-Loeb logic), S4Grz (Grzegorczyk logic) and K4Grz also have cyclic proof systems.
  Particularly, Shamkanov introduces a non-wellfounded and a cyclic sequent system GL. He proves the equivalence of these two systems with an acyclic finite system via proof translations. In order to go from the finite system to the non-wellfounded system he defines the translation by corecursion.
  Iemhoff generalized the work of Shamkanov studying when, for a given modal logic proof system, there exists another modal logic proof system such that proofs in the first are equivalent to cyclic proofs in the second. There, she shows that iGL, an intuitionistic version of GL, also has a natural cyclic proof system.
  We provide an alternative proof of the equivalence of a standard calculus for iGL and a cyclic one.</description>

      <title>Faster Game Solving by Fixpoint Acceleration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for solving parity games with acyclic (DAG) sub-structures by computing nested fixpoints of a DAG attractor function that lives over the non-DAG parts of the game, thereby restricting the domain of the involved fixpoint operators. Intuitively, this corresponds to accelerating fixpoint computation by inlining cycle-free parts during the solution of parity games, leading to earlier convergence. We also present an economic later-appearance-record construction that takes Emerson-Lei games to parity games, and show that it preserves DAG sub-structures; it follows that the proposed method can be used also for the accelerated solution of Emerson-Lei games.</description>

      <title>APOLLO: Automated LLM and Lean Collaboration for Advanced Formal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05758v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Formal reasoning and automated theorem proving constitute a challenging subfield of machine learning, in which machines are tasked with proving mathematical theorems using formal languages like Lean. A formal verification system can check whether a formal proof is correct or not almost instantaneously, but generating a completely correct formal proof with large language models (LLMs) remains a formidable task. The usual approach in the literature is to prompt the LLM many times (up to several thousands) until one of the generated proofs passes the verification system. In this work, we present APOLLO (Automated PrOof repair viaLLM and Lean cOllaboration), a modular, model-agnostic agentic framework that combines the strengths of the Lean compiler with an LLM's reasoning abilities to achieve better proof-generation results at a low token and sampling budgets. Apollo directs a fully automated process in which the LLM generates proofs for theorems, a set of agents analyze the proofs, fix the syntax errors, identify the mistakes in the proofs using Lean, isolate failing sub-lemmas, utilize automated solvers, and invoke an LLM on each remaining goal with a low top-K budget. The repaired sub-proofs are recombined and reverified, iterating up to a user-controlled maximum number of attempts. On the miniF2F benchmark, we establish a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 84.9% among sub 8B-parameter models (as of August 2025) while keeping the sampling budget below one hundred. Moreover, Apollo raises the state-of-the-art accuracy for Goedel-Prover-SFT to 65.6% while cutting sample complexity from 25,600 to a few hundred. General-purpose models (o3-mini, o4-mini) jump from 3-7% to over 40% accuracy. Our results demonstrate that targeted, compiler-guided repair of LLM outputs yields dramatic gains in both efficiency and correctness, suggesting a general paradigm for scalable automated theorem proving.</description>
