      <title>Integrating SPARQL and LLMs for Question Answering over Scholarly Data Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Scholarly Hybrid Question Answering over Linked Data (QALD) Challenge at International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC) 2024 focuses on Question Answering (QA) over diverse scholarly sources: DBLP, SemOpenAlex, and Wikipedia-based texts. This paper describes a methodology that combines SPARQL queries, divide and conquer algorithms, and BERT-based-case-SQuad2 predictions. It starts with SPARQL queries to gather data, then applies divide and conquer to manage various question types and sources, and uses BERT to handle personal author questions. The approach, evaluated with Exact Match and F-score metrics, shows promise for improving QA accuracy and efficiency in scholarly contexts.</description>

      <title>TTT4Rec: A Test-Time Training Approach for Rapid Adaption in Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation tasks, which aim to predict the next item a user will interact with, typically rely on models trained solely on historical data. However, in real-world scenarios, user behavior can fluctuate in the long interaction sequences, and training data may be limited to model this dynamics. To address this, Test-Time Training (TTT) offers a novel approach by using self-supervised learning during inference to dynamically update model parameters. This allows the model to adapt to new user interactions in real-time, leading to more accurate recommendations. In this paper, we propose TTT4Rec, a sequential recommendation framework that integrates TTT to better capture dynamic user behavior. By continuously updating model parameters during inference, TTT4Rec is particularly effective in scenarios where user interaction sequences are long, training data is limited, or user behavior is highly variable. We evaluate TTT4Rec on three widely-used recommendation datasets, demonstrating that it achieves performance on par with or exceeding state-of-the-art models. The codes are available at https://github.com/ZhaoqiZachYang/TTT4Rec.</description>

      <title>TwinCL: A Twin Graph Contrastive Learning Model for Collaborative Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the domain of recommendation and collaborative filtering, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has become an influential approach. Nevertheless, the reasons for the effectiveness of contrastive learning are still not well understood. In this paper, we challenge the conventional use of random augmentations on graph structure or embedding space in GCL, which may disrupt the structural and semantic information inherent in Graph Neural Networks. Moreover, fixed-rate data augmentation proves to be less effective compared to augmentation with an adaptive rate. In the initial training phases, significant perturbations are more suitable, while as the training approaches convergence, milder perturbations yield better results. We introduce a twin encoder in place of random augmentations, demonstrating the redundancy of traditional augmentation techniques. The twin encoder updating mechanism ensures the generation of more diverse contrastive views in the early stages, transitioning to views with greater similarity as training progresses. In addition, we investigate the learned representations from the perspective of alignment and uniformity on a hypersphere to optimize more efficiently. Our proposed Twin Graph Contrastive Learning model -- TwinCL -- aligns positive pairs of user and item embeddings and the representations from the twin encoder while maintaining the uniformity of the embeddings on the hypersphere. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed model optimizing alignment and uniformity with the twin encoder contributes to better recommendation accuracy and training efficiency performance. In comprehensive experiments on three public datasets, our proposed TwinCL achieves an average improvement of 5.6% (NDCG@10) in recommendation accuracy with faster training speed, while effectively mitigating popularity bias.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Multi-threaded Collaborative Filtering Approach in Recommendation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems are a subset of information filtering systems designed to predict and suggest items that users may find interesting or relevant based on their preferences, behaviors, or interactions. By analyzing user data such as past activities, ratings, and preferences, these systems generate personalized recommendations for products, services, or content, with common applications including online retail, media streaming platforms, and social media. Recommender systems are typically categorized into three types: content-based filtering, which recommends items similar to those the user has shown interest in; collaborative filtering, which analyzes the preferences of similar users; and hybrid methods, which combine both approaches to improve accuracy. These systems enhance user experience by reducing information overload and providing personalized suggestions, thus increasing engagement and satisfaction. However, building a scalable recommendation system capable of handling numerous users efficiently is a significant challenge, particularly when considering both performance consistency and user data security, which are emerging research topics. The primary objective of this research is to address these challenges by reducing the processing time in recommendation systems. A multithreaded similarity approach is employed to achieve this, where users are divided into independent threads that run in parallel. This parallelization significantly reduces computation time compared to traditional methods, resulting in a faster, more efficient, and scalable recommendation system that ensures improved performance without compromising user data security.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Collaborative Filtering in a Personalized Research-Paper Recommendation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommendation system is such a platform that helps people to easily find out the things they need within a few seconds. It is implemented based on the preferences of similar users or items. In this digital era, the internet has provided us with huge opportunities to use a lot of open resources for our own needs. But there are too many resources on the internet from which finding the precise one is a difficult job. Recommendation system has made this easier for people. Research-paper recommendation system is a system that is developed for people with common research interests using a collaborative filtering recommender system. In this paper, coauthor, keyword, reference, and common citation similarities are calculated using Jaccard Similarity to find the final similarity and to find the top-n similar users. Based on the test of top-n similar users of the target user research paper recommendations have been made. Finally, the accuracy of our recommendation system has been calculated. An impressive result has been found using our proposed system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel method for extracting information from HTML tables with similar contents but with a different structure. We aim to integrate multiple HTML tables into a single table for retrieval of information containing in various Web pages. The method is designed by extending tree-structured LSTM, the neural network for tree-structured data, in order to extract information that is both linguistic and structural information of HTML data. We evaluate the proposed method through experiments using real data published on the WWW.</description>

      <title>Meta Learning to Rank for Sparsely Supervised Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervisory signals are a critical resource for training learning to rank models. In many real-world search and retrieval scenarios, these signals may not be readily available or could be costly to obtain for some queries. The examples include domains where labeling requires professional expertise, applications with strong privacy constraints, and user engagement information that are too scarce. We refer to these scenarios as sparsely supervised queries which pose significant challenges to traditional learning to rank models. In this work, we address sparsely supervised queries by proposing a novel meta learning to rank framework which leverages fast learning and adaption capability of meta-learning. The proposed approach accounts for the fact that different queries have different optimal parameters for their rankers, in contrast to traditional learning to rank models which only learn a global ranking model applied to all the queries. In consequence, the proposed method would yield significant advantages especially when new queries are of different characteristics with the training queries. Moreover, the proposed meta learning to rank framework is generic and flexible. We conduct a set of comprehensive experiments on both public datasets and a real-world e-commerce dataset. The results demonstrate that the proposed meta-learning approach can significantly enhance the performance of learning to rank models with sparsely labeled queries.</description>

      <title>The Devil is in the Sources! Knowledge Enhanced Cross-Domain Recommendation in an Information Bottleneck Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-domain Recommendation (CDR) aims to alleviate the data sparsity and the cold-start problems in traditional recommender systems by leveraging knowledge from an informative source domain. However, previously proposed CDR models pursue an imprudent assumption that the entire information from the source domain is equally contributed to the target domain, neglecting the evil part that is completely irrelevant to users' intrinsic interest. To address this concern, in this paper, we propose a novel knowledge enhanced cross-domain recommendation framework named CoTrans, which remolds the core procedures of CDR models with: Compression on the knowledge from the source domain and Transfer of the purity to the target domain. Specifically, following the theory of Graph Information Bottleneck, CoTrans first compresses the source behaviors with the perception of information from the target domain. Then to preserve all the important information for the CDR task, the feedback signals from both domains are utilized to promote the effectiveness of the transfer procedure. Additionally, a knowledge-enhanced encoder is employed to narrow gaps caused by the non-overlapped items across separate domains. Comprehensive experiments on three widely used cross-domain datasets demonstrate that CoTrans significantly outperforms both single-domain and state-of-the-art cross-domain recommendation approaches.</description>

Abstract: We propose a domain-adapted reward model that works alongside an Offline A/B testing system for evaluating ranking models. This approach effectively measures reward for ranking model changes in large-scale Ads recommender systems, where model-free methods like IPS are not feasible. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed technique outperforms both the vanilla IPS method and approaches using non-generalized reward models.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Empowered Embedding Generator for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential Recommender Systems (SRS) are extensively applied across various domains to predict users' next interaction by modeling their interaction sequences. However, these systems typically grapple with the long-tail problem, where they struggle to recommend items that are less popular. This challenge results in a decline in user discovery and reduced earnings for vendors, negatively impacting the system as a whole. Large Language Model (LLM) has the potential to understand the semantic connections between items, regardless of their popularity, positioning them as a viable solution to this dilemma. In our paper, we present LLMEmb, an innovative technique that harnesses LLM to create item embeddings that bolster the performance of SRS. To align the capabilities of general-purpose LLM with the needs of the recommendation domain, we introduce a method called Supervised Contrastive Fine-Tuning (SCFT). This method involves attribute-level data augmentation and a custom contrastive loss designed to tailor LLM for enhanced recommendation performance. Moreover, we highlight the necessity of incorporating collaborative filtering signals into LLM-generated embeddings and propose Recommendation Adaptation Training (RAT) for this purpose. RAT refines the embeddings to be optimally suited for SRS. The embeddings derived from LLMEmb can be easily integrated with any SRS model, showcasing its practical utility. Extensive experimentation on three real-world datasets has shown that LLMEmb significantly improves upon current methods when applied across different SRS models.</description>

      <title>Enhancing High-order Interaction Awareness in LLM-based Recommender Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated prominent reasoning capabilities in recommendation tasks by transforming them into text-generation tasks. % many NLP applications including However, existing approaches either disregard or ineffectively model the user--item high-order interactions. To this end, this paper presents an enhanced LLM-based recommender (ELMRec). We enhance whole-word embeddings to substantially enhance LLMs' interpretation of graph-constructed interactions for recommendations, without requiring graph pre-training. This finding may inspire endeavors to incorporate rich knowledge graphs into LLM-based recommenders via whole-word embedding. We also found that LLMs often recommend items based on users' earlier interactions rather than recent ones, and present a reranking solution. Our ELMRec outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both direct and sequential recommendations.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Propensity Bias of Large Language Models for Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) creates new opportunities for recommender systems, especially by exploiting the side information (e.g., descriptions and analyses of items) generated by these models. However, aligning this side information with collaborative information from historical interactions poses significant challenges. The inherent biases within LLMs can skew recommendations, resulting in distorted and potentially unfair user experiences. On the other hand, propensity bias causes side information to be aligned in such a way that it often tends to represent all inputs in a low-dimensional subspace, leading to a phenomenon known as dimensional collapse, which severely restricts the recommender system's ability to capture user preferences and behaviours. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework named Counterfactual LLM Recommendation (CLLMR). Specifically, we propose a spectrum-based side information encoder that implicitly embeds structural information from historical interactions into the side information representation, thereby circumventing the risk of dimension collapse. Furthermore, our CLLMR approach explores the causal relationships inherent in LLM-based recommender systems. By leveraging counterfactual inference, we counteract the biases introduced by LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CLLMR approach consistently enhances the performance of various recommender models.</description>

      <title>Mixed-Precision Embeddings for Large-Scale Recommendation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embedding techniques have become essential components of large databases in the deep learning era. By encoding discrete entities, such as words, items, or graph nodes, into continuous vector spaces, embeddings facilitate more efficient storage, retrieval, and processing in large databases. Especially in the domain of recommender systems, millions of categorical features are encoded as unique embedding vectors, which facilitates the modeling of similarities and interactions among features. However, numerous embedding vectors can result in significant storage overhead. In this paper, we aim to compress the embedding table through quantization techniques. Given that features vary in importance levels, we seek to identify an appropriate precision for each feature to balance model accuracy and memory usage. To this end, we propose a novel embedding compression method, termed Mixed-Precision Embeddings (MPE). Specifically, to reduce the size of the search space, we first group features by frequency and then search precision for each feature group. MPE further learns the probability distribution over precision levels for each feature group, which can be used to identify the most suitable precision with a specially designed sampling strategy. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that MPE significantly outperforms existing embedding compression methods. Remarkably, MPE achieves about 200x compression on the Criteo dataset without comprising the prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Lab-AI -- Retrieval-Augmented Language Model for Personalized Lab Test Interpretation in Clinical Medicine</title>

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of lab results is crucial in clinical medicine, yet most patient portals use universal normal ranges, ignoring factors like age and gender. This study introduces Lab-AI, an interactive system that offers personalized normal ranges using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) from credible health sources. Lab-AI has two modules: factor retrieval and normal range retrieval. We tested these on 68 lab tests-30 with conditional factors and 38 without. For tests with factors, normal ranges depend on patient-specific information. Our results show that GPT-4-turbo with RAG achieved a 0.95 F1 score for factor retrieval and 0.993 accuracy for normal range retrieval. GPT-4-turbo with RAG outperformed the best non-RAG system by 29.1% in factor retrieval and showed 60.9% and 52.9% improvements in question-level and lab-level performance, respectively, for normal range retrieval. These findings highlight Lab-AI's potential to enhance patient understanding of lab results.</description>

      <title>FLEX: Expert-level False-Less EXecution Metric for Reliable Text-to-SQL Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL technology has become crucial for translating natural language into SQL queries in various industries, enabling non-technical users to perform complex data operations. The need for accurate evaluation methods has increased as these systems have grown more sophisticated. However, we found that the Execution Accuracy (EX), the most promising evaluation metric, still shows a substantial portion of false positives and negatives compared to human evaluation. Thus, this paper introduces FLEX (False-Less EXecution), a novel approach to evaluating text-to-SQL systems using large language models (LLMs) to emulate human expert-level evaluation of SQL queries. Our method shows significantly higher agreement with human expert judgments, improving Cohen's kappa from 61 to 78.17. Re-evaluating top-performing models on the Spider and BIRD benchmarks using FLEX reveals substantial shifts in performance rankings, with an average performance decrease of 3.15 due to false positive corrections and an increase of 6.07 from addressing false negatives. This work contributes to a more accurate and nuanced evaluation of text-to-SQL systems, potentially reshaping our understanding of state-of-the-art performance in this field.</description>

      <title>Crafting Personalized Agents through Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Editable Memory Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the age of mobile internet, user data, often referred to as memories, is continuously generated on personal devices. Effectively managing and utilizing this data to deliver services to users is a compelling research topic. In this paper, we introduce a novel task of crafting personalized agents powered by large language models (LLMs), which utilize a user's smartphone memories to enhance downstream applications with advanced LLM capabilities. To achieve this goal, we introduce EMG-RAG, a solution that combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques with an Editable Memory Graph (EMG). This approach is further optimized using Reinforcement Learning to address three distinct challenges: data collection, editability, and selectability. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset validate the effectiveness of EMG-RAG, achieving an improvement of approximately 10% over the best existing approach. Additionally, the personalized agents have been transferred into a real smartphone AI assistant, which leads to enhanced usability.</description>

      <title>ASTRA: Accurate and Scalable ANNS-based Training of Extreme Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: `Extreme Classification'' (or XC) is the task of annotating data points (queries) with relevant labels (documents), from an extremely large set of $L$ possible labels, arising in search and recommendations. The most successful deep learning paradigm that has emerged over the last decade or so for XC is to embed the queries (and labels) using a deep encoder (e.g. DistilBERT), and use linear classifiers on top of the query embeddings. This architecture is of appeal because it enables millisecond-time inference using approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS). The key question is how do we design training algorithms that are accurate as well as scale to $O(100M)$ labels on a limited number of GPUs.
  State-of-the-art XC techniques that demonstrate high accuracies (e.g., DEXML, Ren\'ee, DEXA) on standard datasets have per-epoch training time that scales as $O(L)$ or employ expensive negative sampling strategies, which are prohibitive in XC scenarios. In this work, we develop an accurate and scalable XC algorithm ASTRA with two key observations: (a) building ANNS index on the classifier vectors and retrieving hard negatives using the classifiers aligns the negative sampling strategy to the loss function optimized; (b) keeping the ANNS indices current as the classifiers change through the epochs is prohibitively expensive while using stale negatives (refreshed periodically) results in poor accuracy; to remedy this, we propose a negative sampling strategy that uses a mixture of importance sampling and uniform sampling. By extensive evaluation on standard XC as well as proprietary datasets with 120M labels, we demonstrate that ASTRA achieves SOTA precision, while reducing training time by 4x-15x relative to the second best.</description>

      <title>OM4OV: Leveraging Ontology Matching for Ontology Versioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the dynamic nature of the semantic web, ontology version control is required to capture time-varying information, most importantly for widely-used ontologies. Despite the long-standing recognition of ontology versioning (OV) as a crucial component for efficient ontology management, the growing size of ontologies and accumulating errors caused by manual labour overwhelm current OV approaches. In this paper, we propose yet another approach to performing OV using existing ontology matching (OM) techniques and systems. We introduce a unified OM4OV pipeline. From an OM perspective, we reconstruct a new task formulation, performance measurement, and dataset construction for OV tasks. Reusing the prior alignment(s) from OM, we also propose a cross-reference mechanism to effectively reduce the matching candidature and improve overall OV performance. We experimentally validate the OM4OV pipeline and its cross-reference mechanism using three datasets from the Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) and exploit insights on OM used for OV tasks.</description>

      <title>Cross-Modal Retrieval: A Systematic Review of Methods and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14263v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the exponential surge in diverse multi-modal data, traditional uni-modal retrieval methods struggle to meet the needs of users seeking access to data across various modalities. To address this, cross-modal retrieval has emerged, enabling interaction across modalities, facilitating semantic matching, and leveraging complementarity and consistency between heterogeneous data. Although prior literature has reviewed the field of cross-modal retrieval, it suffers from numerous deficiencies in terms of timeliness, taxonomy, and comprehensiveness. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of cross-modal retrieval's evolution, spanning from shallow statistical analysis techniques to vision-language pre-training models. Commencing with a comprehensive taxonomy grounded in machine learning paradigms, mechanisms, and models, the paper delves deeply into the principles and architectures underpinning existing cross-modal retrieval methods. Furthermore, it offers an overview of widely-used benchmarks, metrics, and performances. Lastly, the paper probes the prospects and challenges that confront contemporary cross-modal retrieval, while engaging in a discourse on potential directions for further progress in the field. To facilitate the ongoing research on cross-modal retrieval, we develop a user-friendly toolbox and an open-source repository at https://cross-modal-retrieval.github.io.</description>

      <title>Robust portfolio optimization for recommender systems considering uncertainty of estimated statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with portfolio optimization models for creating high-quality lists of recommended items to balance the accuracy and diversity of recommendations. However, the statistics (i.e., expectation and covariance of ratings) required for mean--variance portfolio optimization are subject to inevitable estimation errors. To remedy this situation, we focus on robust optimization techniques that derive reliable solutions to uncertain optimization problems. Specifically, we propose a robust portfolio optimization model that copes with the uncertainty of estimated statistics based on the cardinality-based uncertainty sets. This robust portfolio optimization model can be reduced to a mixed-integer linear optimization problem, which can be solved exactly using mathematical optimization solvers. Experimental results using two publicly available rating datasets demonstrate that our method can improve not only the recommendation accuracy but also the diversity of recommendations compared with conventional mean--variance portfolio optimization models. Notably, our method has the potential to improve the recommendation quality of various rating prediction algorithms.</description>

      <title>Decoding Matters: Addressing Amplification Bias and Homogeneity Issue for LLM-based Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for recommendation requires careful consideration of the decoding process, given the inherent differences between generating items and natural language. Existing approaches often directly apply LLMs' original decoding methods. However, we find these methods encounter significant challenges: 1) amplification bias -- where standard length normalization inflates scores for items containing tokens with generation probabilities close to 1 (termed ghost tokens), and 2) homogeneity issue -- generating multiple similar or repetitive items for a user. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a new decoding approach named Debiasing-Diversifying Decoding (D3). D3 disables length normalization for ghost tokens to alleviate amplification bias, and it incorporates a text-free assistant model to encourage tokens less frequently generated by LLMs for counteracting recommendation homogeneity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness in enhancing accuracy and diversity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06716v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This working note outlines our participation in the retrieval task at CLEF 2024. We highlight the considerable gap between studying retrieval performance on static knowledge documents and understanding performance in real-world environments. Therefore, Addressing these discrepancies and measuring the temporal persistence of IR systems is crucial. By investigating the LongEval benchmark, specifically designed for such dynamic environments, our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of a listwise reranking approach, which proficiently handles inaccuracies induced by temporal distribution shifts. Among listwise rerankers, our findings show that ListT5, which effectively mitigates the positional bias problem by adopting the Fusion-in-Decoder architecture, is especially effective, and more so, as temporal drift increases, on the test-long subset.</description>

      <title>High-Order Fusion Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently attracted significant attention in the field of recommender systems. Contrastive learning (CL) stands out as a major SSL paradigm due to its robust ability to generate self-supervised signals. Mainstream graph contrastive learning (GCL)-based methods typically implement CL by creating contrastive views through various data augmentation techniques. Despite these methods are effective, we argue that there still exist several challenges. i) Data augmentation (e.g., discarding edges or adding noise) necessitates additional graph convolution (GCN) or modeling operations, which are highly time-consuming and potentially harm the embedding quality. ii) Existing CL-based methods use traditional CL objectives to capture self-supervised signals. However, few studies have explored obtaining CL objectives from more perspectives and have attempted to fuse the varying signals from these CL objectives to enhance recommendation performance.
  To overcome these challenges, we propose a High-order Fusion Graph Contrastive Learning (HFGCL) framework for recommendation. Specifically, instead of facilitating data augmentations, we use high-order information from GCN process to create contrastive views. Additionally, to integrate self-supervised signals from various CL objectives, we propose an advanced CL objective. By ensuring that positive pairs are distanced from negative samples derived from both contrastive views, we effectively fuse self-supervised signals from distinct CL objectives, thereby enhancing the mutual information between positive pairs. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate the superior recommendation performance and efficiency of HFGCL compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Watermarking Recommender Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21034v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommender systems embody significant commercial value and represent crucial intellectual property. However, the integrity of these systems is constantly challenged by malicious actors seeking to steal their underlying models. Safeguarding against such threats is paramount to upholding the rights and interests of the model owner. While model watermarking has emerged as a potent defense mechanism in various domains, its direct application to recommender systems remains unexplored and non-trivial. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing Autoregressive Out-of-distribution Watermarking (AOW), a novel technique tailored specifically for recommender systems. Our approach entails selecting an initial item and querying it through the oracle model, followed by the selection of subsequent items with small prediction scores. This iterative process generates a watermark sequence autoregressively, which is then ingrained into the model's memory through training. To assess the efficacy of the watermark, the model is tasked with predicting the subsequent item given a truncated watermark sequence. Through extensive experimentation and analysis, we demonstrate the superior performance and robust properties of AOW. Notably, our watermarking technique exhibits high-confidence extraction capabilities and maintains effectiveness even in the face of distillation and fine-tuning processes.</description>

      <title>A Quick, trustworthy spectral knowledge Q&amp;A system leveragingretrieval-augmented generation on LLM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11557v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) has demonstrated significant success in a range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks within general domain. The emergence of LLM has introduced innovative methodologies across diverse fields, including the natural sciences. Researchers aim to implement automated, concurrent process driven by LLM to supplant conventional manual, repetitive and labor-intensive work. In the domain of spectral analysis and detection, it is imperative for researchers to autonomously acquire pertinent knowledge across various research objects, which encompasses the spectroscopic techniques and the chemometric methods that are employed in experiments and analysis. Paradoxically, despite the recognition of spectroscopic detection as an effective analytical method, the fundamental process of knowledge retrieval remains both time-intensive and repetitive. In response to this challenge, we first introduced the Spectral Detection and Analysis Based Paper(SDAAP) dataset, which is the first open-source textual knowledge dataset for spectral analysis and detection and contains annotated literature data as well as corresponding knowledge instruction data. Subsequently, we also designed an automated Q\&amp;A framework based on the SDAAP dataset, which can retrieve relevant knowledge and generate high-quality responses by extracting entities in the input as retrieval parameters. It is worth noting that: within this framework, LLM is only used as a tool to provide generalizability, while RAG technique is used to accurately capture the source of the knowledge.This approach not only improves the quality of the generated responses, but also ensures the traceability of the knowledge. Experimental results show that our framework generates responses with more reliable expertise compared to the baseline.</description>

      <title>A Prompting-Based Representation Learning Method for Recommendation with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, Recommender Systems (RS) have witnessed a transformative shift with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Models such as GPT-3.5/4, Llama, have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. The extensive information pre-trained by these LLMs allows for the potential to capture a more profound semantic representation from different contextual information of users and items.
  While the great potential lies behind the thriving of LLMs, the challenge of leveraging user-item preferences from contextual information and its alignment with the improvement of Recommender Systems needs to be addressed. Believing that a better understanding of the user or item itself can be the key factor in improving recommendation performance, we conduct research on generating informative profiles using state-of-the-art LLMs.
  To boost the linguistic abilities of LLMs in Recommender Systems, we introduce the Prompting-Based Representation Learning Method for Recommendation (P4R). In our P4R framework, we utilize the LLM prompting strategy to create personalized item profiles. These profiles are then transformed into semantic representation spaces using a pre-trained BERT model for text embedding. Furthermore, we incorporate a Graph Convolution Network (GCN) for collaborative filtering representation. The P4R framework aligns these two embedding spaces in order to address the general recommendation tasks. In our evaluation, we compare P4R with state-of-the-art Recommender models and assess the quality of prompt-based profile generation.</description>

      <title>A systematic evaluation of large language models for biomedical natural language processing: benchmarks, baselines, and recommendations</title>

Abstract: The biomedical literature is rapidly expanding, posing a significant challenge for manual curation and knowledge discovery. Biomedical Natural Language Processing (BioNLP) has emerged as a powerful solution, enabling the automated extraction of information and knowledge from this extensive literature. Recent attention has been directed towards Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their impressive performance. However, there remains a critical gap in understanding the effectiveness of LLMs in BioNLP tasks and their broader implications for method development and downstream users. Currently, there is a lack of baseline performance data, benchmarks, and practical recommendations for using LLMs in the biomedical domain. To address this gap, we present a systematic evaluation of four representative LLMs: GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 (closed-source), LLaMA 2 (open-sourced), and PMC LLaMA (domain-specific) across 12 BioNLP datasets covering six applications (named entity recognition, relation extraction, multi-label document classification, question answering, text summarization, and text simplification). The evaluation is conducted under four settings: zero-shot, static few-shot, dynamic K-nearest few-shot, and fine-tuning. We compare these models against state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches that fine-tune (domain-specific) BERT or BART models, which are well-established methods in BioNLP tasks. The evaluation covers both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, where the latter involves manually reviewing collectively hundreds of thousands of LLM outputs for inconsistencies, missing information, and hallucinations in extractive and classification tasks. The qualitative review also examines accuracy, 1 completeness, and readability in text summarization tasks. Additionally, a cost analysis of closed-source GPT models is conducted.</description>
