      <title>JADES: Carbon-enhanced, Nitrogen-normal compact galaxy at z=11.2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past few years \textit{JWST} has been a major workhorse in detecting and constraining the metal enrichment of the first galaxies in the early Universe and finding the source of the ionisation of their interstellar medium. In this work, we present new deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of GS-z11-1, a galaxy at z = 11.28, in which we report the detection of multiple rest-frame UV and optical emission lines: CIII]$\lambda\lambda$1907,09, CIV]$\lambda\lambda$1548,51, [OII]$\lambda\lambda$3726,29, [NeIII]$\lambda$3869, H$\gamma$ and tentative evidence for HeII$\lambda$1640. The ionisation properties of GS-z11-1 are consistent with star formation, with potential contribution from an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We estimate a galaxy stellar mass of log(M$_{*}$/M$_{\odot}$) = 7.8$\pm$0.2 and log(SFR/(M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$))= 0.32$\pm$0.11 for the fiducial SF-only models. We measured C/O from the SED modelling of C/O = 1.20$\pm0.15 \times$ solar. This is one of the highest C/O abundances at z$&gt;$10, and it is consistent with either PopII and PopIII enrichment paths. Despite this source being extremely compact, with a half-light radius of 73$\pm$10 pc, we see no increased equivalent width of NIV] and NIII] emission lines as seen in some other compact sources at similar redshifts, a potential signature of second-generation stars in GCs. Overall, this galaxy exhibits low metallicity and high ionisation parameter consistent with intense star-formation or AGN activity in the early Universe, possibly observed before the enrichment by the second generation of stars in proto-globular clusters in the core of the galaxy.</description>

      <title>A Metal-Free Galaxy at $z = 3.19$? Evidence of Late Population III Star Formation at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star formation from metal-free gas, the hallmark of the first generation of Population III stars, was long assumed to occur in the very early Universe. We report the discovery of MPG-CR3 (Metal-Pristine Galaxy COSMOS Redshift 3; hereafter CR3), an extremely metal-poor galaxy at redshift $z= 3.193\pm0.016$. From JWST, VLT, and Subaru observations, CR3 exhibits exceptionally strong Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$, and He I $\lambda$10830 emission. We measure rest-frame equivalent widths of EW$_0$(Ly$\alpha$) $\approx822$ Angstrom and EW$_0$(H$\alpha$) $\approx2814$ Angstrom, among the highest seen in star-forming systems. No metal lines, e.g. [O III] $\lambda\lambda4959,5007$, C IV $\lambda\lambda1548,1550$, are currently detected at statistically significant level, placing a 2-$\sigma$ abundance upper limit of 12+log(O/H) &lt; 6.52 ($Z &lt; 8\times10^{-3}\ Z_\odot$). The observed Ly$\alpha$/H$\alpha$ flux ratio is $\approx13.9$, indicating negligible dust attenuation. Spectral energy distribution modeling with Pop III stellar templates indicates a very young ($\sim2$ Myr), low-mass ($M_* \approx 6.1\times 10^5 M_\odot$) stellar population. Further, the photometric redshifts reveal that CR3 could reside in a slightly underdense environment ($\delta \approx -0.12$). CR3 provides evidence that first-generation star formation could persist well after the epoch of reionization, challenging the conventional view that pristine star formation ended by $z\gtrsim6$.</description>

      <title>On the incidence of weak and strong Mg II absorbers towards the Flat and Steep Spectrum Radio quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The incidence rate of Mg II absorbers per unit redshift path (dN/dz) towards quasar sightlines has been used to probe the interaction between quasar jets and surrounding gas clouds. Studies using core- and lobe-dominated samples found a higher dN/dz for strong Mg II absorbers (rest equivalent width, W_r(2796) &gt;= 1.0 A) in velocity offsets ranging from 5000 km/s &lt; beta * c &lt; 60000 km/s (with beta = v/c), toward core-dominated sources. In this study, we applied a stringent spectral index criterion: alpha_radio &lt; -0.7 for steep-spectrum radio quasars (SSRQs) and alpha_radio &gt; -0.3 for flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). Using this, we assembled the largest sample to date: 441 FSRQs and 464 SSRQs with suitable optical spectra to study both strong absorbers and weak (0.3 A &lt; W_r(2796) &lt; 1.0 A) Mg II absorbers. We conducted a detailed comparison of absorbers' incidence rate and offset velocity distributions. Our main findings are: (i) For both weak and strong absorbers, we found no significant excess in dN/dz towards FSRQ compared to SSRQ sightlines. (ii) The dN/dbeta distribution of Mg II absorbers along FSRQs and SSRQs are statistically similar. (iii) The cumulative distribution of weak Mg II absorbers is slightly lower for beta &lt; 0.3, but shows an excess at higher beta. This suggests that, while intrinsic Mg II absorber abundance is comparable along both sightlines, FSRQs' more aligned relativistic jets cluster weak absorbers at high beta, consistent with the scenario of jet-driven acceleration of smaller gas clumps.</description>

      <title>CU-JADE: A Method for Traversing Extinction Jumps along the Line-of-Sight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although interstellar dust extinction serves as a powerful distance estimator, the solar system's location within the Galactic plane complicates distance determinations, especially for molecular clouds (MCs) at varying distances along the line of sight (LoS). The presence of complex extinction patterns along LoS introduces degeneracies, resulting in less accurate distance measurements to overlapping MCs in crowded regions of the Galactic plane. In this study, we develop the CUSUM-based Jump-point Analysis for Distance Estimation (CU-JADE), a novel method designed to help mitigate these observational challenges. The key strengths of CU-JADE include: (1) sensitivity to detect abrupt jumps in $Distance$-$A_{\lambda}$ ($D$-$A$) datasets, (2) minimal systematic errors as demonstrated on both mock and observed data, and (3) the ability to combine CUSUM analysis with multi-wavelength data to improve the completeness of distance measurements for nearby gas structures, even for extinction values as low as $\Delta A_{V} \gtrsim 0.15$ mag. By combining CO survey data with a large sample of stars characterized by high-precision parallaxes and extinctions, we uncovered the multi-layered molecular gas distribution in the high-latitude Cepheus region. We also determined accurate distances to MCs beyond the Cygnus Rift by analyzing the intricate structure of gas and extinction within the Galactic plane. Additionally, we constructed a full-sky 3D extinction map extending to 4 kpc, which provides critical insights into dense interstellar medium components dominated by molecular hydrogen. These results advance our understanding of the spatial distribution and physical properties of MCs across the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Numerical Study of Bar Suppression in Galaxy Models Due to Disc Heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of bar formation, evolution and destruction is still a controversial topic regarding galaxy dynamics. Numerical simulations show that these phenomena strongly depend on physical and numerical parameters. In this work, we study the combined influence of the softening parameter, $\epsilon$ and disc mass fraction, $m_{\mathrm{d}}$ on the formation and evolution of bars in isolated disc-halo models via $N$-body simulations with different particle resolutions. Previous studies indicate that the bar strength depends on $m_{\mathrm{d}}$ as $\propto m_{\mathrm{d}}^{-1}$, which is seen as a delay in bar formation. However, the distorsion parameter, $\eta$, which measures the bar's momentum through time, shows that an increase in $m_{\mathrm{d}}$ does not always induce a delay in bar formation. This suggests that $\epsilon$ interact to either enhance or weaken the bar. Moreover, numerical heating dominates in models with small softening values, creating highly accelerated particles at the centre of discs, regardless of $m_{\mathrm{d}}$ or resolution. These enhanced particle accelerations produce chaotic orbits for $\epsilon \leq 5\,$pc, resulting in bar suppression due to collisional dynamics in the centre. In our high resolution models ($N \approx 10^{7}$), small softening values are incapable of reproducing the bar instability. The role of disc mass is as follows: increasing $m_{\mathrm{d}}$ for moderate $\epsilon$ ($\geq 10\,$pc) reduces the amount of drift in the acceleration profile, without affecting the bar's behaviour. Models with lower $m_{\mathrm{d}}$ values coupled with small softening values, have an excess of highly accelerated particles, introducing unwanted effects into otherwise reliable simulations. Finally, we show that the evolution of the disc's vertical acceleration profile is a reliable indicator of numerical heating introduced by $\epsilon$ and the bar.</description>

      <title>The MeerKAT Fornax Survey: removal of HI gas from galaxies in the Fornax cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MeerKAT Fornax Survey is conducting a thorough examinationof the nearby Fornax galaxy cluster to understand how galaxies lose their cold gas and stop forming stars in low-mass clusters (M$_{\rm vir} \leq 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$). We are doing so through very deep (down to $\sim 10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$) and high resolution (up to$\sim~ 1$ kpc and 1 km s$^{-1}$) MeerKAT observations of neutral atomic hydrogen gas (HI) in a $1\times2$ Mpc$^2$ region centred on Fornax. At the time of writing, the survey is $88\%$ complete. Initial analysis of the cluster's central area has unveiled the widespread existence of previously unseen HI tails and clouds. Some of the HI is clearly being removed from Fornax galaxies as they interact with one another or with the intra-cluster medium. We present a sample of galaxies with long, one-sided, star-less HI tails (of which only one was previously known) radially oriented within the cluster. The properties of these tails represent the first conclusive evidence that ram pressure is a key force shaping the distribution of HI in the Fornax cluster. Furthermore, interactions within the Fornax environment shape the HI mass function, the HI content of dwarf galaxies and determines how the HI sustains the nuclear activity of some cluster members and neighbouring galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Tremaine-Weinberg method at high redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the reliability of the Tremaine-Weinberg (TW) method in measuring the pattern speed of barred galaxies at high redshifts. Measuring pattern speeds at high redshift may help to shed light on the time evolution of interactions between galactic bars and dark matter halos. The TW method has been extensively employed for nearby galaxies, and its accuracy in determining bar pattern speeds has been validated through numerical simulations. For nearby galaxies, the method yields acceptable results when the inclination angle of the galaxy and the position angle of the bar fall within appropriate ranges. However, the application of the TW method to high-redshift galaxies remains unexplored in both observations and simulations. In this study, we generate mock observations of barred galaxies from the TNG50 cosmological simulation. These simulated observations are tailored to mimic the Integral Field Unit (IFU) spectroscopy data that the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) would capture at a redshift of $z\simeq 1.2$. By applying the TW method to these mock observations and comparing the results with the known pattern speeds, we demonstrate that the TW method performs adequately for barred galaxies with bars sufficiently long to be detected by JWST at high redshifts. This work opens a new avenue for applying the TW method to investigate the properties of high-redshift barred galaxies.</description>

      <title>Molecular gas in a system of two interacting galaxies overlapping on the line-of-sight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy interactions can disturb gas in galactic discs, compress it, excite it, and enhance star formation. An intriguing system likely consisting of two interacting galaxies overlapping on the line-of-sight was previously studied through ionised gas observations from the integral-field spectrograph Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA). A decomposition into two components using MaNGA spectra, together with a multi-wavelength study, allowed to characterise the system as a minor-merger with interaction-induced star-formation, and maybe AGN activity. We use new interferometric observations of the CO(1-0) gas of this system from the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) to confront and combine the spatially-resolved ionised and molecular gas observations. Mock NOEMA and MaNGA data are computed from simulated systems of two discs and compared to the observations. The NOEMA observations of the molecular gas, dynamically colder than the ionised gas, help to precise the configuration of the system, which we revisit as being a major merger. Combination of ionised and molecular gas data allow us to study the star-formation efficiency of the system.</description>

      <title>An S-shaped filament formed due to Cloud-Cloud Collision in molecular cloud G178.28-00.61</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present compelling observational evidence supporting G178.28-00.61 as an early-stage candidate for Cloud-Cloud Collision (CCC), with indications of the formation of an S-shaped filament, evenly-separated dense cores, and young star clusters. The observations of CO molecular line emission demonstrate the existence of two interacting molecular clouds with systemic velocities of 0.8 km/s and -1.2 km/s, respectively. The convergence zone of these two clouds reveals an S-shaped filament in the JCMT 850 micron continuum image, suggesting cloud interaction. In line with expectations from CCC simulations, broad bridging features are discernible in the position-velocity diagrams. An elevated concentration of identified Class I and II young stellar objects along the filament at the intersection area further supports the hypothesis of a collision-induced origin. This observation could be explained by a recent MHD model of CCC (Kong et al. 2024), which predicts a similar morphology, scale, density, and unbound status, as well as the orientation of the polarization.</description>

      <title>Galaxy quenching across the Cosmic Web: disentangling mass and environment with SDSS DR18</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of large-scale cosmic web environments on galaxy quenching using a volume-limited, stellar mass-matched galaxy sample from SDSS DR18. Galaxies are classified as residing in sheets, filaments, or clusters based on the eigenvalues of the tidal tensor derived from the smoothed density field. The quenched fraction increases with stellar mass and is highest in clusters, intermediate in filaments, and lowest in sheets, reflecting the increasing efficiency of environmental quenching with density. A flattening of the quenched fraction beyond $\log_{10}(M_\star/M_\odot) \sim 10.6$ across all environments signals a transition from environment-driven to mass-driven quenching. In contrast, the bulge fraction continues to rise beyond this threshold, indicating a decoupling between star formation suppression and morphological transformation. At the high-mass end ($\log_{10}(M_\star/M_\odot) \gtrsim 11.5$), both quenched and bulge fractions bifurcate, increasing in clusters but declining in sheets, suggesting a divergent evolutionary pathway where massive galaxies in sheets retain cold gas and disk-like morphologies, potentially sustaining or rejuvenating star formation. The AGN fraction also increases with stellar mass and is somewhat higher in sheets than in clusters, indicating enhanced AGN activity in low-density, gas-rich environments. The high-mass trends are independently corroborated by our analysis of specific star formation rate, $(u-r)$ colour, concentration index, and D4000 in the stellar mass-density plane, which show that massive galaxies in sheets remain bluer, younger, more star-forming, and structurally less evolved than their cluster counterparts. Our results highlight the cosmic web as an active driver of galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Bridging Scales in Black Hole Accretion and Feedback: Relativistic Jet linking the Horizon to the Host Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating black hole (BH) accretion and feedback from the horizon to galactic scales is extremely challenging, as it involves a vast range of scales. Recently, our multizone method has successfully achieved global dynamical steady-states of hot accretion flows in three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations by tracking the bidirectional interaction between a non-spinning BH and its host galaxy. In this paper, we present technical improvements to the method and apply it to spin $a_*=0.9$ BHs, which power relativistic jets. We first test the new multizone set-up with a smaller Bondi radius, $R_B\approx400\,r_g$, where $r_g$ is the gravitational radius. The strongly magnetized accretion launches a relativistic jet with an intermediate feedback efficiency $\eta\sim30\,\%$, in between that of a prograde ($\eta\sim100\,\%$) and retrograde ($\eta\sim 10\,\%$) torus. Interestingly, both prograde and retrograde simulations also eventually converge to the same intermediate efficiency when evolved long enough, as accumulated magnetic fields remove gas rotation. We then extend strongly magnetized simulations to larger Bondi radii, $R_B\approx 2\times10^3,~2\times 10^4,~2\times 10^5\,r_g$. We find that the BH accretion rate $\dot{M}$ is suppressed with respect to the Bondi rate $\dot{M}_B$ as $\dot{M}/\dot{M}_B\propto R_B^{-1/2}$. However, despite some variability, the time-averaged feedback efficiency is $\eta\sim30\,\%$, independent of $R_B$. This suggests that BH feedback efficiency in hot accretion flows is mainly governed by the BH spin ($a_*$) rather than by the galactic properties ($R_B$). From these first-principles simulations, we provide a feedback subgrid prescription for cosmological simulations: $\dot{E}_{\rm fb}=2\times10^{-3}[R_B/(2\times10^5\,r_g)]^{-1/2}\dot{M}_Bc^2$ for BH spin $a_*=0.9$.</description>

      <title>Synchrotron-limited Particle Acceleration in Relativistic Shearing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fermi-type shear particle acceleration is a promising mechanism for sustaining ultra-relativistic particles along the kilo-parsec scale jets in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). We explore the possibility of synchrotron-limited electron acceleration in mildly relativistic shearing flows and present numerical solutions to the corresponding particle transport equation. We compare our findings with analytical calculations to infer an effective electron cutoff energy, and discuss the relationship to a simplified box model treatment. The results show that mildly relativistic large-scale jets offer a suitable environment for distributed electron acceleration beyond Lorentz factors of $\gamma_e \sim 10^8$.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal emission in the central starburst region of M82</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffuse non-thermal (NT) emission from the central starburst (CSB) of M82 has been measured at radio, X-ray and gamma-ray energies. Far-infrared (FIR), radio, and X-ray emission maps are mutually consistent, with radio and X-ray emissions spectrally similar - suggesting the latter to be Compton/FIR radiation. We present our analysis of 16.3 years of Fermi-LAT measurements, which - combined with newly-published VERITAS data - constitute the deepest, most extensive currently available gamma-ray dataset on M82. We model the NT radio to gamma-ray emission of the CSB as due to relativistic particles (CR). Key features of our models are the identification of the &gt;50 GeV emission as pionic and the use of X-ray and radio emission to calibrate the CRe spectrum. This enables determination of the zero-point and slope of the CRp (and secondary CRe) spectrum, and meaningful estimates of the energy densities of CR and magnetic fields. We consider all relevant radiative processes involving CR, and use published detailed descriptions of the soft radiation fields in the CSB region - the most important of which is the FIR field, modeled as a graybody. Our SED modeling indicates that 1) the &gt;10 GeV emission is mostly pionic, 2) the 0.1 &lt; E/GeV &lt; 10 emission is a combination of pionic and Compton/starlight (and subdominant NT bremss), 3) the &lt;0.1 GeV gamma-ray emission is leptonic, and 4) the radio spectrum arises from primary and secondary CRe synchrotron at comparable levels: the corresponding CRe populations are described by a PL and a curved spectrum, respectively. Averaged over the FIR graybody models, the CRp spectral index and energy density are 2.3 and 385 eV/cm3 (for n(H) = 200 1/cm3), the primary-CRe and CRp maximum energies are 30 GeV and 7 TeV, and the magnetic field is B = 120 uG. The derived CR and B energy densities are in equipartition.</description>

      <title>21 Balmer Jump Street: The Nebular Continuum at High Redshift and Implications for the Bright Galaxy Problem, UV Continuum Slopes, and Early Stellar Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the physical origin and spectroscopic impact of extreme nebular emission in high-redshift galaxies. The nebular continuum, which can appear during an extreme starburst, is of particular importance as it tends to redden UV slopes and has a significant contribution to the UV luminosities of galaxies. Furthermore, its shape can be used to infer the gas density and temperature of the interstellar medium. First, we provide a theoretical background, showing how different stellar populations (SPS models, initial mass functions (IMFs), and stellar temperatures) and nebular conditions impact observed galaxy spectra. We demonstrate that, for systems with strong nebular continuum emission, 1) UV fluxes can increase by up to 0.7~mag (or more in the case of hot/massive stars) above the stellar continuum, which may help reconcile the surprising abundance of bright high-redshift galaxies and the elevated UV luminosity density at $z&gt;10$, 2) at high gas densities, UV slopes can redden from $\beta&lt;-2.5$ to $\beta\sim-1$, 3) observational measurements of $\xi_{\rm ion}$ are gross underestimates, and 4) UV downturns from two-photon emission can masquerade as damped Ly$\alpha$ systems. Second, we present a dataset of 58 galaxies observed with NIRSpec on JWST at $2.5&lt;z&lt;9.0$ that are selected to have strong nebular continuum emission via the detection of the Balmer jump. Five of the 58 spectra are consistent with being dominated by nebular emission, exhibiting both a Balmer jump and a UV downturn consistent with two-photon emission. For some galaxies, this may imply the presence of hot massive stars and a top-heavy IMF. We conclude by exploring the properties of spectroscopically confirmed $z&gt;10$ galaxies, finding that UV slopes and UV downturns are in some cases redder or steeper than expected from SPS models, which may hint at more exotic (e.g. hotter/more massive stars or AGN) ionizing sources.</description>

      <title>The rise of the galactic empire: luminosity functions at $z\sim17$ and $z\sim25$ estimated with the MIDIS$+$NGDEEP ultra-deep JWST/NIRCam dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15594v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a sample of six F200W and three F277W dropout sources identified as $16&lt;z&lt;25$ galaxy candidates using the deepest JWST/NIRCam data to date (5$\sigma$ depths $\sim31.5$ mag at $\geq2$ $\mu$m), provided by the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) and the Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public survey (NGDEEP). We estimate ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions and densities at $z\sim17$ and $z\sim25$. The number density of galaxies with absolute magnitudes $-19&lt;M_\mathrm{UV}&lt;-18$ at $z\sim17$ ($z\sim25$) is a factor of 4 (25) smaller than at $z\sim12$; the luminosity density presents a similar evolution. Compared to state-of-the-art galaxy simulations, we find the need for an enhanced UV-photon production at $z=17-25$ in $\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{DM}=10^{8.5-9.5}$ M$_\odot$ dark matter halos, provided by an increase in the star formation efficiency at early times and/or by intense compact starbursts with enhanced emissivity linked to strong burstiness, low or primordial gas metallicities, and/or a top-heavy initial mass function. There are few robust theoretical predictions for the evolution of galaxies above $z\sim20$ in the literature, however, the continuing rapid drop in the halo mass function would predict a more rapid evolution than we observe if photon production efficiencies remained constant. Our $z&gt;16$ candidates present mass-weighted ages around 30 Myr, and attenuations $\mathrm{A(V)}&lt;0.1$ mag. Their average stellar mass is $\mathrm{M}_\bigstar\sim10^{7}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$, implying a stellar-to-baryon mass fraction around 10% if the emissivity increases with redshift, or significantly higher otherwise. Three candidates present very blue UV spectral slopes ($\beta\sim-3$) compatible with Pop III young ($\lesssim10$ Myr) stars and/or high escape fractions of ionizing photons; the rest have $\beta\sim-2.5$ similar to $z=10-12$ samples.</description>

      <title>Effects of chemically homogeneous evolution of the first stars on the 21-cm signal and reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first generation of stars, known as Population III (Pop III), played a crucial role in the early Universe through their unique formation environment and metal-free composition. These stars can undergo chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) due to fast rotation, becoming more compact and hotter/bluer than their (commonly assumed) non-rotating counterparts. In this study, we investigate the impact of Pop III CHE on the 21-cm signal and cosmic reionization under various assumptions on Pop III star formation, such as their formation efficiency, initial mass function, and transition to metal-enriched star formation. We combine stellar spectra computed by detailed atmosphere models with semi-numerical simulations of Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization ($z\sim 6-30$). The key effect of CHE arises from the boosted ionizing power of Pop III stars, which reduces the Pop III stellar mass density required to reproduce the observed Thomson scattering optical depth by a factor of $\sim 2$. Meanwhile, the maximum 21-cm global absorption signal is shallower by up to $\sim 15$ mK (11%), partly due to the reduced Lyman-band emission from CHE, and the large-scale ($k\sim 0.2\ \rm cMpc^{-1}$) power drops by a factor of a few at $z\gtrsim 25$. In general, the effects of CHE can be comparable to those of Pop III star formation parameters, showing an interesting interplay with distinct features in different epochs. These results highlight the importance of metal-free/poor stellar evolution in understanding the early Universe and suggest that future studies should consider joint constraints on the physics of star/galaxy formation and stellar evolution.</description>

      <title>Generating Dark Matter Subhalo Populations Using Normalizing Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for probing the nature of dark matter, as lensing signals are sensitive to the dark matter substructure within the lensing galaxy. We present a comparative analysis of strong gravitational lensing signatures generated by dark matter subhalo populations using two different approaches. The first approach models subhalos using an empirical model, while the second employs the Galacticus semi-analytic model of subhalo evolution. To date, only empirical approaches have been practical in the analysis of lensing systems, as incorporating fully physical models was computationally infeasible. To circumvent this, we utilize a generative machine learning algorithm, known as a normalizing flow, to learn and reproduce the subhalo populations generated by Galacticus. We demonstrate that the normalizing flow algorithm accurately reproduces the Galacticus subhalo distribution while significantly reducing computation time compared to direct simulation. Moreover, we find that subhalo populations from Galacticus produce comparable results to the empirical model in replicating observed lensing signals under the fiducial dark matter model. This work highlights the potential of machine learning techniques in accelerating astrophysical simulations and improving model comparisons of dark matter properties.</description>

      <title>A XRISM Observation of the Archetypal Radio-Mode Feedback System Hydra-A: Measurements of Atmospheric Motion and Constraints on Turbulent Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present XRISM Resolve observations centered on Hydra-A, a redshift z = 0.054 brightest cluster galaxy which hosts one of the largest and most powerful FR-I radio sources in the nearby Universe. We examine the effects of its high jet power on the velocity structure of the cluster's hot atmosphere. Hydra-A's central radio jets have inflated X-ray cavities with energies upward of $10^{61}$ erg. They reach altitudes of 225 kpc from the cluster center, well beyond the atmosphere's central cooling region. Resolve's $3\times3$ arcmin field-of-view covers $190\times190$ kpc, which encompasses most of the cooling volume. We find a one dimensional atmospheric velocity dispersion across the volume of $164\pm10$ km/s. The fraction in isotropic turbulence or unresolved bulk velocity is unknown. Assuming pure isotropic turbulence, the turbulent kinetic energy is $2.5 \%$ of the thermal energy radiated away over the cooling timescale, implying that kinetic energy must be supplied continually to offset cooling. While Hydra-A's radio jets are powerful enough to supply kinetic energy to the atmosphere at the observed level, turbulent dissipation alone would struggle to offset cooling throughout the cooling volume. The central galaxy's radial velocity is similar to the atmospheric velocity, with an offset of $-37 \pm 23$ km/s.</description>

      <title>Dust removal timescale in galaxies across cosmic time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the evolution of dust in galaxies is crucial because it affects the dynamics and cooling of gas, star formation, and chemical evolution. Recent work on dust removal in galaxies indicates timescales of gigayears, with old stellar populations and AGNs as the primary drivers of this process. However, most statistically significant studies are focused on low redshifts $z &lt; 0.4$. Here, we determine the dust removal timescale in galaxies over a wide range of redshifts, up to $z \sim 5$. We use publicly available catalogue data of infrared-selected galaxies, observed by \textit{Herschel}. Using the inferred dust masses, stellar masses, and stellar ages, we calculate the dust removal timescale in a sample of more than 120,000 galaxies. We find that, with increasing redshift, the dust removal timescale decreases from 1.8 Gyr at redshift $z \sim 0.05$ to less than 500\,Myr at $z &gt; 3$. Galaxies at higher redshifts undergo more efficient dust removal than galaxies at lower redshift, likely driven by AGN activity, supernova shocks, and astration. These findings indicate that dust removal evolves over cosmic time, reflecting the changing mechanisms regulating dust content of galaxies as the Universe evolves.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation with Galaxy Clustering and Weak Lensing from DES Year 3 Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a framework to study the relation between the stellar mass of a galaxy and the total mass of its host dark matter halo using galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements. We model a wide range of scales, roughly from $\sim 100 \; {\rm kpc}$ to $\sim 100 \; {\rm Mpc}$, using a theoretical framework based on the Halo Occupation Distribution and data from Year 3 of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) dataset. The new advances of this work include: 1) the generation and validation of a new stellar mass-selected galaxy sample in the range of $\log M_\star/M_\odot \sim 9.6$ to $\sim 11.5$; 2) the joint-modeling framework of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing that is able to describe our stellar mass-selected sample deep into the 1-halo regime; and 3) stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) constraints from this dataset. In general, our SHMR constraints agree well with existing literature with various weak lensing measurements. We constrain the free parameters in the SHMR functional form $\log M_\star (M_h) = \log(\epsilon M_1) + f\left[ \log\left( M_h / M_1 \right) \right] - f(0)$, with $f(x) \equiv -\log(10^{\alpha x}+1) + \delta [\log(1+\exp(x))]^\gamma / [1+\exp(10^{-x})]$, to be $\log M_1 = 11.559^{+0.334}_{-0.415}$, $\log \epsilon = -1.689^{+0.333}_{-0.220}$, $\alpha = -1.637^{+0.107}_{-0.096}$, $\gamma = 0.588^{+0.265}_{-0.220}$ and $\delta = 4.227^{+2.223}_{-1.776}$. The inferred average satellite fraction is within $\sim 5-35\%$ for our fiducial results and we do not see any clear trends with redshift or stellar mass. Furthermore, we find that the inferred average galaxy bias values follow the generally expected trends with stellar mass and redshift. Our study is the first SHMR in DES in this mass range, and we expect the stellar mass sample to be of general interest for other science cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aims: In this work we aim to investigate the late evolution of ETGs, both observationally and theoretically, by focusing on the stellar mass density profile inside a fixed aperture, within $10 ~\rm{kpc}$ from the galaxy center.
  Methods: We first studied the stellar mass and mass-weighted density slope within $10 ~\rm{kpc}$, respectively $M_{*,10}$ and $\mathit{\Gamma_{*,10}}$, of a sample of early-type galaxies from the GAMA survey. We measured the $\mathit{\Gamma_{*,10}} - M_{*,10}$ relation and its evolution over the redshift range $0.17\leq z \leq 0.37$. We then built a toy model for the merger evolution of galaxies, based on N-body simulations, to explore to what extent the observed growth in $\mathit{\Gamma_{*,10}} - M_{*,10}$ relation is consistent with a dry-merger evolution scenario.
  Results: From the observations, we do not detect evidence for an evolution of the $\mathit{\Gamma_{*,10}} - M_{*,10}$ relation. We put an upper limit on the redshift derivative of the normalization$~(\mu)$ and slope$~(\beta)$of the $\mathit{\Gamma_{*,10}} - M_{*,10}$ relation $|\partial \mu/\partial \log (1+z)| \leq 0.13$ and $\left|\partial \beta/\partial \log (1+z)\right| \leq 1.10$, respectively. Simulations show that most mergers induce a decrease in $\mathit{\Gamma_{*,10}}$ and an increase in $M_{*,10}$, although some show a decrease in $M_{*,10}$, particularly for the most extended galaxies and smaller merger mass ratios. By combining the observations with our merger toy model, we placed an upper limit on $f_M = 11.2 \%$ in the redshift range $0.17 \leq z \leq 0.37$.
  Conclusions: While our measurement is limited by systematics, the application of our approach to samples with a larger redshift baseline, particularly with a time interval $\Delta t \geq 3.2~\mathrm{Gyr}$, should enable us to detect a signal and help us better understand the late growth of ETGs.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a fraction of LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA events coming from active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation channels of the gravitational-wave (GW) sources detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) remain poorly constrained. Active galactic nucleus (AGN) has been proposed as one of the potential hosts, but the fraction of GW events originating from AGNs has not been quantified. Here, we constrain the AGN-origin fraction $f_{\rm agn}$ by analyzing the spatial correlation between GW source localizations ($O1\!-\!O4$a) and AGNs (SDSS DR16). We report preliminary evidence of an excess of lower-luminosity ($10^{44.5} \lesssim L_{\rm bol} \le 10^{45}~\!\mathrm{erg~s}^{-1}$) as well as lower-Eddington ratio ($0.01 \lesssim \lambda_{\rm Edd} \le 0.05$) AGNs around the LVK events, the explanation of which requires $f_{\rm agn} = 0.39^{+0.41}_{-0.32}$ and $0.29^{+0.40}_{-0.25}$ (90\% confidence level) of the LVK events originating from these respective AGN populations. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that this correlation is unlikely to arise from random coincidence, further supported by anomalous variation of the error of $f_{\rm agn}$ with GW event counts. These results support the theoretical speculation that some LVK events come from lower-luminosity or lower-accretion-rate AGNs, offering critical insights into the environmental dependencies of the formation of GW sources.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Preliminary Characterization of a Third Interstellar Object: 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02757v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report initial observations aimed at the characterization of a third interstellar object. This object, 3I/ATLAS or C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), was discovered on 2025 July 1 UT and has an orbital eccentricity of $e\sim6.1$, perihelion of $q\sim 1.36$ au, inclination of $\sim175^\circ$, and hyperbolic velocity of $V_\infty\sim 58$ km s$^{-1}$. We report deep stacked images obtained using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the Very Large Telescope that resolve a compact coma. Using images obtained from several smaller ground-based telescopes, we find minimal light curve variation for the object over a $\sim4$ day time span. The visible/near-infrared spectral slope of the object is 17.1$\pm$0.2 %/100 nm, comparable to other interstellar objects and primitive solar system small bodies (comets and D-type asteroids). 3I/ATLAS will be observable through early September 2025, then unobservable by Earth-based observatories near perihelion due to low solar elongation. It will be observable again from the ground in late November 2025. Although this limitation unfortunately prohibits detailed Earth-based observations at perihelion when the activity of 3I/ATLAS is likely to peak, spacecraft at Mars could be used to make valuable observations at this time.</description>

      <title>Assessing interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS with the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias and the Two-meter Twin Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Theories of the formation and evolution of small bodies in planetary systems predict that they may escape into interstellar space at any time. After having characterized just two such interlopers -1I/2017 U1 (Oumuamua) and 2I/Borisov more questions were raised than answered. Assessing the recently discovered interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will only broaden our understanding of this complex topic.
  Aims. Here, we investigate the spectral, cometary, and rotational properties of 3I/ATLAS as well as its dynamical context.
  Methods. We identified the spectral type of 3I/ATLAS from the visible reflectance spectrum and used photometric observations to derive its level of activity and rotational properties. Observational data were obtained with the OSIRIS camera spectrograph at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias and the Two-meter Twin Telescope. We used N-body simulations and statistical analyses of Gaia DR3 data to investigate the origin of 3I/ATLAS and its Galactic background.
  Results. Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has a visible spectrum consistent with that of a D-type asteroid, and has a spectral slope of 14.6%/1000 A in the 5000-9000 A range, which is similar to the one of Oumuamua but redder than that of 2I/Borisov and most solar system comets. It has a conspicuous coma and its rotation period is 16.79 h. The heliocentric components of its Galactic velocity were (U, V, W) = (-51.233, -19.456, 18.930) km/s with a radiant in Sagittarius. The analysis of a sample of kinematic analogs of 3I/ATLAS extracted from Gaia DR3 suggests that its parent system is part of the Galactic thin disk and includes a solar-like star with slightly sub-solar metallicity.</description>

      <title>A kinematic and structural study of young open clusters in the Milky Way Galaxy using Gaia DR3 catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We aim to identify the cluster members, estimate cluster properties, study the dynamical state of the clusters as a function of mass, trace the existence of dynamical effects in massive stars, and check for spatial patterns of members in young clusters. We studied 14 young open clusters located within 1 kpc using the data from Gaia DR3 with the membership estimated using the GMM method. The cluster parameters such as age, distance, metallicity, and extinction were estimated by fitting PARSEC isochrones to the CMDs. These clusters are found to have ages between 6-90 Myr, located between 334-910 pc, covering a mass range, of 0.13 to 13.77 solar mass. In five of these clusters, stars from F to M spectral type show increasing velocity dispersion, a signature for dynamical relaxation. We detect high proper motion for B and A-type stars, possible walkaway stars in the other five clusters, Alessi Teutsch 5, ASCC 16, ASCC 21, IC 2395, and NGC 6405. We demonstrate the existence of mass-dependent velocity dispersion in young clusters suggestive of dynamical relaxation. The typical range of transverse velocity dispersion is found to be 0.40 - 0.70 km/s for young clusters.</description>

      <title>Tidal adaptive softening and artificial fragmentation in cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional N-body methods introduce localised perturbations in the gravitational forces governing their evolution. These perturbations lead to an artificial fragmentation in the filamentary network of the Large Scale Structure, often referred to as "beads-on-a-string." This issue is particularly apparent in cosmologies with a suppression of the matter power spectrum at small spatial scales, such as warm dark matter models, where the perturbations induced by the N-body discretisation dominate the cosmological power at the suppressed scales. Initial conditions based on third-order Lagrangian perturbation theory, which allow for a late-starting redshift, have been shown to minimise numerical errors contributing to such artefacts. In this work, we investigate whether the additional use of a spatially adaptive softening for dark matter particles, based on the gravitational tidal field, can reduce the severity of artificial fragmentation. Tidal adaptive softening significantly improves force accuracy in idealised filamentary collapse simulations over a fixed softening approach. However, it does not substantially reduce spurious haloes in cosmological simulations when paired with such optimised initial conditions. Nevertheless, tidal adaptive softening induces a shift in halo formation times in warm dark matter simulations compared to a fixed softening counterpart, an effect not seen in cold dark matter simulations. Furthermore, initialising the initial conditions at an earlier redshift generally results in z=0 haloes forming from Lagrangian volumes with lower average sphericity. This sphericity difference could impact post-processing algorithms identifying spurious objects based on Lagrangian volume morphology. We propose potential strategies for reducing spurious haloes without abandoning current N-body methods.</description>

      <title>Ancient, eclipsing, tidally-locked: A blue lurker progenitor in the population of extreme-velocity star candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many extreme velocity candidate stars have been found based on \textit{Gaia} astrometry, but need spectroscopic confirmation. We select late-type hypervelocity star (HVS) candidates from the \textit{Gaia} DR3 catalog with a $1\sigma$ lower limit of the tangential velocity of 800 km\,s$^{-1}$. J1903-0023, one of the brightest targets, stands out as high priority candidate for follow-up spectroscopy using the X-shooter instrument at ESO-VLT. We determine its atmospheric parameters and abundances utilizing synthetic spectral grids and a global $\chi^2-$minimization procedure, and its stellar parameters with the help of evolutionary tracks and the spectral energy distribution. The star shows variability in its light curve and follow-up spectroscopy confirms that the star is radial-velocity variable. The spectroscopic distance of J1903-0023 is lower than that based on the parallax, indicating that the star is not a hypervelocity binary star but bound to the Galaxy. The star turned out to be of spectral type F, very similar to the extreme-velocity star J0725-2351, which we analyse in the same way as the target. Apparently, both stars are very metal poor and old halo main-sequence (sdF) stars with masses slightly below the halo turn-off mass, and share the low metallicity ([Fe/H]=-2.3,-2.6) and strong alpha enhancement ([$\alpha$/Fe]$\sim0.44$). While J0725-2351 is non-rotating ($v\sin\,i&lt;3$\,km\,s$^{-1}$), J1903-0023 is a fast rotator ($v\sin i=42.3\pm2.0$ km\,s$^{-1}$). The Gaia, and ZTF light curves show an eclipse at a 1.179 day period, similar to the rotation period of J1903-0023. We therefore conclude that J1903-0023 is a high-velocity tidally-synchronised binary most likely with a metal-poor M dwarf companion.</description>
