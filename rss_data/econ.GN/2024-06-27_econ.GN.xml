      <title>Credit Ratings: Heterogeneous Effect on Capital Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Why do companies choose particular capital structures? A compelling answer to this question remains elusive despite extensive research. In this article, we use double machine learning to examine the heterogeneous causal effect of credit ratings on leverage. Taking advantage of the flexibility of random forests within the double machine learning framework, we model the relationship between variables associated with leverage and credit ratings without imposing strong assumptions about their functional form. This approach also allows for data-driven variable selection from a large set of individual company characteristics, supporting valid causal inference. We report three findings: First, credit ratings causally affect the leverage ratio. Having a rating, as opposed to having none, increases leverage by approximately 7 to 9 percentage points, or 30\% to 40\% relative to the sample mean leverage. However, this result comes with an important caveat, captured in our second finding: the effect is highly heterogeneous and varies depending on the specific rating. For AAA and AA ratings, the effect is negative, reducing leverage by about 5 percentage points. For A and BBB ratings, the effect is approximately zero. From BB ratings onwards, the effect becomes positive, exceeding 10 percentage points. Third, contrary to what the second finding might imply at first glance, the change from no effect to a positive effect does not occur abruptly at the boundary between investment and speculative grade ratings. Rather, it is gradual, taking place across the granular rating notches ("+/-") within the BBB and BB categories.</description>

      <title>The myth of declining competitive balance in the UEFA Champions League group stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to previous studies, competitive balance has significantly declined in the UEFA Champions League group stage over the recent decades. Our paper introduces six alternative indices for measuring ex ante and ex post competitive balance in order to explore the robustness of these results. The ex ante measures are based on Elo ratings, while the ex post measures compare the group ranking to reasonable benchmarks. We find no evidence of any trend in the competitive balance of the UEFA Champions League group stage between the 2003/04 and 2023/24 seasons.</description>

      <title>Commodification of Compute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, big data analytics, and cloud computing have precipitated an unprecedented demand for computational resources. However, the current landscape of computational resource allocation is characterized by significant inefficiencies, including underutilization and price volatility. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel global platform for the commodification of compute hours, termed the Global Compute Exchange (GCX) (Patent Pending). The GCX leverages blockchain technology and smart contracts to create a secure, transparent, and efficient marketplace for buying and selling computational power. The GCX is built in a layered fashion, comprising Market, App, Clearing, Risk Management, Exchange (Offchain), and Blockchain (Onchain) layers, each ensuring a robust and efficient operation. This platform aims to revolutionize the computational resource market by fostering a decentralized, efficient, and transparent ecosystem that ensures equitable access to computing power, stimulates innovation, and supports diverse user needs on a global scale. By transforming compute hours into a tradable commodity, the GCX seeks to optimize resource utilization, stabilize pricing, and democratize access to computational resources. This paper explores the technological infrastructure, market potential, and societal impact of the GCX, positioning it as a pioneering solution poised to drive the next wave of innovation in commodities and compute.</description>

      <title>They were robbed! Scoring by the middlemost to attenuate biased judging in boxing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boxing has a long-standing problem with biased judging, impacting both professional and Olympic bouts. "Robberies", where boxers are widely seen as being denied rightful victories, threaten to drive fans and athletes away from the sport. To tackle this problem, we propose a minimalist adjustment in how boxing is scored: the winner would be decided by the majority of round-by-round victories according to the judges, rather than relying on the judges' overall bout scores. This approach, rooted in social choice theory and utilising majority rule and middlemost aggregation functions, creates a coordination problem for partisan judges and attenuates their influence. Our model analysis and simulations demonstrate the potential to significantly decrease the likelihood of a partisan judge swaying the result of a bout.</description>
