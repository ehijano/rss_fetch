      <title>Total variation distance between SDEs with stable noise and Brownian motion with applications to Poisson PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a $d$-dimensional stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the form $dU_t = b(U_t)d t + \sigma d Z_t$ with initial condition $U_0 = u\in \mathbb{R}^d$ and additive noise. Denote by $X_t^x$ the (unique) solution with initial value $X_0^x = x$, if the driving noise $Z_t$ is a $d$-dimensional rotationally symmetric $\alpha$-stable ($1&lt;\alpha&lt;2$) L\'evy process, and by $Y_t^y$ the (unique) solution with initial value $Y_0^y=y$, if the driving noise is a $d$-dimensional Brownian motion.
  We give precise estimates of the total variation distance $\|{\rm law} (X_{t}^x)-{\rm law} (Y_{t}^y)\|_{TV}$ for all $t&gt;0$, and we show that the ergodic measures $\mu_\alpha$ and $\mu_2$ of $X_t^x$ and $Y_t^y$, respectively, satisfy $\|\mu_\alpha-\mu_2\|_{TV} \leq 2\wedge\left[\frac{Cd^{3/2}}{\alpha-1}(2-\alpha)\right]$.
  As an application, we consider the following $d$-dimensional Poisson PDE \begin{gather*}
  -(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2} f(x) + \langle b(x), \nabla f(x)\rangle
  = h(x)-\mu_\alpha(h), \end{gather*} where $h \in C_b(\mathbb{R}^d,\mathbb{R})$ and $1&lt;\alpha\leq 2$. We show that this PDE admits a solution $f_\alpha$, which is continuous, but may have linear growth. For fixed $\alpha_0\in(1,2)$, we show that for any $\alpha_0\leq \alpha &lt;2$ there is a constant $C(\alpha_0)$ such that \begin{gather*}
  \left|f_\alpha(x)-f_2(x)\right| \leq C(\alpha_0)(1+|x|)\|h\|_\infty d^{3/2}(2-\alpha)\log\frac{1}{2-\alpha}
  \quad\text{for all $x$}. \end{gather*}</description>

      <title>On the reducibility of affine models with dependent L\'evy factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to the study of the short rate equation of the form $$ dR(t)=F(R(t)) dt +\sum_{i=1}^{d}G(R(t-))dZ_i(t)$$
  with deterministic functions $F,G_1,...,G_d$ and a multivariate L\'evy process $Z=(Z_1,...,Z_d)$ with possibly dependent coordinates. The equation is supposed to have a nonnegative solution which generates an affine term structure model. The L\'evy measure $\nu$ of $Z$ is assumed to admit a spherical decomposition based on the representation $\mathbb{R}^d=S^{d-1}\times (0,+\infty)$, where $S^{d-1}$ stands for the unit sphere. Then $\nu(dy)=\lambda(d\xi)\times \gamma_{\xi}(dr)$, where $\lambda$ is a measure on $S^{d-1}$ and $\gamma_{\xi}$ on $(0,+\infty)$. Under some assumptions on spherical decomposition, a precise form of the generator of $R$ is determined and it is shown that the resulted term structure model is identical to that generated by the equation $$ d R(t)=(a R(t)+b) dt+C\cdot (R(t-))^{1/\alpha} dZ^{\alpha}(t), \quad R(0)=x, $$ with some constants $a,b,C$ and a one dimensional $\alpha$-stable L\'evy process $Z^{\alpha}$, where $\alpha\in(1,2)$. The case when $\nu$ has a density is considered as a special case.
  The paper generalizes the classical results on the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model, \cite{CIR}, as well as on its extended version from \cite{BarskiZabczykCIR} and \cite{BarskiZabczyk} where $Z$ is a one-dimensional L\'evy process. It is the starting point for the classification in the spirit of \cite{DaiSingleton} and \cite{BarskiLochowski} for the affine models with dependent L\'evy processes.</description>

      <title>Bounding adapted Wasserstein metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wasserstein distance $\mathcal{W}_p$ is an important instance of an optimal transport cost. Its numerous mathematical properties as well as applications to various fields such as mathematical finance and statistics have been well studied in recent years. The adapted Wasserstein distance $\mathcal{A}\mathcal{W}_p$ extends this theory to laws of discrete time stochastic processes in their natural filtrations, making it particularly well suited for analyzing time-dependent stochastic optimization problems.
  While the topological differences between $\mathcal{A}\mathcal{W}_p$ and $\mathcal{W}_p$ are well understood, their differences as metrics remain largely unexplored beyond the trivial bound $\mathcal{W}_p\lesssim \mathcal{A}\mathcal{W}_p$. This paper closes this gap by providing upper bounds of $\mathcal{A}\mathcal{W}_p$ in terms of $\mathcal{W}_p$ through investigation of the smooth adapted Wasserstein distance. Our upper bounds are explicit and are given by a sum of $\mathcal{W}_p$, Eder's modulus of continuity and a term characterizing the tail behavior of measures. As a consequence, upper bounds on $\mathcal{W}_p$ automatically hold for $\mathcal{AW}_p$ under mild regularity assumptions on the measures considered. A particular instance of our findings is the inequality $\mathcal{A}\mathcal{W}_1\le C\sqrt{\mathcal{W}_1}$ on the set of measures that have Lipschitz kernels.
  Our work also reveals how smoothing of measures affects the adapted weak topology. In fact, we find that the topology induced by the smooth adapted Wasserstein distance exhibits a non-trivial interpolation property, which we characterize explicitly: it lies in between the adapted weak topology and the weak topology, and the inclusion is governed by the decay of the smoothing parameter.</description>

      <title>Finite rank perturbation of non-Hermitian random matrices: heavy tail and sparse regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of perturbing a large, i.i.d. random matrix by a finite rank error. It is known that when elements of the i.i.d. matrix have finite fourth moment, then the outlier eigenvalues of the perturbed matrix are close to the outlier eigenvalues of the error, as long as the perturbation is relatively small. We first prove that under a merely second moment condition, for a large class of perturbation matrix with bounded rank and bounded operator norm, the outlier eigenvalues of perturbed matrix still converge to that of the perturbation. We then prove that for a matrix with i.i.d. Bernoulli $(d/n)$ entries or Bernoulli $(d_n/n)$ entries with $d_n=n^{o(1)}$, the same result holds for perturbation matrices with a bounded number of nonzero elements.</description>

      <title>Integrability of the multi-species ASEP with long-range jumps on $\mathbb{Z}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let us consider a two-sided multi-species stochastic particle model with finitely many particles on $\mathbb{Z}$ defined as follows. Suppose that each particle is labelled by a positive integer $l$ and waits a random time exponentially distributed with rate $1$. It then chooses the right direction to jump with probability $p$ or the left direction with probability $q=1-p$. If the particle chooses the right direction, it jumps to the nearest site occupied by a particle $l'&lt;l$ (with the convention that an empty site is considered as a particle with labelled $0$). If the particle chooses the left direction, it follows the rule of the multi-species totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (mTASEP). We show that this model is integrable and provide the exact formula of the transition probability using the Bethe ansatz.</description>

      <title>Remarks on the Poisson additive process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Poisson additive process is a binary conditionally additive process such that the first is the Poisson process provided the second is given. We prove the existence and uniqueness of predictable increasing mean intensity for the Poisson additive process. Besides, we establish a likelihood ratio formula for the Poisson additive process. It directly implies there doesn't exist an anticipative Poisson additive process which is absolutely continuous with respect to the standard Poisson process, which confirms a conjecture proposed by P. Br\'emaud in his PhD thesis in 1972. When applied to the Hawkes process, it concludes that the self-exciting function is constant. Similar results are also obtained for the Wiener additive process and Markov additive process.</description>

      <title>Grothendieck Shenanigans: Permutons from pipe dreams via integrable probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study random permutations arising from reduced pipe dreams. Our main model is motivated by Grothendieck polynomials with parameter $\beta=1$ arising in K-theory of the flag variety. The probability weight of a permutation is proportional to the principal specialization (setting all variables to 1) of the corresponding Grothendieck polynomial. By mapping this random permutation to a version of TASEP (Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process), we describe the limiting permuton and fluctuations around it as the order $n$ of the permutation grows to infinity. The fluctuations are of order $n^{\frac13}$ and have the Tracy-Widom GUE distribution, which places this algebraic (K-theoretic) model into the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class.
  We also investigate non-reduced pipe dreams and make progress on a recent open problem on the asymptotic number of inversions of the resulting permutation. Inspired by Stanley's question for the maximal value of principal specializations of Schubert polynomials, we resolve the analogous question for $\beta=1$ Grothendieck polynomials, and provide bounds for general $\beta$.</description>

      <title>Convergence rates for the Adam optimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization methods are nowadays the method of choice for the training of deep neural networks (DNNs) in artificial intelligence systems. In practically relevant training problems, usually not the plain vanilla standard SGD method is the employed optimization scheme but instead suitably accelerated and adaptive SGD optimization methods are applied. As of today, maybe the most popular variant of such accelerated and adaptive SGD optimization methods is the famous Adam optimizer proposed by Kingma &amp; Ba in 2014. Despite the popularity of the Adam optimizer in implementations, it remained an open problem of research to provide a convergence analysis for the Adam optimizer even in the situation of simple quadratic stochastic optimization problems where the objective function (the function one intends to minimize) is strongly convex. In this work we solve this problem by establishing optimal convergence rates for the Adam optimizer for a large class of stochastic optimization problems, in particular, covering simple quadratic stochastic optimization problems. The key ingredient of our convergence analysis is a new vector field function which we propose to refer to as the Adam vector field. This Adam vector field accurately describes the macroscopic behaviour of the Adam optimization process but differs from the negative gradient of the objective function (the function we intend to minimize) of the considered stochastic optimization problem. In particular, our convergence analysis reveals that the Adam optimizer does typically not converge to critical points of the objective function (zeros of the gradient of the objective function) of the considered optimization problem but converges with rates to zeros of this Adam vector field.</description>

      <title>Extending choice assessments to choice functions: An algorithm for computing the natural extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how to infer new choices from prior choices using the framework of choice functions, a unifying mathematical framework for decision-making based on sets of preference orders. In particular, we define the natural (most conservative) extension of a given choice assessment to a coherent choice function -- whenever possible -- and use this natural extension to make new choices. We provide a practical algorithm for computing this natural extension and various ways to improve scalability. Finally, we test these algorithms for different types of choice assessments.</description>

      <title>A Trek Rule for the Lyapunov Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we show a new version of the trek rule for the continuous Lyapunov equation. This linear matrix equation characterizes the cross-sectional steady-state covariance matrix of a Gaussian Markov process, and the trek rule links the graphical structure of the drift of the process to the entries of this covariance matrix. In general, the trek rule is a power series expansion of the covariance matrix, while for the special case where the drift is acyclic, it simplifies to a polynomial in the off-diagonal entries of the drift matrix. Using the trek rule we can give relatively explicit formulas for the entries of the covariance matrix for some special cases of the drift matrix. Furthermore, we use the trek rule to derive a new lower bound for the variances in the acyclic case.</description>

      <title>On the mean-field limit of the Cucker-Smale model with Random Batch Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on the mean-field limit of the Random Batch Method (RBM) for the Cucker-Smale model. Different from the classical mean-field limit analysis, the chaos in this model is imposed at discrete time and is propagated to discrete time flux. We approach separately the limits of the number of particles $N\to\infty$ and the discrete time interval $\tau\to 0$ with respect to the RBM, by using the flocking property of the Cucker-Smale model and the observation in combinatorics. The Wasserstein distance is used to quantify the difference between the approximation limit and the original mean-field limit. Also, we combine the RBM with generalized Polynomial Chaos (gPC) expansion and proposed the RBM-gPC method to approximate stochastic mean-field equations, which conserves positivity and momentum of the mean-field limit with random inputs.</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal behavior of Quadratically Regularized Optimal Transport and its relation with the Porous Medium Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quadratically regularized optimal transport problem has recently been considered in various applications where the coupling needs to be \emph{sparse}, i.e., the density of the coupling needs to be zero for a large subset of the product of the supports of the marginals. However, unlike the acclaimed entropy-regularized optimal transport, the effect of quadratic regularization on the transport problem is not well understood from a mathematical standpoint. In this work, we take a first step towards its understanding. We prove that the difference between the cost of optimal transport and its regularized version multiplied by the ratio $\varepsilon^{-\frac{2}{d+2}}$ converges to a nontrivial limit as the regularization parameter $\varepsilon$ tends to 0. The proof confirms a conjecture from Zhang et al. (2023) where it is claimed that a modification of the self-similar solution of the porous medium equation, the Barenblatt--Pattle solution, can be used as an approximate solution of the regularized transport cost for small values of $\varepsilon$.</description>

      <title>Fisher-Rao distance between truncated distributions and robustness analysis in uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Input variables in numerical models are often subject to several levels of uncertainty, usually modeled by probability distributions. In the context of uncertainty quantification applied to these models, studying the robustness of output quantities with respect to the input distributions requires: (a) defining variational classes for these distributions; (b) calculating boundary values for the output quantities of interest with respect to these variational classes. The latter should be defined in a way that is consistent with the information structure defined by the ``baseline'' choice of input distributions. Considering parametric families, the variational classes are defined using the geodesic distance in their Riemannian manifold, a generic approach to such problems. Theoretical results and application tools are provided to justify and facilitate the implementation of such robustness studies, in concrete situations where these distributions are truncated -- a setting frequently encountered in applications. The feasibility of our approach is illustrated in a simplified industrial case study.</description>

      <title>A non-autonomous p-Adic diffusion equation on time changing graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recently proven presence of ultrametricity in physical models (certain spin glasses) and the very recent study of Turing patterns on locally ultrametric state spaces, first non-autonomous diffusion operators on such spaces, where finitely many compact p-adic spaces are joined by a graph structure, are studied, including their Dirichlet and van Neumann eigenvalues. Secondly, the Cauchy problem for the heat equation associated with these operators is solved, its solution approximated by Trotter products, and thirdly, the corresponding Feller property as well as the Markov property (a Hunt process) is established.</description>

      <title>A deterministic proof of Loewner energy reversibility via local reversals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new proof of the orientation reversibility of chordal Loewner energy by reversing the orientation of a chord in small increments. This fact was first proved by Yilin Wang (arXiv:1601.05297) using the reversibility of chordal Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE). Our method is similar in spirit to Dapeng Zhan's proof (arXiv:0808.3649) of chordal SLE reversibility, though it is purely deterministic.</description>

      <title>A sharp lower bound on the small eigenvalues of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a compact hyperbolic surface of genus $g\geq 2$ and let $I(S) = \frac{1}{\mathrm{Vol}(S)}\int_{S} \frac{1}{\mathrm{Inj}(x)^2 \wedge 1} dx$, where $\mathrm{Inj}(x)$ is the injectivity radius at $x$. We prove that for any $k\in \{1,\ldots, 2g-3\}$, the $k$-th eigenvalue $\lambda_k$ of the Laplacian satisfies \begin{equation*}
  \lambda_k \geq \frac{c k^2}{I(S) g^2} \, , \end{equation*} where $c&gt;0$ is some universal constant. We use this bound to prove the heat kernel estimate \begin{equation*}
  \frac{1}{\mathrm{Vol}(S)} \int_S \Big| p_t(x,x) -\frac{1}{\mathrm{Vol}(S)} \Big | ~dx \leq C \sqrt{ \frac{I(S)}{t}} \qquad \forall t \geq 1 \, , \end{equation*} where $C&lt;\infty$ is some universal constant. These bounds are optimal in the sense that for every $g\geq 2$ there exists a compact hyperbolic surface of genus $g$ satisfying the reverse inequalities with different constants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.02641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper attempts to obtain necessary and sufficient conditions to solve the parabolic Anderson model with fractional Gaussian noises: $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}u(t,x)=\frac{1}{2}\Delta u(t,x)+u(t,x)\dot{W}(t,x)$, where $ {W}(t,x)$ is the fractional Brownian field with temporal Hurst parameter $H_0\in [1/2, 1) $ and spatial Hurst parameters $H$ $ =(H_1, \cdots, H_d)$ $ \in (0, 1)^d$, and $\dot{W}(t,x)=\frac{\partial ^{d+1}}{\partial t \partial x_1 \cdots \partial x_d}W(t,x)$. When $d=1$ and when $(H_0,H)\in(\frac 12,1)\times(\frac 1{20},\frac 12)$ we show that the condition $2H_0+H&gt;5/2$ is necessary and sufficient to ensure the existence of a unique solution for the parabolic Anderson Model. When $d\ge 2$, we find the necessary and sufficient condition on the Hurst parameters so that each chaos of the solution candidate is square integrable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider coupled slow-fast stochastic processes, where the averaged slow motion is given by a two-dimensional Hamiltonian system with multiple critical points. On a proper time scale, the evolution of the first integral converges to a diffusion process on the corresponding Reeb graph, with certain gluing conditions specified at the interior vertices, as in the case of additive white noise perturbations of Hamiltonian systems considered by M. Freidlin and A. Wentzell. The current paper provides the first result where the motion on a graph and the corresponding gluing conditions appear due to the averaging of a slow-fast system, with a Hamiltonian structure, on a large time scale. The result allows one to consider, for instance, long-time diffusion approximation for an oscillator with a potential with more than one well.</description>

Abstract: We provide a probabilistic proof of the fundamental gap estimate for Schr\"odinger operators in convex domains on the sphere, which extends the probabilistic proof of F. Gong, H. Li, and D. Luo for the Euclidean case. Our results further generalize the results achieved for the Laplacian by S. Seto, L. Wang, and G. Wei, as well as by C. He, G. Wei, and Qi S. Zhang.

      <description>arXiv:2405.04076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $R&gt;0$, we give a rigorous probabilistic construction on the cylinder $\mathbb{R} \times (\mathbb{R}/(2\pi R\mathbb{Z}))$ of the (massless) Sinh-Gordon model. In particular we define the $n$-point correlation functions of the model and show that these exhibit a scaling relation with respect to $R$. The construction, which relies on the massless Gaussian Free Field, is based on the spectral analysis of a quantum operator associated to the model. Using the theory of Gaussian multiplicative chaos, we prove that this operator has discrete spectrum and a strictly positive ground state.</description>

Abstract: We study the asymptotics of the expected Wasserstein distance between the empirical measure of a Point Process and the background volume form. The main DPP studied is the harmonic ensemble, where we get the optimal rate of convergence for homogeneous manifolds of dimension $d\geq 3$, and for two-point homogeneous manifolds. We also discuss some variations of this process on the torus. Regarding other point processes, we find the optimal rate for the spherical ensemble and the zeros of Gaussian Analytic Functions.</description>

      <title>Stein's method and general clocks: diffusion approximation of the $G/G/1$ workload</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We begin developing the theory of the generator comparison approach of Stein's method for continuous-time Markov processes where jumps are driven by clocks having general distributions, as opposed to exponential distributions. This paper handles models with a single general clock.
  Using the workload process in the $G/G/1$ queueing system as a driving example, we develop two variants of the generator comparison approach for models with a single general clock: the original, which we call the limiting approach, and the recently proposed prelimit approach. The approaches are duals of one another, yielding distinct bounds on the diffusion approximation error of the steady-state workload.
  We also contribute to the theory of heavy-traffic approximations for the $G/G/1$ system. Under some assumptions on the interarrival time distribution, the prelimit approach allows us to bound the diffusion approximation error in terms of $G/G/1$ model primitives. For example, when the interarrival time has a nonincreasing hazard rate that is bounded from above, we show that the diffusion approximation error of the expected workload is bounded in terms of the first three moments of the interarrival and service-time distributions, as well as the upper bound on the interarrival hazard rate.</description>

      <title>Quantitative disorder effects in low-dimensional spin systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2101.01711v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Imry-Ma phenomenon, predicted in 1975 by Imry and Ma and rigorously established in 1989 by Aizenman and Wehr, states that first-order phase transitions of low-dimensional spin systems are `rounded' by the addition of a quenched random field to the quantity undergoing the transition. The phenomenon applies to a wide class of spin systems in dimensions $d\le 2$ and to spin systems possessing a continuous symmetry in dimensions $d\le 4$.
  This work provides quantitative estimates for the Imry--Ma phenomenon: In a cubic domain of side length $L$, we study the effect of the boundary conditions on the spatial and thermal average of the quantity coupled to the random field. We show that the boundary effect diminishes at least as fast as an inverse power of $\log\log L$ for general two-dimensional spin systems and for four-dimensional spin systems with continuous symmetry, and at least as fast as an inverse power of $L$ for two- and three-dimensional spin systems with continuous symmetry. Specific models of interest for the obtained results include the two-dimensional random-field $q$-state Potts and Edwards-Anderson spin glass models, and the $d$-dimensional random-field spin $O(n)$ models ($n\ge 2$) in dimensions $d\le 4$.</description>

      <title>On the prime Selmer ranks of cyclic prime twist families of elliptic curves over global function fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fix a prime number $p$. Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be a finite field of characteristic coprime to 2, 3, and $p$, which also contains the primitive $p$-th root of unity $\mu_p$. Based on the works by Swinnerton-Dyer and Klagsbrun, Mazur, and Rubin, we prove that the probability distribution of the sizes of prime Selmer groups over a family of cyclic prime twists of non-isotrivial elliptic curves over $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ satisfying a number of mild constraints conforms to the distribution conjectured by Bhargava, Kane, Lenstra, Poonen, and Rains with explicit error bounds. The key tools used in proving these results are the Riemann hypothesis over global function fields, the Erd\"os-Kac theorem, and the geometric ergodicity of Markov chains.</description>

      <title>Posterior-Variance-Based Error Quantification for Inverse Problems in Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, a method for obtaining pixel-wise error bounds in Bayesian regularization of inverse imaging problems is introduced. The proposed method employs estimates of the posterior variance together with techniques from conformal prediction in order to obtain coverage guarantees for the error bounds, without making any assumption on the underlying data distribution. It is generally applicable to Bayesian regularization approaches, independent, e.g., of the concrete choice of the prior. Furthermore, the coverage guarantees can also be obtained in case only approximate sampling from the posterior is possible. With this in particular, the proposed framework is able to incorporate any learned prior in a black-box manner. Guaranteed coverage without assumptions on the underlying distributions is only achievable since the magnitude of the error bounds is, in general, unknown in advance. Nevertheless, experiments with multiple regularization approaches presented in the paper confirm that in practice, the obtained error bounds are rather tight. For realizing the numerical experiments, also a novel primal-dual Langevin algorithm for sampling from non-smooth distributions is introduced in this work.</description>

      <title>Gibbs sampling, exact sampling, and distribution function evaluation for the generalized inverse Gaussian distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generalized inverse Gaussian, denoted $\mathrm{GIG}(p, a, b)$, is a flexible family of distributions that includes the gamma, inverse gamma, and inverse Gaussian distributions as special cases. In addition to its applications in statistical modeling and its theoretical interest, the GIG often arises in computational statistics, especially in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for posterior inference. This article introduces two mixture representations for the GIG: one that expresses the distribution as a continuous mixture of inverse Gaussians and another that reveals a recursive relationship between GIGs with different values of $p$. The former representation forms the basis for a data augmentation scheme that leads to a geometrically ergodic Gibbs sampler for the GIG. This simple Gibbs sampler, which alternates between gamma and inverse Gaussian conditional distributions, can be incorporated within an encompassing MCMC algorithm when simulation from a GIG is required. The latter representation leads to algorithms for exact, rejection-free sampling as well as CDF evaluation for the GIG with half-integer $p.$ We highlight computational examples from the literature where these new algorithms could be applied.</description>

Abstract: The totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) is a stochastic model for the unidirectional dynamics of interacting particles on a $1$D-lattice that is much used in systems biology and statistical physics. Its master equation describes the evolution of the probability distribution on the state space. The size of the master equation grows exponentially with the length of the lattice. It is known that the complexity of the system may be reduced using mean field approximations. We provide a rigorous derivation and a stochastic interpretation of these approximations and present numerical results on their accuracy for a number of relevant cases.</description>

      <title>The saddlepoint approximation for averages of conditionally independent random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the application of saddlepoint approximations to resampling-based statistical tests, we prove that the Lugannani-Rice formula has vanishing relative error when applied to approximate conditional tail probabilities of averages of conditionally independent random variables. In a departure from existing work, this result is valid under only sub-exponential assumptions on the summands, and does not require any assumptions on their smoothness or lattice structure. The derived saddlepoint approximation result can be directly applied to resampling-based hypothesis tests, including bootstrap, sign-flipping and conditional randomization tests. We exemplify this by providing the first rigorous justification of a saddlepoint approximation for the sign-flipping test of symmetry about the origin, initially proposed in 1955. On the way to our main result, we establish a conditional Berry-Esseen inequality for sums of conditionally independent random variables, which may be of independent interest.</description>
