      <title>Mobility Edges in Two-Dimensional Aperiodic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1958, Anderson proposed a new insulating mechanism in random lattices, now known as Anderson localization. It has been shown that a metal-insulating transition occurs in three dimensions, and that one-dimensional disordered systems can be solved exactly to show strong localization regardless of the strength of disorders. Meanwhile, the two-dimensional case was known to be localizing from a scaling argument. Here, we report that there exists a mobility edge in certain random potentials which separate the extended-like states from short-ranged localized states. We further observe that the location of the mobility edge depends on the typical wavelength of the potential, and that the localization length are are related to the energy of an eigenstate. Finally, we apply a renormalization group theory to explain the localization effects and the existence of mobility edge and propose an experimental scheme to verify the mobility edge in photonic crystals.</description>

      <title>The long-range origin of the black hole entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, has emerged as a powerful tool for exploring the quantum nature of black holes, particularly their residual entropy at zero temperature. In this work, we investigate the role of long-range interactions in a chain of SYK dots with power-law decaying couplings and demonstrate how these interactions can lead to finite residual entropy in the strong non-local case. Indeed, as a function of the interaction range, the black-hole phase, found in the isolated SYK, melts into a long-range Fermi-liquid phase in the weak long-range regime and finally reaches the non Fermi-liquid phase in the purely local case. Our results pave the way to the understanding of the role of the interaction range in black hole thermodynamics and quantum information.</description>

      <title>Hypermodularity and community detection in higher-order networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous networked systems feature a structure of non-trivial communities, which often correspond to their functional modules. Such communities have been detected in real-world biological, social and technological systems, as well as in synthetic models thereof. While much effort has been devoted to develop methods for community detection in traditional networks, the study of community structure in networks with higher-order interactions is still relatively unexplored. In this article, we introduce a formalism for the hypermodularity of higher-order networks that allows us to use spectral methods to detect community structures in hypergraphs. We apply this approach to synthetic random networks as well as to real-world data, showing that it produces results that reflect the nature and the dynamics of the interactions modelled, thereby constituting a valuable tool for the extraction of hidden information from complex higher-order data sets.</description>

      <title>Impurity effects in twisted carbon nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider electronic spectra of twisted carbon nanotubes and their perturbation by impurity atoms absorbed at different positions on nanotube surface within the framework of Anderson hybrid model. A special attention is given to the cases when 1D Weyl (massless Dirac) modes are present in the nanotube spectrum and their hybridization with localized impurity states produces, with growing impurity concentration c, onset of a mobility gap near the impurity level and then opening, at yet higher c, of some narrow range of delocalized states within this mobility gap. Such behaviors are compared with similar effects in the previously studied 2D graphene, carbon nanoribbons, and non-twisted carbon nanotubes. Some possible practical applications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Critical exponents at the Nishimori point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Nishimori point of the random bond Ising model is a prototype of renormalization group fixed points with strong disorder. We show that the exact correlation length and crossover critical exponents at this point can be identified in two and three spatial dimensions starting from properties of the Nishimori line. These are the first exact exponents for frustrated random magnets, a circumstance to be also contrasted with the fact that the exact exponents of the Ising model without disorder are not known in three dimensions. Our considerations extend to higher dimensions and models other than Ising.</description>

      <title>Edge of entanglement in non-ergodic states: a complexity parameter formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the subsystem size scaling of the entanglement entropy of a non-ergodic pure state that can be described by a multi-parametric Gaussian ensemble of complex matrices in a bipartite basis. Our analysis indicates, for a given set of global constraints, the existence of infinite number of universality classes of local complexity, characterized by the complexity parameter, for which the entanglement entropy reveals a universal scaling with subsystem size. A rescaling of the complexity parameter helps us to identify the critical regime for the entanglement entropy of a broad range of pure non-ergodic states.</description>

      <title>Neural Projected Quantum Dynamics: a systematic study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of simulating unitary quantum dynamics in large systems using Neural Quantum States, focusing on overcoming the computational instabilities and high cost of existing methods. This work offers a comprehensive formalization of the projected time-dependent Variational Monte Carlo (p-tVMC) method by thoroughly analyzing its two essential components: stochastic infidelity minimization and discretization of the unitary evolution. We investigate neural infidelity minimization using natural gradient descent strategies, identifying the most stable stochastic estimators and introducing adaptive regularization strategies that eliminate the need for manual adjustment of the hyperparameter along the dynamics. We formalize the specific requirements that p-tVMC imposes on discretization schemes for them to be efficient, and introduce four high-order integration schemes combining Taylor expansions, Pad\'e approximants, and Trotter splitting to enhance accuracy and scalability. We benchmark our adaptive methods against a 2D Ising quench, matching state of the art techniques without manual tuning of hyperparameters. This work establishes p-tVMC as a highly promising framework for addressing complex quantum dynamics, offering a compelling alternative for researchers looking to push the boundaries of quantum simulations.</description>
