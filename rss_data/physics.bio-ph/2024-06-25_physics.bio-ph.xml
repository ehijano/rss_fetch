      <title>Can Specific THz Fields Induce Collective Base-Flipping in DNA? A Stochastic Averaging and Resonant Enhancement Investigation Based on a New Mesoscopic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the metastability, internal frequencies, activation mechanism, energy transfer, and the collective base-flipping in a mesoscopic DNA via resonance with specific electric fields. Our new mesoscopic DNA model takes into account not only the issues of helicity and the coupling of an electric field with the base dipole moments, but also includes environmental effects such as fluid viscosity and thermal noise. And all the parameter values are chosen to best represent the typical values for the opening and closing dynamics of a DNA. Our study shows that while the mesocopic DNA is metastable and robust to environmental effects, it is vulnerable to certain frequencies that could be targeted by specific THz fields for triggering its collective base-flipping dynamics and causing large amplitude separation of base pairs. Based on applying Freidlin-Wentzell method of stochastic averaging and the newly developed theory of resonant enhancement to our mesoscopic DNA model, our semi-analytic estimates show that the required fields should be THz fields with frequencies around 0.28 THz and with amplitudes in the order of 450 kV/cm. These estimates compare well with the experimental data of Titova et al., which have demonstrated that they could affect the function of DNA in human skin tissues by THz pulses with frequencies around 0.5 THz and with a peak electric field at 220 kV/cm. Moreover, our estimates also conform to a number of other experimental results which appeared in the last couple years.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enhanced photoprotection in neuroprotein architectures emerges from collective light-matter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study here the collective quantum optical effect of superradiance in neuroprotein architectures. This phenomenon arises from the interaction of the electromagnetic field with an organized network of tryptophan chromophores, where each can be effectively modeled as a two-level quantum emitter. Building on our prior experimental confirmation of single-photon superradiance in microtubules, we predict that bright superradiant states will also emerge in simulated actin filament bundles and amyloid fibrils, which manifests in the form of high quantum yields that are robust to static disorder up to five times that of room temperature. For microtubules and amyloid fibrils, the quantum yield is enhanced with increasing system size, contrary to the conventional expectations of quantum effects in a thermally equilibrated environment. We conduct our analyses using a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian derived from the Lindblad equation for an open quantum system that describes the interaction of a chromophore network with the electromagnetic field, in the single-photon limit. Our detailed quantum yield predictions in realistic neuroprotein structures -- including analysis of the potential information-processing applications of correlated superradiant and subradiant states at divergent timescales -- provide motivation for a range of in vitro experiments to confirm these quantum enhancements, which can serve in vivo as a mechanism for dissipating or downconverting high-energy UV metabolic photon emissions in intensely oxidative pathological environments, including those found in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.</description>

      <title>Label-free mid-infrared photothermal microscopy revisits intracellular thermal dynamics: what do fluorescent nanothermometers measure?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorescent nanothermometry has revealed pronounced inhomogeneous temperature distributions within cells and has opened the field of single-cell thermal biology. However, this finding has sparked a controversial discussion known as the 10^5 gap issue, which arises from a simple heat conduction calculation suggesting such large temperature distributions should not exist inside cells. This debate has led to a hypothesis that intracellular thermal conduction is considerably slower than in water. Although various efforts have been made to measure intracellular thermal conduction, there are significant variations in the reported values. Here, we address this issue using label-free mid-infrared photothermal microscopy, which enables us to measure heat-induced temperature variations under local thermal equilibrium via refractive index changes. We measured intracellular thermal diffusivity via transient thermal decay and found that thermal diffusivity within living cells is 93-94% of water in the cytoplasm and nucleus. This result suggests that intracellular thermal conduction cannot explain the 10^5 gap issue. To investigate this issue further, we compared fluorescent nanothermometry with our label-free thermometry by measuring heat-induced temperature variations in living cells. This experiment revealed intriguing results where the fluorescent nanothermometry showed a slowly varying unexpected signal in addition to a constant temperature change. This result indicates that fluorescent nanothermometers are sensitive to additional factors on top of the temperature variation under local thermal equilibrium, raising an open question of what fluorescent nanothermometry measures.</description>

      <title>Entropy-driven decision-making dynamics sheds light on the emergence of the "paradox of choice"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision making is the cognitive process of selecting a course of action among multiple alternatives. As the decision maker belongs to a complex microenvironment (which contains multiple decision makers), has to make a decision where multiple options are present which often leads to a phenomenon known as the "paradox of choices". The latter refers to the case where too many options can lead to negative outcomes, such as increased uncertainty, decision paralysis, and frustration. Here, we employ an entropy driven mechanism within a statistical physics framework to explain the premises of the paradox. In turn, we focus on the emergence of a collective "paradox of choice", in the case of interacting decision-making agents, quantified as the decision synchronization time. Our findings reveal a trade-off between synchronization time and the sensing radius, indicating the optimal conditions for information transfer among group members, which significantly depends the individual sensitivity parameters. Interestingly, when agents sense their microenvironment in a biased way or their decisions are influenced by their past choices, then the collective "paradox of choice" does not occur. In a nutshell, our theory offers a low-dimensional and unified statistical explanation of the "paradox of choice" at the individual and at the collective level.</description>

      <title>Apparent phase transitions and critical-like behavior in multi-component mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid-liquid phase separation has recently emerged as an important topic in the context of cellular organization. Within this context, there are multiple poorly understood features; for instance hints of critical behavior in the plasma membrane, and how homeostasis maintains phase separation. In this paper, using statistical mechanics, we show that finite size effects in multicomponent mixtures can induce the system to behave as-if it were near a critical point, which we term apparent transitions. The apparent transition temperature is naturally driven towards the ambient temperature of the system.</description>

      <title>General Binding Affinity Guidance for Diffusion Models in Structure-Based Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) focuses on generating valid ligands that strongly and specifically bind to a designated protein pocket. Several methods use machine learning for SBDD to generate these ligands in 3D space, conditioned on the structure of a desired protein pocket. Recently, diffusion models have shown success here by modeling the underlying distributions of atomic positions and types. While these methods are effective in considering the structural details of the protein pocket, they often fail to explicitly consider the binding affinity. Binding affinity characterizes how tightly the ligand binds to the protein pocket, and is measured by the change in free energy associated with the binding process. It is one of the most crucial metrics for benchmarking the effectiveness of the interaction between a ligand and protein pocket. To address this, we propose BADGER: Binding Affinity Diffusion Guidance with Enhanced Refinement. BADGER is a general guidance method to steer the diffusion sampling process towards improved protein-ligand binding, allowing us to adjust the distribution of the binding affinity between ligands and proteins. Our method is enabled by using a neural network (NN) to model the energy function, which is commonly approximated by AutoDock Vina (ADV). ADV's energy function is non-differentiable, and estimates the affinity based on the interactions between a ligand and target protein receptor. By using a NN as a differentiable energy function proxy, we utilize the gradient of our learned energy function as a guidance method on top of any trained diffusion model. We show that our method improves the binding affinity of generated ligands to their protein receptors by up to 60\%, significantly surpassing previous machine learning methods. We also show that our guidance method is flexible and can be easily applied to other diffusion-based SBDD frameworks.</description>

      <title>Modular DNA origami-based electrochemical detection of DNA and proteins</title>

Abstract: The diversity and heterogeneity of biomarkers has made the development of general methods for single-step quantification of analytes difficult. For individual biomarkers, electrochemical methods that detect a conformational change in an affinity binder upon analyte binding have shown promise. However, because the conformational change must operate within a nanometer-scale working distance, an entirely new sensor, with a unique conformational change, must be developed for each analyte. Here, we demonstrate a modular electrochemical biosensor, built from DNA origami, which is easily adapted to diverse molecules by merely replacing its analyte binding domains. Instead of relying on a unique nanometer-scale movement of a single redox reporter, all sensor variants rely on the same 100-nanometer scale conformational change, which brings dozens of reporters close enough to a gold electrode surface that a signal can be measured via square wave voltammetry, a standard electrochemical technique. To validate our sensor's mechanism, we used single-stranded DNA as an analyte, and optimized the number of redox reporters and various linker lengths. Adaptation of the sensor to streptavidin and PDGF-BB analytes was achieved by simply adding biotin or anti-PDGF aptamers to appropriate DNA linkers. Geometrically-optimized streptavidin sensors exhibited signal gain and limit of detection markedly better than comparable reagentless electrochemical sensors. After use, the same sensors could be regenerated under mild conditions: performance was largely maintained over four cycles of DNA strand displacement and rehybridization. By leveraging the modularity of DNA nanostructures, our work provides a straightforward route to the single-step quantification of arbitrary nucleic acids and proteins.</description>

      <title>The Turing Pattern Transition with the Growing Domain and Metabolic Rate Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines how patterns on mammal body surfaces change as they transition from juveniles to adults and with seasonal variations. Our previous research suggests that patterns formed in infancy may fade due to the growing domain effects, typically linked to the body's surface expanding as it grows, but this transition is influenced by various factors. Here, we focus on how heat, which can change with body growth, affects this process. Generally, smaller organisms lose heat more easily due to their higher surface area-to-volume ratio, while larger organisms retain heat more effectively. In fact, thermoregulation during infancy is a crucial factor directly influencing survival. We propose a theoretical model that incorporates both growing domain and metabolic rate effects to explain the mechanisms behind these pattern transitions. The model suggests that Turing patterns formed during juvenile stages disperse in adulthood due to domain growth and changes in metabolic rates affecting reaction rates. Numerical analysis shows that when both growing domain and metabolic rate effects are considered, patterns disperse more rapidly than when only growing domain effects are accounted for. Furthermore, we discuss potential correlations among pattern transitions, growth, and thermoregulation mechanisms, emphasizing the role of metabolic rates in maintaining body temperature. Our findings shed light on the intricate relationship between growth, thermoregulation, and pattern transitions in mammals, possibly useful for further research in this field.</description>

      <title>Computing macroscopic reaction rates in reaction-diffusion systems using Monte Carlo simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03089v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic reaction-diffusion models are employed to represent many complex physical, biological, societal, and ecological systems. The macroscopic reaction rates describing the large-scale kinetics in such systems are effective, scale-dependent parameters that need to be either measured experimentally or computed using a microscopic model. In a Monte Carlo simulation of stochastic reaction-diffusion systems, microscopic probabilities for specific events to happen serve as the input control parameters. Finding the functional dependence of emergent macroscopic rates on the microscopic probabilities is a difficult problem, and there is no systematic analytical way to achieve this goal. Therefore, we introduce a straightforward numerical method of using Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the macroscopic reaction rates by directly obtaining the count statistics of how many events occur per simulation time step. Our technique is first tested on well-understood fundamental examples, namely restricted birth processes, diffusion-limited two-particle coagulation, and two-species pair annihilation kinetics. Next we utilize the thus gained experience to investigate how the microscopic algorithmic probabilities become coarse-grained into effective macroscopic rates in more complex model systems such as the Lotka--Volterra model for predator-prey competition and coexistence, as well as the rock-paper-scissors or cyclic Lotka--Volterra model as well as its May--Leonard variant that capture population dynamics with cyclic dominance motifs. Thereby we achieve a deeper understanding of coarse-graining in spatially extended stochastic reaction systems and the nontrivial relationships between the associated microscopic and macroscopic model parameters. The proposed technique should generally provide a useful means to better fit Monte Carlo simulation results to experimental or observational data.</description>

      <title>Predicting heteropolymer interactions: demixing and hypermixing of disordered protein sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07826v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cells contain multiple condensates which spontaneously form due to the heterotypic interactions between their components. Although the proteins and disordered region sequences that are responsible for condensate formation have been extensively studied, the rule of interactions between the components that allow demixing, i.e., the coexistence of multiple condensates, is yet to be elucidated. Here we construct an effective theory of the interaction between heteropolymers by fitting it to the molecular dynamics simulation results obtained for more than 200 sequences sampled from the disordered regions of human proteins. We find that the sum of amino acid pair interactions across two heteropolymers predicts the Boyle temperature qualitatively well, which can be quantitatively improved by the dimer pair approximation, where we incorporate the effect of neighboring amino acids in the sequences. The improved theory, combined with the finding of a metric that captures the effective interaction strength between distinct sequences, allowed the selection of up to three disordered region sequences that demix with each other in multicomponent simulations, as well as the generation of artificial sequences that demix with a given sequence.The theory points to a generic sequence design strategy to demix or hypermix thanks to the low dimensional nature of the space of the interactions that we identify. As a consequence of the geometric arguments in the space of interactions, we find that the number of distinct sequences that can demix with each other is strongly constrained, irrespective of the choice of the coarse-grained model. Altogether, we construct a theoretical basis for methods to estimate the effective interaction between heteropolymers, which can be utilized in predicting phase separation properties as well as rules of assignment in the localization and functions of disordered proteins.</description>

      <title>A Mereological Approach to Higher-Order Structure in Complex Systems: from Macro to Micro with M\"obius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14423v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relating microscopic interactions to macroscopic observables is a central challenge in the study of complex systems. Addressing this question requires understanding both pairwise and \textit{higher-order} interactions, but the latter are less well understood. Here, we show that the M\"obius inversion theorem provides a general mathematical formalism for deriving higher-order interactions from macroscopic observables, relative to a chosen decomposition of the system into parts. Applying this framework to a diverse range of systems, we demonstrate that many existing notions of higher-order interactions, from epistasis in genetics and many-body couplings in physics, to synergy in game theory and artificial intelligence, naturally and uniquely arise from an appropriate mereological decomposition. By revealing the common mathematical structure underlying seemingly disparate phenomena, our work highlights the fundamental role of decomposition choice in the definition and estimation of higher-order interactions. We discuss how this unifying perspective can facilitate the transfer of insights between domains, guide the selection of appropriate system decompositions, and motivate the search for novel interaction types through new decomposition strategies. To illustrate how this works in practice, we derive a new decomposition of the KL-divergence, and show that it correctly disentangles divergences at different orders on simulated spin models. Our results suggest that the M\"obius inversion theorem provides a powerful and practical lens for understanding the emergence of complex behaviour from the interplay of microscopic parts, with applications across a wide range of disciplines.</description>

      <title>Localization and bistability of bioconvection in a doubly periodic domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A suspension of swimming microorganisms often generates a large-scale convective pattern known as bioconvection. In contrast to the thermal Rayleigh-Benard system, recent experimental studies report an emergence of steady localized convection patterns and bistability near the onset of instability in bioconvection systems. In this study, to understand the underlying mechanisms and identify the roles of particle self-propulsion in pattern formation, we theoretically and numerically investigate a model bioconvection system in a two-dimensional periodic boundary domain. In doing so, we extend a standard bioconvection model by introducing the equilibrium density profile as an independent parameter, for which the particle self-propulsion is treated as an independent dimensional parameter. Since the large-scale vertical structure dominates in this system, we are able to simplify the model by truncating the higher vertical modes. With this truncated model, we analytically derived the neutrally stable curve and found that the particle motility stabilizes the system. We then numerically analyzed the bifurcation diagram and found the bistable structure at the onset of instability. These findings, localization and bistability, are consistent with experimental observations. We further examined the global structure of the bistable dynamical system and found that the non-trivial unstable steady solution behaves as an edge state that separates the basins of attractors. These results highlight the importance of particle self-propulsion in bioconvection, and more generally our methodology based on the dynamical systems theory is useful in understanding complex flow patterns in nature.</description>
