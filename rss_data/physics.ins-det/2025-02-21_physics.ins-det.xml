      <title>Compact multi-channel analyzer for SiPM detectors with real time on-board signal analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-channel analysers (MCAs) play a crucial role in spectral measurements, especially in the context of Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) used for gamma spectroscopy. Most commercial MCAs, while highly accurate, remain cost-prohibitive for broader applications. This paper presents the design and implementation of a cost-effective MCA utilizing off-the-shelf components while achieving spectroscopy of gamma particles with reasonable resolution. The MCA board is built around the STM32G4 family microcontroller (MCU), which provides embedded analog components, timers, and high-resolution ADCs. This system is designed to reduce external component requirements, thereby decreasing costs and increasing system reliability. Experimental results demonstrate that the MCA can perform accurate real-time gamma radiation measurements with SiPM detectors. The device offers flexible connectivity options (USB, Ethernet, WiFi). The low-cost, accessible nature of the MCA opens up opportunities for educational and research applications in radiation detection.</description>

      <title>Characterization of sealed (zero gas flow) RPCs under strong irradiation source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase-out of Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), due to their high Global Warming Potential (GWP), affecting the main gas used in Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs), tetrafluorethane C2H2F4, has created operational difficulties on existing systems and imposes strict restrictions on its use in new systems. A possible solution to the problem is the substitution of this gas by others with a much lower GWP. This approach has attracted the attention of an important part of the community in recent years.
  But there could be another possibility, which is the construction of sealed chambers, i.e. chambers that do not need a continuous gas flow to operate (in a similar way to Geiger-Muller counters). This possibility would allow continuing to use HFCs or eventually other types of gases that are already banned. It would also greatly simplify the detector, not requiring the complex and expensive gas systems normally used. This simplification could be particularly relevant for outdoor applications, such as in Cosmic Ray experiments. This has motivated a new line of research and development on sealed RPCs: RPCs that do not require a continuous gas flow for their operation.
  In this work we show the characterization of a sealed RPC plane exposed to an intense radiation source for about one month, with the aim of verifying, in an accelerated way, gas degradation effects that could compromise the operation of the detector. The results show no apparent degradation in any of the parameters studied, namely: efficiency, average charge and streamer probability. The exposure period corresponds, based on the accumulated charge, to approximately four years of natural Cosmic Ray radiation exposure (background signals generated by the detector itself), suggesting the feasibility of the application of this technology in Cosmic Ray experiments for extended periods of time.</description>

      <title>Bolide infrasound signal morphology and yield estimates: A case study of two events detected by a dense acoustic sensor network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two bolides (2 June 2016 and 4 April 2019) were detected at multiple regional infrasound stations with many of the locations receiving multiple detections. Analysis of the received signals was used to estimate the yield, location and trajectory, and the type of shock that produced the received signal. The results from the infrasound analysis were compared with ground truth information that was collected through other sensing modalities. This multi-modal framework offers an expanded perspective on the processes governing bolide shock generation and propagation. The majority of signal features showed reasonable agreement between the infrasound-based interpretation and the other observational modalities, though the yield estimate from the 2019 bolide was significantly lower using the infrasound detections. There was also evidence suggesting that one of the detections was from a cylindrical shock that was initially propagating upward, which is unusual though not impossible.</description>

      <title>The GammaTPC Gamma-Ray Telescope Concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present GammaTPC, a transformative 0.1-10 MeV $\gamma$-ray instrument concept featuring a tracker using a liquid argon time projection chamber (LAr TPC) technology with the novel GAMPix high spatial resolution and ultra low power charge readout. These enable an economical instrument with unprecedented effective area and sensitivity. We discuss the design and technology in some detail, including how a LAr TPC can be staged in space. Finally, we present a first study of the sensitivity of the instrument in the Compton regime using a new framework for analyzing Compton telescope data.</description>

      <title>Distributed network of smartphone sensors: a new tool for scientific field measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Smartphones are widespread objects that have been used as physics sensors for the general public thanks to their availability, high connectivity and built-in sensors. Here, we present the use of a fleet of smartphones to create a distributed network of time-synchronized sensors. We first evaluate the sensors quality in the laboratory and then describe the network configuration that allows the remote control of an entire fleet. Finally, we present two test cases that use the smartphone fleet for physical field measurements. By this study, we show that this approach paves the way for large-scale field scientific studies.</description>
