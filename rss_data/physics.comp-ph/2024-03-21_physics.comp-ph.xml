      <title>Neural Downscaling for Complex Systems: from Large-scale to Small-scale by Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting and understanding the chaotic dynamics in complex systems is essential in various applications. However, conventional approaches, whether full-scale simulations or small-scale omissions, fail to offer a comprehensive solution. This instigates exploration into whether modeling or omitting small-scale dynamics could benefit from the well-captured large-scale dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology called Neural Downscaling (ND), which integrates neural operator techniques with the principles of inertial manifold and nonlinear Galerkin theory. ND effectively infers small-scale dynamics within a complementary subspace from corresponding large-scale dynamics well-represented in a low-dimensional space. The effectiveness and generalization of the method are demonstrated on the complex systems governed by the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and Navier-Stokes equations. As the first comprehensive deterministic model targeting small-scale dynamics, ND sheds light on the intricate spatiotemporal nonlinear dynamics of complex systems, revealing how small-scale dynamics are intricately linked with and influenced by large-scale dynamics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a nonlinear autoregressive neural network with a hidden layer of 50 neurons, three delays and one output layer that accurately is capable of predict the appearence of extreme events in a Kerr lens mode locking Ti:Sapphire laser with ultrashort pulses. Extreme events are produced in the context of a chaotic atractor and with chirped pulses. The prediction of this neural network works well with experimental and theoretical time series of amplitude of laser pulses. When fed with experimental time series we have 95.45\% of hits and 6.67\% of false positives while using theoretical time series the network predicts 100\% of extreme events but the false positive rise to 23.33\%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular quantum chemistry has seen enormous progress in the last few decades thanks to the more advanced and sophisticated numerical techniques and computing power. Following the recent interest in extending these capabilities to condensed-phase problems, we summarize basic knowledge of condensed-phase quantum chemistry for ones with experience in molecular quantum chemistry. We highlight recent efforts in this direction, including solving the electron repulsion integrals bottleneck and implementing hybrid density functional theory and wavefunction methods, and lattice dynamics for periodic systems within atom-centered basis sets. Many computational techniques presented here are inspired by the extensive method developments rooted in quantum chemistry. In this Focus Article, we selectively focus on the computational techniques rooted in molecular quantum chemistry, emphasize some challenges, and point out open questions. We hope our perspectives will encourage researchers to pursue this exciting and promising research avenue.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Models Predicting Energetics of Interacting Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interacting defect systems are ubiquitous in materials under realistic scenarios, yet gaining an atomic-level understanding of these systems from a computational perspective is challenging - it often demands substantial resources due to the necessity of employing supercell calculations. While machine learning techniques have shown potential in accelerating materials simulations, their application to systems involving interacting defects remains relatively rare. In this work, we present a comparative study of three different methods to predict the free energy change of systems with interacting defects. We leveraging a limited dataset from Density Functional Theory(DFT) calculations to assess the performance models using materials descriptors, graph neural networks and cluster expansion. Our findings indicate that the cluster expansion model can achieve precise energetics predictions even with this limited dataset. Furthermore, with synthetic data generate from cluster expansion model at near-DFT levels, we obtained enlarged dataset to assess the demands on data for training accurate prediction models using graph neural networks for systems featuring interacting defects. A brief discussion of the computational cost for each method is provided at the end. This research provide a preliminary evaluation of applying machine learning techniques in imperfect surface systems.</description>

      <title>Bridging scales in multiscale bubble growth dynamics with correlated fluctuations using neural operator learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intricate process of bubble growth dynamics involves a broad spectrum of physical phenomena from microscale mechanics of bubble formation to macroscale interplay between bubbles and surrounding thermo-hydrodynamics. Traditional bubble dynamics models including atomistic approaches and continuum-based methods segment the bubble dynamics into distinct scale-specific models. In order to bridge the gap between microscale stochastic fluid models and continuum-based fluid models for bubble dynamics, we develop a composite neural operator model to unify the analysis of nonlinear bubble dynamics across microscale and macroscale regimes by integrating a many-body dissipative particle dynamics (mDPD) model with a continuum-based Rayleigh-Plesset (RP) model through a novel neural network architecture, which consists of a deep operator network for learning the mean behavior of bubble growth subject to pressure variations and a long short-term memory network for learning the statistical features of correlated fluctuations in microscale bubble dynamics. Training and testing data are generated by conducting mDPD and RP simulations for nonlinear bubble dynamics with initial bubble radii ranging from 0.1 to 1.5 micrometers. Results show that the trained composite neural operator model can accurately predict bubble dynamics across scales, with a 99% accuracy for the time evaluation of the bubble radius under varying external pressure while containing correct size-dependent stochastic fluctuations in microscale bubble growth dynamics. The composite neural operator is the first deep learning surrogate for multiscale bubble growth dynamics that can capture correct stochastic fluctuations in microscopic fluid phenomena, which sets a new direction for future research in multiscale fluid dynamics modeling.</description>

      <title>Link Node: A Method to Characterize the Chain Topology of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP) are highly dynamic, which is related to their functionality in various biological processes. However, the characterization of the intricate structures of IDP has been a challenge. Here, we analyze the chain topology of IDPs to characterize their conformations, in combination with molecular dynamics simulation (MD). We systematically compute the Gauss Linking Number ($GLN$) between segments in IDP, and show that the resulting GLN Map can effectively depict an unconventional structure -- physical link, i.e., the entanglement between two segments. The crossing points of physical links are further identified and denoted as Link Nodes. We show that the probability distribution of Link Nodes is highly heterogeneous and there are certain residues that largely affect the chain topology of IDP. Moreover, the structural fluctuations of the vicinity of these residues are largely suppressed, i.e., Link Node provides useful information about the topological constraint imposed on the residues during the conformation fluctuations of IDP. We further reveal that the evolution of the chain topology is considerably slow (with a timescale of hundreds of nanoseconds), which is distinct from the flipping of residue contact.</description>

      <title>Using machine learning to find exact analytic solutions to analytically posed physics problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the use of machine learning for solving analytic problems in theoretical physics. In particular, symbolic regression (SR) is making rapid progress in recent years as a tool to fit data using functions whose overall form is not known in advance. Assuming that we have a mathematical problem that is posed analytically, e.g.~through equations, but allows easy numerical evaluation of the solution for any given set of input variable values, one can generate data numerically and then use SR to identify the closed-form function that describes the data, assuming that such a function exists. In addition to providing a concise way to represent the solution of the problem, such an obtained function can play a key role in providing insight and allow us to find an intuitive explanation for the studied phenomenon. We use a state-of-the-art SR package to demonstrate how an exact solution can be found and make an attempt at solving an unsolved physics problem. We use the Landau-Zener problem and a few of its generalizations as examples to motivate our approach and illustrate how the calculations become increasingly complicated with increasing problem difficulty. Our results highlight the capabilities and limitations of the presently available SR packages, and they point to possible modifications of these packages to make them better suited for the purpose of finding exact solutions as opposed to good approximations. Our results also demonstrate the potential for machine learning to tackle analytically posed problems in theoretical physics.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Twist-Averaging Technique for Magnetic Metals: Applications using Quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an improved twist-averaging scheme for quantum Monte Carlo methods that use converged Kohn-Sham or Hartree-Fock orbitals as the reference. This twist-averaging technique is tailored to sample the Brillouin zone of magnetic metals, although it naturally extends to nonmagnetic conducting systems. The proposed scheme aims to reproduce the reference magnetization and achieves charge neutrality by construction, thus avoiding the large energy fluctuations and the postprocessing needed to correct the energies. It shows the most robust convergence of total energy and magnetism to the thermodynamic limit when compared to four other twist-averaging schemes. Diffusion Monte Carlo applications are shown on nonmagnetic Al and ferromagnetic $\alpha$-Fe. The cohesive energy of Al in the thermodynamic limit shows an excellent agreement with the experimental result. Furthermore, the magnetic moments in $\alpha$-Fe exhibit rapid convergence with an increasing number of twists.</description>

      <title>Motility-induced coexistence of a hot liquid and a cold gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If two phases exist at the same time, such as a gas and a liquid, they have the same temperature. This fundamental law of equilibrium physics is known to apply even to many non-equilibrium systems. However, recently, there has been much attention in the finding that inertial self-propelled particles like Janus colloids in a plasma or microflyers could self-organize into a hot gas-like phase that coexists with a colder liquid-like phase. Here, we show that a kinetic temperature difference across coexisting phases can occur even in equilibrium systems when adding generic (overdamped) self-propelled particles. In particular, we consider mixtures of overdamped active and inertial passive Brownian particles and show that when they phase separate into a dense and a dilute phase, both phases have different kinetic temperatures. Surprisingly, we find that the dense phase (liquid) cannot only be colder but also hotter than the dilute phase (gas). This effect hinges on correlated motions where active particles collectively push and heat up passive ones primarily within the dense phase. Our results answer the fundamental question if a non-equilibrium gas can be colder than a coexisting liquid and create a route to equip matter with self-organized domains of different kinetic temperatures.</description>

      <title>A finite element method for stochastic diffusion equations using fluctuating hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00022v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a finite element approach for diffusion problems with thermal fluctuations based on a fluctuating hydrodynamics model. The governing transport equations are stochastic partial differential equations with a fluctuating forcing term. We propose a discrete formulation of the stochastic forcing term that has the correct covariance matrix up to a standard discretization error. Furthermore, to obtain a numerical solution with spatial correlations that converge to those of the continuum equation, we derive a linear mapping to transform the finite element solution into an equivalent discrete solution that is free from the artificial correlations introduced by the spatial discretization. The method is validated by applying it to two diffusion problems: a second-order diffusion equation and a fourth-order diffusion equation. The theoretical (continuum) solution to the first case presents spatially decorrelated fluctuations, while the second case presents fluctuations correlated over a finite length. In both cases, the numerical solution presents a structure factor that approximates well the continuum one.</description>
