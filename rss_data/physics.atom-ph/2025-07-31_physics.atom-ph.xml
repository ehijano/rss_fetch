      <title>Wavefront Mapping for Absolute Atom Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wavefront distortions are a leading source of systematic uncertainty in light-pulse atom interferom- etry, limiting absolute measurements of gravitational acceleration at the 30 nm/s$^2$ level. Here, we demonstrate in situ spatially resolved measurement of the interferometer phase in a Mach-Zehnder atom interferometer as a tool to characterize and correct wavefront bias. By introducing controllable curvature of the Raman light using an adjustable collimation retro-reflector, we show that the bias due to parabolic wavefront curvature can be measured with 1 mrad uncertainty and that finite-size corrections impact the measured phase curvature. This measurement process could be adopted in optimized atom interferometer gravimeters to reduce wavefront bias uncertainty below the nm/s$^2$ level.</description>

      <title>Two-mode and dual-resonant planar photonic waveguides for efficient guiding and trapping of atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trapping of ultracold atoms using two-colour evanescent light waves formed by propagating modes of suspended optical rib waveguides is modelled in different configurations. Reducing the anisotropy of the two-colour evanescent optical dipole potential requires two laser light components with a large frequency difference. The upper frequency is guided in the two lowest transverse waveguide modes and the lower frequency propagates in a single-mode regime. This increases the dipole potential depth in the lateral direction. An additional increase in the optical dipole potential can be achieved by tuning the frequencies of the two modes to two different atomic transitions. When applied to rubidium, the total depth of the corresponding surface optical dipole traps can reach 0.3 mK or above under reasonable conditions.</description>

      <title>Quasi-continuous sub-$\mu$K strontium source without a high-finesse cavity stabilized laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a quasi-continuous sub-$\mu$K strontium source achieved without the use of a high-finesse cavity-locked laser. Our frequency reference is based on a dispersion-optimized, fiber-based frequency comb that enables sub-kHz linewidths. The long-term stability of the comb is defined by an external RF reference: either a 10 MHz RF signal from the Dutch Metrology Institute (VSL), or a tunable RF source whose long-term stability is maintained by monitoring and stabilizing the position of a narrow-line magneto-optical trap (MOT). The comb-stabilized system is benchmarked against a conventional cavity-locked laser and achieves comparable performance in broadband and single-frequency MOTs using the narrow $^1$S$_0$ $\rightarrow$ $^3$P$_1$ laser cooling transition. We generate high-flux, sub-$\mu$K samples of all three bosonic strontium isotopes and demonstrate quasi-continuous outcoupling from the MOT. These results highlight the system's suitability for compact, robust, and field-deployable continuous cold atom devices.</description>

      <title>Geometric phase in anisotropic Kepler problem: Perspective for realization in Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We predict a gyroscopic effect that can be demonstrated with Rydberg atoms following the dynamics of a Kepler Hamiltonian with an additional uniaxial anisotropy induced by optical ponderomotive force. This effect is analogous to the rotation of the Foucault pendulum in response to the Earth's rotation. We argue that in Rydberg states a similar geometric angle can be generated by mechanical rotations of an atomic-optical setup on time scales between $1~\mu$s and $1~$ms.</description>

      <title>Probing electronic state-dependent conformational changes in a trapped Rydberg ion Wigner crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-dependent conformational changes play a central role in molecular dynamics, yet they are often difficult to observe or simulate due to their complexity and ultrafast nature. One alternative approach is to emulate such phenomena using quantum simulations with cold, trapped ions. In their electronic ground state, these ions form long-lived Wigner crystals. When excited to high-lying electronic Rydberg states, the ions experience a modified trapping potential, resulting in a strong coupling between their electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom. In an ion crystal, this vibronic coupling creates electronic state-dependent potential energy surfaces that can support distinct crystal structures -- closely resembling the conformational changes of molecules driven by electronic excitations. Here, we present the first experimental observation of this effect, by laser-coupling a single ion at the centre of a three-ion crystal to a Rydberg state. By tuning the system close to a structural phase transition, the excitation induces a state-dependent conformational change, transforming the Wigner crystal from a linear to a zigzag configuration. This structural change leads to a strong hybridisation between vibrational and electronic states, producing a clear spectroscopic signature in the Rydberg excitation. Our findings mark the first experimental step towards using Rydberg ions to create and study artificial molecular systems. change leads to a strong hybridisation between vibrational and electronic states, producing a clear spectroscopic signature in the Rydberg excitation.

      <title>Attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We simulate the attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS) of monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) using the time-dependent density functional theory and two-band density-matrix equations within the tight-binding approximation. The simulation results from the two methods are qualitatively consistent. We focus on the fishbone structure around the gap energy of the M point, which exhibits a temporal period equal to that of the pump laser. To gain deeper insight into this structure, we simplify the two-band model to a single-electron model located at the M point, allowing us to derive an analytical expression that can qualitatively reproduce the numerical results. By isolating the influence of the Berry connection on the ATAS, our analytical results reveal that both the interband transition dipole moments and the Berry connection play important roles in the fishbone structure of the ATAS. Moreover, we also have investigated the dependence of ATAS on the gap energy based the tight-binding approximation. The results demonstrate that the ATAS intensity is enhanced as the gap energy increases, in agreement with our analytical prediction. Our study may shed light on the generation mechanism of the fishbone structure of the ATAS in hBN.</description>

      <title>Nebular spectra of kilonovae with detailed recombination rates -- I. Light r-process composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18345v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To investigate spectra of kilonovae in the NLTE phase (t&gt;= 1 week), we perform atomic calculations for dielectronic recombination (DR) rates for the light r-process elements Se (Z = 34), Rb (Z = 37), Sr (Z = 38), Y (Z = 39), and Zr (Z = 40) using the HULLAC code. For the different elements, our results for the DR rate coefficients for recombining from the ionization states of II to I, III to II, and IV to III vary between 2x10^{-12} - 5x10^{-11} cm^3/s, 10^{-13} - 5x10^{-11} cm^3/s and 2x10^{-15} - 10^{-11} cm^3/s, respectively, at a temperature of T = 10,000 K. Using this new atomic data (DR), we study the impact on kilonova model spectra at phases of t = 10 days and t = 25 days after the merger using the spectral synthesis code SUMO. Compared to models using the previous treatment of recombination as a constant rate, the new models show significant changes in ionization and temperature, and correspondingly, in emergent spectra. With the new rates, we find that Zr (Z = 40) plays a yet more dominant role in kilonova spectra for light r-process compositions. Further, we show that previously predicted mid-infrared (e.g. [Se III] 4.55 mum) and optical (e.g. Rb I 7802, 7949 {\AA}) lines weaken in the new model. Instead [Se I] 5.03 mum emerges as a signature. These results demonstrate the importance of considering the detailed microphysics for modelling and interpreting the late-time kilonova spectra.</description>
