      <title>Long games just beyond fixed countable length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new type of game on natural numbers of variable countable length, which can be regarded as a diagonalization of all games of fixed countable length on natural numbers. Building on previous work by Trang and Woodin, we show that analytic determinacy of the game is equivalent to the existence of a sharp for a canonical inner model with a limit of Woodin cardinals $\lambda$ such that the order type of Woodin cardinals below $\lambda$ is $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Duality for Constructive Modal Logics: from Sahqlvist to Goldblatt-Thomason</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out a semantic study of the constructive modal logic CK. We provide a categorical duality linking the algebraic and birelational semantics of the logic. We then use this to prove Sahlqvist style correspondence and completeness results, as well as a Goldblatt-Thomason style theorem on definability of classes of frames.</description>

      <title>The reverse mathematics of Brooks' theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is an analysis of the status of Brooks' Theorem, a celebrated result in graph coloring, from the point of view of Reverse Mathematics. We prove that the restriction of Brooks' theorem to bounded graphs of degree greater than or equal to $3$ is provable in $\mathsf{RCA}_0$, while the statement for arbitrary graphs is equivalent to $\mathsf{WKL}_0$ over $\mathsf{RCA}_0$. Brooks' Theorem for degree $2$, even when restricted to bounded graphs, is equivalent to $\mathsf{WKL}_0$ over $\mathsf{RCA}_0$.</description>

      <title>Galois theory, automorphism groups of prime models, and the Picard-Vessiot closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main result of the paper extends the well-known Galois correspondence between closed subgroups of $Aut(acl^{eq}(A)/A)$ and $dcl$-closed intermediate sets $A \subseteq C \subseteq acl^{eq}(A)$ to the setting of the minimal closure inside of a prime model of a totally transcendental theory $T = T^{eq}$, $A \subseteq mcl^{eq}(A) \subseteq M_A$ (namely, $mcl^{eq}(A)$ is the intersection of all self elementary embeddings of the prime model $M_A$). Precisely, for $B$ a normal intermediate extension $A \subseteq B \subseteq mcl^{eq}(A)$, definable subgroups of $Aut(B/A)$ are in Galois correspondence with $dcl$-closed intermediate sets $A \subseteq C \subseteq B$.
  This applies to the ``Picard-Vessiot closure" $K^{PV_{\infty}}$ (or $K_{\infty}$) of a differential field $K$ of characteristic $0$ with algebraically closed field of constants $C_K$. We also show that normal differential subfields of $K^{PV_{\infty}}$ containing $K$ are ``iterated $PV$-extensions" of $K$, and the Galois correspondence result above holds for these extensions. This fills in some missing parts of Magid's paper [5].
  We also discuss exact sequences $1 \to N \to G \to H \to 1$, where $G = Aut(K_{2}/K)$, $N = Aut(K_{2}/K_{1})$ and $H = Aut(K_{1}/K)$, $K_1$ is a (maybe infinite type) $PV$ extension of $K$. $K_2$ is a (maybe infinite type) $PV$ extension of $K_1$ and $K_2$ is normal over $K$ (in the differential closure of $K$) and again $C_K$ is algebraically closed. Both $N$ and $H$ have the structure of proalgebraic groups over $C_K$. We show that conjugation by any given element of $G$ is a proalgebraic automorphism of $N$. Moreover if $G$ splits as a semidirect product $N\rtimes H$, then left multiplication by any fixed element of $G$ is a morphism of proalgebraic varieties $N\times H \to N\times H$. This improves and extends observations in Section 4 of [5] which dealt with one particular example.</description>

      <title>The most natural paradefinite logic relative to classical logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A paradefinite logic is a logic that can serve as the underlying logic for theories that are inconsistent or incomplete. A well-known paradefinite logic is Belnap-Dunn logic. Various expansions of Belnap-Dunn logic have been studied in the literature. In this note, it is argued that the most natural paradefinite logic relative to classical logic is the expansion of Belnap-Dunn logic with a falsity connective and an implication connective for which the standard deduction theorem holds.</description>

      <title>Policy Synthesis for Interval MDPs via Polyhedral Lyapunov Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision-making under uncertainty is central to many safety-critical applications, where decisions must be guided by probabilistic modeling formalisms. This paper introduces a novel approach to policy synthesis in multi-objective interval Markov decision processes using polyhedral Lyapunov functions. Unlike previous Lyapunov-based methods that mainly rely on quadratic functions, our method utilizes polyhedral functions to enhance accuracy in managing uncertainties within value iteration of dynamic programming. We reformulate the value iteration algorithm as a switched affine system with interval uncertainties and apply control-theoretic stability principles to synthesize policies that guide the system toward a desired target set. By constructing an invariant set of attraction, we ensure that the synthesized policies provide convergence guarantees while minimizing the impact of transition uncertainty in the underlying model. Our methodology removes the need for computationally intensive Pareto curve computations by directly determining a policy that brings objectives within a specified range of their target values. We validate our approach through numerical case studies, including a recycling robot and an electric vehicle battery, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving policy synthesis under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>The strong topological Rokhlin property and Medvedev degrees of SFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that if a recursively presented group admits a (nonempty) subshift of finite type with nonzero Medvedev degree then it fails to have the strong topological Rokhlin property. This result simplifies a known criterion and provides new examples of recursively presented groups without this property.</description>

      <title>Algebraizable Weak Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.06047v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the framework of abstract algebraic logic to weak logics, namely logical systems which are not necessarily closed under uniform substitution. We interpret weak logics by algebras expanded with an additional predicate and we introduce a loose and strict version of algebraizability for weak logics. We study this framework by investigating the connection between the algebraizability of a weak logic and the algebraizability of its schematic fragment, and we then prove a version of Blok and Pigozzi's Isomorphism Theorem in our setting. We apply this framework to logics in team semantics and show that the classical versions of inquisitive and dependence logic are strictly algebraizable, while their intuitionistic versions are only loosely so.</description>
