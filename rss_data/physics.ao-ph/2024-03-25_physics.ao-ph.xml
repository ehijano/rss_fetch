      <title>An ensemble of data-driven weather prediction models for operational sub-seasonal forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an operations-ready multi-model ensemble weather forecasting system which uses hybrid data-driven weather prediction models coupled with the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ocean model to predict global weather at 1-degree resolution for 4 weeks of lead time. For predictions of 2-meter temperature, our ensemble on average outperforms the raw ECMWF extended-range ensemble by 4-17%, depending on the lead time. However, after applying statistical bias corrections, the ECMWF ensemble is about 3% better at 4 weeks. For other surface parameters, our ensemble is also within a few percentage points of ECMWF's ensemble. We demonstrate that it is possible to achieve near-state-of-the-art subseasonal-to-seasonal forecasts using a multi-model ensembling approach with data-driven weather prediction models.</description>

      <title>Droughts in Germany -- Why global climate change amplifies hydrological extremes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The warmer temperatures of global climate change strengthen the water cycle, evaporation and precipitation increase. But the extremes of heavy rain, floods, dry periods and droughts will also increase. How does this fit together? Simple physical considerations show which factors mainly regulate the strength of the water cycle in the Earth system, and how this determines water availability on land. This can be used to interpret the observed changes in the water balance in Germany and explain the increasing dryness in Germany.</description>

      <title>An adjoint-free algorithm for conditional nonlinear optimal perturbations (CNOPs) via sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.00956v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a sampling algorithm based on state-of-the-art statistical machine learning techniques to obtain conditional nonlinear optimal perturbations (CNOPs), which is different from traditional (deterministic) optimization methods.1 Specifically, the traditional approach is unavailable in practice, which requires numerically computing the gradient (first-order information) such that the computation cost is expensive, since it needs a large number of times to run numerical models. However, the sampling approach directly reduces the gradient to the objective function value (zeroth-order information), which also avoids using the adjoint technique that is unusable for many atmosphere and ocean models and requires large amounts of storage. We show an intuitive analysis for the sampling algorithm from the law of large numbers and further present a Chernoff-type concentration inequality to rigorously characterize the degree to which the sample average probabilistically approximates the exact gradient. The experiments are implemented to obtain the CNOPs for two numerical models, the Burgers equation with small viscosity and the Lorenz-96 model. We demonstrate the CNOPs obtained with their spatial patterns, objective values, computation times, and nonlinear error growth. Compared with the performance of the three approaches, all the characters for quantifying the CNOPs are nearly consistent, while the computation time using the sampling approach with fewer samples is much shorter. In other words, the new sampling algorithm shortens the computation time to the utmost at the cost of losing little accuracy.</description>

      <title>Latent assimilation with implicit neural representations for unknown dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data assimilation is crucial in a wide range of applications, but it often faces challenges such as high computational costs due to data dimensionality and incomplete understanding of underlying mechanisms. To address these challenges, this study presents a novel assimilation framework, termed Latent Assimilation with Implicit Neural Representations (LAINR). By introducing Spherical Implicit Neural Representations (SINR) along with a data-driven uncertainty estimator of the trained neural networks, LAINR enhances efficiency in assimilation process. Experimental results indicate that LAINR holds certain advantage over existing methods based on AutoEncoders, both in terms of accuracy and efficiency.</description>
