      <title>GAIA: A General AI Assistant for Intelligent Accelerator Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale machines like particle accelerators are usually run by a team of experienced operators. In case of a particle accelerator, these operators possess suitable background knowledge on both accelerator physics and the technology comprising the machine. Due to the complexity of the machine, particular subsystems of the machine are taken care of by experts, who the operators can turn to. In this work the reasoning and action (ReAct) prompting paradigm is used to couple an open-weights large language model (LLM) with a high-level machine control system framework and other tools, e.g. the electronic logbook or machine design documentation. By doing so, a multi-expert retrieval augmented generation (RAG) system is implemented, which assists operators in knowledge retrieval tasks, interacts with the machine directly if needed, or writes high level control system scripts. This consolidation of expert knowledge and machine interaction can simplify and speed up machine operation tasks for both new and experienced human operators.</description>

      <title>Electron beam emittance at operational intensity in fourth-generation synchrotron light sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05204v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For synchrotron light sources, the brightness of user X-ray beams is primarily determined by the electron beam emittance and energy spread at operational intensity. A common feature of fourth-generation synchrotrons is the short length of electron bunches combined with a very small transverse beam size. Consequently, the particle density is much higher than in machines of previous generations, leading to strong collective effects that significantly increase the emittance and limit the achievable brightness at operational beam intensity. In this article, we summarize our studies of the emittance scaled with the beam energy and intensity, taking into account the effects of intrabeam scattering, beam-impedance interaction, and bunch lengthening provided by higher-harmonic RF systems, to identify optimal combinations of machine and beam parameters.</description>
