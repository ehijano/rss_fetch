      <title>Local classical solutions to Navier-Stokes equations with degenerate viscosities and vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the 3D isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with degenerate viscousities and vacuum. The degenerate viscosities $\mu(\rho)$ and $\lambda(\rho)$ are proportional to some power of density, while the powers of density in $\mu(\rho)$ and $\lambda(\rho)$ are different(i.e., $\delta_1\neq \delta_2$). The local well-posedness of classical solution is established by introducing a ``quasi-symmetric hyperbolic''--``degenerate elliptic'' coupled structure to control the behavior of the velocity of the fluid near the vacuum and give some uniform estimates. In particular, the initial data allows vacuum in an open set and we do not need any initial compatibility conditions.</description>

      <title>Globally conservative weak solutions for a class of two-component nonlinear dispersive wave equations beyond wave breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the existence of globally conservative weak solutions for a class of two-component nonlinear dispersive wave equations beyond wave breaking. We first introduce a new set of independent and dependent variables in connection with smooth solutions, and transform the system into an equivalent semi-linear system. We then establish the global existence of solutions for the semi-linear system via the standard theory of ordinary differential equations. Finally, by the inverse transformation method, we prove the existence of the globally conservative weak solution for the original system.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary integro-differential equations of scalar type on locally compact groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study existence, uniqueness, norm estimates and asymptotic time behaviour (in some cases can be claimed to be sharp) for the solution of a general evolutionary integral (differential) equation of scalar type on a locally compact separable unimodular group $G$ governed by any positive left invariant operator (unbounded and either with discrete or continuous spectrum) on $G$. We complement our studies by proving some time-space (Strichartz type) estimates for the classical heat equation, and its time-fractional counterpart, as well as for the time-fractional wave equation. The latter estimates allow us to give some results about the well-posedness of nonlinear partial integro-differential equations. We provide many examples of the results by considering particular equations, operators and groups through the whole paper.</description>

      <title>The $L^1$-relaxed area of the graph of the vortex map: optimal upper bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute an upper bound for the value of the $L^1$-relaxed area of the graph of the vortex map $u : B_l(0)\subset \mathbb R^2 \to \mathbb R^2$, $u(x):= x/\vert x\vert$, $x \neq 0$, for all values of $l&gt;0$. Together with a previously proven lower bound, this upper bound turns out to be optimal. Interestingly, for the radius $l$ in a certain range, in particular $l$ not too large, a Plateau-type problem, having as solution a sort of catenoid constrained to contain a segment, has to be solved.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking of extremals for the high order Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg type inequalities: the singular case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let us consider the following Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg type inequality
  \begin{equation}\label{nsckn}
  \int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|x|^{-\beta}|\mathrm{div} (|x|^{\alpha}\nabla u)|^2 \mathrm{d}x
  \geq \mathcal{S}\left(\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|x|^{\gamma}
  |u|^{2^{**}_{\alpha,\beta}} \mathrm{d}x\right)^{\frac{2}{2^{**}_{\alpha,\beta}}}, \quad \mbox{for all}\quad u\in C^\infty_0(\mathbb{R}^N\setminus\{0\}),
  \end{equation}
  for some $\mathcal{S}=\mathcal{S}(N,\alpha,\beta)&gt;0$, where $N\geq 5$, $\alpha&gt;2-N$, $\frac{N-4}{N-2}\alpha-4 \leq \beta\leq\alpha -2$
  and
  \begin{align*}
  2^{**}_{\alpha,\beta}:=\frac{2(N+\gamma)}{N+2\alpha-\beta-4}
  \quad \mbox{with}\quad (N+\beta)(N+\gamma)=(N+2\alpha-\beta-4)^2.
  \end{align*}
  A crucial element is that the functional $\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|x|^{-\beta}|\mathrm{div} (|x|^{\alpha}\nabla u)|^2 \mathrm{d}x$ is equivalent to $\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|x|^{2\alpha-\beta}|\Delta u|^2 \mathrm{d}x$.
  Firstly, we obtain a symmetry result (with partial translation invariant) when $\alpha=0$ and $\beta=-4$, then existence and non-existence of extremal functions for the best constant $\mathcal{S}$ in \eqref{nsckn} under different conditions are completely given. Moreover, by a result of linearized problem related to radial solution of \eqref{Pwhs0}, we obtain a symmetry breaking conclusion: when $\alpha&gt;0$ and $\frac{N-4}{N-2}\alpha-4&lt;\beta&lt;\beta_{\mathrm{FS}}(\alpha)$ where $\beta_{\mathrm{FS}}(\alpha):=
  N+2\alpha-4-\sqrt{(N-2+\alpha)^2+4(N-1)}$, the extremal functions for $\mathcal{S}$ are nonradial. Finally, we give a partial symmetry result when $\beta=\frac{N-4}{N-2}\alpha-4$ and $2-N&lt;\alpha&lt;0$, and we also study the stability of extremal functions.</description>

      <title>On Inverse Problems for Two-Dimensional Steady Supersonic Euler Flows past Curved Wedges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with the well-posedness of an inverse problem for determining the wedge boundary and associated two-dimensional steady supersonic Euler flow past the wedge, provided that the pressure distribution on the boundary surface of the wedge and the incoming state of the flow are given. We first establish the existence of wedge boundaries and associated entropy solutions of the inverse problem when the pressure on the wedge boundary is larger than that of the incoming flow but less than a critical value, and the total variation of the incoming flow and the pressure distribution is sufficiently small. This is achieved by carefully constructing suitable approximate solutions and approximate boundaries via developing a wave-front tracking algorithm and the rigorous proof of their strong convergence to a global entropy solution and a wedge boundary respectively. Then we establish the $L^{\infty}$--stability of the wedge boundaries, by introducing a modified Lyapunov functional for two different solutions with two distinct boundaries, each of which may contain a strong shock-front. The modified Lyapunov functional is carefully designed to control the distance between the two boundaries and is proved to be Lipschitz continuous with respect to the differences of the incoming flow and the pressure on the wedge, which leads to the existence of the Lipschitz semigroup. Finally, when the pressure distribution on the wedge boundary is sufficiently close to that of the incoming flow, using this semigroup, we compare two solutions of the inverse problem in the respective supersonic full Euler flow and potential flow and prove that, at $x&gt;0$, the distance between the two boundaries and the difference of the two solutions are of the same order of $x$ multiplied by the cube of the perturbations of the initial boundary data in $L^\infty\cap BV$.</description>

      <title>A bilinear fractional integral operator for Euler-Riesz systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a uniform estimate for a bilinear fractional integral operator via restricted weak-type endpoint estimates and Marcinkiewicz interpolation. This estimate is crucial in the integrability analysis of a tensor-valued bilinear fractional integral operator associated with Euler-Riesz systems modeling mean-field interactions induced by a singular kernel. The tensorial operator arises from a reformulation of the Euler-Riesz system that yields a gain in integrability for finite energy solutions through compensated integrability. Additionally, for smooth periodic solutions of the reformulated system, we derive a stability result.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we introduce the John-Nirenberg's type spaces $\text{JN}_p$ associated with the Gaussian measure $d\gamma(x) = \pi^{-d/2}e^{-|x|^2}dx$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ where $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. We prove a John-Nirenberg inequality for $\text{JN}_p(\mathbb{R}^d,\gamma)$. We also characterize the predual of $\text{JN}_p(\mathbb{R}^d,\gamma)$ as a Hardy type space.</description>

      <title>Contraction of Convex Hypersurfaces in $\mathbb R^3$ by Powers of Principal Curvatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the contraction of strictly convex, axially symmetric hypersurfaces by a non-symmetric, non-homogeneous, fully nonlinear function of curvature. Starting from axially symmetric hypersurfaces with even profile curves, we show evolving hypersurfaces converge to a point in a finite time, and under proper rescaling, solutions will converge to a convex hypersurface.</description>

      <title>Energy equality of the weak solutions to the non-Newtonian fluids equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of energy equality for weak solutions of the 3D incompressible non-Newtonian fluids equations equations with initial value conditions. We get new sufficient conditions by means of the Sobolev multiplier spaces, which guarantee the establishment of the energy equality. And the aforementioned equations are often associated with the corresponding positive conclusion of the Onsager's conjecture for non-Newtonian fluids.</description>

      <title>Rigidity in the Lorentzian Calder\'on problem with formally determined data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Lorentzian Calder\'on problem, where the objective is to determine a globally hyperbolic Lorentzian metric up to a boundary fixing diffeomorphism from boundary measurements given by the hyperbolic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. This problem is a wave equation analogue of the Calder\'on problem on Riemannian manifolds. We prove that if a globally hyperbolic metric agrees with the Minkowski metric outside a compact set and has the same hyperbolic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map as the Minkowski metric, then it must be the Minkowski metric up to diffeomorphism. In fact we prove the same result with a much smaller amount of measurements, thus solving a formally determined inverse problem. To prove these results we introduce a new method for geometric hyperbolic inverse problems. The method is based on distorted plane wave solutions and on a combination of geometric, topological and unique continuation arguments.</description>

Abstract: We consider two models, a free boundary problem and a simplification thereof, which describe a soap film bridge subjected to an electrostatic force. For both models, we construct stationary solutions if the force is small, analyse their stability and examine how their shape is influenced by small changes in the strength of the force.</description>

      <title>Sobolev spaces with mixed weights and the Poisson equation on angular domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and analyse a class of weighted Sobolev spaces with mixed weights on angular domains. The weights are based on both the distance to the boundary and the distance to the one vertex of the domain. Moreover, we show how the regularity of the Poisson equation can be analysed in the framework of these spaces by means of the Mellin transform, provided the integrability parameter equals two. Our main motivation comes from the study of stochastic partial differential equations and associated degenerate deterministic parabolic equations.</description>

      <title>Necessary conditions for the solvability of fractional semilinear heat equations in the very weak framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain necessary conditions on the initial value for the solvability of the Cauchy problem for semilinear heat equations. These necessary conditions were already obtained in the framework of integral solutions, but not in that of very weak ones. We establish a new proof method, which can derive the desired conditions in the framework of very weak solutions. In particular, since any integral solution is a very weak solution, our conditions are more general.</description>

      <title>Several functional capacities and Carleson type embeddings of fractional Sobolev sapces on stratified Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the functional and geometrical aspects of the fractional Sobolev capacity, the Besov capacity and the Riesz capacity on stratified lie groups, respectively. Firstly, we provide a new Carleson characterization of the extension of fractional Sobolev spaces to $L^{q}(\X\times\mathbb{R}_{+},\mu)$ with $q\in\mathbb{R}_{+}$ using the fractional heat semigroup and the Caffarelli-Silvestre type extension on stratified Lie groups $\X$. Secondly, a characterization of $\nu$ on $\X$ which ensures the continuity of the fractional Sobolev space belonging to $L^{q}(\X,\nu)$ is also obtained via taking $t\rightarrow 0$. Finally, with the help of inequalities related to the Besov capacity and its properties, we also obtain a characterization of $\nu$ on $\X$ which ensures the continuity of the Besov type space belonging to $L^{q}(\X,\nu)$.</description>

      <title>Stationary Soap Film Bridge Subjected to an Electrostatic Force: The Balanced Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically study a stationary free boundary problem describing a soap film bridge subjected to an electrostatic force. Starting from a cylinder that the soap film forms if its surface tension and the electrostatic force are perfectly balanced, we construct a local branch of stationary solutions. Then, we prove that there is a sharp threshold value for a characteristic model parameter at which the stability behaviour of this branch switches from stable to unstable. Finally, we show that the soap film deflects monotonically outwards if the strength of the electrostatic force is increased. Besides rigorous results, we also discuss a possible balancing effect of the electrostatic force.</description>

      <title>Sharp bounds on the attractor dimensions for damped wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give the explicit estimates of order $\gamma^{-d}$ (with logarithmic correction in the 1D case) for the fractal dimension of the attractor of the damped hyperbolic equation (or system) in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb R^d$, $d\ge1$ with linear damping coefficient $\gamma&gt;0$.
  The key ingredient in the proof for $d\ge3$ is Lieb's bound for the $L_p$-norms of systems with orthonormal gradients based on the Cwikel--Lieb--Rozenblum (CLR) inequality for negative eigenvalues of the Schr\"odinder operator. The case $d=1$ is simpler, but contains a logarithmic correction term that seems to be inevitable. The 2D case is more difficult and is strongly based on the Strichartz-type estimates for the linear equation. Lower bounds of the same order for the dimension of the attractor are also obtained for a damped hyperbolic system with nonlinearity containing a small non-gradient perturbation term, meaning that in this case our estimates are optimal for $d\ge2$ and contain a logarithmic discrepancy for $d=1$. Estimates for the various dimensions (Hausdorff, fractal, Lyapunov) of the attractor in purely gradient case are also given. We show, in particular, that the Lyapunov dimension of a non-trivial attractor is of the order $\gamma^{-1}$ in all spatial dimensions $d\ge1$.</description>

      <title>A Simple A-Priory Estimate for 3D Stationary Navier-Stokes System Via Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short communication is motivated by a paper by O.A.Ladyzhenskaya, where a simple interpolation inequality was proved between summable smooth spaces. Such interpolation was applied as a technical tool for obtaining estimates of the solution to the linear Stokes system. But such cooperative simultaneous applying summable and smooth functional spaces even more often occurs at investigations of nonlinear problems, where, in particular, some bootstrap arguments are often involved. And we believe that the taking into account such interpolation reasoning can notably simplify different bootstrap procedures to rise up the smoothness of a solution or obtain an a-priory estimate in smooth classes of functions. Therefore by the present paper we just would like to attract the attention of the reader to such possibility. And for this we are going to demonstrate an obtaining of the a-priory estimate in a smooth space to the solution of the stationary Navier-Stokes system in a bounded (for simplicity) domain.</description>

Abstract: Given $s\in (3/2,2)$ and $\varepsilon &gt;0$, we construct a compactly supported initial data $\theta_0$ such that $\| \theta_0 \|_{H^s}\leq \varepsilon$ and there exist $T&gt;0$, $c&gt;0$ and a local-in-time solution $\theta$ of the SQG equation that is compactly supported in space, continuous and differentiable on $\mathbb{R}^2\times [0,T]$, and, for each $t\in [0,T]$, $ \theta (\cdot ,t ) \in {H^{s/(1+ct)}}$ and $ \theta (\cdot ,t ) \not \in {H^\beta }$ for any $\beta &gt; s/(1+ct)$. Moreover, $\theta$ is unique among all solutions with initial condition $\theta_0$ which belong to $C([0,T];H^{1+\alpha })$ for any $\alpha &gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear orbital stability of stationary discrete shock profiles for scalar conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For scalar conservation laws, we prove that spectrally stable stationary Lax discrete shock profiles are nonlinearly stable in some polynomially-weighted $\ell^1$ and $\ell^\infty$ spaces. In comparison with several previous nonlinear stability results on discrete shock profiles, we avoid the introduction of any weakness assumption on the amplitude of the shock and apply our analysis to a large family of schemes that introduce some artificial possibly high-order viscosity. The proof relies on a precise description of the Green's function of the linearization of the numerical scheme about spectrally stable discrete shock profiles obtained in [Coeu23]. The present article also pinpoints the ideas for a possible extension of this nonlinear orbital stability result for discrete shock profiles in the case of systems of conservation laws.</description>

      <title>Dual Cone Gradient Descent for Training Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a prominent approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by minimizing a combined loss function that incorporates both boundary loss and PDE residual loss. Despite their remarkable empirical performance in various scientific computing tasks, PINNs often fail to generate reasonable solutions, and such pathological behaviors remain difficult to explain and resolve. In this paper, we identify that PINNs can be adversely trained when gradients of each loss function exhibit a significant imbalance in their magnitudes and present a negative inner product value. To address these issues, we propose a novel optimization framework, Dual Cone Gradient Descent (DCGD), which adjusts the direction of the updated gradient to ensure it falls within a dual cone region. This region is defined as a set of vectors where the inner products with both the gradients of the PDE residual loss and the boundary loss are non-negative. Theoretically, we analyze the convergence properties of DCGD algorithms in a non-convex setting. On a variety of benchmark equations, we demonstrate that DCGD outperforms other optimization algorithms in terms of various evaluation metrics. In particular, DCGD achieves superior predictive accuracy and enhances the stability of training for failure modes of PINNs and complex PDEs, compared to existing optimally tuned models. Moreover, DCGD can be further improved by combining it with popular strategies for PINNs, including learning rate annealing and the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK).</description>

      <title>On the convergence rate of a numerical method for the Hunter-Saxton equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a robust error estimate for a recently proposed numerical method for $\alpha$-dissipative solutions of the Hunter-Saxton equation, where $\alpha \in [0, 1]$. In particular, if the following two conditions hold: i) there exist a constant $C &gt; 0$ and $\beta \in (0, 1]$ such that the initial spatial derivative $\bar{u}_{x}$ satisfies $\|\bar{u}_x(\cdot + h) - \bar{u}_x(\cdot)\|_2 \leq Ch^{\beta}$ for all $h \in (0, 2]$, and ii), the singular continuous part of the initial energy measure is zero, then the numerical wave profile converges with order $O(\Delta x^{\frac{\beta}{8}})$ in $L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R})$.
  Moreover, if $\alpha=0$, then the rate improves to $O(\Delta x^{\frac{1}{4}})$ without the above assumptions, and we also obtain a convergence rate for the associated energy measure - it converges with order $O(\Delta x^{\frac{1}{2}})$ in the bounded Lipschitz metric. These convergence rates are illustrated by several examples.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the regularising properties of singular kernels at the level of germs, i.e. families of distributions indexed by points in $\mathbb{R}^d$. First we construct a suitable integration map which acts on general coherent germs. Then we focus on germs that can be decomposed along a basis (corresponding to the so-called modelled distributions in Regularity Structures) and we prove a version of Hairer's multilevel Schauder estimates in this setting, with minimal assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study nonlocal Dirichlet energies associated with a class of nonlocal diffusion models on a bounded domain subject to the conventional local Dirichlet boundary condition. The goal of this paper is to give a general framework to correctly impose Dirichlet boundary condition in nonlocal diffusion model. To achieve this, we formulate the Dirichlet boundary condition as a penalty term and use theory of $\varGamma$-convergence to study the correct form of the penalty term. Based on the analysis of $\varGamma$-convergence, we prove that the Dirichlet boundary condition can be correctly imposed in nonlocal diffusion model in the sense of $\varGamma$-convergence as long as the penalty term satisfies a few mild conditions. This work provides a theoretical foundation for approximate Dirichlet boundary condition in nonlocal diffusion model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Response solutions are quasi-periodic ones with the same frequency as the forcing term. The present work is devoted to the construction of response solutions for $d$-dimensional beam equations with nonlocal nonlinear damping, which model frictional mechanisms affecting the bodies based on the average. By considering $\epsilon$ in a domain that does not include the origin and imposing a small quasi-periodic forcing with Diophantine frequency vector, we can show the existence of the response solution for such a model. We present an alternative approach to the contraction mapping principle (cf. [5, 33]) through a combination of reduction together with the Nash--Moser iteration technique. The reason behind this approach lies in the derivative losses caused by the nonlocal nonlinearity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proving homogenization has been a subtle issue for geometric equations due to the discontinuity when the gradient vanishes. A sufficient condition for periodic homogenization using perturbed correctors is suggested in the literature [3] to overcome this difficulty. However, some noncoercive equations do not satisfy this condition. In this note, we prove homogenization of geometric equations without using perturbed correctors, and therefore we conclude homogenization for the noncoercive equations. Also, we provide a rate of periodic homogenization of coercive geometric equations by utilizing the fact that they remain coercive under perturbation. We also present an example that homogenizes with a rate slower than $\Omega(\varepsilon)$.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stability for active suspensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the nonlinear analysis of a kinetic model introduced by Saintillan and Shelley to describe suspensions of active rodlike particles in viscous flows. We investigate the stability of the constant state $\Psi(t,x,p) = \frac{1}{4\pi}$ corresponding to a distribution of particles that is homogeneous in space (variable $x \in \mathbb{T}^3$) and uniform in orientation (variable $p \in \mathbb{S}^2$). We prove its nonlinear stability under the optimal condition of linearized spectral stability. The main achievement in this work is that the smallness condition on the initial perturbation is independent of the translational diffusion and only depends on the rotational diffusion, which is particularly relevant for dilute suspensions. Upgrading our previous linear study \cite{CZDGV22} to such nonlinear stability result requires new mathematical ideas, due to the presence of a quasilinear term in $x$ associated with nonlinear convection. This term cannot be treated as a source, because it is not controllable by the rotational diffusion in $p$. Also, it prevents the decoupling of $x$-Fourier modes crucially used in \cite{CZDGV22}. A key feature of our work is an analysis of enhanced dissipation and mixing properties of the advection diffusion operator $\partial_t + (p + u(t,x)) \cdot \nabla_x - \nu \Delta_p$ on $\mathbb{T}^3 \times \mathbb{S}^2$ for a given appropriately small vector field $u$. We hope this linear analysis to be of independent interest, and useful in other contexts with partial or anisotropic diffusions.</description>

      <title>Higher-order asymptotic profiles of solutions to the Cauchy problem for the convection-diffusion equation with variable diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00896v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the asymptotic behavior of solutions to the convection-diffusion equation: \[ \partial_t u - \mathrm{div}\left(a(x)\nabla u\right) = d\cdot\nabla \left(\left\lvert u\right\rvert ^{q-1}u\right),\ \ x\in\mathbb{R}^n, \ t&gt;0 \] with an integrable initial data $u_{0}(x)$, where $n\ge1$, $q&gt;1+\frac{1}{n}$ and $d\in \mathbb{R}^{n}$. Moreover, we take $a(x)=1+b(x)&gt;0$, where $b(x)$ is smooth and decays fast enough at spatial infinity. It is known that the asymptotic profile of the solution to this problem can be given by the heat kernel. Moreover, some higher-order asymptotic expansions of the solution have already been studied. In particular, the structures of the second asymptotic profiles strongly depend on the nonlinear exponent $q$. More precisely, these profiles have different decay orders in each of the following three cases: $1+\frac{1}{n}&lt;q&lt;1+\frac{2}{n}$; $q=1+\frac{2}{n}$; $q&gt;1+\frac{2}{n}$. In this paper, we focus on the critical case $q=1+\frac{2}{n}$. By analyzing the corresponding integral equation in details, we have succeeded to give the more higher-order asymptotic expansion of the solution, which generalizes the previous works.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical analysis on principal bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a compact Lie group. We introduce a semiclassical framework, called Borel-Weil calculus, to investigate $G$-equivariant (pseudo)differential operators acting on $G$-principal bundles over closed manifolds. In this calculus, the semiclassical parameters correspond to the highest roots in the Weyl chamber of the group $G$ that parametrize irreducible representations, and operators are pseudodifferential in the base variable, with values in Toeplitz operators on the flag manifold associated to the group. This monograph unfolds two main applications of our calculus.
  Firstly, in the realm of dynamical systems, we obtain explicit sufficient conditions for rapid mixing of volume-preserving partially hyperbolic flows obtained as extensions of an Anosov flow to a $G$-principal bundle (for an arbitrary $G$). In particular, when $G = \mathrm{U}(1)$, we prove that the flow on the extension is rapid mixing whenever the Anosov flow is not jointly integrable, and the circle bundle is not torsion. When $G$ is semisimple, we prove that ergodicity of the extension is equivalent to rapid mixing. Secondly, we study the spectral theory of sub-elliptic Laplacians obtained as horizontal Laplacians of a $G$-equivariant connection on a principal bundle. When $G$ is semisimple, we prove that the horizontal Laplacian is globally hypoelliptic as soon as the connection has a dense holonomy group in $G$. Notably, this result encompasses all flat bundles with a dense monodromy group in $G$. We also prove a quantum ergodicity result for flat (and in some situations non-flat) principal bundles under a suitable ergodicity assumption.
  We believe that this monograph will serve as a cornerstone for future investigations applying the Borel-Weil calculus across different fields.</description>

      <title>Effect of weak elasticity on Kelvin-Helmholtz instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an analysis of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in two-dimensional ideal compressible elastic flows, providing a rigorous confirmation that weak elasticity has a destabilizing effect on the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. There are two critical velocities, $U_{\text{low}}$ and $U_{\text{upp}}$, where $U_{\text{low}}$ and $U_{\text{upp}}$ represent the lower and upper critical velocities, respectively. We demonstrate that when the magnitude of the rectilinear solutions satisfies $U_{\text{low}}+c\epsilon_{0}\le |\dot{v}^{+}_{1}| \le U_{\text{upp}}-c\epsilon_{0}$, the linear and nonlinear ill-posedness of the piecewise smooth solutions of the Kelvin-Helmholtz problem for two-dimensional ideal compressible elastic fluids is established uniformly, where $c$ is the sound speed and $\epsilon_{0}$ is some small enough positive constant.</description>

      <title>On the Sobolev stability threshold for 3D Navier-Stokes equations with rotation near the Couette flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotation is a crucial characteristic of fluid flow in the atmosphere and oceans, which is present in nearly all meteorological and geophysical models. The global existence of solutions to the 3D Navier-Stokes equations with large rotation has been established through the dispersion effect resulting from Coriolis force (i.e., rotation). In this paper, we investigate the dynamic stability of periodic, plane Couette flow in the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with rotation at high Reynolds number $\mathbf{Re}$. Our aim is to determine the stability threshold index on $\mathbf{Re}$: the maximum range of perturbations within which the solution remains stable. Initially, we examine the linear stability effects of a linearized perturbed system. Comparing our results with those obtained by Bedrossian, Germain, and Masmoudi [Ann. Math. 185(2): 541--608 (2017)], we observe that mixing effects (which correspond to enhanced dissipation and inviscid damping) arise from Couette flow while Coriolis force acts as a restoring force inducing a dispersion mechanism for inertial waves that cancels out lift-up effects occurred at zero frequency velocity. This dispersion mechanism exhibits favorable algebraic decay properties distinct from those observed in classical 3D Navier-Stokes equations. Consequently, we demonstrate that if initial data satisfies $\left\|u_{\mathrm{in}}\right\|_{H^{\sigma}}&lt;\delta \mathbf{Re}^{-1}$ for any $\sigma&gt;\frac{9}{2}$ and some $\delta=\delta(\sigma)&gt;0$ depending only on $\sigma$, then the solution to the 3D Navier-Stokes equations with rotation is global in time without transitioning away from Couette flow. In this sense, Coriolis force contributes as a factor enhancing fluid stability by improving its threshold from $\frac{3}{2}$ to 1.</description>

      <title>Ground states of the two-dimensional dispersion managed nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the variational problem with a mass constraint arising from the two-dimensional dispersion managed nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with power-law type nonlinearity. We prove a threshold phenomenon with respect to mass for the existence of minimizers for all possible powers of nonlinearities, including at the threshold itself. This threshold is closely related to the best constant for the Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Strichartz type inequality whose extremizers are found as a byproduct.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of the $\Phi^4_3$ measures on closed Riemannian $3$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We constructed in a previous work the $\Phi^4_3$ measures on compact boundaryless $3$-dimensional Riemannian manifolds as some invariant probability measures of some Markovian dynamics. We prove in the present work that these dynamics have unique invariant probability measures. This is done by using an explicit coupling by change of measure that does not require any a priori information on the support of the law of the solution to the dynamics. In addition, the coupling can be used to see that the semigroup generated by the dynamics satisfies a Harnack-type inequality, which entails that the semigroup has the strong Feller property.</description>

      <title>Trace formulas revisited and a new representation of KdV solutions with short-range initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We put forward a new approach to Deift-Trubowitz type trace formulas for the 1D Schrodinger operator with potentials that are summable with the first moment (short-range potentials). We prove that these formulas are preserved under the KdV flow whereas the class of short-range potentials is not. Finally, we show that our formulas are well-suited to study the dispersive smoothing effect.</description>

      <title>L^2-instability of the Taub-Bolt metric under the Ricci flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that there exists a compact perturbation of the Ricci flat Taub-Bolt metric that evolves under the Ricci flow into a finite time singularity modelled on the shrinking solition FIK [5]. Moreover, this perturbation can be made arbitrarily L^2-small with respect to the Taub-Bolt metric. The method of proof closely follows the strategy adopted in [14], where the author constructs, via a Wa\.zewski box argument, Ricci flows on compact manifolds which encounter finite singularities modelled on a given asymptotically conical shrinking soliton.</description>
