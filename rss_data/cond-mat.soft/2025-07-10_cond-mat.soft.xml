      <title>Short-wavelength mesophases in the ground states of core-softened particles in two-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the formation of short-wavelength mesophases in a two-dimensional core-softened particle system. By proposing a series of specific ansatz for each relevant phase, we performed a variational analysis to obtain the ground-state phase diagram. Our results reveal a variety of cluster lattice phases with distinct cluster orientations, alongside traditional two-dimensional Bravais lattices such as square, triangular, oblique, and rectangular structures, as well as other non-Bravais arrangements including honeycomb and kagome phases. We characterize in detail the ground-state phase transitions and identify coexistence regions between competing phases, capturing both first-order and continuous transitions. In addition, we highlight the crucial role of the competing length scales introduced by the hard-core repulsion in shaping the rich landscape of mesophases, emphasizing the interplay between intra-cluster structure and inter-cluster organization. This study provides a systematic framework that could support future investigations of classical thermal melting behavior or quantum phase transitions in similar cluster-forming systems.</description>

      <title>Ordering According to Size of Disks in a Narrow Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long and narrow channel confines disks of two sizes. The disks are randomly agitated in a widened channel under moderate pressure, then jammed according to a tunable protocol. We present exact results that characterize jammed macrostates (volume, entropy, jamming patterns). The analysis divides jammed disk sequences into overlapping tiles out of which statistically interacting quasiparticles are constructed. The fractions of small and large disks are controlled by a chemical potential adapted to configurational statistics of granular matter. The results show regimes for the energy parameters (determined by the jamming protocol) that either enhance or suppress the mixing of disk sizes. Size segregation or size alternation driven by steric forces alone are manifestations of a broken symmetry.</description>

      <title>A physics-informed neural network for modeling fracture without gradient damage: formulation, application, and assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate computational modeling of damage and fracture remains a central challenge in solid mechanics. The finite element method (FEM) is widely used for numerical modeling of fracture problems; however, classical damage models without gradient regularization yield mesh-dependent and usually inaccurate predictions. The use of gradient damage with FEM improves numerical robustness but introduces significant mathematical and numerical implementation complexities. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) can encode the governing partial differential equations, boundary conditions, and constitutive models into the loss functions, offering a new method for fracture modeling. Prior applications of PINNs have been limited to small-strain problems and have incorporated gradient damage formulation without a critical evaluation of its necessity. Since PINNs in their basic form are meshless, this work presents a PINN framework for modeling fracture in elastomers undergoing large deformation without the gradient damage formulation. The PINN implementation here does not require training data and utilizes the collocation method to formulate physics-informed loss functions. We have validated the PINN's predictions for various defect configurations using benchmark solutions obtained from FEM with gradient damage formulation. The crack paths obtained using the PINN are approximately insensitive to the collocation point distribution. This study offers new insights into the feasibility of using PINNs without gradient damage and suggests a simplified and efficient computational modeling strategy for fracture problems. The performance of the PINN has been evaluated through systematic variations in key neural network parameters to provide guidance for future applications. The results provide motivation for extending PINN-based approaches to a broader class of materials and damage models in mechanics.</description>

      <title>Superheating and melting phenomena of a vibrated granular layer of cubic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the combined results of experiments and molecular dynamics simulations conducted to investigate superheating phenomena in vertically vibrated granular matter. Specifically, we consider a system of cubic particles densely packed in a square-lattice array and subjected to different shaking strengths, denoted by Gamma, approaching a critical value Gamma_c. Below Gamma_c, the superheated crystalline array remains indefinitely stable. Above Gamma_c, it transitions progressively into a granular liquid-like state over a Gamma-dependent timescale tau. We show that while an increase in frictional contacts significantly prolongs the lifetime of the superheated crystalline state, it does not play a major role in the scaling laws governing how that lifetime depends on shaking strength. Our findings also show that the transition from the superheated solid to the liquid state in the vibrated system is well described by a Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami (KJMA) equation, which is commonly used to model phase transformations in thermal systems.</description>

      <title>Not even metastable: Cubic double-diamond in diblock copolymer melts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of continuous transformations between two canonical, cubic network phases of block copolymer melts: double-gyroid, an equilibrium morphology for many systems; and double-diamond, often thought to be a close competitor. We use a strong-segregation approach to compute the free energy of double network morphologies as a function of two structural parameters that convert between two limiting cubic cases; a tetragonal stretch of the unit cell in combination with fusion of pairs of trihedal gyroid nodes into tetrahedral diamond nodes. For the simplest case of conformationally symmetric diblock melts, we find that cubic double-diamond sits at an unstable saddle point that is continuously deformable into the lower free energy gyroid, as well as a second metastable, tetragonal network composed by trihedral nodes. We confirm the broad instability of double-diamond at finite segregation using self-consistent field studies and further show that it derives directly from the entropic free energy cost of chain packing in the tubular domains of tetrahedral nodes. Correspondingly, we demonstrate two factors that quench the entropic cost of packing in the tubular domain -- homopolymer blending and elastic asymmetry between the blocks -- promoting double-diamond to a metastable state by way of free energy barrier that separates it from double-gyroid.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic bend instability of motile particles on a substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of hydrodynamic bend instabilities in ordered suspensions of active particles is widely observed across diverse living and synthetic systems, and is considered to be governed by dipolar active stresses generated by the self-propelled particles. Here, using linear stability analyses and numerical simulations, we show that a hydrodynamic bend instability can emerge in the absence of any dipolar active stress and solely due to the self-propulsion force acting on polar active units suspended in an incompressible fluid confined to a substrate. Specifically, we show analytically, and confirm in simulations, that a uniformly ordered state develops bend instability above a critical self-propulsion force. Numerical simulations show that a further increase in the self-propulsion strength leads the system towards a disorderly flow state. The results offer a new route for development of hydrodynamic instabilities in two-dimensional self-propelled materials that are in contact with a substrate, with wide implications in layers of orientationally ordered cells and synthetic active particles.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Dependent Adhesion in Transparent, Monodomain Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastomeric pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) form adhesive bonds under light pressure. Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are exciting PSA candidates as they can impart both anisotropy and temperature-dependence to adhesion, but the full potential of their anisotropic adhesion is unexplored. Here, identical side-chain LCEs, produced as transparent isotropic or nematic films are investigated; the latter aligned in homeotropic or planar geometries. Their room-temperature adhesion, determined through a 90-degree peel test, is consistent with theoretical predictions and strongest in a planar geometry (peeled parallel to the director) with adhesive force per unit length of 0.67 Nmm-1. In contrast, adhesion of the planar perpendicular, isotropic and homeotropic films is 62.5%, 38.5% and 23.0% lower, respectively. The surface contribution to adhesion is identical for all films, confirming that the variation in adhesion is determined solely by the bulk LCE alignment controlled during film preparation. A temperature-dependent adhesion factor is determined from 0 Celsius to 80 Celsius using dynamic mechanical analysis, and found to be in excellent agreement with the peel data at room temperature. Molecular relaxations active above the glass transition temperature are dominant in determining LCE adhesion. The results show that side-chain LCEs can function as transparent, tunable, broad-temperature smart PSAs</description>

      <title>Growth of Structural Lengthscale in Kob Andersen Binary Mixtures: Role of medium range order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central and extensively debated question in glass physics concerns whether a single, growing lengthscale fundamentally controls glassy dynamics, particularly in systems lacking obvious structural motifs or medium range crystalline order (MRCO). In this work, we investigate structural and dynamical lengthscales in supercooled liquids using the Kob Andersen binary Lennard Jones (KALJ) model in two compositions: 80:20 and 60:40. We compute the dynamical lengthscale from displacement displacement correlation functions and observe a consistent growth as temperature decreases. To explore the static counterpart, we use a structural order parameter (SOP) based on the mean field caging potential. While this SOP is known to predict short time dynamics effectively, its bare correlation function reveals minimal spatial growth. Motivated by recent findings that long time dynamics reflect collective rearrangements, we perform spatial coarse-graining of the SOP and identify an optimal lengthscale $L_{max}$ that maximises structure dynamics correlation. We show that the structural correlation length derived from SOP coarse-grained over $L_{max}$ exhibits clear growth with cooling and closely tracks the dynamical lengthscale, especially for A particles in the 80:20 mixture and for both A and B particles in the 60:40 system. Our results reconcile the previously observed absence of static length growth in MRCO-free models like KALJ by highlighting the necessity of intermediate range structural descriptors. Furthermore, we find that the particles with larger structural length growth also correspond to species with latent crystallisation tendencies, suggesting a possible link between structural order, dynamics, and incipient crystallisation.</description>

      <title>The effect of fiber plasticity on domain formation in soft biological composites -- Part I: a bifurcation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main objective of this work is to shed light on the effect of fiber plasticity on the macroscopic response and domain formation in soft biological composites. This goal is pursued by analyzing the plane-strain response of two-phase laminates. In the context of this problem, the effect of fiber plasticity is accounted for by allowing the elastically stiffer layers (``fiber'' phase) to also yield plastically and by taking the soft layers (``matrix'' phase) to be purely elastic solids. The analysis is carried out at finite elastic and plastic strains, but it is restricted to unidirectional, non-monotonic loading paths, applied by initially increasing the macroscopic stretch along the direction of the layers up to a prescribed maximum value and then decreasing the same stretch down to a minimum value. A simple expression is derived for the critical conditions at which the homogenized behavior of the laminate loses strong ellipticity for the first time along the loading path. The relevance of this result stems from the fact that the loss of macroscopic ellipticity of these composites is known to coincide with the onset of bifurcations of the long-wavelength type. It follows from this result that, just like hyperelastic laminates, elastoplastic laminates may lose macroscopic ellipticity whenever their incremental strength in shear perpendicular to the layers vanishes for the first time. For situations in which loss of macroscopic ellipticity does take place, a corresponding post-bifurcation solution for the homogenized behavior of the laminate is computed. The deformed state of the material described by this solution is characterized by twin lamellar domains that are formed at a length scale much larger than the width of the original, microscopic layers, but still much smaller than the overall dimensions of the macroscopic specimen under consideration.</description>

      <title>Membrane-mediated force transduction: Stick-slip motion of vesicles with fluid membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How internal forces are transduced into motion through soft, fluid membranes remains a fundamental question in the study of active systems. To investigate this coupling, we develop a minimal system consisting of a single ferromagnetic particle encapsulated within a lipid vesicle with controlled membrane composition and phase behavior. An external rotating magnetic field actuates the particle, which rotates and translates along the inner membrane leaflet. This motion generates local slip in the membrane; near a substrate, the slip creates a shear gradient across the lubrication gap that propels the vesicle forward. Propulsion is intermittent and strongest when the particle moves near the vesicle bottom, where stress transmission is most effective. We find that the coupling between internal flows and vesicle motion is highly sensitive to membrane elasticity, excess area, and phase coexistence. Local membrane deformation and flow dissipate part of the stress, limiting the efficiency of force transduction. Additionally, membrane fluctuations and external boundaries reduce particle mobility, and in phase-separated membranes, line tension at domain boundaries deflects the particle and gradually reorients membrane structure. These results demonstrate that lipid membranes not only transmit internal stresses but also remodel themselves in response, actively shaping the dynamics of force transduction and motion in active systems.</description>

      <title>Pseudoperiodic Spherical Boundary Conditions: Efficient And Isotropic 3D Particle Simulations Without Lattice Artifacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBC) introduce well-known lattice artifacts. We present a novel Pseudoperiodic Spherical Boundary Condition (SBC) that is perfectly isotropic. Through detailed comparative simulations, we demonstrate that SBC eliminates the structural and dynamic anisotropy inherent to PBC. For the crowded systems where these artifacts are most prominent, our method is also computationally more efficient than standard Minimum Image Convention implementations. This establishes SBC as a powerful, high-fidelity alternative for simulating isotropic matter.</description>

      <title>A Study of Non-linear Flows and Shear Banding in Wormlike Micelles Under Varying Elasticity, Flow Curvature, and Surfactant Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the flow dynamics of two shear-banding wormlike micellar solutions with distinct surfactant chemistries in a Taylor-Couette (TC) setup following a startup shear. The solutions, formulated with CTAB/NaSal and CPyCl/NaSal, exhibit comparable bulk rheology and equilibrium microstructural properties. By varying the TC gap size, we systematically examine elasticity number over a range of 128000-4470000, while flow curvature spans from 0.022 to 0.171. Under a step shear into the stress plateau, both solutions exhibit a pronounced stress overshoot that intensifies with increasing elasticity number and flow curvature, followed by the development of growing flow heterogeneities. Beyond a critical threshold of elasticity number and curvature, the CTAB/NaSal solution exhibits transient flow reversal, whereas the CPyCl/NaSal solution, despite developing similar heterogeneities, does not undergo flow reversal under any tested conditions. We hypothesize that this difference arises from the stronger electrostatic repulsions between CPyCl head groups due to their larger size, coupled with the higher dissociation rate of Cl counterions. Additionally, the quasi-steady velocity profiles are significantly influenced by elasticity number and flow curvature. Wall slip at the outer cylinder exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on these parameters: it is negligible at low values of elasticity number and flow curvature, peaks at intermediate values, and diminishes at high values. Our findings highlight how surfactant chemistry, elasticity number, and flow curvature control shear-banding flows in wormlike micelles.</description>

      <title>Length scales in electrolytes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The elusive presence of an anomalously increasing screening length at high ionic concentrations hampers a complete picture of interactions in electrolytes. Theories which extend the diluted Debye-Huckel framework to higher concentrations predict, in addition to the expected decreasing Debye length, an increasing significant scale of the order of at most a few ionic diameters. More recent surface force balance experiments with different materials succeeded in measuring increasing length scales which, however, turn out to extend over tenths or even hundreds of ionic diameters. While simulation work has managed to characterize the former, the latter still avoid detection, generating doubts about its true origin. Here we provide a step forward in the clarification of such a conundrum. We have studied by extensive Molecular Dynamics simulation the properties of a generic model of electrolyte, lithium tetrafluoroborate dissolved in ethylene-carbonate, in a vast range of salt concentrations continuously joining the Debye non-interacting limit to the opposite over-charged solvent-in-salt states. On one side, we have accurately determined the macroscopic concentration-induced structural, dielectric and transport modifications, on the other we have quantified the resulting nano-scale ions organization. Based only on the simulation data, without resorting to any uncontrolled hypothesis or phenomenological parameter, we identify a convincing candidate for the measured anomalously increasing length, whose origin has been possibly misinterpreted.</description>

      <title>Synchronization and exceptional points in nonreciprocal active polar mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many active matter systems consist of different particle types that interact via nonreciprocal couplings. Such nonreciprocal couplings can lead to the spontaneous emergence of time-dependent states that break parity-time symmetry. On the field-theoretical level, the transition to these states is marked by so-called exceptional points. However, their precise impact on observable particle dynamics remains poorly understood. In this study, we address this gap by providing a scale-bridging view of a minimal active mixture with nonreciprocal polar interactions. We find that nonreciprocity induces chiral motion on the particle level, yet no full, homogeneous synchronization. Instead, we observe various behaviors, ranging from fully synchronized clusters to chimera-like states. The nonreciprocity-induced spontaneous chirality increases with the degree of nonreciprocity and peaks at coupling strengths associated with exceptional points.</description>

      <title>Active phase separation: new phenomenology from non-equilibrium physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In active systems, whose constituents have non-equilibrium dynamics at local level, fluid-fluid phase separation is widely observed. Examples include the formation of membraneless organelles within cells; the clustering of self-propelled colloidal particles in the absence of attractive forces, and some types of ecological segregation. A schematic understanding of such active phase separation was initially borrowed from what is known for the equilibrium case, in which detailed balance holds at microscopic level. However it has recently become clear that in active systems the absence of detailed balance, although it leave phase separation qualitatively unchanged in some regimes (for example domain growth driven by interfacial tension via Ostwald ripening), can in other regimes radically alter its phenomenology at mechanistic level. For example, microphase separation can be caused by reverse Ostwald ripening, a process that is hard to imagine from an equilibrium perspective. This and other new phenomena arise because, instead of having a single, positive interfacial tension like their equilibrium counterparts, the fluid-fluid interfaces created by active phase separation can have several distinct interfacial tensions governing different properties, some of which can be negative. These phenomena can be broadly understood by studying continuum field theories for a single conserved scalar order parameter (the fluid density), supplemented with a velocity field in cases where momentum conservation is also present. More complex regimes arise in systems described by multiple scalar order parameters (especially with nonreciprocal interactions between these); or when an order parameter undergoes both conserved and non-conserved dynamics; or in systems that support orientational long-range order in one or more of the coexisting phases.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research paper comprehensively explores the effects of molecular weight and chain architecture on the interfacial and thermodynamic properties of cyclic and linear polymer blends. Utilizing the Kremer-Grest bead-spring model, the study meticulously investigates how these polymers behave at the polymer-wall interface, with a specific emphasis on their adsorption characteristics and thermal attributes. By showing the heat capacity and thermal stability of polymeric fluids, the research not only advances the understanding of these critical factors within polymer systems but also highlights the broader environmental implications associated with polymer degradation. The study examines the intricate interaction between molecular design parameters and functionality, revealing how variations in polymer architecture can lead to significant changes in performance and stability. Furthermore, it examines the potential for enhancing the lifecycle performance of polymers, with an eye toward the development of more sustainable materials capable of minimizing environmental impact. Through this exploration, it aims to provide valuable insights that contribute to the ongoing discourse on the optimization of polymer formulations for a greener future, setting the stage for innovations in material science aimed at sustainable applications. The insights gained from this investigation have the potential to inform future research directions and material design strategies, ultimately supporting the creation of polymers that not only perform effectively but are also environmentally friendly. By integrating a thorough understanding of these relationships, this work aspires to lay the groundwork for the evolution of polymer science, encouraging advancements that align with both technological needs and ecological stewardship.</description>

      <title>Transverse vortices induced by modulated granular shear flows of elongated particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform discrete element method (DEM) simulations of elongated grains in a shear cell for various particle aspect ratios and contact frictions, with an additional heterogeneous force perturbation in the flow direction. For a perturbation in the form of a single Fourier mode, we show that the response of the system consists of transverse secondary flows that average onto a pattern of four vortices. We also theoretically studied this phenomenon by generalizing the granular rheology $\mu(I)$ to the case of elongated grains and computing the linear response to such a perturbation. Even if the agreement between theory and simulations remains qualitative only, we can reproduce and understand the inversion of the vortex pattern when the cell aspect ratio is increased from a vertically to a horizontally elongated cell shape, emphasizing the key role of the second normal stress difference as well as the cell geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A viscosity-sensitive monomer consisting of a methacrylate-functionalized julolidone-based molecular rotor (MECVJ) was synthesized and used to obtain viscosity-sensitive polymers (poly(DMA-\textit{s}-MECVJ)). The qualitative properties of the molecular rotor were preserved after its inclusion in the new polymer, in particular the effect of the viscosity of the surrounding medium on the fluorescence lifetime of the rotor. By grafting these polymers onto glass slides, viscosity-sensitive surfaces were obtained, showing good robustness in time after successive use and washing. As proof of concept, these surfaces were used to assemble a microfluidic chip capable of mapping viscosity of fluids flowing inside the channel.</description>

      <title>String Formation and Arrested Ordering Kinetics in Nematics Induced by Polar Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our study explores the mixture of polar particles in apolar environment. We employ a coarse-grained approach to model the mixture, where polar particles are in minority. The interaction between polar and apolar components is incorporated via a coupling term in the free energy. Coupling generates local interaction in the system which results in the formation of string like structures connecting a pair of half integer topological defects. The increase in the coupling strength or the density of polar particles results in the: Sharper strings with larger probability of connecting the topological defects of same charge and the enhanced dynamics of topological defects. However, the ordering kinetics of the system shows the delayed coarsening for larger coupling or polar density. Our results can be used to develop controlled kinetics as well as to detect the impurities in liquid crystals.</description>

      <title>Exact anisotropic properties of hard spheres in narrow cylindrical confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) system of hard spheres confined within a cylindrical pore so narrow that only nearest-neighbor interactions occur. By mapping this Q1D system onto a one-dimensional polydisperse mixture of nonadditive hard rods, we obtain exact thermodynamic and structural properties, including the radial distribution function, which had remained elusive in previous studies. We derive analytical results for limiting cases, such as small pore diameters, virial expansions, and the high-pressure regime. In particular, we identify a crossover in the anisotropic pressure components: at high densities, the transverse pressure overtakes the longitudinal one when the pore diameter exceeds a critical threshold. We also examine spatial correlations in particle arrangements and radial fluctuations, shedding light on the emergence of ordering in confined systems.</description>

      <title>Learning to control non-equilibrium dynamics using local imperfect gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard approaches to controlling dynamical systems involve biologically implausible steps such as backpropagation of errors or intermediate model-based system representations. Recent advances in machine learning have shown that "imperfect" feedback of errors during training can yield test performance that is similar to using full backpropagated errors, provided that the two error signals are at least somewhat aligned. Inspired by such methods, we introduce an iterative, spatiotemporally local protocol to learn driving forces and control non-equilibrium dynamical systems using imperfect feedback signals. We present numerical experiments and theoretical justification for several examples. For systems in conservative force fields that are driven by external time-dependent protocols, our update rules resemble a dynamical version of contrastive divergence. We appeal to linear response theory to establish that our imperfect update rules are locally convergent for these conservative systems. Finally, we show that similar local update rules can also solve dynamical control problems for non-conservative systems, and we illustrate this in the non-trivial example of active nematics. Our updates allow learning spatiotemporal activity fields that pull topological defects along desired trajectories in the active nematic fluid. These imperfect feedback methods are information efficient and in principle biologically plausible, and they can help extend recent methods of decentralized training for physical materials into dynamical settings.</description>

      <title>Exact computation of Transfer Entropy with Path Weight Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01650v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to quantify the directional flow of information is vital to understanding natural systems and designing engineered information-processing systems. A widely used measure to quantify this information flow is the transfer entropy. However, until now, this quantity could only be obtained in dynamical models using approximations that are typically uncontrolled. Here we introduce a computational algorithm called Transfer Entropy-Path Weight Sampling (TE-PWS), which makes it possible, for the first time, to quantify the transfer entropy and its variants exactly for any stochastic model, including those with multiple hidden variables, nonlinearity, transient conditions, and feedback. By leveraging techniques from polymer and path sampling, TE-PWS efficiently computes the transfer entropy as a Monte-Carlo average over signal trajectory space. We use our exact technique to demonstrate that commonly used approximate methods to compute transfer entropies incur large systematic errors and high computational costs. As an application, we use TE-PWS in linear and nonlinear systems to reveal how transfer entropy can overcome naive applications of the data processing inequality in the presence of feedback.</description>
