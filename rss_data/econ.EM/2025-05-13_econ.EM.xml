      <title>Team Networks with Partially Observed Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a linear production model in team networks with missing links. In the model, heterogeneous workers, represented as nodes, produce jointly and repeatedly within teams, represented as links. Links are omitted when their associated outcome variables fall below a threshold, resulting in partial observability of the network. To address this, I propose a Generalized Method of Moments estimator under normally distributed errors and develop a distribution-free test for detecting link truncation. Applied to academic publication data, the estimator reveals and corrects a substantial downward bias in the estimated scaling factor that aggregates individual fixed effects into team-specific fixed effects. This finding suggests that the collaboration premium may be systematically underestimated when missing links are not properly accounted for.</description>

      <title>On Selection of Cross-Section Averages in Non-stationary Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information criteria (IC) are important tools in the literature of factor models that allow one to estimate a typically unknown number of latent factors. Although first proposed for the Principal Components setting in the seminal work by Bai and Ng (2002), it has recently been shown that IC perform extremely well in Common Correlated Effects (CCE) and related setups with stationary factors. In particular, they can consistently select a sufficient set of cross-section averages (CAs) to approximate the factor space. Given that CAs can proxy nonstationary factors, it is tempting to believe that the consistency of IC continues to hold under such generality. This study is a cautionary tale for practitioners. We demonstrate formally and in simulations that IC has a severe underselection issue even under very mild forms of factor non-stationarity, which goes against the sentiment in the CAs literature.</description>

      <title>rd2d: Causal Inference in Boundary Discontinuity Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boundary discontinuity designs -- also known as Multi-Score Regression Discontinuity (RD) designs, with Geographic RD designs as a prominent example -- are often used in empirical research to learn about causal treatment effects along a continuous assignment boundary defined by a bivariate score. This article introduces the R package rd2d, which implements and extends the methodological results developed in Cattaneo, Titiunik and Yu (2025) for boundary discontinuity designs. The package employs local polynomial estimation and inference using either the bivariate score or a univariate distance-to-boundary metric. It features novel data-driven bandwidth selection procedures, and offers both pointwise and uniform estimation and inference along the assignment boundary. The numerical performance of the package is demonstrated through a simulation study.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Multi-scale Leverage Effect Estimator under Dependent Microstructure Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the leverage effect from high-frequency data is vital but challenged by complex, dependent microstructure noise, often exhibiting non-Gaussian higher-order moments. This paper introduces a novel multi-scale framework for efficient and robust leverage effect estimation under such flexible noise structures. We develop two new estimators, the Subsampling-and-Averaging Leverage Effect (SALE) and the Multi-Scale Leverage Effect (MSLE), which adapt subsampling and multi-scale approaches holistically using a unique shifted window technique. This design simplifies the multi-scale estimation procedure and enhances noise robustness without requiring the pre-averaging approach. We establish central limit theorems and stable convergence, with MSLE achieving convergence rates of an optimal $n^{-1/4}$ and a near-optimal $n^{-1/9}$ for the noise-free and noisy settings, respectively. A cornerstone of our framework's efficiency is a specifically designed MSLE weighting strategy that leverages covariance structures across scales. This significantly reduces asymptotic variance and, critically, yields substantially smaller finite-sample errors than existing methods under both noise-free and realistic noisy settings. Extensive simulations and empirical analyses confirm the superior efficiency, robustness, and practical advantages of our approach.</description>

      <title>Assumption-robust Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In observational causal inference, it is common to encounter multiple adjustment sets that appear equally plausible. It is often untestable which of these adjustment sets are valid to adjust for (i.e., satisfies ignorability). This discrepancy can pose practical challenges as it is typically unclear how to reconcile multiple, possibly conflicting estimates of the average treatment effect (ATE). A naive approach is to report the whole range (convex hull of the union) of the resulting confidence intervals. However, the width of this interval might not shrink to zero in large samples and can be unnecessarily wide in real applications. To address this issue, we propose a summary procedure that generates a single estimate, one confidence interval, and identifies a set of units for which the causal effect estimate remains valid, provided at least one adjustment set is valid. The width of our proposed confidence interval shrinks to zero with sample size at $n^{-1/2}$ rate, unlike the original range which is of constant order. Thus, our assumption-robust approach enables reliable causal inference on the ATE even in scenarios where most of the adjustment sets are invalid. Admittedly, this robustness comes at a cost: our inferential guarantees apply to a target population close to, but different from, the one originally intended. We use synthetic and real-data examples to demonstrate that our proposed procedure provides substantially tighter confidence intervals for the ATE as compared to the whole range. In particular, for a real-world dataset on 401(k) retirement plans our method produces a confidence interval 50\% shorter than the whole range of confidence intervals based on multiple adjustment sets.</description>

      <title>Sparse High-Dimensional Vector Autoregressive Bootstrap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a high-dimensional multiplier bootstrap for time series data based on capturing dependence through a sparsely estimated vector autoregressive model. We prove its consistency for inference on high-dimensional means under two different moment assumptions on the errors, namely sub-gaussian moments and a finite number of absolute moments. In establishing these results, we derive a Gaussian approximation for the maximum mean of a linear process, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A Nonresponse Bias Correction using Nonrandom Followup with an Application to the Gender Entrepreneurship Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a nonresponse correction applicable to any setting in which multiple attempts to contact subjects affect whether researchers observe variables without affecting the variables themselves. Our procedure produces point estimates of population averages using selected samples without requiring randomized incentives or assuming selection bias cancels out for any within-respondent comparisons. Applying our correction to a 16% response rate survey of University of Wisconsin-Madison undergraduates, we estimate a 15 percentage point male-female entrepreneurial intention gap. Our estimates attribute the 20 percentage point uncorrected within-respondent gap to positive bias for men and negative bias for women, highlighting the value of within-group nonresponse corrections.</description>

      <title>Inference after discretizing time-varying unobserved heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximating time-varying unobserved heterogeneity by discrete types has become increasingly popular in economics. Yet, provably valid post-clustering inference for target parameters in models that do not impose an exact group structure is still lacking. This paper fills this gap in the leading case of a linear panel data model with nonseparable two-way unobserved heterogeneity. Building on insights from the double machine learning literature, we propose a simple inference procedure based on a bias-reducing moment. Asymptotic theory and simulations suggest excellent performance. In the application on fiscal policy we revisit, the novel approach yields conclusions in line with economic theory.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Model Averaging in Causal Instrumental Variable Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instrumental variables are a popular tool to infer causal effects under unobserved confounding, but choosing suitable instruments is challenging in practice. We propose gIVBMA, a Bayesian model averaging procedure that addresses this challenge by averaging across different sets of instrumental variables and covariates in a structural equation model. Our approach extends previous work through a scale-invariant prior structure and accommodates non-Gaussian outcomes and treatments, offering greater flexibility than existing methods. The computational strategy uses conditional Bayes factors to update models separately for the outcome and treatments. We prove that this model selection procedure is consistent. By explicitly accounting for model uncertainty, gIVBMA allows instruments and covariates to switch roles and provides robustness against invalid instruments. In simulation experiments, gIVBMA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate its usefulness in two empirical applications: the effects of malaria and institutions on income per capita and the returns to schooling. A software implementation of gIVBMA is available in Julia.</description>
