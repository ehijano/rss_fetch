      <title>Decoding the human brain tissue response to radiofrequency excitation using a biophysical-model-free deep MRI on a chip framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) relies on radiofrequency (RF) excitation of proton spin. Clinical diagnosis requires a comprehensive collation of biophysical data via multiple MRI contrasts, acquired using a series of RF sequences that lead to lengthy examinations. Here, we developed a vision transformer-based framework that captures the spatiotemporal magnetic signal evolution and decodes the brain tissue response to RF excitation, constituting an MRI on a chip. Following a per-subject rapid calibration scan (28.2 s), a wide variety of image contrasts including fully quantitative molecular, water relaxation, and magnetic field maps can be generated automatically. The method was validated across healthy subjects and a cancer patient in two different imaging sites, and proved to be 94% faster than alternative protocols. The deep MRI on a chip (DeepMonC) framework may reveal the molecular composition of the human brain tissue in a wide range of pathologies, while offering clinically attractive scan times.</description>

      <title>Personalizing Federated Instrument Segmentation with Visual Trait Priors in Robotic Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) for surgical instrument segmentation (SIS) is a promising approach. It enables multiple clinical sites to collaboratively train a series of models in privacy, with each model tailored to the individual distribution of each site. Existing PFL methods rarely consider the personalization of multi-headed self-attention, and do not account for appearance diversity and instrument shape similarity, both inherent in surgical scenes. We thus propose PFedSIS, a novel PFL method with visual trait priors for SIS, incorporating global-personalized disentanglement (GPD), appearance-regulation personalized enhancement (APE), and shape-similarity global enhancement (SGE), to boost SIS performance in each site. GPD represents the first attempt at head-wise assignment for multi-headed self-attention personalization. To preserve the unique appearance representation of each site and gradually leverage the inter-site difference, APE introduces appearance regulation and provides customized layer-wise aggregation solutions via hypernetworks for each site's personalized parameters. The mutual shape information of instruments is maintained and shared via SGE, which enhances the cross-style shape consistency on the image level and computes the shape-similarity contribution of each site on the prediction level for updating the global parameters. PFedSIS outperforms state-of-the-art methods with +1.51% Dice, +2.11% IoU, -2.79 ASSD, -15.55 HD95 performance gains. The corresponding code and models will be released at https://github.com/wzjialang/PFedSIS.</description>
