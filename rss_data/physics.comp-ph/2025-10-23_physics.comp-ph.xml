      <title>Investigation of the Mechanical Properties of Three Commercial and Five Variations of IOL Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aimed to simulate the mechanical stability of eight different (three commercial and five variations) haptic IOL models using FEM to measure mechanical biomarkers (axial displacement, elasticity modulus, and stress) under quasi-static compression. The results revealed that a commercial IOL model exhibited a better mechanical response for smaller compression forces than the other models. Conversely, a variation model performed better for larger compression forces. These findings may help in developing more mechanically stable IOL models.</description>

      <title>ComProScanner: A multi-agent based framework for composition-property structured data extraction from scientific literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the advent of various pre-trained large language models, extracting structured knowledge from scientific text has experienced a revolutionary change compared with traditional machine learning or natural language processing techniques. Despite these advances, accessible automated tools that allow users to construct, validate, and visualise datasets from scientific literature extraction remain scarce. We therefore developed ComProScanner, an autonomous multi-agent platform that facilitates the extraction, validation, classification, and visualisation of machine-readable chemical compositions and properties, integrated with synthesis data from journal articles for comprehensive database creation. We evaluated our framework using 100 journal articles against 10 different LLMs, including both open-source and proprietary models, to extract highly complex compositions associated with ceramic piezoelectric materials and corresponding piezoelectric strain coefficients (d33), motivated by the lack of a large dataset for such materials. DeepSeek-V3-0324 outperformed all models with a significant overall accuracy of 0.82. This framework provides a simple, user-friendly, readily-usable package for extracting highly complex experimental data buried in the literature to build machine learning or deep learning datasets.</description>

      <title>Two Quantum Algorithms for Nonlinear Reaction-Diffusion Equation using Chebyshev Approximation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present two new quantum algorithms for reaction-diffusion equations that employ the truncated Chebyshev polynomial approximation. This method is employed to numerically solve the ordinary differential equation emerging from the linearization of the associated nonlinear differential equation. In the first algorithm, we use the matrix exponentiation method (Patel et al., 2018), while in the second algorithm, we repurpose the quantum spectral method (Childs et al., 2020). Our main technical contribution is to derive the sufficient conditions for the diagonalization of the Carleman embedding matrix, which is indispensable for designing both quantum algorithms. We supplement this with an efficient iterative algorithm to diagonalize the Carleman matrix.
  Our first algorithm has gate complexity of O(d$\cdot$log(d)+T$\cdot$polylog(T/$\varepsilon$)). Here $d$ is the size of the Carleman matrix, $T$ is the simulation time, and $\varepsilon$ is the approximation error. The second algorithm is polynomial in $log(d)$, $T$, and $log(1/\varepsilon)$ - the gate complexity scales as O(polylog(d)$\cdot$T$\cdot$polylog(T/$\varepsilon$)). In terms of $T$ and $\varepsilon$, this is comparable to the speedup gained by the current best known quantum algorithm for this problem, the truncated Taylor series method (Costa et.al., 2025).
  Our approach has two shortcomings. First, we have not provided an upper bound, in terms of d, on the condition number of the Carleman matrix. Second, the success of the diagonalization is based on a conjecture that a specific trigonometric equation has no integral solution. However, we provide strategies to mitigate these shortcomings in most practical cases.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Regression and Differentiable Fits in Beyond the Standard Model Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the efficacy of symbolic regression (SR) to probe models of particle physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), by considering the so-called Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM). Like many incarnations of BSM physics this model has a number (four) of arbitrary parameters, which determine the experimental signals, and cosmological observables such as the dark matter relic density. We show that analysis of the phenomenology can be greatly accelerated by using symbolic expressions derived for the observables in terms of the input parameters. Here we focus on the Higgs mass, the cold dark matter relic density, and the contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. We find that SR can produce remarkably accurate expressions. Using them we make global fits to derive the posterior probability densities of the CMSSM input parameters which are in good agreement with those performed using conventional methods. Moreover, we demonstrate a major advantage of SR which is the ability to make fits using differentiable methods rather than sampling methods. We also compare the method with neural network (NN) regression. SR produces more globally robust results, while NNs require data that is focussed on the promising regions in order to be equally performant.</description>

      <title>Kinetics of Peierls dimerization transition: Machine learning force-field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a machine learning (ML) force-field framework for simulating the non-equilibrium dynamics of charge-density-wave (CDW) order driven by the Peierls instability. Since the Peierls distortion arises from the coupling between lattice displacements and itinerant electrons, evaluating the adiabatic forces during time evolution is computationally intensive, particularly for large systems. To overcome this bottleneck, we develop a generalized Behler-Parrinello neural-network architecture -- originally formulated for ab initio molecular dynamics -- to accurately and efficiently predict forces from local structural environments. Using the locality of electronic responses, the resulting ML force field achieves linear scaling efficiency while maintaining quantitative accuracy. Large-scale dynamical simulations using this framework uncover a two-stage coarsening behavior of CDW domains: an early-time regime characterized by a power-law growth $L \sim t^{\alpha}$ with an effective exponent $\alpha \approx 0.7$, followed by a crossover to the Allen-Cahn scaling $L \sim \sqrt{t}$ at late times. The enhanced early-time coarsening is attributed to anisotropic domain-wall motion arising from electron-mediated directional interactions. This work demonstrates the promise of ML-based force fields for multiscale dynamical modeling of condensed-matter lattice models.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness and Approximation of Weak Solutions to Time Dependent Maxwell's Equations with $L^2$-Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Maxwell's equations in conducting media with perfectly conducting boundary conditions on Lipschitz domains, allowing rough material coefficients and $L^2$-data. Our first contribution is a direct proof of well-posedness of the first-order weak formulation, including solution existence and uniqueness, an energy identity, and continuous dependence on the data. The argument uses interior-in-time mollification to show uniqueness while avoiding reflection techniques. Existence is via the well-known Galerkin method (cf.~Duvaut and Lions \cite[Eqns.~(4.31)--(4.32), p.~346; Thm.~4.1]{GDuvaut_JLLions_1976a}). For completeness, and to make the paper self-contained, a complete proof has been provided.
  Our second contribution is a structure-preserving semi-discrete finite element method based on the N\'ed\'elec/Raviart--Thomas de Rham complex. The scheme preserves a discrete Gauss law for all times and satisfies a continuous-in-time energy identity with stability for nonnegative conductivity. With a divergence-free initialization of the magnetic field (via potential reconstruction or constrained $L^2$ projection), we prove convergence of the semi-discrete solutions to the unique weak solution as the mesh is refined. The analysis mostly relies on projector consistency, weak-* compactness in time-bounded $L^2$ spaces, and identification of time derivatives in dual spaces.</description>

      <title>Unifying same- and different-material particle charging through stochastic scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Triboelectric charging of insulating particles through contact is critical in diverse physical and engineering processes, from dust storms and volcanic eruptions to industrial powder handling. However, many experiments over the years have consistently revealed counterintuitive charging patterns, including variable impact charge under identical conditions, charge sign reversal with repeated impacts, and bipolar charging of differently sized particles. Existing computational models cannot predict these patterns; they either rely on oversimplified heuristics or require inaccessible detailed surface properties. We present a stochastic scaling model (SSM) for particle charging that unifies same-material (particle-particle) and different-material (particle-wall) charging in a single theoretical framework. The model grounds in a physics-based stochastic closure by the mean, variance, skewness, and minimum impact charge measured in a highly-controlled reference experiment. To test the SSM, we implemented it in an open-source Lagrangian-Eulerian CFD solver. When simulating 300 000 insulating particles transported by turbulent wall-bounded flows, the SSM takes less than 0.01% of the CPU time. By scaling the statistical parameters of the reference impact to each collision, the new model reproduces the complex charging patterns observed in experiments without requiring surface-level first-principles inputs. The SSM offers a physically grounded route to large-scale simulations of electrostatic effects across many fields of particle-laden flows.</description>

      <title>Tracking electron capture processes in classical molecular dynamics simulations for spectral line broadening in plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasma spectroscopy is a fundamental tool for diagnosing laboratory and astrophysical plasmas. Accurate interpretation of spectra depends upon precise modeling and comprehension of Stark broadening and other mechanisms affecting spectral lines. In this context, computer simulations have emerged as valuable tools, offering idealized experiments with well-defined conditions. Molecular dynamics simulations, in particular, excel at replicating the particle interactions within the plasma and their impact on the state of a radiating atom or ion. However, these simulations present challenges in tracking electron capture processes, since setting an unambiguous criterion to distinguish between bound and free electrons is not trivial. In this paper we introduce a new algorithm that, within a classical framework, precisely identifies the scenario in which an electron is captured by an ion and then follows a stable orbit around it. The algorithm's applicability extends to emitters with charges Z &gt;= 1. The procedure enables the correct identification of valid time-histories of the electric microfield perturbing the emitting ion, which will be used for subsequent line shape calculations. The ionization balance results obtained from the application of this algorithm are compared with an additional method based on the potential energy of the particles in the simulations, finding good agreement, therefore validating the use of this approach.</description>

      <title>Modal analysis of a domain decomposition method for Maxwell's equations in a waveguide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-harmonic wave propagation problems, especially those governed by Maxwell's equations, pose significant computational challenges due to the non-self-adjoint nature of the operators and the large, non-Hermitian linear systems resulting from discretization. Domain decomposition methods, particularly one-level Schwarz methods, offer a promising framework to tackle these challenges, with recent advancements showing the potential for weak scalability under certain conditions. In this paper, we analyze the weak scalability of one-level Schwarz methods for Maxwell's equations in strip-wise domain decompositions, focusing on waveguides with general cross sections and different types of transmission conditions such as impedance or perfectly matched layers (PMLs). By combining techniques from the limiting spectrum analysis of Toeplitz matrices and the modal decomposition of Maxwell's solutions, we provide a novel theoretical framework that extends previous work to more complex geometries and transmission conditions. Numerical experiments confirm that the limiting spectrum effectively predicts practical behavior even with a modest number of subdomains. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the one-level Schwarz method can achieve robustness with respect to the wave number under specific domain decomposition parameters, offering new insights into its applicability for large-scale electromagnetic wave problems.</description>

      <title>CALM-PDE: Continuous and Adaptive Convolutions for Latent Space Modeling of Time-dependent PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving time-dependent Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) using a densely discretized spatial domain is a fundamental problem in various scientific and engineering disciplines, including modeling climate phenomena and fluid dynamics. However, performing these computations directly in the physical space often incurs significant computational costs. To address this issue, several neural surrogate models have been developed that operate in a compressed latent space to solve the PDE. While these approaches reduce computational complexity, they often use Transformer-based attention mechanisms to handle irregularly sampled domains, resulting in increased memory consumption. In contrast, convolutional neural networks allow memory-efficient encoding and decoding but are limited to regular discretizations. Motivated by these considerations, we propose CALM-PDE, a model class that efficiently solves arbitrarily discretized PDEs in a compressed latent space. We introduce a novel continuous convolution-based encoder-decoder architecture that uses an epsilon-neighborhood-constrained kernel and learns to apply the convolution operator to adaptive and optimized query points. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CALM-PDE on a diverse set of PDEs with both regularly and irregularly sampled spatial domains. CALM-PDE is competitive with or outperforms existing baseline methods while offering significant improvements in memory and inference time efficiency compared to Transformer-based methods.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Based Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks for Simulating Nonlinear Solid Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06045v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph-based learned simulators have emerged as a promising approach for simulating physical systems on unstructured meshes, offering speed and generalization across diverse geometries. However, they often struggle with capturing global phenomena, such as bending or long-range correlations usually occurring in solid mechanics, and suffer from error accumulation over long rollouts due to their reliance on local message passing and direct next-step prediction. We address these limitations by introducing the Rolling Diffusion-Batched Inference Network (ROBIN), a novel learned simulator that integrates two key innovations: (i) Rolling Diffusion-Batched Inference (ROBI), a parallelized inference scheme that amortizes the cost of diffusion-based refinement across physical time steps by overlapping denoising steps across a temporal window. (ii) A Hierarchical Graph Neural Network built on algebraic multigrid coarsening, enabling multiscale message passing across different mesh resolutions. This architecture, implemented via Algebraic-hierarchical Message Passing Networks, captures both fine-scale local dynamics and global structural effects critical for phenomena like beam bending or multi-body contact. We validate ROBIN on challenging 2D and 3D solid mechanics benchmarks involving geometric, material, and contact nonlinearities. ROBIN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on all tasks, substantially outperforming existing next-step learned simulators while reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude compared to standard diffusion simulators.</description>

      <title>Computing excited eigenstates using inexact Lanczos methods and tree tensor network states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22574v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To understand the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, it is essential to study excited eigenstates. While tensor network states have become a standard tool for computing ground states in computational many-body physics, obtaining accurate excited eigenstates remains a significant challenge. In this work, we develop an approach that combines the inexact Lanczos method, which is designed for efficient computations of excited states, with tree tensor network states (TTNSs). We demonstrate our approach by computing excited vibrational states for three challenging problems: (1) 122 states in two different energy intervals of acetonitrile (12-dimensional), (2) Fermi resonance states of the fluxional Zundel ion (15-dimensional), and (3) selected excited states of the fluxional and very correlated Eigen ion (33-dimensional). The proposed TTNS inexact Lanczos method is directly applicable to other quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mechanism of resistive switching in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor-based memristors is intriguing, and our conventional knowledge of bulk-oxide based memristors does not apply to these devices. Experimental data indicate that the genesis of resistive switching may be intrinsic to the 2D semiconducting active layer, as well as resulting from the movement of electrode atoms. Employing reactive-force field (ReaxFF) molecular dynamics simulations, we introduced the "sulphur atom popping model" [npj 2D Mater. Appl. 5, 33 (2021)] to elucidate the intrinsic nature of non-volatile resistive switching in 2D molybdenum disulfide-based memristors. In this paper we provide additional perspective to this model using density functional theory. We also discuss the limitations of universal machine learning interatomic potentials in reproducing ReaxFF simulation results.</description>
