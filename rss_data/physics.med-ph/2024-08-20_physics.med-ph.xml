      <title>Compartment-specific estimation of T2 and T2* with diffusion-PEPTIDE MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a microstructure imaging technique for estimating compartment-specific T2 and T2* simultaneously in the human brain. Microstructure imaging with diffusion MRI (dMRI) has enabled the modelling of intra-neurite and extra-neurite diffusion signals separately allowing for the estimation of compartment-specific tissue properties. These compartment-specific properties have been widely used in clinical studies. However, conventional dMRI cannot disentangle differences in relaxations between tissue compartments, causing biased estimates of diffusion measures which also change with TE. To solve the problem, combined relaxometry-diffusion imaging methods have been developed in recent years, providing compartmental T2-diffusion or T2*-diffusion imaging respectively, but not T2 and T2* together. As they provide complementary information, a technique that can estimate both jointly with diffusion is appealing to neuroimaging studies. The aim of this work is to develop a method to map compartmental T2-T2*-diffusion simultaneously. Using an advanced MRI acquisition called diffusion-PEPTIDE, a novel microstructure model is proposed and a multi-step fitting method is developed to estimate parameters of interest. We demonstrate for the first time that compartmental T2, T2* can be estimated simultaneously from in vivo data. we further show the accuracy and precision of parameter estimation with simulation.</description>

      <title>Influence of Medical Foreign Bodies on Dark-Field Chest Radiographs: First experiences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objectives: Evaluating the effects and artifacts introduced by medical foreign bodies in clinical dark-field chest radiographs and assessing their influence on the evaluation of pulmonary tissue, compared to conventional radiographs.
  Material &amp; Methods: This retrospective study analyzed data from subjects enrolled in clinical trials conducted between 2018 and 2021, focusing on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and COVID-19 patients. All patients obtained a radiograph using an in-house developed clinical prototype for grating-based dark-field chest radiography. The prototype simultaneously delivers a conventional and dark-field radiograph. Two radiologists independently assessed the clinical studies to identify patients with foreign bodies. Subsequently, an analysis was conducted on the effects and artifacts attributed to distinct foreign bodies and their impact on the assessment of pulmonary tissue.
  Results: Overall, 30 subjects with foreign bodies were included in this study (mean age, 64 years +/- 11 [standard deviation]; 15 men). Foreign bodies composed of materials lacking microstructure exhibited a diminished dark-field signal or no discernible signal. Foreign bodies with a microstructure, in our investigations the cementation of the kyphoplasty, produce a positive dark-field signal. Since most foreign bodies lack microstructural features, dark-field imaging revealed fewer signals and artifacts by foreign bodies compared to conventional radiographs.
  Conclusion: Dark-field radiography enhances the assessment of pulmonary tissue with overlaying foreign bodies compared to conventional radiography. Reduced interfering signals result in fewer overlapping radiopaque artifacts within the investigated regions. This mitigates the impact on image quality and interpretability of the radiographs and the projection-related limitations of radiography compared to CT.</description>
