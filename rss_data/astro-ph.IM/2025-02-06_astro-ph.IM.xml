      <title>Earth Detecting Earth: At what distance could Earth's constellation of technosignatures be detected with present-day technology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) searches for ``technosignatures'' that could provide the first detection of life beyond Earth through the technology that an extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) may have created. Any given SETI survey, if no technosignatures are detected, should set upper limits based on the kinds of technosignatures it should have been able to detect; the sensitivity of many SETI searches requires that their target sources (e.g., Dyson spheres or Kardashev II/III level radio transmitters) emit with power far exceeding the kinds of technology humans have developed. In this paper, we instead turn our gaze Earthward, minimizing the axis of extrapolation by only considering transmission and detection methods commensurate with an Earth-2024 level. We evaluate the maximum distance of detectability for various present-day Earth technosignatures -- radio transmissions, atmospheric technosignatures, optical and infrared signatures, and objects in space or on planetary surfaces -- using only present-day Earth instruments, providing one of the first fully cross-wavelength comparisons of the growing toolbox of SETI techniques. In this framework, we find that Earth's space-detectable signatures span 13 orders of magnitude in detectability, with intermittent, celestially-targeted radio transmission (i.e., planetary radar) beating out its nearest non-radio competitor by a factor of $10^3$ in detection distance. This work highlights the growing range of ways that exoplanet technosignatures may be expressed, the growing complexity and visibility of the human impact upon our planet, and the continued importance of the radio frequencies in SETI.</description>

      <title>Astromer 2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundational models have emerged as a powerful paradigm in deep learning field, leveraging their capacity to learn robust representations from large-scale datasets and effectively to diverse downstream applications such as classification. In this paper, we present Astromer 2 a foundational model specifically designed for extracting light curve embeddings. We introduce Astromer 2 as an enhanced iteration of our self-supervised model for light curve analysis. This paper highlights the advantages of its pre-trained embeddings, compares its performance with that of its predecessor, Astromer 1, and provides a detailed empirical analysis of its capabilities, offering deeper insights into the model's representations. Astromer 2 is pretrained on 1.5 million single-band light curves from the MACHO survey using a self-supervised learning task that predicts randomly masked observations within sequences. Fine-tuning on a smaller labeled dataset allows us to assess its performance in classification tasks. The quality of the embeddings is measured by the F1 score of an MLP classifier trained on Astromer-generated embeddings. Our results demonstrate that Astromer 2 significantly outperforms Astromer 1 across all evaluated scenarios, including limited datasets of 20, 100, and 500 samples per class. The use of weighted per-sample embeddings, which integrate intermediate representations from Astromer's attention blocks, is particularly impactful. Notably, Astromer 2 achieves a 15% improvement in F1 score on the ATLAS dataset compared to prior models, showcasing robust generalization to new datasets. This enhanced performance, especially with minimal labeled data, underscores the potential of Astromer 2 for more efficient and scalable light curve analysis.</description>

      <title>Lunar Laser Ranging with High-Power CW Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a high-power continuous-wave (CW) lunar laser ranging (LLR) technique that has the potential to significantly improve Earth--Moon distance measurements. Using a 1 kW CW laser at 1064 nm and a 1 m-aperture telescope as an example, we develop a detailed link budget and analyze the prevailing noise sources to assess system performance when ranging to next-generation ~10 cm corner-cube retroreflectors (CCRs). Unlike legacy arrays, these smaller CCRs are designed to yield lower intrinsic range errors, yet their reduced reflective area results in lower photon return rates, posing challenges for pulsed LLR systems. The photon-rich CW approach, by providing continuous high-power illumination, overcomes this limitation, reducing shot noise and enabling sustained millimeter-level ranging with a pathway to sub-0.1 mm precision. Furthermore, by alternating measurements between widely separated lunar reflectors, differential LLR mitigates common-mode station errors to achieve tens-of-micrometer precision, limited primarily by uncorrelated atmospheric turbulence. This scalable approach -- integrating high-power CW lasers, narrowband filtering, and rapid atmospheric turbulence averaging -- enables next-generation gravitational tests, precision lunar geodesy, and improved lunar reference frames in support of planetary exploration.</description>

      <title>Method for Determining the Parameters of a Ring-like Structure from the Visibility Function Shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole images obtained by very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) by the Event Horizon Telescope are a new tool for testing general relativity in super-strong gravitational fields. These images demonstrated a ring-like structure which can be explained as the black hole shadow image. To date, there are no reliable methods for determining the parameters of these ring-like structures, such as diameter, width, and asymmetry. In this paper, an algorithm for determining black hole image parameters is proposed using a Gaussian asymmetric ring as an example. Using the proposed method, the diameter and asymmetry parameters of the image of a supermassive black hole in the galaxy M87$^{*}$ were estimated based on observational data obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope group.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Advantages of a Moving Mesh in Nuclear Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many astrophysical explosions, such as type Ia supernovae, classical novae, and X-ray bursts, are dominated by thermonuclear runaway. To model these processes accurately, one must evolve nuclear reactions concurrently with hydrodynamics. We present an application of the moving mesh technique to this field of computation with the aim of explicitly testing the advantages of the method against the fixed mesh case. By way of traditional Strang splitting, our work couples a 13 isotope nuclear reaction network to a 1D moving mesh, Cartesian geometry hydrodynamics code. We explore three reacting problems: an acoustic pulse, a burning shock, and an advecting deflagration. Additionally using the shock jump conditions, we semi-analytically solve the burning shock problem under the assumption of quick, complete burning with the hope of establishing a useful and easy to set-up test problem. Strong moving mesh advantages are found in advecting, deflagrating flame fronts, where the technique dramatically reduces numerical diffusion that would otherwise lead to very fast artificial deflagration.</description>

      <title>Development of Radar and Optical Tracking of Near-Earth Asteroids at the University of Tasmania</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We detail the use of the University of Tasmania's (UTAS) optical and radio telescopes to conduct observations of near-Earth asteroids from 2021 to 2024. The Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex transmitted a radio signal at 7159.45 MHz, with the radar echo detected by the UTAS radio telescopes. The method of accounting for the Doppler shift between the stations and the near-Earth object is described so that others can implement a similar program. We present our results, with confirmed detections of 1994 PC1 and 2003 UC20 asteroids using the Hobart and Katherine 12-m antennas, demonstrating the feasibility of using small radio telescopes for these observations. Additionally, the recently upgraded Ceduna 30 m antenna was used to detect 2024 MK. Data collected from other observatories, such as Tidbinbilla, as well as the UTAS radar tracking of the moon are also presented in the context of demonstrating the means of applying these Doppler corrections and the accuracy of each method. Optical observations conducted in this period are also detailed as they complement radar observations and aid in refining the orbit parameters.</description>

      <title>Fast Sampling of Cosmological Initial Conditions with Gaussian Neural Posterior Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge of the primordial matter density field from which the large-scale structure of the Universe emerged over cosmic time is of fundamental importance for cosmology. However, reconstructing these cosmological initial conditions from late-time observations is a notoriously difficult task, which requires advanced cosmological simulators and sophisticated statistical methods to explore a multi-million-dimensional parameter space. We show how simulation-based inference (SBI) can be used to tackle this problem and to obtain data-constrained realisations of the primordial dark matter density field in a simulation-efficient way with general non-differentiable simulators. Our method is applicable to full high-resolution dark matter $N$-body simulations and is based on modelling the posterior distribution of the constrained initial conditions to be Gaussian with a diagonal covariance matrix in Fourier space. As a result, we can generate thousands of posterior samples within seconds on a single GPU, orders of magnitude faster than existing methods, paving the way for sequential SBI for cosmological fields. Furthermore, we perform an analytical fit of the estimated dependence of the covariance on the wavenumber, effectively transforming any point-estimator of initial conditions into a fast sampler. We test the validity of our obtained samples by comparing them to the true values with summary statistics and performing a Bayesian consistency test.</description>

Abstract: In the last decade, the ringdown community has made large strides in understanding the aftermath of binary black hole mergers through the study of numerical simulations. In this note, we introduce two flavors of fitting algorithms, that have been verified against each other, for the extraction of quasinormal mode amplitudes from ringdown waveforms - $\texttt{qnmfits}$ in Python and $\texttt{KerrRingdown}$ in Mathematica.</description>

      <title>PhotoD with LSST: Stellar Photometric Distances Out to the Edge of the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As demonstrated with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), Pan-STARRS, and most recently with Gaia data, broadband near-UV to near-IR stellar photometry can be used to estimate distance, metallicity, and interstellar dust extinction along the line of sight for stars in the Galaxy. Anticipating photometric catalogs with tens of billions of stars from Rubin's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), we present a Bayesian model and pipeline that build on previous work and can handle LSST-sized datasets. Likelihood computations utilize MIST/Dartmouth isochrones and priors are derived from TRILEGAL-based simulated LSST catalogs from P. Dal Tio et al. The computation speed is about 10 ms per star on a single core for both optimized grid search and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods; we show in a companion paper by K. Mrakov\v{c}i\'c et al. how to utilize neural networks to accelerate this performance by up to an order of magnitude. We validate our pipeline, named PhotoD (in analogy with photo-z, photometric redshifts of galaxies) using both simulated catalogs and SDSS, DECam, and Gaia photometry. We intend to make LSST-based value-added PhotoD catalogs publicly available via the Rubin Science Platform with every LSST data release.</description>

      <title>SACRA-2D: New axisymmetric general relativistic hydrodynamics code with fixed mesh refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present \texttt{SACRA-2D}, a new MPI and OpenMP parallelized, fully relativistic hydrodynamics (GRHD) code in dynamical spacetime under axial symmetry with the cartoon method using the finite-volume shock-capturing schemes for hydrodynamics. Specifically, we implemented the state-of-the-art HLLC Riemann solver and found better accuracy than the standard Total Variation Diminishing Lax-Friedrich Riemann solver. The spacetime evolves under the Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura formalism with Z4c constraint propagation. We demonstrate the accuracy of the code with some benchmark tests and excellent agreement with other codes in the literature. A wide variety of test simulations, including the head-on collision of black holes, the migration and collapse of neutron stars, and the collapse of a rotating supermassive star to a massive black hole and a disk, is also performed to show the robustness of our new code.</description>

      <title>Spatial and Spectral Characterization of the Gravitational-wave Background with the PTA Optimal Statistic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have made tremendous progress and are now showing strong evidence for the gravitational-wave background (GWB). Further probing the origin and characteristics of the GWB will require more generalized analysis techniques. Bayesian methods are most often used but can be computationally expensive. On the other hand, frequentist methods, like the PTA Optimal Statistic (OS), are more computationally efficient and can produce results that are complementary to Bayesian methods, allowing for stronger statistical cases to be built from a confluence of different approaches. In this work we expand the capabilities of the OS through a technique we call the Per-Frequency Optimal Statistic (PFOS). The PFOS removes the underlying power-law assumption inherent in previous implementations of the OS, and allows one to estimate the GWB spectrum in a frequency-by-frequency manner. We have also adapted a recent generalization from the OS pipeline into the PFOS, making it capable of accurately characterizing the spectrum in the intermediate and strong GW signal regimes using only a small fraction of the necessary computational resources when compared with fully-correlated Bayesian methods, while also empowering many new types of analyses not possible before. We find that even in the strong GW signal regime, where the GWB dominates over noise in all frequencies, the injected value of the signal lies within the 50th-percentile of the PFOS uncertainty distribution in 41-45% of simulations, remaining 3$\sigma$-consistent with unbiased estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present MauveSim, the instrument simulator software for Mauve, the latest mission from Blue Skies Space dedicated to time-domain stellar astronomy. The tool is designed to generate simulated stellar spectra, enabling the assessment of various scientific objectives, as well as determining limiting magnitudes and conducting signal-to-noise (S/N) analyses. MauveSim functions as an end-to-end simulator that takes an input stellar spectrum-either observed or synthetic-and produces a simulated observation based on the instrument's performance and characteristics. The results of MauveSim have been validated against instrument performance data from extensive ground testing campaigns, ensuring that the software reflects the most up-to-date understanding of the payload performance. Accessible to all scientists involved in the mission, MauveSim serves as a crucial tool for target selection and observation planning.</description>

      <title>A Poisson Process AutoDecoder for X-ray Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray observing facilities, such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the eROSITA, have detected millions of astronomical sources associated with high-energy phenomena. The arrival of photons as a function of time follows a Poisson process and can vary by orders-of-magnitude, presenting obstacles for common tasks such as source classification, physical property derivation, and anomaly detection. Previous work has either failed to directly capture the Poisson nature of the data or only focuses on Poisson rate function reconstruction. In this work, we present Poisson Process AutoDecoder (PPAD). PPAD is a neural field decoder that maps fixed-length latent features to continuous Poisson rate functions across energy band and time via unsupervised learning. PPAD reconstructs the rate function and yields a representation at the same time. We demonstrate the efficacy of PPAD via reconstruction, regression, classification and anomaly detection experiments using the Chandra Source Catalog.</description>

Abstract: Infrared spectroscopy has been developed significantly. In particular, infrared photons can be measured with high spectral and angular resolution in state-of-art spectrographs. They are sensitive to monochromatic photons due to the decay and annihilation of particles beyond the Standard Model, such as dark matter (DM), while insensitive to background photons that form a continuous spectrum. In this paper, we study the indirect detection of the DM decaying into infrared light using infrared spectrographs. In particular, we show that serious thermal and astrophysical noises can be overcome. As concrete examples, the Warm INfrared Echelle spectrograph to Realize Extreme Dispersion and sensitivity (WINERED) installed at the Magellan Clay 6.5m telescope and Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) at the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are discussed. We show that a few hours of measurements of a faint dwarf spheroidal galaxy with WINERED (NIRSpec-like spectrograph) in the Magellan telescope (JWST) can probe an axion-like particle DM in the mass range $m_\phi=1.8 - 2.7\,$eV ($0.5-4\,$eV) with a photon coupling $g_{\phi\gamma\gamma}\gtrsim 10^{-11}{\rm GeV}^{-1}$. Complemental approaches, taking advantage of the high resolutions, such as the measurement of the Doppler shift of the signal photon lines and the possible search of the DM decay around the Milky Way galaxy center with Infrared Camera and Spectrograph (IRCS) at 8.2m Subaru telescope, are also presented.</description>

      <title>Use the 4S (Signal-Safe Speckle Subtraction): Explainable Machine Learning reveals the Giant Exoplanet AF Lep b in High-Contrast Imaging Data from 2011</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main challenge of exoplanet high-contrast imaging (HCI) is to separate the signal of exoplanets from their host stars, which are many orders of magnitude brighter. HCI for ground-based observations is further exacerbated by speckle noise originating from perturbations in Earth's atmosphere and imperfections in the telescope optics. Various data post-processing techniques are used to remove this speckle noise and reveal the faint planet signal. Often, however, a significant part of the planet signal is accidentally subtracted together with the noise. In the present work, we use explainable machine learning to investigate the reason for the loss of the planet signal for one of the most used post-processing methods: principal component analysis (PCA). We find that PCA learns the shape of the telescope point spread function for high numbers of PCA components. This representation of the noise captures not only the speckle noise but also the characteristic shape of the planet signal. Building on these insights, we develop a new post-processing method (4S) that constrains the noise model to minimize this signal loss. We apply our model to 11 archival HCI datasets from the VLT-NACO instrument in the L'-band and find that our model consistently outperforms PCA. The improvement is largest at close separations to the star ($\leq 4 \lambda /D$) providing up to 1.5 magnitudes deeper contrast. This enhancement enables us to detect the exoplanet AF Lep b in data from 2011, 11 years before its subsequent discovery. We present updated orbital parameters for this object.</description>

      <title>Ensemble noise properties of the European Pulsar Timing Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03661v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The null hypothesis in Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) analyses includes assumptions about ensemble properties of pulsar time-correlated noise. These properties are encoded in prior probabilities for the amplitude and the spectral index of the power-law power spectral density of temporal correlations of the noise. Because multiple realizations of time-correlated noise processes are found in pulsars, these ensemble noise properties could and should be modelled in the full-PTA observations by parameterising the respective prior distributions using the so-called hyperparameters. This approach is known as the hierarchical Bayesian inference. In this work, we introduce a new procedure for numerical marginalisation over hyperparameters. The procedure may be used in searches for nanohertz gravitational waves and other PTA analyses to resolve prior misspecification at negligible computational cost. Furthermore, we infer the distribution of amplitudes and spectral indices of the power spectral density of spin noise and dispersion measure variation noise based on the observation of 25 millisecond pulsars by the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA). Our results may be used for the simulation of realistic noise in PTAs.</description>

      <title>Significant increase in sensitive volume of a gravitational wave search upon including higher harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most gravitational wave searches to date have included only the quadrupole mode in their search templates. Here, we demonstrate that incorporating higher harmonics improves the search sensitive volume for detecting binary black hole mergers, challenging the conclusion of previous studies. Using the $\tt{IAS-HM}$ detection pipeline, and the simulated (injection) signals from the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) collaboration, we quantify the improvement in sensitivity due to the inclusion of higher harmonics. This improvement is significant for systems with higher mass ratios and larger total masses, with gains in sensitivity even exceeding $100\%$ at certain high masses. We also show that, due to using a marginalized detection statistic, the $\tt{IAS-HM}$ pipeline performs roughly as well as its quadrupole-mode-only counterpart even for equal mass-ratio mergers, and its sensitive volume is either better than or comparable to that of the individual LVK pipelines.</description>
