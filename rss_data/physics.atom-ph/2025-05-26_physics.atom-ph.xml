      <title>Self-induced transparency and optical transients in atomic vapors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid turn-on of a strong, resonant, continuous wave laser field may trigger the formation of a transient oscillation akin to a train of damped solitons, before the vapor-field system relaxes into a stationary state. We study this transient dynamic on theoretical models of a rubidium vapor. We also consider doubly resonant V-systems, for which the transients take the form of trains of damped simultons. We compute the propagating field(s) by solving the Maxwell-Bloch equations, taking homogeneous broadening, Doppler broadening and the full hyperfine structure of the atoms into account. We also compare the actual fields to the stationary dnoidal fields predicted by the Maxwell-Bloch equations in conditions of self-induced transparency. A similar dynamics is expected to occur in any atomic vapor at the turn-on of a strong resonant continuous wave field provided the turn-on is sufficiently fast compared to relaxation.</description>

      <title>Statistical Localization in a Rydberg Simulator of $U(1)$ Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provide a framework for describing dynamical systems ranging from nuclei to materials. LGTs that host concatenated conservation laws can exhibit Hilbert space fragmentation, where each subspace may be labeled by a conserved quantity with nonlocal operator support. It is expected that nonlocal conservation laws will not impede thermalization locally. However, this expectation has recently been challenged by the notion of statistical localization, wherein particular motifs of microscopic configurations may remain frozen in time due to strong Hilbert space fragmentation. Here, we report the first experimental signatures of statistically-localized behavior. We realize a novel constrained LGT model using a facilitated Rydberg atom array, where atoms mediate the dynamics of electric charge clusters whose nonlocal pattern of net charges remains invariant. By experimentally reconstructing observables sampled from a temporal ensemble, we probe the spatial distribution of each conserved quantity. We find that as a result of strong Hilbert space fragmentation, the expectation values of all conserved quantities remain locally distributed in typical quantum states, even though they are described by nonlocal string-like operators. Our work opens the door to high-energy explorations of cluster dynamics and low-energy studies of strong zero modes that persist in infinite-temperature topological systems.</description>

      <title>Precision magnetometry at cryogenic temperatures with gaseous 3He NMR probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on compact, gaseous 3He NMR probes for precision magnetometry of magnetic fields B &gt; 0.1 T in the temperature range from ambient temperatures down to 4 Kelvin. The gas is polarized at thermal equilibrium under pressures up to 100 bar to provide a high nuclear spin density. In order to achieve sensor readout rates of order (Hz), paramagnetic substances and/or silica gel with high specific surface area were added to reduce the otherwise long T1 relaxation time of pure 3He gas to reach thermal polarization equilibrium. Sensitivity limits, which cover the range from 10-11 &lt; dB/B &lt; 10-7, are accessible in a single-pulse NMR measurement and can be further improved through signal averaging in accumulated NMR scans.</description>

      <title>Erasure-cooling, control, and hyper-entanglement of motion in optical tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15580v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherently controlling the motion of single atoms in optical tweezers would enable new applications in quantum information science. To demonstrate this, we first prepare atoms in their motional ground state using a species-agnostic cooling mechanism that converts motional excitations into erasures -- errors with a known location. This cooling mechanism fundamentally outperforms idealized traditional sideband cooling, which we experimentally demonstrate. By coherently manipulating the resultant pure motional state, we perform mid-circuit readout and mid-circuit erasure detection via local shelving into motional superposition states. We finally entangle the motion of two atoms in separate tweezers and generate hyper-entanglement by preparing a simultaneous Bell state of motional and optical qubits, unlocking a large new class of quantum operations with neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>In vacuum metasurface for optical microtrap array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays of laser-cooled and individual controlled particles have revolutionized the atomic, molecular and optical physics, and they afford exquisite capabilities for applications in quantum simulation of many-body physics, quantum computation and quantum sensing. Underlying this development is the technical maturity of generating scalable optical beams, enabled by active components and high numerical aperture objective. However, such a complex combination of bulk optics outside the vacuum chamber is very sensitive to any vibration and drift. Here we demonstrate the generation of 3*3 static tweezer array with a single chip-scale multifunctional metasurface element in vacuum, replacing the meter-long free space optics. Fluorescence counts on the camera validates the successfully trapping of the atomic ensemble array. Further, we discuss the strategy to achieve low scattering and crosstalk, where a metasurface design featuring dual-wavelength independent control is included. Our results, together with other recent development in integrated photonics for cold atoms, could pave the way for compact and portable quantum sensors and simulators in platforms of neutral atom arrays.</description>
