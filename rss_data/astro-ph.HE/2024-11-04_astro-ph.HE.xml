      <title>Pythia 8 and Air Shower Simulations: A Tuning Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory has revealed a significant challenge in air shower physics: a discrepancy between the simulated and observed muon content in cosmic-ray interactions, known as the 'Muon Puzzle'. This issue stems from a lack of understanding of high-energy hadronic interactions. Current state-of-the-art hadronic interaction models fall short, underscoring the need for improvements. In this contribution, we explore the integration of the Pythia 8 hadronic interaction model into air shower simulations. While Pythia 8 is primarily used in Large Hadron Collider experiments, recent advancements in its Angantyr module show promise in better describing hadron-nucleus interactions, making it a valuable tool for addressing the Muon Puzzle.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the effects of pulse shape changes on pulsar timing precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements of pulses from pulsars are conventionally made by a template matching algorithm that compares a profile constructed by averaging a finite number of pulses to a long-term average pulse shape. However, the shapes of pulses can and do vary, leading to errors in TOA estimation. All pulsars show stochastic variations in shape, amplitude, and phase between successive pulses that only partially average out in averages of finitely many pulses. This jitter phenomenon will only become more problematic for timing precision as more sensitive telescopes are built. We describe techniques for characterizing jitter (and other shape variations) and demonstrate them with data from the Vela pulsar, PSR B0833$-$45. These include partial sum analyses; auto-and cross correlations between templates and profiles and between multifrequency arrival times; and principal component analysis. We then quantify how pulse shape changes affect TOA estimates using both analytical and simulation methods on pulse shapes of varying complexity (multiple components). These methods can provide the means for improving arrival time precision for many applications, including gravitational wave astronomy using pulsar timing arrays.</description>

      <title>Alive and Strongly Kicking: Stable X-ray Quasi-Periodic Eruptions from eRO-QPE2 over 3.5 Years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are recurring bursts of soft X-rays from the nuclei of galaxies. Their physical origin is currently a subject of debate, with models typically invoking an orbiter around a massive black hole or disk instabilities. Here we present and analyze the temporal and spectral evolution of the QPE source eRO-QPE2 over 3.5 years. We find that eRO-QPE2 1) is remarkably stable over the entire 3.5-year temporal baseline in its eruption peak luminosity, eruption temperature, quiescent temperature, and quiescent luminosity, 2) has a stable mean eruption recurrence time of 2.35 hours, with marginal ($\sim$2$\sigma$) evidence for a $0.1$ hour reduction over the 3.5 yr period, and 3) has a long-short variation in its recurrence time in August 2020, but this pattern is absent from all subsequent observations. The stability of its peak eruption luminosity and that of the quiescent state are notably dissimilar from three previously tracked QPEs (GSN069, eRO-QPE1, eRO-QPE3), which show declines in eruption and quiescent flux over comparable temporal baselines. This stability is even more pronounced in eRO-QPE2 due to its 2.4 hour average recurrence time compared to GSN-069's 9 hour, eRO-QPE1's 16 hour, and eRO-QPE3's 20 hour recurrence times, i.e., this system has undergone 4-8 times more cycles than these other systems over the 3.5 years of observations. We discuss the implications of these observations within the context of some proposed extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) models.</description>

      <title>Steady-State Solutions for a Geometrically Thin Accretion Disk with Magnetically-Driven Winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present steady-state solutions for a one-dimensional, magnetically-driven accretion disk wind model based on magnetohydrodynamic equations. We assume a geometrically thin, gas-pressure-dominated accretion disk, incorporating both magnetic braking and turbulent viscosity introduced by an extended alpha-viscosity prescription. Additionally, the vertical stress parameter is assumed to scale with the disk aspect ratio. We confirm that the derived solutions result in standard disk solutions when the wind is absent. We find that the mass accretion rate decreases as the disk mass falls inward, while the mass loss rate increases with radius. The disk spectrum emitted from the magnetically-driven disk wind can be observed without interference from the wind medium because the wind is significantly optically thin. The spectral luminosity is proportional to $\nu^{1/3}$ in the intermediate, multicolor-blackbody wavebands, in the absence of wind, as predicted by standard disk theory. However, in the presence of wind, it follows a different power-law dependence on frequency over the same range. A deviation from the spectral slope of $1/3$, particularly a negative spectral slope, is a clear indicator of the presence of a magnetically driven wind. We also discuss an observational strategy to test our model with multi-wavelength observations.</description>

      <title>X-ray and Radio Campaign of the Z-source GX 340+0 II: the X-ray polarization in the normal branch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first X-ray polarization measurement of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary and Z-source, GX 340$+$0, in the normal branch (NB) using a 200 ks observation with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetric Explorer (IXPE). This observation was performed in 2024 August. Along with IXPE, we also conducted simultaneous observations with NICER, AstroSat, Insight-HXMT, ATCA, and GMRT to investigate the broadband spectral and timing properties in the X-ray and radio wavelengths. During the campaign, the source traced a complete Z-track during the IXPE observation but spent most of the time in the NB. We measure X-ray polarization degree (PD) of $1.22\pm0.25\%$ in the 2-8 keV energy band with a polarization angle (PA) of $38\pm6^\circ$. The PD in the NB is observed to be weaker than in the horizontal branch (HB) but aligned in the same direction. The PD of the source exhibits a marginal increase with energy while the PA shows no energy dependence. The joint spectro-polarimetric modeling is consistent with the observed X-ray polarization originating from a single spectral component from the blackbody, the Comptonized emission, or reflection feature, while the disk emission does not contribute towards the X-ray polarization. GMRT observations at 1.26 GHz during HB had a tentative detection at 4.5$\pm$0.7 mJy while ATCA observations a day later during the NB detected the source at 0.70$\pm$0.05 mJy and 0.59$\pm$0.05 mJy in the 5.5 &amp; 9 GHz bands, respectively, suggesting an evolving jet structure depending on the Z-track position.</description>

      <title>Modelling Cosmic Rays Flux with Pierre Auger and Telescope Array Data in $\boldsymbol{f(R)}$ and $\boldsymbol{f(Q)}$ Theories of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of the magnetic field and the redshift on the propagation of galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays (CRs) in a modified theory of gravity (MTG) and an alternative theory of gravity (ATG) framework. For this purpose, we consider the $f(R)$ gravity and the $f(Q)$ gravity theories. We utilise these two MTG and ATG to compute the density enhancement factor of CRs as a function of the magnetic field and the redshift. For this work, we take the magnetic field strength from $1-100$ nG, while $0-2.5$ for the redshift. For each of these parameters, we take $100$ bins within their considered range for the computation. The enhancement parameter for the mixed composition of heavy nuclei up to Fe is also taken into account for this work. Further, we compute the $E^3$ magnified diffusive flux for $150$ sources separated by a distance $d_\text{s}$ for the different cosmological models. For the fitting with observational data from the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) and Telescope Array (TA), we parameterized some set that consists of the redshift $z$, the separation distances $d_\text{s}$ between the $150$ sources, and the maximum cutoff energy $E_{\text{max}}$. For each case, a residue plot and $\chi^2$ value are also added to check the goodness of fitting. A comparative analysis of considered models has been performed in each of the cases along with the $\Lambda$CDM model. The considered MTG and ATG models produce notable and fascinating outcomes, with the $f(Q)$ model showing the highest CR density enhancement and the lowest reduced chi-squared value when fitted to PAO and TA data of UHECRs flux. This research provides new perspectives on the connections between high-energy physics, astrophysics, and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Investigating Polarization characteristics of GRB200503A and GRB201009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results of a comprehensive analysis of the polarization characteristics of GRB 200503A and GRB 201009A observed with the Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager (CZTI) on board AstroSat. Despite these GRBs being reasonably bright, they were missed by several spacecraft and had thus far not been localized well, hindering polarization analysis. We present positions of these bursts obtained from the Inter-Planetary Network (IPN) and the newly developed CZTI localization pipeline. We then undertook polarization analyses using the standard CZTI pipeline. We cannot constrain the polarization properties for GRB 200503A, but find that GRB 201009A has a high degree of polarization.</description>

      <title>On the Formation of the Double Neutron Star Binary PSR J1846-0513</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The double neutron star PSR J1846-0513 is discovered by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) in Commensal Radio Astronomy FAST Survey. The pulsar is revealed to be harbored in an eccentric orbit with $e=0.208$ and orbital period of 0.613 days. The total mass of the system is constrained to be $2.6287(35)\rm{M}_{\odot}$, with a mass upper limit of $1.3455{\rm~M}_{\odot}$ for the pulsar and a mass lower limit of $1.2845{\rm~M}_{\odot}$ for the companion star. To reproduce its evolution history, we perform a 1D model for the formation of PSR J1846-0513 whose progenitor is assumed to be neutron star - helium (He) star system via MESA code. Since the large eccentricity is widely believed to originate from an asymmetric supernova explosion, we also investigate the dynamical effects of the supernova explosion. Our simulated results show that the progenitor of PSR J1846-0513 could be a binary system consisting of a He star of $3.3-4.0{\rm~M}_\odot$ and a neutron star in a circular orbit with an initial period of $\sim0.5$ days.</description>

      <title>Probing Broadband Spectral Energy Distribution and Variability of Mrk\,501 in the low flux state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted a multi-wavelength analysis of the blazar Mrk\,501, utilizing observations from \emph{Astro}Sat (SXT, LAXPC), \emph{Swift-UVOT}, and \emph{Fermi-LAT} during the period August 15, 2016 to March 27, 2022. The resulting multi-wavelength light curve revealed relatively low activity of the source across the electromagnetic spectrum. Notably, logparabola and broken power-law models provided a better fit to the joint X-ray spectra from \emph{Astro}Sat-SXT/LAXPC instruments compared to the power-law model. During the low activity state, the source showed the characteristic harder when brighter trend at the X-ray energies. To gain insights into underlying physical processes responsible for the broadband emission, we performed a detailed broadband spectral analysis using the convolved one-zone leptonic model with different forms of particle distributions such as logparabola (LP), broken power-law (BPL), power-law model with maximum energy ($\xi_{max}$), and energy-dependent acceleration (EDA) models. Our analysis revealed similar reduced-$\chi^2$ values for the four particle distributions. The LP and EDA models exhibited the lowest jet powers. The correlation analyses conducted for the LP and BPL models revealed that there is a positive correlation between jet power and bulk Lorentz factor. Specifically, in the LP model, jet power proved independent of $\gamma_{min}$, whereas in the broken power-law model, jet power decreased with an increase in $\gamma_{min}$. The jet power in the LP/EDA particle distribution is nearly 10 percent of the Eddington luminosity of a $10^7$ M$_\odot$ black hole. This result suggests that the jet could potentially be fueled by accretion processes.</description>

      <title>The XRISM/Resolve view of the Fe K region of Cyg X-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The X-ray binary system Cygnus X-3 (4U 2030+40, V1521 Cyg) is luminous but enigmatic owing to the high intervening absorption. High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy uniquely probes the dynamics of the photoionized gas in the system. In this paper we report on an observation of Cyg X-3 with the XRISM/Resolve spectrometer which provides unprecedented spectral resolution and sensitivity in the 2-10 keV band. We detect multiple kinematic and ionization components in absorption and emission, whose superposition leads to complex line profiles, including strong P-Cygni profiles on resonance lines. The prominent Fe XXV He$\alpha$ and Fe XXVI Ly$\alpha$ emission complexes are clearly resolved into their characteristic fine structure transitions. Self-consistent photoionization modeling allows us to disentangle the absorption and emission components and measure the Doppler velocity of these components as a function of binary orbital phase. We find a significantly higher velocity amplitude for the emission lines than for the absorption lines. The absorption lines generally appear blueshifted by ${\sim}-500$-$600$km s$^{-1}$. We show that the wind decomposes naturally into a relatively smooth and large scale component, perhaps originating with the background wind itself, plus a turbulent more dense structure located close to the compact object in its orbit.</description>

      <title>Probing magneto-ionic microstructure towards the Vela pulsar using a prototype SKA-Low station</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vela pulsar (J0835-4510) is known to exhibit variations in Faraday rotation and dispersion on multi-decade timescales due to the changing sightline through the surrounding Vela supernova remnant and the Gum Nebula. Until now, variations in Faraday rotation towards Vela have not been studied on timescales less than around a decade. We present the results of a high-cadence observing campaign carried out with the Aperture Array Verification System 2 (AAVS2), a prototype SKA-Low station, which received a significant bandwidth upgrade in 2022. We collected observations of the Vela pulsar and PSR J0630-2834 (a nearby pulsar located outside the Gum Nebula), spanning $\sim 1\,\mathrm{yr}$ and $\sim 0.3\,\mathrm{yr}$ respectively, and searched for linear trends in the rotation measure (RM) as a function of time. We do not detect any significant trends on this timescale ($\sim$months) for either pulsar, but the constraints could be greatly improved with more accurate ionospheric models. For the Vela pulsar, the combination of our data and historical data from the published literature have enabled us to model long-term correlated trends in RM and dispersion measure (DM) over the past two decades. We detect a change in DM of $\sim 0.3\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\,\mathrm{pc}$ which corresponds to a change in electron density of $\sim 10^5\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ on a transverse length scale of $\sim$1-2 au. The apparent magnetic field strength in the time-varying region changes from $240^{+30}_{-20}\,\mu\mathrm{G}$ to $-6.2^{+0.7}_{-0.9}\,\mu\mathrm{G}$ over the time span of the data set. As well as providing an important validation of polarimetry, this work highlights the pulsar monitoring capabilities of SKA-Low stations, and the niche science opportunities they offer for high-precision polarimetry and probing the microstructure of the magneto-ionic interstellar medium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A number of new balloon or space-based gamma-ray observatories have been proposed to close a "MeV gap" in sensitivity to gamma rays in the MeV-GeV energy band. One aspect of the science case for these instruments is their ability to constrain or discover decaying or annihilating dark matter. In this work, we forecast the sensitivity of these instruments for dark matter annihilation or decay for a range of possible Standard Model final states and compare to existing bounds.</description>

      <title>A New Class of Three Nucleon Forces and their Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a new class of three-nucleon forces that arises in the low-energy effective theory of nuclear interactions including pions. We estimate their contribution to the energy of neutron and nuclear matter and find that it can be as important as the leading-order three-nucleon forces previously considered in the literature. The magnitude of this force is set by the strength of the coupling of pions to two nucleons and is presently not well constrained by experiments. The implications for nuclei, nuclear matter, and the equation of state of neutron matter are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Orbital eccentricity in general relativity from catastrophe theory</title>

Abstract: While the orbital eccentricity is a key feature of the gravitational two-body problem, providing an unambiguous definition in General Relativity poses significant challenges. Despite such foundational issue, the eccentricity of binary black holes has important implications in gravitational-wave astronomy. We present a novel approach to consistently define the orbital eccentricity in General Relativity, grounded in the mathematical field of catastrophe theory. Specifically, we identify the presence of catastrophes -- i.e., breakdowns of the stationary-phase approximation -- in numerical-relativity waveforms and exploit them to develop a robust and fully gauge-invariant estimator of the eccentricity. Our procedure does not require orbital fitting and naturally satisfies the Newtonian limit. We extract gauge-free eccentricity estimates from about 100 numerical-relativity simulations and find that the resulting values are systematically lower compared to those reported alongside the simulations themselves.</description>

      <title>The formation and stability of a cold disc made out of stellar winds in the Galactic Centre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reported discovery of a cold ($\sim$10$^4~\text{K}$) disc-like structure around the super-massive black hole at the centre of the Milk Way, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), has challenged our understanding of the gas dynamics and thermodynamic state of the plasma in its immediate vicinity. State-of-the-art simulations do not agree on whether or not such a disc can indeed be a product of the multiple stellar wind interactions of the mass-losing stars in the region. This study aims to constrain the conditions for the formation of a cold disc as a natural outcome of the system of the mass-losing stars orbiting around Sgr A*, to investigate if the disc is a transient or long-lasting structure, and to assess the validity of the model through direct comparisons with observations. We conduct a set of hydrodynamic simulations of the observed Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars feeding Sgr A* using the finite-volume adaptive mesh-refinement code Ramses. We focus, for the first time, on the impact of the chemical composition of the plasma emanating from the WR stars. The simulations show that the chemical composition of the plasma affects the radiative cooling enough to impact the properties of the medium such as density and temperature and, as a consequence, the rate at which the material inflows onto Sgr A*. We demonstrated that the formation of a cold disc from the stellar winds is possible for certain chemical compositions that are consistent with the current observational constraints. However, even in such a case, it is not possible to reproduce the reported properties of the observed disc-like structure, namely its inclination and hydrogen recombination line fluxes. We conclude that the stellar winds on their own cannot form the cold disc around Sgr A* inferred from the observations. Either relevant ingredients are still missing in the model, or the interpretation of the observed data needs to be revised.</description>

      <title>Ultraluminous X-ray sources with He star companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are non-nuclear point-like objects observed with extremely high X-ray luminosity that exceeds the Eddington limit of a $\rm10\,M_\odot$ black hole. A fraction of ULXs has been confirmed to contain neutron star (NS) accretors due to the discovery of their X-ray pulsations. The donors detected in NS ULXs are usually luminous massive stars because of the observational biases. Recently, the He donor star in NGC 247 ULX-1 has been identified, which is the first evidence of a He donor star in ULXs. In this paper, we employed the stellar evolution code MESA to investigate the formation of ULXs through the NS+He star channel, in which a He star transfers its He-rich material onto the surface of a NS via Roche-lobe overflow. We evolved a large number of NS+He star systems and provided the parameter space for the production of ULXs. We found that the initial NS+He star systems should have $\rm\sim 0.7-2.6 \, M_\odot$ He star and $\rm \sim 0.1-2500\, d$ orbital period for producing ULXs, eventually evolving into intermediate-mass binary pulsars. According to binary population synthesis calculations, we estimated that the Galactic rate of NS ULXs with He donor stars is in the range of $\sim1.6-4.0\times10^{-4}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, and that there exist $\sim7-20$ detectable NS ULXs with He donor stars in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Heavy element abundances from a universal primordial distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a freeze-out approach to the formation of heavy elements in expanding nuclear matter. Applying concepts used in the description of heavy-ion collisions or ternary fission, we determine the abundances of heavy elements taking into account in-medium effects such as Pauli blocking and the Mott effect, which describes the dissolution of nuclei at high densities of nuclear matter. With this approach, we search for a universal primordial distribution in an equilibrium state from which the gross structure of the solar abundances of heavy elements freezes out via radioactive decay of the excited states. The universal primordial state is characterized by the Lagrangian parameters of temperature and chemical potentials of neutrons and protons. We show that such a state exists and determine a temperature of 5.266 MeV, a neutron chemical potential of 940.317 MeV and a proton chemical potential of 845.069 MeV, at a baryon number density of 0.013 fm$^{-3}$ and a proton fraction of 0.13. Heavy neutron-rich nuclei such as the hypothesized double-magic nucleus $^{358}$Sn appear in the primordial distribution and contribute to the observed abundances after fission. We discuss astrophysical scenarios for the realization of this universal primordial distribution for heavy element nucleosynthesis, including supernova explosions, neutron star mergers and the inhomogeneous Big Bang. The latter scenario may be of interest in the light of early massive objects observed with the James Webb Space Telescope and opens new perspectives to explain universality of the observed r-process patterns and the lack of observations of population III stars.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Tidal Disruption Event Disks with Magnetically Driven Winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a time-dependent, one-dimensional, magnetically-driven disk wind model based on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, in the context of tidal disruption events (TDEs). We assume that the disk is geometrically thin and gas-pressure dominated, and explicitly accounts for magnetic braking and turbulent viscosity through an extended alpha-viscosity prescription. We find a particular wind solution for a set of basic equations that satisfies the necessary and sufficient conditions for vertically unbound MHD flows. The solution shows that the disk evolves with mass loss due to wind and accretion from the initial Gaussian density distribution. We confirm that the mass accretion rate follows the power law of time $t^{-19/16}$ at late times in the absence of wind, which matches the classical solution of Cannizzo et al. (1990). We find that the mass accretion rate is steeper than the $t^{-19/16}$ curve when the wind is present. Mass accretion is also induced by magnetic braking, known as the wind-driven accretion mechanism, which results in a faster decay with time of both the mass accretion and loss rates. In the disk emission, the ultraviolet (UV) luminosity is the highest among the optical, UV, and X-ray luminosities. While the optical and X-ray emission is observationally insignificant without magnetic braking, the X-ray emission is brighter at late times, especially in the presence of magnetic braking. This provides a possible explanation for observed delayed X-ray flares. Our model predicts that late-time bolometric light curves steeper than $t^{-19/16}$ in UV-bright TDEs are potentially compelling indicators of magnetically driven winds.</description>

      <title>On the Contribution of Unresolved Pulsars to the Ultra-high-energy Galactic Diffuse Gamma-Ray Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ultra high-energy (UHE) Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission holds important information on the propagation of cosmic rays in the Galaxy. However, its measurements suffer from a contamination from unresolved sources whose contribution remains unclear. In this Letter, we propose a novel data-driven estimate of the contribution of unresolved pulsar wind nebulae and TeV halos based on the information present in the ATNF and the LHAASO catalogs. We find that in the inner Galaxy, this contribution is limited to $\sim38\%\pm10\%$ of the diffuse flux measured by LHAASO at $\sim20\,\rm{TeV}$ in the case where all sources associated to pulsars contribute as unresolved sources, and this fraction drops with energy to less than $21\%\pm6\%$ above $100\,\rm{TeV}$. In the outer Galaxy, this contribution is always subdominant. In particular, it reaches at most $\sim18\%\pm2\%$ at $10\,\rm{TeV}$ and is less than $\sim7\%\pm1\%$ above $\sim25\,\rm{TeV}$. We conclude that the UHE Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission cannot be dominated by unresolved pulsar sources above a few tens of $\rm{TeV}$.</description>

      <title>North Polar Spur: gaseous plume(s) from star-forming regions at $\sim$3-5 kpc from Galactic Center?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that the North Polar Spur (NPS) and many less prominent structures are formed by gaseous metal-rich plumes associated with star-forming regions (SFRs). The SFRs located at the tangent to the 3-5~kpc rings might be particularly relevant to NPS. A multi-temperature mixture of gaseous components and cosmic rays rises above the Galactic disk under the action of their initial momentum and buoyancy. Eventually, the plume velocity becomes equal to that of the ambient gas, which rotates with different angular speed than the stars in the disk. As a result, the plumes acquire characteristic bent shapes. An ad hoc model of plumes' trajectories shows an interesting resemblance to the morphology of structures seen in the radio continuum and X-rays.</description>

      <title>511 keV Galactic Photons from a Dark Matter Spike</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that a dark matter (DM) spike around the Galactic Center's (GC) supermassive black hole, Sgr A*, could account for most of the bulge's measured 511 keV line intensity while remaining cosmologically compatible. DM annihilation can be the primary source of the 511 keV line emission without violating constraints from disk emission observations and in-flight positron annihilation with the interstellar medium, provided the disk emission is dominated by an astrophysical source of low-energy positrons. We find that a DM mass up to approximately 20 MeV, either with a Gondolo-Silk spike or one softened by stellar heating, could explain the observed 511 keV bulge emission profile. Our proposal can be tested by future observations of the continuum diffuse emission close to the GC.</description>

      <title>Fast Transients from Magnetic Disks Around Non-Spinning Collapsar Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most black holes (BHs) formed in collapsing stars have low spin, though some are expected to acquire a magnetic accretion disk during the collapse. While such BH disks can launch magnetically driven winds, their physics and observational signatures have remained unexplored. We present global 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of collapsing stars that form slowly spinning BHs with accretion disks. As the disk transitions to a magnetically arrested state, it drives mildly relativistic, wobbling, collimated magnetic outflows through two mechanisms: steady outflows along vertical magnetic field lines (''Blandford-Payne jets'') and magnetic flux eruptions. With an isotropic-equivalent energy of $E_{\rm iso}\approx10^{52}\,{\rm erg}$, exceeding that of relativistic jets from BHs with spin $a\lesssim 0.25$, the disk outflows unbind the star, ultimately capping the final BH mass at $ M_{\rm BH} \approx 4\,M_\odot$. Once the outflows emerge from the star, they produce mildly relativistic shock breakout, cooling, and $^{56}{\rm Ni}$-decay emission. Our cooling emission estimates suggest a bright near-ultraviolet and optical signal at absolute magnitude $M_{\rm AB}\approx-16$ lasting for several days. This indicates that disk winds could be responsible for the first peak in the double-peaked light curves observed in Type Ib/c supernovae (SNe) or power another class of transients. The detection rate in the upcoming Rubin Observatory and ULTRASAT/UVEX will enable us to differentiate between competing models for the origin of the first SN peak and provide constraints on the physics and formation rate of accretion disks in core-collapse SNe.</description>

      <title>A Fast Radio Burst monitor with a Compact All-Sky Phased Array (CASPA)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are short-duration radio transients that occur at random times in host galaxies distributed all over the sky. Large field of view instruments can play a critical role in the blind search for rare FRBs. We present a concept for an all-sky FRB monitor using a compact all-sky phased array (CASPA), which can efficiently achieve an extremely large field of view of $\sim10^4$ square degrees. Such a system would allow us to conduct a continuous, blind FRB search covering the entire southern sky. Using the measured FRB luminosity function, we investigate the detection rate for this all-sky phased array and compare the result to a number of other proposed large field-of-view instruments. We predict a rate of a few FRB detections per week and determine the dispersion measure and redshift distributions of these detectable FRBs. This instrument is optimal for detecting FRBs in the nearby Universe and for extending the high-end of the FRB luminosity function through finding ultraluminous events. Additionally, this instrument can be used to shadow the new gravitational-wave observing runs, detect high energy events triggered from Galactic magnetars and search for other bright, but currently unknown transient signals.</description>

      <title>The 10 pc Neighborhood of Habitable Zone Exoplanetary Systems: Threat Assessment from Stellar Encounters &amp; Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The habitability of a planet is influenced by both its parent star and the properties of its local stellar neighborhood. Potential threats to habitability from the local stellar environment mainly arise from two factors: cataclysmic events such as powerful stellar explosions and orbital perturbations induced by close stellar encounters. Among the 4,500+ exoplanet-hosting stars, about 140+ are known to host planets in their habitable zones. In this study, we use \textit{Gaia DR3} data to investigate the 10~pc stellar neighborhood of the 84 habitable zone systems (HZS) closest to the Sun. We assess the possible risks that local stellar environment of these HZS pose to their habitability. In particular, we find that HD~165155 has a high stellar density around it, making it likely to experience at least one flyby encounter within a span of 5~Gyr. We also identified two high-mass stars ($M \geq 8 M_\odot$) as potential progenitors of supernovae, which could threaten the long-term survivability of habitable zone systems HD~48265 and TOI-1227. Further, to quantify the similarity between habitable zone stars and the Sun, as well as their respective 10~pc stellar environments, we employ various astrophysical parameters to define a Solar Similarity Index (SSI) and a Neighborhood Similarity Index (NSI). Our analysis suggests that HD~40307 exhibits the closest resemblance to the solar system, while HD~165155 shows the least resemblance.</description>
